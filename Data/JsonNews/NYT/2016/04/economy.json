{"Headline": "Banharn Silpa-archa, Former Prime Minister of Thailand, Dies at 83", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 Banharn Silpa-archa, a former prime minister of Thailand whose scandal-ridden tenure preceded the country\u2019s economic collapse in the 1990s, died here on Saturday. He was 83.His death was announced by Siriraj Hospital, where he had been admitted after an asthma attack.Mr. Banharn, a regional power broker and a master of money politics, enriched his home province, Suphanburi, as a political patron. But his 16-month tenure as prime minister, in 1995 and 1996, was marked by allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement.Thailand\u2019s bubble economy of reckless and unchecked lending grew on his watch and burst one year later, touching off the Asian financial crisis.Throughout, Mr. Banharn remained a quintessential provincial overlord. He was elected 11 times to Parliament and gained the nickname Banharnburi for his home province.He was a familiar presence in national politics, serving as a minister in various governments over the years, and became known as \u201cMr. A.T.M.\u201d for his methods of winning support and securing allies.In the pragmatic, nonideological politics that was once common in Thailand, he was also known as \u201cthe eel\u201d for his ability to wriggle his party into coalitions, including the tenuous grouping of small parties that briefly kept him in power as prime minister.Mr. Banharn\u2019s style of small-party coalitions has since been eclipsed by the ideological, nationally based politics introduced in the 2000s by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, which has split the country along deep economic and social fault lines.Banharn Silpa-archa was born on Aug. 19, 1932, in Suphanburi, to a family of Chinese traders. He made a fortune in trade and construction, riding an infrastructure boom in the 1960s that was partly fueled by American investment during the Vietnam War.He became active in politics in 1974 when he joined the Chart Thai party. He was elected to Parliament for the first time in 1976 and re-elected repeatedly by huge margins, as he used his power to help make Suphanburi one of Thailand\u2019s most prosperous provinces.After stepping down as prime minister in the face of corruption scandals, Mr. Banharn did not serve as a minister again, but he remained politically active. In 2008, two years after a coup ousted Mr. Thaksin, he formed a coalition with the People Power Party, a successor to Mr. Thaksin\u2019s Thai Rak Thai party.When the Constitutional Court dissolved the governing party later that year, Mr. Banharn was barred from politics, along with other party leaders, for five years.In the years since then, he remained a marginal, though colorful, player on the political stage. He was not a major factor in the demonstrations and violence that roiled the country in the last years of his life.His children are active in his Chart Thai Pattana party. But the party has been so entwined with his personality and leadership that its future is uncertain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Prince Shares Plan to Cut Oil Dependency and Energize the Economy", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The ambitious young prince who oversees the economy of Saudi Arabia rolled out a grand vision for the future of the kingdom on Monday that aspires to reduce its dependence on oil, stimulate the private sector and reduce government subsidies \u2014 all while ensuring rising living standards for Saudi citizens.Prince Mohammed, who is about 30, has been given a broad array of positions since his father, King Salman, ascended to the Saudi throne last year and has not hesitated to wield his influence. As defense minister, the prince has overseen a costly war in Yemen and Saudi efforts to push back Iranian influence in Syria and elsewhere. He is also second in line to the throne, and leads a powerful council that oversees the economy.Saudi officialdom has been abuzz for months about a comprehensive National Transformation Plan, though its release has been repeatedly delayed. Monday\u2019s announcement of the \u201cSaudi Vision 2030\u201d was billed as an aspirational guide, with details to be filled in later.In an extensive prerecorded interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television broadcast in conjunction with the plan\u2019s release, Prince Mohammed painted an optimistic picture of the kingdom\u2019s future, one in which declining oil revenues would be replaced by the returns from enormous government investments and a robust private sector.\u201cWe have developed an oil addiction in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, among everyone,\u201d Prince Mohammed said. \u201cThat is dangerous, and that is what has hampered the development of many different sectors in recent years.\u201dHe described steps the government would take to reduce that dependence, like selling shares of the state oil giant, Saudi Aramco, injecting money into a public investment fund and privatizing sectors of the economy, such as airports, education and health care.\u201cI think that by 2020, if the oil stops, we\u2019ll be able to live,\u201d Prince Mohammed said.Many energy-reliant states have issued such proclamations in the past, particularly when prices were plunging, but carrying out the programs has always proved problematic at best. Saudi officials themselves, foreign analysts and economists were quick to note, have been speaking for decades about reducing the kingdom\u2019s reliance on oil, and similar grand plans for economic transformation have been announced but not carried out.\u201cBroadly, the direction is right, but there are a lot of question marks about implementation and the size of what they are promising,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor of comparative politics at the London School of Economics who studies Saudi Arabia.Privatizing large sectors like health care and education would require lots of government oversight and regulation that may be too much for the kingdom\u2019s bloated and often ineffective bureaucracy to handle, Mr. Hertog said.And it remains unlikely that the measures Prince Mohammed has announced will raise enough revenue to replace what the government gets from oil, Mr. Hertog said.\u201cThey have to try, but I think that by 2020 they won\u2019t be able to do enough,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if they succeed in the long run, it will be a long and painful process.\u201dJohn Sfakianakis, the Riyadh-based director of economics research at the Gulf Research Center, said the government faced a delicate balancing act of finding non-oil income without inhibiting the growth that the economy needs.The new fees and taxes the government has announced on undeveloped land, soft drinks and luxury items would bring in some revenue. And while lifting subsidies on water and electricity makes sense, it could raise operating costs for businesses while the government is trying to encourage private investment.\u201cWe know the goal, to rid the economy of oil,\u201d Mr. Sfakianakis said. \u201cIf it can accomplish that, it would be among the few countries to do so in such a short period of time.\u201dThe vision was approved by the Saudi government on Monday, and King Salman gave a televised statement praising it. But the initiative was clearly led by Prince Mohammed, who has emerged as the kingdom\u2019s most dynamic official.Many Saudi citizens, and especially the 70 percent of the population that is under the age of 30, have celebrated the prince\u2019s rise and took to social media to thank him for laying out an optimistic vision.While the plan\u2019s focus was economic, it also addressed some social issues, such as calling for the development of historic and tourist sites, the issuance for the first time of green cards for expatriates, more athleticism among Saudi citizens and more women in the workplace. Despite rampant speculation on social media before its release, the plan did not call for Saudi women to be permitted to drive.Prince Mohammed\u2019s vision for the future was clear in his interview with Al Arabiya, where he described the kingdom as a global economic and cultural leader. He said that a proposed bridge between Saudi Arabia and Egypt could be \u201cthe most important land crossing in the world.\u201d He said Arab culture had produced the best \u201cvalues and principles\u201d of any world civilization, and he boasted that the Saudi sovereign wealth fund would be \u201can essential mover on planet Earth.\u201d\u201cThere will not be any investment or movement or growth in any region of the world without the voice of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund,\u201d he said.Through such interviews with foreign news media and other appearances, Prince Mohammed\u2019s public profile has surpassed that of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, who runs the Interior Ministry and has close links with American officials.While the nature of the relationship between the two men is known only to a tight circle within the royal family, it is clear that Prince Mohammed bin Salman derives his power from his father, who is 80 and has had health problems.But many Saudis and some foreign diplomats say privately that if King Salman dies soon, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef could remove the young prince and name his own successor. Ironically, the precedent for such a move was created by King Salman, who removed the crown prince named by his own predecessor, King Abdullah.Others have speculated that the young prince could seek to amass enough power to make himself indispensable while his father is still alive, or even try to have himself named as his father\u2019s successor.Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disposable Workers", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byLettersReaders discuss the culture and lack of job security in tech companies today.If the most critical issue this article is highlighting is how disposable employees are in the technology world, I think it would be wise to consider the macro trends in the economy, all of which point to a more distributed, happier work force of people who use their skills across dozens of companies in their working lives.CHRISTOPHER SCHRADERHong Kong The writer is chief executive of The Graduate, a company that connects students with experts using artificial intelligence.To the Editor: People who are willing to work \u201coff the clock,\u201d or work 60-plus-hour weeks at entry-level positions, or read work email and respond 24/7, even when \u201con vacation,\u201d are also a substantial part of the problem. They\u2019re feeding the very beast that\u2019s feasting on their flesh.It\u2019s been observed that companies have no social compact with employees anymore, so it is incumbent on individuals to set limits and stick to them. I did so and never once got fired for it. Even if I had been, who wants a job that robs you of any personal life? After hanging on to my first job, one that made me soul-sick, I was determined that I would never repeat that mistake again, and didn\u2019t. My career may have suffered some, but I gained immeasurably. I refuse to work for any entity that doesn\u2019t recognize that I am a human being who not only has a life outside of work, but also that I work in order to have that life. I don\u2019t live to work. No one should.BRIAN VOGELStaunton, Va.To the Editor: Nothing described in this article is in any way limited to the tech industry. I\u2019m rather amazed that Dan Lyons sounds so surprised \u2014 as if \u201cit\u2019s not supposed to happen here.\u201d Of course it does, and of course it will. It is old-fashioned contempt for workers, only now it\u2019s occurring in an exposed-brick setting with a latte machine off to the right. Perhaps some of the obvious arrogance feels new to Mr. Lyons, but it really isn\u2019t.Workers, of whatever caliber and educational level, have always been exploited by employers and management, and that\u2019s not going to change just because it\u2019s the next generation being all whizzy. I\u2019ve seen just about everything highlighted in this article on two continents (I\u2019m American-born but have lived and worked in the Netherlands for the last 11 years) \u2014 not just in tech-related companies, but in other for-profit environments, as well as in nonprofit and social service areas.In fact, the first time I heard a manager fling the word \u201cproductivity\u201d at her staff was in a mental health agency setting. She was angry that counselors weren\u2019t seeing enough patients per day, completely ignoring the fact that a lot of the patients, who were members of very stressed and troubled populations, weren\u2019t showing up. But of course, it was the staff\u2019s not \u201cproducing\u201d enough, not the context within which they worked, that was viewed as the problem. All of this should remind people why strong and powerful unions are necessary, and why union membership should be embraced by us all.CARL M. LEWISAmsterdamTo the Editor: I understand that being laid off can be confusing and frustrating. However, you quoted a line from a book that expresses it perfectly: \u201cYour company is not your family.\u201dTimes are changing. Companies see people as a resource, and their bottom line is profit. If you can\u2019t provide value for them, why should they keep you around? There is no such thing as job security today. It is time to adapt to this new work culture that many companies have adopted rather than reminisce about the \u201990s. An alternative to this insufferable environment is being your own boss, where freedom awaits you.JAMES LEISan Jose, Calif.To the Editor: Dan Lyons takes issue with the idiosyncrasies of start-up culture. Unfortunately, his essay fails to understand the millennial zeitgeist and what young people really want out of work and life. While he craves normalcy, stability and hierarchy, our generation seeks out adventure, progress and meaning. A start-up provides these things in abundance. Change is a constant, and no one knows whether the company will be around in six months. Despite the risk, this is an environment where we can truly feel alive.JEFF PAWLAKSan FranciscoThe writer is a growth marketer for GrubMarket, a start-up.To the Editor: One might ask why it is that executives were so focused on retaining technology talent in the \u201980s and \u201990s and are so indifferent to it now. It\u2019s because back then technology talent was harder to come by. You had to be a lot of things \u2014 an analyst, a business process architect, a programmer, a documentation writer, etc. There weren\u2019t that many who could do that, then or now. Every discipline now has its career path, so people are far more replaceable because they\u2019re far narrower in what they offer; also, a lot of the processes are being automated, so people are increasingly disposable.RICHARD LUETTGENRamsey, N.J.To the Editor: The toxic work environment we have today simply reflects our current American values. Employees were once a valued part of the organizations I worked for. Now they are disposable parts. Our children have been raised to value material gain at the cost of lifestyle and positive human experience, and we are paying the price in lower happiness and higher stress and related disease. This won\u2019t change until our culture changes.GREGORY A. BORRORBailey, Colo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Comes Up Short on Corporate Transparency", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 Journalists have done their job, again, with another enormous leak of documents outing a global list of rich and powerful people who hid their wealth in offshore companies.\u201cPopulist outrage doesn\u2019t by itself collect a single extra pound or dollar in tax or put a single criminal in jail,\u201d said George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, at a news conference on Thursday in Washington.This is good news for the global campaign to expose the ill-gotten gains of the corrupt and the secretly held wealth of tax evaders who benefit from a system that rewards anonymity.The Obama administration has recently taken steps to require banks to check the identities of clients setting up companies and to track the ownership of expensive real estate.Attention has focused on Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada, which aggressively market tax advantages for offshore companies. But in fact, full disclosure of ownership is not required in any of the 50 states.This has created an enormous black hole not only for tax inspectors but also for law enforcement officials who \u201ccan\u2019t follow the money,\u201d said Tom Cardamone, managing director of Global Financial Integrity, a research and advocacy group based in Washington. \u201cWhat we have in place is compete secrecy, and it is secrecy that is the problem,\u201d he said.A bipartisan bill to make the states require disclosure of ownership is now before Congress, but it has stalled.Opposition comes from the American Bar Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a less-known but powerful lobby, the National Association of Secretaries of State. That final group fears a loss of revenue for state budgets if more transparency is required, said Robert Palmer, campaign director at Global Witness, an anticorruption organization.\u201cPassing legislation in the U.S. is challenging,\u201d he said.Failure to respond to the worldwide clamor for financial accountability looks hypocritical from afar, considering the United States\u2019 aggressive extraterritorial pursuit of foreign companies that violate its Foreign Corrupt Practices law and its demands that foreign banks provide information about accounts held by American citizens.\u201cThough the U.S. has been a pioneer in defending itself from foreign secrecy jurisdictions it provides little information in return to other countries, making it a formidable, harmful and irresponsible secrecy jurisdiction,\u201d according to a Tax Justice Network report.Though legislation in the United States has faltered, other countries began moving ahead with the creation of registries of corporate beneficial owners even before the Panama Papers came to light. Such a registry will be available to the public in Britain on June 30, while national registries required by the European Union will be ready by 2017, although access to their information will be more restricted.Transparency advocates hope similar pressure will build in the United States to shine a light on what Mr. Osborne called \u201cthose hiding spaces, those dark corners of the global financial system\u201d right in its own backyard.As Mr. Palmer says, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have to rely on journalists.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dilma Rousseff\u2019s Impeachment Isn\u2019t a Coup, It\u2019s a Cover-Up", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 BRAZIL took a major step toward the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff on Sunday when the lower house of Congress voted to send her case to the Senate, which will almost certainly refer her for a trial. It now looks likely that the president will be removed from office and replaced by Michel Temer, her vice president. Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters are furious, her opponents are overjoyed, and Brazil\u2019s corrupt politicians are breathing a sigh of relief.In the hourslong televised session on Sunday, members of Congress explained their decisions as they voted for impeachment: They voted \u201cfor peace in Jerusalem,\u201d \u201cfor the truckers,\u201d \u201cfor the Free Masons of Brazil\u201d and \u201cbecause of the Communism that threatens this country.\u201d Very few members of congress based their votes on the charges that have actually been brought against the president: that she violated regulations regarding public finances.Those in the opposition claim that they want to send a message about good governance. But the real reason the president is being impeached is that the Brazilian political system is in ruins. Her impeachment will provide a convenient distraction while other politicians try to get their own houses in order.An enormous corruption investigation, known as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash, has exploded in the political system\u2019s face. At first, when the investigation began in 2014, investigators accused members of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s left-wing Workers Party of using Petrobras, the state-run oil company, to trade kickbacks for political favors. There is more and more evidence that this kind of practice was common among Brazilian political parties. The investigation has expanded to include a host of figures across the political spectrum, including roughly 50 politicians and a handful of business leaders.Unlike many Brazilian politicians, Ms. Rousseff isn\u2019t accused of taking bribes or trading cash for favors. But she is a weak and unpopular president. The economy has stagnated, thanks in large part to dropping global commodity prices and economic mismanagement during her first term. She has been forced to cut spending and implement painful austerity measures. In short, she is an easy target for the public\u2019s anger.Bringing down Ms. Rousseff \u2014 even on charges unrelated to the original corruption investigation \u2014 would be a nice season finale to Operation Car Wash: a catharsis of epic proportions. It would also provide corrupt, right-wing politicians, the largest constituency in Congress, with a reprieve from public scrutiny.The inspiration for this strategy is Eduardo Cunha, the head of Brazil\u2019s lower house, who has led the impeachment charge. At the same time that he was starting the impeachment process against Ms. Rousseff, he was being investigated on corruption charges that include money laundering and taking bribes. So far, his strategy of muddying the waters has worked perfectly: The impeachment proceedings have continued and shifted the focus away from Mr. Cunha\u2019s own legal problems. Many of the members of Congress who voted for impeachment on Sunday are hoping they\u2019ll enjoy the same good fortune.Members of the task force responsible for Operation Car Wash are worried. In an interview with BBC Brazil, Deltan Dallagnol, the lead public prosecutor in Operation Car Wash, said he feared a post-impeachment political offensive against the investigation. A change in government, he said, could bring to power congressmen who are themselves under investigation, who might \u201cpull up their sleeves and move against the operation\u201d when media exposure declines and public interest fades.Many observers in Brazil also fear that a government led by Mr. Temer, the vice president, could reach an \u201cacord\u00e3o,\u201d or big agreement, with other parties to declaw the investigation. This could be achieved by passing laws that make future anti-corruption initiatives more difficult, or by replacing the people in charge of the Federal Police. Even if all that fails, many of the people who voted to impeach Ms. Rousseff on Sunday hope that judges will be more lenient when they are not subject to public pressure and extensive media coverage.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters claim that her impending impeachment is part of a coup. It\u2019s not. Legal procedure is being followed, and it seems likely that Ms. Rousseff broke the law. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right.The crisis brought on by the Operation Car Wash scandals should have been part of Brazil\u2019s painful \u2014 and extraordinary \u2014 process of establishing a functioning judiciary and fighting corruption. But Ms. Rousseff\u2019s fall is not the logical conclusion of that happy story. Far from being the dawn of a new era, it may very well turn out to be the way the old political class reasserts control over the country \u2014 and escapes jail.Celso Rocha de Barros is a political columnist at the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo.Advertisement"}

Now, it is a clean, well-lighted space rented out to investment banks and pop stars. Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna have rehearsed there.From a distance, that evolution may seem like another attempt to put lipstick on a fading industrial legacy. But upon closer inspection, the Greenhouse is part of a concerted effort by New York City officials and a collection of entrepreneurs to revive a historic hub of American enterprise: the Brooklyn Navy Yard.The 215-year-old Navy Yard was the birthplace of some of the nation\u2019s most celebrated and ill-fated military ships, including the U.S.S. Missouri and the U.S.S. Arizona. At its peak, during World War II, it employed about 70,000 people.On Tuesday, Rick Mast, the chief executive of Mast Brothers, stood inside a vast, empty structure in the center of the Navy Yard, giggling with anticipation. He and his brother, Michael, had just taken over a 65,000-square-foot space that they said would become the headquarters and primary factory for their business.Rick Mast said they planned to double their work force to about 150 people after they move into the Navy Yard next year from their base of operations nearby. They expect to hire 100 people within three years to make, package, sell and ship chocolate from the renovated building.\u201cThe opportunity to grow in Brooklyn in a spectacular space like this, that\u2019s huge for us,\u201d Mr. Mast said, looking up at a vestige of the space\u2019s shipbuilding past, an overhead crane capable of hoisting 10 tons.Russ & Daughters will occupy about a quarter of the hub\u2019s 66,000 square feet to bake, pickle and fill orders from across the country and, eventually, overseas, said Niki Russ Federman, one of the owners. Ms. Federman said the space, like those of the other future tenants of the food hub, would include a retail shop.\u201cThe more good people and delicious food there is in one place, the more of a draw it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Ms. Federman, who added that she had suggested some prospective tenants to the landlord, the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation.In turn, Ms. Federman said she had received help finding new employees through the employment center that the development corporation runs. \u201cWe\u2019ve already hired a number of people through the Navy Yard, and we\u2019re not even there yet,\u201d she said.\u201cWe are actually making things here,\u201d said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development.As Ms. Glen looked out from a high floor in one of the yard\u2019s buildings at working dry docks and structures in various states of repair, she rattled off a list of products being made or designed at the site, not all of them edible. \u201cThese are good jobs that people thought were lost to New York forever,\u201d she said.Among the more ambitious tenants is Edward Jacobs, whose company, FXE Industries, is building a prototype of motorcycles it hopes to mass-produce in the Navy Yard. The group has just three employees now, but would need many more to produce the \u201cthousands of bikes\u201d Mr. Jacobs dreams of.\u201cWe believe that there is value in keeping everything close by,\u201d he said, adding that being in Brooklyn exposes entrepreneurs to many different perspectives.Steve Hindy, the chairman and co-founder of Brooklyn Brewery, said the company\u2019s formerly scruffy neighborhood in Williamsburg had filled with hotels and clubs that were able to afford higher rents than a manufacturer could.\u201cThe Navy Yard is an incredible success story and an example to be copied around the country,\u201d Mr. Hindy said. \u201cIt offers the kind of long-term home that any industrial business would embrace.\u201dHe said he would not be attending the debate but would be delivering some Brooklyn beer to a neighboring building where the news media will be stationed.\u201cThirty years ago, when we started, the idea of a presidential debate in Brooklyn would have been pretty far beyond anyone\u2019s imagination,\u201d Mr. Hindy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real demonstration of Brooklyn\u2019s arrival.\u201dAn article on Thursday about how changes at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the site of a debate that night between the Democratic presidential candidates, reflect an evolving economy misidentified a company that is building a motorcycle prototype there. It is FXE Industries, not Design Necessities Initiative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Economies Rise as Emissions Fall? The Evidence Says Yes", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byOn the EnvironmentThroughout the 20th century, the global economy was fueled by burning coal to run factories and power plants, and burning oil to move planes, trains and automobiles. The more coal and oil countries burned \u2014 and the more planet-warming carbon dioxide they emitted \u2014 the higher the economic growth.And so it seemed logical that any policy to reduce emissions would also push countries into economic decline.\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting, and it suggests that countries can sever the historic link between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Mr. Aden said.Of course, even if 21 countries have achieved decoupling, more than 170 countries have not. They continue to follow the traditional economic path of growth directly tied to carbon pollution. Among those are some of the world\u2019s biggest polluters: China, India, Brazil and Indonesia.And decoupling by just 21 countries is not enough to save the planet as we know it. Over the 15 years that Mr. Aden studied, the decoupled countries lowered emissions about 1 billion tons \u2014 but overall global emissions grew about 10 billion tons.The question is whether what happened in the 21 countries can be a model for the rest of the world. Almost all of them are European, but not all are advanced Group of 20 economies. Bulgaria, Romania and Uzbekistan are among them.The Paris Agreement, the landmark climate change accord reached in December, commits nearly every country to actions to tackle climate change \u2014 and to continuously increase the intensity of those actions in the coming decades. But absent major breakthroughs in decoupling, governments are likely to be hesitant to take aggressive steps to curb emissions if they mean economic loss.In the United States, the decoupling of emissions and economic growth was driven chiefly by the boom in domestic natural gas, which when burned produces about half the carbon pollution of coal. The glut of cheap natural gas drove electric utilities away from coal, while still lighting and powering ever more homes and factories. The decoupling was also driven by improvements in energy-efficiency technology.The decoupling trend held even in the United States industrial sector. Between 2000 and 2014, Mr. Aden found that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions dropped 16 percent in the American industrial sector, while economic activity increased 9 percent.But decoupling can hurt. Even as the industrial sector grew over all in those years, a push by American factories to use more energy-efficient technology contributed to a 21 percent loss of industrial jobs, Mr. Aden says.In smaller economies, decoupling hurts less. Sweden experienced economic growth of 31 percent as its emissions fell 8 percent, continuing a longstanding trend driven by its tax on carbon emissions, instituted in 1991. Today, Sweden gets nearly half of its electricity from nuclear power, which produces no emissions, and 35 percent from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectric.But in large, industrial economies that are trying to decouple, the change raises thorny questions. For example, will the pollution just move elsewhere? In Britain, emissions fell 20 percent between 2000 and 2014, while G.D.P. grew 27 percent. That was largely the result of a push to de-industrialize in the country that gave birth to the Industrial Revolution. As Britain\u2019s financial and service sectors grew and its coal mines, mills and steel factories closed, some of those industries went to China, which became the world\u2019s largest polluter.According to Mr. Aden\u2019s study, China\u2019s G.D.P. has increased 270 percent since 2000 and its carbon emissions 178 percent. But there are very tentative signs that even China may be decoupling.Decoupling presents another problem. \u201cThe countries that have achieved decoupling have de-industrialized \u2014 and that has increased income inequality,\u201d Bill Cassidy, a United States senator from Louisiana, said in an interview. \u201cOne of the things that has not been analyzed is the job prospects for those families. There\u2019s going to be unintended consequences of their livelihoods being curtailed.\u201dMeanwhile, some left-wing economists still say that the dream of decoupling is just that \u2014 and that the only way to truly lower emissions will be to bite the bullet and accept a hit to the economy.\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible to decouple, but we have to be skeptical,\u201d said Giorgos Kallis, an editor of the book \u201cDegrowth\u201d and an economist at the University of Barcelona. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that an economy powered by solar and renewables can sustain the same level of economic growth. If we are serious about reducing emissions, we cannot do the wishful thinking that the economy will double every 35 years. We have to ask, can we manage without growth?\u201dBut Mr. Aden remains optimistic, saying, \u201cWe may be on the verge of a transition where this relationship is finally unhinging.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the first year that a study by the International Energy Agency found that global carbon emissions leveled off as global G.D.P. grew. The year was 2014, not 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Keeps Rates Steady and Says Labor Market Is Improving", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve, determined to move cautiously, said on Wednesday that the American economy still was not ready for higher interest rates.The Fed said that the labor market continued to get stronger, yet it made the widely expected decision not to raise its benchmark interest rate, which remains close to zero, and it offered no suggestion that a rate increase was imminent.The case against higher rates is basically that it makes sense to err on the side of stimulus. By holding borrowing costs at low levels, Fed officials say, it will be relatively easy to respond to stronger inflation by doing less to encourage spending and borrowing. If the Fed raises rates prematurely, however, it will have little room to correct the error by doing more.The central bank left itself room to maneuver, though, and the Fed\u2019s two-handed assessment of economic conditions appeared to confuse financial markets.Investors initially bid up yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, suggesting they expected interest rates to rise more quickly than anticipated before the meeting. But then they reversed course and drove yields sharply lower. The 10-year yield ended the trading day down 4 percent at 1.85 percent.Some analysts still think the Fed may raise rates at its next meeting, in June, particularly if other economic indicators show the same strength as job growth. Others, however, said they did not expect a rate increase until later in the year.Over all, investors are betting against June, putting the chance of an increase around 20 percent, and the Fed on Wednesday made little effort to change minds.\u201cThere was a distinct absence of teeing up a hike in June,\u201d economists at BNP Paribas wrote in an analysis. \u201cIndeed, it is difficult to see how a hike could be delivered, despite reduced external risks, until the economy takes on a more positive tone.\u201dTD Securities, which had predicted an increase in June, said it now expected none until September.\u201cRelax and enjoy your summer!\u201d said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for the fixed income group at RBC Wealth Management, writing off a rate increase until November.The Fed already had backed away from its December projection that it would raise rates four times this year. Officials in March predicted just two rate increases. But Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said this month that she did not regard the December increase as a mistake, and she and other officials have continued to suggest that more moves are likely this year.Other officials, too, have cautioned against assuming too much caution.While the Fed\u2019s latest statement acknowledged the weakness of some recent economic data, it also noted a number of reasons that growth could gain strength.\u201cMuch of the weakness in economic activity that manifested in recent data appears to have been downplayed in the statement and is in any case largely in the rear view as far as the committee is concerned,\u201d said Michael Dolega, a senior economist at TD Bank.For example, there is a divide in the recent rounds of government data between the reported strength of job growth and the reported weakness of overall economic activity. The early estimates of job growth are historically more accurate, and the Fed\u2019s choice of language suggested Fed officials think the reported economic weakness may be overstated. The statement described job growth as improved but said economic growth \u201cappears\u201d to have slowed.The Commerce Department is scheduled to report its initial estimate of first-quarter growth in economic activity on Thursday; the number is expected to be modest, perhaps little more than a 1 percent annual pace.The change may reflect better news from China, but the Fed still appears to be unusually attentive to global developments. One looming risk is the British referendum in late June on continued membership in the European Union.On inflation, too, the Fed appears to be waiting for expected improvement.Since the financial crisis, the economy has consistently fallen short of the Fed\u2019s annual inflation target of 2 percent. And some officials have expressed concern that recent declines in measures of inflation expectations may reflect a loss of confidence the Fed will hit the target in future years.Another batch of data, through March, is scheduled for publication on Friday. It is expected to show continued weakness. Yet the statement on Wednesday repeated the Fed\u2019s view that inflation will rebound as the effects of low oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually fade.The problem facing the Fed, however, is the same one it has been facing for some time. It continues to predict better times tomorrow. And tomorrow never seems to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Adds China\u2019s Internet Controls to List of Trade Barriers", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s notorious online controls have long been criticized as censorship by human rights groups, businesses, Chinese Internet users and others.Now they have earned a new label from the American government: trade barrier.United States trade officials have for the first time added China\u2019s system of Internet filters and blocks \u2014 broadly known as the Great Firewall \u2014 to an annual list of trade impediments. The entry says that over the last decade, the limits have \u201cposed a significant burden to foreign suppliers, hurting both Internet sites themselves and users who often depend on them for business.\u201dThe move, which isn\u2019t likely to have immediate repercussions, speaks to the American government\u2019s growing concern over Chinese Internet regulations and could foreshadow more aggressive actions. It also underscores the opposing visions the world\u2019s two largest economies have on how the Internet should work and be managed.The United States argues against overt censorship and policies that block the flow of data across borders. China has been pushing its agenda that each state should have the right to closely control what websites are available within its borders.The report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative said that over the last year, the \u201coutright blocking of websites appears to have worsened,\u201d noting that eight of the top 25 most popular global sites are blocked in China.\u201cMuch of the blocking appears arbitrary; for example, a major home improvement site in the United States, which would appear wholly innocuous, is typical of sites likely swept up by the Great Firewall,\u201d the report said.Officials at China\u2019s commerce and foreign affairs ministries, as well as at its top Internet regulatory agency, did not respond to requests for comment.In recent years, China and the United States have clashed over trade in the technology industry. Last year, the Obama administration responded to lobbying from American companies against a number of Chinese laws that the companies said were devised to push them out of China. Beijing toned down language in an antiterrorism law, and it scrapped a regulation restricting what foreign hardware could be sold to Chinese banks.Still, any effort by the United States to persuade China to reduce its Internet censorship would most likely be a nonstarter. The Chinese government considers the close control of online discourse a matter of national security, largely out of concerns about the Internet\u2019s power to aid the organization of protests and the spread of dissent. As a result, Beijing has shown little flexibility on issues of censorship, and it tends to block any Internet media it feels it does not have complete control over.Scott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move by the United States trade office illustrated the gulf between the attitude represented by China\u2019s heavy regulation of the Internet and the one put forward by the United States through trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201cChina is far less willing to separate commercial and national security concerns,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThis difference in approach is unlikely to disappear anytime soon, no matter how much the U.S. highlights the issue.\u201dChina cites the threat of online espionage, pointing to disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, that showed American intelligence efforts to use American hardware abroad to gather information.Online filters in China create an Internet largely walled off from the rest of the world, violating the fundamental idea of the web as an open channel of communication among people across the globe. Detractors say that the practice is anticompetitive, prohibits freedom of expression and ultimately damages Chinese economic growth by limiting access to information. Supporters of China\u2019s policies say that the rules have allowed the country to foster a thriving set of domestic Internet companies.The United States trade office added China\u2019s Internet censorship policies to its annual National Trade Estimate Report, released on March 31. The insertion was reported on April 1 by Inside U.S. Trade, a trade publication.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Verizon Strike, Blue-Collar Stress Hits the Sidewalks", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe roughly 36,000 Verizon workers who went on strike Wednesday as a contract dispute entered its ninth month have brought into sharp relief one of the most fundamental questions facing the United States: Can an economy in the throes of dizzying technological change be a source of new middle-class jobs for blue-collar workers?The company, which is seeking rule changes that would make it easier to outsource work, seems to cast some doubt on that proposition, through its actions if not its words. It argues that technological change and shifts in consumer demand have rendered self-defeating many of the promises made to workers a generation or two ago.The two unions involved, whose members at Verizon currently earn an average of $130,000 a year in wages and benefits, insist this level of compensation can be not just sustained but shared with more workers, if only it were a higher priority. The company, they point out, is highly profitable and sells services that consumers are clamoring for.Both sides have a point. Over 99 percent of the striking employees work on the so-called wireline side of its business \u2014 that is, the traditional phone landlines and the fiber optic network, called Fios, which offers subscribers Internet, voice and video service. It is a business where growth is slow or declining, as more and more consumers give up landlines and traditional subscription television. Profits are low.The wireline business generated about 29 percent of Verizon\u2019s revenue in 2015, but accounted for only 7 percent of its operating income.By contrast, the wireless business, which is largely not unionized and where wages and benefits for rank-and-file workers are lower on average, is booming and highly profitable. Over the last few years, Verizon\u2019s wireless business has consistently grown at least 7 percent a year, whereas its wireline business has shrunk slightly \u2014 in the last year, about 2 percent.At the same time, Verizon\u2019s wireless margins are the highest in the industry. More than 40 cents of every dollar of revenue on the wireless side becomes cash flow.\u201cAt this point it\u2019s treating wireline as a sort of cash cow rather than something to be invested in heavily, whereas wireless is where the future growth is,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research.Yet these broad trends obscure some of the ways that Verizon could sustain and expand good-paying work even on the wireline side. Foremost is Fios, widely regarded as state of the art when it comes to broadband networks, and which the union and the company agree can serve as a foundation for sustaining desirable jobs.But Verizon remains ambivalent about Fios. In 2004 the company pledged to lay fiber that could serve as many as 18 million homes. It fulfilled that plan according to its own measure, but has shown little desire in moving much beyond it, leaving several million households with little hope of getting access to the network. Until Verizon announced on Tuesday that it would be making Fios available throughout Boston, it had been several years since the company had committed itself to a major expansion.Ian Olgeirson, an analyst at the media research firm SNL Kagan, said one reason for this reluctance to expand is that the rising price of television programming has put pressure on margins for video, which makes the economics of the entire fiber optics investment less attractive.Still, there continues to be great demand for the broadband service, where margins are quite high. And while companies that invest in fiber optics like to see good returns on multiple services rather than just one to justify the expense, Mr. Olgeirson notes that some of Verizon\u2019s competitors have not been deterred by this issue.\u201cYou do see evidence of a little more enthusiasm for the wireline business at AT&T,\u201d Mr. Olgeirson said.Given the potential social benefits of a broadband expansion \u2014 in terms of both jobs for those working on the network and opportunity for those using it \u2014 many experts see a rationale for a government role in at least nudging the process forward, even if the economics are too challenging for private carriers to undertake on their own. But this has not been forthcoming either.\u201cThe F.C.C. doesn\u2019t have an effective policy to build out broadband in the U.S.,\u201d said Jeffrey Keefe, a professor emeritus at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, who has studied the telecom industry for decades. \u201cFios is a state-of-the-art broadband network. The F.C.C. has not provided the appropriate incentives.\u201dThe two unions \u2014 the second is the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2014 have made no secret of their intention to also open a political front in the dispute. After the New York City government audited Verizon\u2019s performance in building out its fiber optic network there, union leaders asked the City Council to hold hearings.The unions also procured a letter from 14 mayors about the fiber optic issue and one from 20 United States senators urging Verizon to act as a \u201cresponsible corporate citizen\u201d and negotiate fairly with its workers.\u201cThe purposes of the strike are to build public support for the workers and to put pressure on the politicians and the regulators to put pressure on Verizon to settle this thing,\u201d Professor Keefe said.Even as the unions seek to build support from outside, they argue internally that there are several categories of jobs that could sustain middle-class lifestyles if the company were willing to think about them differently. One of the major points of contention between Verizon and its unions are call centers. The company currently outsources some of its customer service and sales calls to centers in lower-cost regions of the United States, and it is proposing rule changes that would allow it to do more of this.But the cost savings that outsourced call centers appear to offer often prove illusory. Rosemary Batt, a professor at the ILR School of Cornell University who has extensively studied the moving of service work to call centers, says turnover is lower and performance and customer satisfaction are substantially higher when the work is done in-house.\u201cThere are real opportunities to increase revenue by bundling and packaging different products,\u201d she said, giving an example. \u201cBut you need a more sophisticated work force that\u2019s trained and committed to the company to do that well. Outsourcing is penny-wise but pound-foolish.\u201dTo be sure, the company is hardly oblivious to the good-jobs question. It is not seeking wage concessions, and officials there express genuine enthusiasm at the economic benefits that Fios confers on its workers. Tami Erwin, president of Verizon\u2019s consumer and mass business unit, emphasized in an interview that the Boston expansion would mean a lot of \u201cgreat high-paying work.\u201dBut despite that expansion, the company\u2019s overall posture does not appear to be intended to pursue a business model that maximizes the number of middle-class incomes it produces. Asked about the possible benefits of keeping call center workers in-house, Ms. Erwin said: \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to make sure we\u2019ve created an environment where people have the right tools, the right resources. If we do that, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re a contractor or an employee.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the broader economic questions behind the strike at Verizon misstated the day Verizon announced that it would expand its Fios service in Boston. It was Tuesday, not Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making a Soda Tax More Politically Palatable", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byScaling BackMayor Jim Kenney was elected in Philadelphia last year after promising to bring the city universal prekindergarten, but he needed a way to pay for it.Enter the soda tax. As part of his budget, introduced this month, Mr. Kenney has proposed taxing sugar-sweetened beverages at 3 cents an ounce, the highest soda tax proposed anywhere in the country.Mr. Kenney is taking a different political tack. Instead of the usual eat-your-vegetables pitch of public health reformers, he is offering Philadelphians something delicious: a giant pot of money to fund popular city projects. He says his soda tax could raise more than $400 million over five years, enough to fund not just universal preschool, but also renovations to local libraries, parks and recreation centers; \u201ccommunity schools\u201d that wrap social services with education; and cash for the troubled municipal pension program. He is not using the word obesity, or suggesting that people should drink less soda.His tax could raise the price of a 20-ounce bottle of soda by 60 cents, an increase likely to make some shoppers think twice. But when asked about the health benefits of the tax, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s really serious health benefits in pre-K.\u201dIn other words, this soda tax isn\u2019t for the nanny state; it\u2019s for the needy state. Governments are starting to think of soda taxes as the next sin tax \u2014 an untapped source of revenue that could help with other things.\u201cI think Philadelphia may change the whole conversation about soda taxes,\u201d said Larry Tramutola, a political consultant who helped Berkeley pass its soda tax, and who is advising other California communities eyeing similar measures.\u201cThe world economy is squeezing a lot of governments, and they need revenue,\u201d said Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, who is deeply involved in studies evaluating the effects of the taxes in Mexico, Chile and Berkeley, and hears from a lot of curious public officials.In this country the pitch has remained mostly about public health. San Francisco, where a measure last year just missed a needed two-thirds supermajority of votes, is trying again to pass a tax on sugary drinks. So are a handful of other communities in California. Berkeley\u2019s government has promised to devote the money to community gardens and other healthy initiatives. San Francisco is expected to do the same.But public health advocates say they are watching the Philadelphia experience closely, and think it could influence other local lawmakers if it succeeds. Five years ago, Mr. Kenney, then a City Council member, opposed a soda tax when his predecessor proposed it to fight childhood obesity. This time, he looked around and decided that such a tax was necessary to pay for his prekindergarten program. \u201cIt turns out in the end to be the only revenue source,\u201d he said.The use of soda tax funds to finance local libraries, parks and recreation centers could be a shrewd political choice in a city where district representatives want to show results in their community. Ten of the 17 City Council members represent districts. \u201cThere\u2019s an innate incentive to get in line,\u201d Mr. Kenney said. The tax will continue to be debated as part of the city budget, which typically comes up for a final vote before the City Council in May.Articles in this series will examine Americans\u2019 changing eating habits.The soda industry, of course, is fighting these efforts aggressively. As it has done in past years, it is responding through lobbying and advertising, and by organizing coalitions of opponents. It argues that soda taxes are condescending and hurt poor shoppers disproportionately.\u201cTime and time again, voters in cities across the country say loud and clear they oppose soda taxes,\u201d said William Dermody, the vice president of policy for the American Beverage Association.In Philadelphia, industry officials are making anti-tax arguments, saying that a tax devised to lower consumption of the good will not be a stable source of revenue for an initiative, like universal prekindergarten, that requires permanent funding.They also argue that the big soda tax, collected on distributors who deliver beverages into the city, may be too easy for individuals and retailers to evade by shopping outside city lines. The Teamsters, which delivers sodas in the city, and local grocers are worried about the effect on revenue and jobs. Opponents are also highlighting the sheer magnitude of the proposed tax: Three cents an ounce is enough to double the price of some products.Mr. Kenney said he would advise other cities to consider his approach to soda tax policies. As desirable as it is to get people in your community healthy, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a natural American response to, \u2018You\u2019re going to tell me how I\u2019m going to eat or drink or smoke or fry.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Trade Becomes an Election Issue", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:The real problem for the United States is not whether or not there is free trade or some level of protectionism. The real problem is that American corporations have been completely free to move their production facilities into other countries where the cost of labor has been much lower than in the United States. They then produce products far more cheaply and send them back to the United States and to other countries.The solution to this problem does not lie so much on trade policy, but rather on the much more politically and economically sensitive question of control over capital investment decisions. We need to somehow develop a system of constraints on what is now the essentially unfettered international flow of corporate capital searching the world for the lowest possible production costs.It is becoming increasingly clear that these goals of the private corporation, while perhaps good for the corporation and its shareholders, have created serious problems for the overwhelming majority of Americans and for American foreign policy. STEPHEN ANDORSBrooklynTo the Editor:Paul Krugman is correct that much of the negative impact of foreign trade for Americans results from our inadequate domestic policies, including the undercutting of the bargaining power of workers. But for the last 25 years this argument has been used to rationalize a perverse politics in which Democratic presidents ally with big business and Republicans to make trade deals that expose American workers to brutal competition, and then complain that they are helpless to stop these same \u201callies\u201d from dismantling social safety nets and destroying labor unions.Like it or not, only the threat of protectionism will change this cynical behavior. Those who profess to care about the future of American workers should be demanding an immediate freeze, and where possible a rollback, of any new trade agreements until we have first established domestic policies, like those in Europe and Canada, that allow workers to prosper from trade.JEFF FAUXDistinguished FellowEconomic Policy InstituteWashingtonTo the Editor:Thus, should a foreign corporation try, say, to market a product in the United States that would violate our health and safety laws or whose manufacture involved slave labor, and the tribunals, operating entirely outside American courts, decided for the corporation, the United States would be compelled to comply. No appeal is allowed. This shows utter contempt for our sovereignty and the rule of law.CLIFFORD E. ANDERSONSacramentoTo the Editor:And this is made even worse by corporations ducking out on paying their fair share of taxes through the use of \u201cinversions\u201d and extorting tax breaks from local and state governments.By focusing mainly on trading partners, Donald Trump is deflecting the anger from where it should be aimed \u2014 at people like him who take far more than they need while stiffing the American working and middle classes. If American workers ever wake up to the real source of their lost jobs and declining wealth, it is going to get a lot more uncomfortable for Mr. Trump and his peer group.MARK FURMANMorristown, N.J.To the Editor:There is an old joke about a shipwrecked economist advising his stranded colleagues how to open a can of food by saying \u201cassume we have a can opener.\u201d The dwindling number of economists who unquestioningly support more trade agreements assume untrue facts to support their belief.Trade agreements produce more gains than losses under rare circumstances. First, there must be full employment so workers losing jobs gain equivalent jobs next week. Second, there must be no currency manipulation that distorts the relative price of imports to domestic goods and services. Third, trade must remain balanced so import job losses are offset by export job gains.Because those factors usually do not exist, the losses from trade deals often exceed any gains. Thus, cheaper goods do not compensate for the lost income from job losses and depressed growth. This is standard macroeconomics. It also happens to be the reality voters live in.

{"Headline": "Seeking Bold Tax Overhaul, Texas Lawmaker to Test Congress", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaHOUSTON \u2014 Over two decades in Congress, Representative Kevin Brady has always been popular with colleagues. Now that the genial Texas Republican has become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Brady has got real power, too.Or does he?The committee has authority over taxation, health policy and retirement benefit programs, and it holds the potential to significantly influence the economy not just in the United States but the entire world.\u201cIt can do big things,\u201d he said during an interview in his Houston district.Yet he has assumed the gavel in an era when congressional leaders, following partisan imperatives, have increasingly curbed the independence of committee chiefs.Mr. Brady says that doesn\u2019t bother him. \u201cIt\u2019s a great advantage to have a speaker who knows the issues and knows the importance,\u201d he explained.Mr. Brady\u2019s bigger problem is whether Congress can act at all.Mr. Brady, a longtime Chamber of Commerce executive before arriving in Washington, eyes something bigger: the first comprehensive rewrite of corporate and individual taxation in 30 years.He is looking at more fundamental changes, like a shift toward taxing consumption rather than income.\u201cLet\u2019s not tweak what we have and call it a day,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cLet\u2019s think bold about tax reform, and look at it with fresh eyes.\u201dRecent predecessors have found only eyestrain.The plan raised the same amount of revenue as the existing system. Unlike many Republican tax plans, including those of the 2016 presidential candidates, it didn\u2019t confer disproportionate benefits on wealthy Americans that would make the system less progressive.Mr. Camp\u2019s product went nowhere, as Mr. Boehner\u2019s sarcastic reaction signaled. But Mr. Brady said the episode encouraged him by showcasing how lower rates and fewer loopholes could improve the economy.\u201cThose were the tightest constraints that you could possibly accept in new tax reform,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cI think we can loosen those constraints.\u201dLoosening them would increase Republican enthusiasm by permitting deeper rate cuts; Mr. Camp could only pare the top rate for high earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. Yet those \u201ctightest constraints\u201d represent a bare minimum for cooperation from congressional Democrats.\u201cMajor changes in American government almost always require buy-in from both parties,\u201d Mr. Brady acknowledged. If Democrats emerge from the November elections with more clout, he\u2019ll need more buy-in.His good humor masks a fierce competitive streak. Mr. Brady once broke his shoulder sliding headfirst into home plate in the annual Democrats-against-Republicans congressional baseball game.\u201cWe don\u2019t have rose-colored glasses on,\u201d Mr. Brady said.But he insisted that a tax overhaul was \u201cinevitable.\u201d That\u2019s something he\u2019ll have to prove.Advertisement"}

Accuses Polish Government of Undermining Democracy", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWARSAW \u2014 The European Parliament accused Poland\u2019s right-wing government on Wednesday of undermining democracy, overwhelmingly adopting a resolution urging it to respect the decisions of a top Polish court.A constitutional crisis that has gripped the country for five months has allowed the right-wing Law and Justice party to govern with a free hand, prompting protests nationwide.The European Parliament resolution, backed by a coalition of liberal and left-wing factions and passed in a meeting in Strasbourg, France, calls on the Polish government to respect the decisions of the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal, which is empowered to review Poland\u2019s laws.The motion urged the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to take actions to force the Polish government to follow the resolution\u2019s recommendations. If the Polish government fails to do so, it could face penalties.Representatives of Law and Justice quickly denounced the vote, calling it \u201cabsurd\u201d and saying the government would not comply with it.Law and Justice contended that because the previous government had improperly appointed two of those judges \u2014 as the Constitutional Tribunal had ruled \u2014 none of the five should be seated.In December, though, the tribunal ruled that the three judges who had been properly appointed by the previous government should be seated. Law and Justice refused, and Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, who was a member of the party until May 2015, refused to swear in the judges.According to the resolution on Wednesday, which passed with a vote of 513 to 142, Parliament \u201cis seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland endangers democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\u201dThe resolution is not legally binding, but it offers yet another sign that Poland, the sixth-largest economy in the union and a major net recipient of its programs, faces growing pressure from Western powers.Ryszard Czarnecki, a Law and Justice member of the European Parliament, called the resolution \u201ccoarse and vulgar.\u201d Ryszard Legutko, also a member of the party, said the government would not follow its recommendations.If that also fails, Poland\u2019s voting rights in the European Union could be suspended, though such a decision is considered unlikely. It would require the unanimous approval of European Union members, and Hungary, which has also been accused of violating democratic norms, has already said that it would not support it.\u201cIf Polish authorities don\u2019t want the international public to get involved in Polish affairs, they shouldn\u2019t give it reasons to do so,\u201d Donald Tusk, president of the European Council and a former prime minister of Poland, said on Wednesday. \u201cToday, there are way too many reasons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To decouple the economy from oil without at the same time eroding living standards, his government plans to sell shares in the state oil giant, Saudi Aramco, funnel the money raised into a public investment fund, and shift vital services like education, health care and airports to the private sector.The nation\u2019s reliance on oil will be further reduced, and its economy diversified, by new investment in solar and wind power, by building up the small defense sector and by opening up the Saudi market to \u201cthe finest talent and the best investments globally.\u201dOne formidable challenge is creating millions of jobs for the overwhelming majority of Saudis who are under 30 years old. Spoiled by decades of reliable oil revenues, many young people lack the education, the technical skills and the work ethic for private sector jobs. The young prince talks of creating an education system \u201caligned with market needs,\u201d a critical goal at odds with existing religion-centric education. There are also doubts about whether the kingdom, with its authoritarian government, can establish the kind of regulatory and legal structure needed for a large private sector.International businesses want to know that the rules are clear and that commercial disputes can be resolved on the basis of law. Many such business may be uncomfortable investing in a country where powerful clerics practicing Wahhabism, an extreme form of Islam that inspires the Islamic State and other terrorists, exercise control over religious life and execute dissidents and those who run afoul of religious practices and Islamic law.Still, Prince Mohammed\u2019s initiative suggests that broader reforms might be possible in a nation where women are second-class citizens, Shiites are disparaged and foreign workers have no real status. His plan makes no pretense of recognizing basic rights and freedoms for all people, but it does praise moderation, tolerance and equity, says opportunities for women will be expanded and raises the possibility of green cards for foreigners. It says that culture and entertainment are indispensable components of a healthy society and that the participation of women in sports will be encouraged. He seems to understand that these changes, at a minimum, are necessary if his dysfunctional country is to have a better future.Advertisement"}

A bit of realpolitik is very necessary now.MICHAEL SPIELMANBronxTo the Editor:Bernie Sanders may not always have feasible solutions to the issues he addresses, but at least he has shown the capacity to think independently, defying the conventional wisdom of Washington.Hillary Clinton, in contrast, appears to be the \u201csafe\u201d choice who will uphold the status quo, tucked securely within the fold of establishment opinion.Yet recent history has shown that the conventional wisdom in this turbulent and unpredictable world can lead to catastrophe in economics, like the financial crisis that so few experts foresaw, and foreign affairs, as in the disastrous Iraq war.This helps explain the popularity of Senator Sanders and the defiantly unconventional Donald Trump.The ability to think and decide independently, to risk ridicule and isolation, appears to be a core requirement for the presidency this time around. Yet, Mrs. Clinton has shown precious little evidence of this capacity.Her ability to win in November may very well hinge on conveying the strength to stand alone, as so many presidents have done, often in their most distinguished moments. LARRY DEBLINGERMonroe, N.Y.To the Editor:Your editorial seems to suggest that Hillary Clinton is a more practical politician than Bernie Sanders; I agree. She is also part of the 1 percent.As one of the richer, more powerful people in this country, she has probably had as much to do with maintaining and developing our socioeconomic-political system as anyone. Why else would Goldman Sachs pay her $225,000 for a speaking engagement? Do you seriously think she is likely to be any agent of change?Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, appears to be a refreshingly honest man who is genuinely concerned about the vast and growing inequality in this country.Admittedly, his appeal has an emotional, idealistic element to it. But aren\u2019t we all subject to emotional influences, and if strong enough, can\u2019t they lead to a broad-based inspirational movement and the demand for real change?For those of us who feel that the status quo is not good enough, I suggest giving some serious thought to voting for the passionate senator from Vermont.EMMETT M. DOCKERYSouth Salem, N.Y.To the Editor:I am a supporter of Hillary Clinton. But I have been disheartened by the obvious mistakes her campaign has made. Knowing that she would be running in 2016, why would she make speeches to any group that might impinge on her credibility?I am also puzzled as to the need for a private email server. Both she and Bill Clinton are seasoned, savvy politicians, and must have realized that these sort of activities could be damaging.I am worried that though she is by far the most qualified candidate in the field, she will spend precious time answering to those mistakes rather than being able to expound on the many issues, both domestic and foreign, on which she has workable, detailed ideas.

The issue seems likely to come up again on Thursday when they meet for a debate in Brooklyn five days before the primary.In an ad running in New York, Mr. Sanders portrays Mrs. Clinton as too cozy with Wall Street, and promises that unlike his opponent, he would break up financial behemoths and raise their taxes.\u201cWill they like me? No,\u201d he says in the ad. \u201cWill they begin to play by the rules if I\u2019m president? You better believe it.\u201dUnder the law, meant to prevent a reprise of the 2008 financial crisis, large banks must file plans on how they would undergo an orderly bankruptcy in the event of a severe crisis. The five banks\u2019 plans, known as living wills, were found inadequate. The banks have until Oct. 1 to fix them or face restrictions, which after two years could include selling off assets.Mr. Sanders, in no mood to wait, said the banks were bigger today than when taxpayers bailed them out in the financial crisis. \u201cIf we are serious about preventing another major financial crisis and ending the enormous concentration of ownership within the financial sector, we have got to stand up to Wall Street and break these banks up,\u201d he said in a statement.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, urged that the regulatory process play itself out under existing law, starting with banks submitting new living wills. Next regulators should impose higher capital requirements.\u201cAnd if these banks don\u2019t fix their problems over time, then regulators need to break them apart,\u201d she said in a statement.In the past, Mr. Sanders has called Mrs. Clinton too compromised to take on Wall Street because she has taken large donations from bankers as a candidate and was paid $675,000 for a series speeches to Goldman Sachs. He regularly needles her to release the transcripts of the speeches.Mr. Sanders pledged in January to break up banks that are too big to fail \u2014 that is, so important to the economy they would need a taxpayer bailout \u2014 within one year of taking office. He wants to reinstate the Glass-Steagall law of the 1930s that created a wall between investment banking and retail banks. It was partly repealed under President Bill Clinton, which Mr. Sanders maintains helped bring on the Great Recession a decade later.Mrs. Clinton has called Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposals inadequate because the financial crisis was caused not just by banks collapsing, but by the failure of \u201cshadow\u201d financial institutions like AIG, an insurance company, and subprime mortgage companies like Countrywide, which went on lending sprees.\u201cIf all you do is look at the banks, you are missing shadow banking,\u201d she told The Daily News in an interview with its editorial board recently. Mr. Sanders also spoke with the New York paper\u2019s editors, and in endorsing Mrs. Clinton this week they cited the Vermont senator\u2019s lack of specifics on how he would execute his \u201cshock-and-awe bank-busting campaign.\u201dThe Republican candidates, in calling for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, which was passed by President Obama and a Democratic-controlled Congress, have blamed it as inadequate to prevent future bank bailouts, and for crippling small community banks.At the same time, he said, overregulation of small banks forced them to sell out to bigger banks, \u201cso the big banks get bigger and the small banks are eliminated.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just nuts,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you have to be able to thread the needle on that.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Says U.S. Regulations Keeping It From Trade With Iran", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 With the completion of the nuclear deal with Iran and the opening of its market, European businesses expected a trade bonanza.But three months after the lifting of many sanctions against Iran, there is growing frustration among European politicians, diplomats and businesspeople over the inability to complete dozens of energy, aviation and construction deals with the Iranians.The main obstacle, the Europeans say, is their ally, and the driving force behind the historic nuclear agreement, the United States. Wary of running afoul of new sanctions imposed by Washington over Iran\u2019s missile program and accusations that Iran sponsors terrorism, European banks are refusing to finance any of the deals, effectively perpetuating Iran\u2019s isolation from the global financial system.Europeans also point to new American visa regulations that make it more difficult for them to enter the United States if they have traveled to Iran. Those financial and travel restrictions, they say, make it nearly impossible to reach agreements with their Iranian counterparts.The hurdles set up by the United States, Europeans say, are also infuriating the Iranian leadership and undermining what they understood to be one of the main goals of the nuclear deal, which was to draw Iran out of its international isolation.From the Iranian perspective, the American obstacles are jeopardizing the fulfillment of the nuclear agreement and empowering the country\u2019s hard-liners. \u201cThe question is, now that the nuclear sanctions are lifted, what status quo will emerge when it comes to doing business with Iran?\u201d said Cyrus Razzaghi, the chief executive officer of Ara Enterprise, a Tehran-based consultancy. \u201cNow everything is ambiguous. If the situation doesn\u2019t change for the better \u2014 banking, more deals \u2014 for Iran this will be a growing risk for the deal.\u201dThe financial obstacles are bad news for Iran\u2019s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who ran for office on promises of an economic revival fueled by the nuclear deal and the lifting of sanctions. Hard-liners have pointed to the financial complications as evidence that the United States can never be trusted, and that Mr. Rouhani has been deceived into making unreciprocated concessions.Indeed, American officials have discounted talk of an Iranian windfall. On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Jewish lobbying group J Street in Washington that Iran had so far received only $3 billion after the nuclear deal, far less than what some Republican critics of the deal claimed were $150 billion in frozen assets. \u201cWe thought it would be $55 billion, but guess what,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, holding up three fingers.United States officials say \u2014 and most European experts agree \u2014 that it is not only the sanctions that are blocking Iran\u2019s access to the American financial system but also Iran\u2019s failure during its years of isolation to update laws governing money laundering and prohibitions against the financing of terrorism.European oil companies, whose capital and expertise Iran desperately needs to revitalize its flagging oil industry, are not making any deals until the Treasury provides clarity over the use of dollars for sales of Iranian oil, diplomats and industry insiders say.But European banks will still have to contend with American regulatory requirements. According to a financial disclosure law, all banks worldwide have to disclose whether their customers are American citizens, to prevent tax evasion. If they fail to do so the banks\u2019 assets can be seized.Several million people hold dual Iranian and American citizenship. Because the Iranian government is reluctant to allow information about its citizens to be shared with the United States, experts say, it is unlikely that it will comply with the act \u2014 another complication for European banks.The United States first imposed sanctions against Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis, focusing over the years primarily on disrupting its ability to connect to international financing networks. As a result, no foreign credit or debit cards work in Iran, forcing visitors to carry large amounts of cash. Selected European banks were once allowed by the Treasury to use dollars in their dealings with Iran. That ended with the nuclear sanctions.Europe never imposed any trade restrictions on Iran. Until 2006, Germany was its biggest trading partner, and there were dozens of flights between Europe and Iran. Iranian oil was refined in the Dutch port of Rotterdam. The European oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and Total were engaged in huge oil projects.When the European Union joined the American effort to press Iran to halt its nuclear program, the bloc\u2019s main action was to impose a boycott on Iranian crude. European banks, oil companies and producers subsequently abandoned the country after increasingly tough sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.Despite the obstacles, European officials say they are determined to clear a path for restored commercial relations. \u201cWe used to be Iran\u2019s first partner in the field of economy, trade, investment,\u201d Ms. Mogherini told the Tasnim News Agency on Tuesday. \u201cWe want to return to those days.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Ruling Over Compensation for \u201983 Beirut Bombing Riles Iran", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 Anger is building among even Iran\u2019s staunchest defenders of the historic nuclear agreement with the United States, after a recent decision by the American Supreme Court allowing relatives of victims of a 1983 bombing to sue Tehran for $2 billion in compensation from frozen Iranian funds.On Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani, widely seen as the executor of the nuclear agreement, lashed out against the United States, calling the ruling a \u201ccontinuation of hostilities against Iran\u201d and a \u201cflagrant theft and a legal disgrace,\u201d the semiofficial Iranian Student News Agency reported.The court ruled last week that the United States Congress did not exceed its constitutional role by enacting a law in 2012 making it easier for families of those killed in terrorist attacks to obtain compensation. The decision opens a path for more than a thousand American relatives of Marines killed in the 1983 bombing of their barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, an attack that Iran has been held responsible for.Iranian officials have repeatedly denied responsibility, however, and they accuse the United States of using the pretext of an attack to steal money that is rightfully theirs.Mr. Rouhani, one of the few Iranian leaders openly committed to restoring relations with the United States, called the Americans \u201cthieves,\u201d adding that they \u201cimagine what they have pillaged belongs to themselves.\u201dIran was expecting a bonanza in unfrozen funds and new business opportunities after sanctions that had been imposed because of the nuclear program were lifted. But the continued presence of nonnuclear sanctions has slowed the process to a crawl, and foreign banks have been afraid to lend to Iranian companies because of potential penalties imposed by the United States.Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, added to the chorus on Wednesday, repeating his contention that the United States was deceitful and not to be trusted. While he had supported the nuclear deal, he always insisted that the United States would try to double-cross Iran.The continuing financial restrictions are evidence of this, Ayatollah Khamenei hinted in a speech on his website, Khamenei.ir.\u201cAmerica engages in tricks and practices deceit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey write on paper that banks can cooperate with Iran, but in practice they promote Iranophobia so that no one trades with Iran.\u201d\u201cAmerican officials say that sanctions are still in place so that foreign investors get scared and do not come,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said.On Monday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the nuclear deal, also strongly criticized the Supreme Court decision. \u201cWe hold the U.S. administration responsible for preservation of Iranian funds, and if they are plundered, we will lodge a complaint with the I.C.J. for reparation,\u201d he said, referring to the International Court of Justice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patricio Aylwin, President Who Guided Chile to Democracy, Dies at 97", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byPatricio Aylwin, the former president of Chile whose election in 1989 put an end to the long dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and who set up a commission that exposed the government\u2019s brutalities, died on Tuesday at his home in Santiago. He was 97.His family confirmed his death.Mr. Aylwin (pronounced ELL-win), the leader of the centrist Christian Democratic Party for more than half a century, was the first elected civilian after General Pinochet\u2019s 17-year rule.A mild-mannered lawyer, he initially seemed no match for the gruff General Pinochet, who remained the army commander in chief. But Mr. Aylwin went on to hold together a coalition of 17 moderate and left-wing parties, maintained the high economic growth rate he had inherited from the Pinochet years, distributed income and social benefits that helped reduce poverty levels and \u2014 perhaps his greatest accomplishment \u2014 established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to collect testimony on human rights abuses under General Pinochet.The negotiated terms of the transition to civilian rule had placed severe limitations on Mr. Aylwin\u2019s government. They included keeping General Pinochet\u2019s authoritarian 1980 Constitution in place, albeit with revisions, allowing the former dictator to remain head of the army for eight years and later to take a seat in the Senate for life.Mr. Aylwin was under pressure to reverse General Pinochet\u2019s policies and bring those responsible for human rights crimes to justice. But he met resistance from the army, which still exerted influence over the nascent democratic institutions and made constant threats, and from an obstructionist new Congress, which skewed to the right because of an electoral system that favored General Pinochet\u2019s allies.Nevertheless, Mr. Aylwin pushed ahead with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, acting against the advice of some of his ministers, who feared further straining the relationship with the military.Years later, the Aylwin model inspired similar commissions in South Africa and other countries with long legacies of human rights abuses.Patricio Aylwin Az\u00f3car was born on Nov. 26, 1918, in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, a Pacific beach resort west of Santiago, the Chilean capital. Although largely of Spanish Basque heritage, he owed his last name to a Welsh ancestor who immigrated to Chile in the 19th century. His father was a Chilean Supreme Court president.Like his father, Mr. Aylwin became a lawyer, graduating from the University of Chile Law School in 1943. After years of successful practice, he gravitated toward politics and was elected to the Senate in 1965 on the Christian Democratic ticket. He was elected president of the party seven times.In 1970, Chile was plunged into political turmoil with the election of Salvador Allende Gossens, the Socialist head of a Marxist coalition, as president. He received slightly more than a third of the popular vote after the two other major party candidates split the remaining ballots.Under President Allende, hundreds of companies were expropriated, the copper industry was nationalized, and an extensive program of agrarian reforms redistributed lands among the poor. But government overspending on social programs and American-orchestrated economic strangulation led to food scarcity and hyperinflation, leaving Chile bitterly divided between left-wing and right-wing camps. The rightists ultimately asked the armed forces to intervene.On Sept. 11, 1973, General Pinochet and three other military junta members began a bloody coup, with the Air Force bombing the presidential palace. Mr. Allende committed suicide during the assault.Along with most Christian Democrats, Mr. Aylwin publicly endorsed the military regime. But as it became increasingly repressive, and after General Pinochet announced his intention to remain in office indefinitely, Mr. Aylwin, like other centrists, became an opponent. He eventually emerged as a leader of the center-left and moderate opposition, though he had been anathema to many leftists because of his early support for the dictatorship.General Pinochet, confident that his high-growth economic policies had gained him public support, sought to extend his rule by eight years through a plebiscite sanctioned under his Constitution. But the opposition leaders coordinated a campaign that led to a resounding popular rejection of General Pinochet\u2019s proposal and forced him to call democratic elections for president and Congress the next year.On Dec. 14, 1989, Mr. Aylwin, then 71, won the presidency with 55.2 percent of the vote, easily defeating General Pinochet\u2019s handpicked candidate and former finance minister, Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi, as well as another right-wing candidate, Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz, a businessman.\u201cChile doesn\u2019t want violence or war; it wants peace,\u201d Mr. Aylwin declared on taking office on March 11, 1990.With the return of civilian government, Chile ended its diplomatic isolation from the rest of the world. Foreign capital poured into the country, especially to exploit its rich copper mines, and domestic investment further expanded an economy that benefited from the balanced budgets, low inflation and strong private-sector bias of the Pinochet era.Still, the general did not hesitate to rattle his saber as army commander when government policy displeased him. The tensest moment was in December 1990, amid calls for his resignation in the wake of a corruption scandal involving his son, also named Augusto Pinochet. As a show of force, General Pinochet ordered troops confined to their barracks. A second attempt to investigate his son\u2019s shady deals provoked another threatening response by the military.Mr. Aylwin struggled to control the armed forces while promising \u201cjustice insofar as it is possible,\u201d a phrase that human rights groups considered to be synonymous with impunity. Although Mr. Aylwin gave the courts information on the human rights abuses laid out by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, years passed before judicial investigations led to any convictions.Mr. Aylwin also pushed the army high command to weed out hundreds of agents of the C.N.I., General Pinochet\u2019s repressive secret intelligence agency, who were still active in the army.Mr. Aylwin, who was limited to one term as president by the Chilean Constitution, left office in 1994. But he remained one of the most admired political figures in Chile, gaining status as the leading elder statesman.He is survived by his wife, Leonor Oyarz\u00fan, whom he married in 1948; two daughters, Isabel and Mariana; three sons, Miguel, Jos\u00e9 Antonio and Juan Francisco; 15 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.\u201cChile has lost a great democrat,\u201d President Michelle Bachelet said, \u201ca man who always knew how to place the unity of democrats above their differences, which helped him build a democratic country.\u201dShe declared three days of national mourning.Jonathan Kandell reported from New York, and Pascale Bonnefoy from Santiago, Chile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Union Drops Effort to Restrict U.S. Imports of Raw Aluminum", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The United Steelworkers union has suspended indefinitely an unusual effort to push the United States government to restrict all aluminum imports after the campaign ran into opposition from aluminum companies, the Canadian government and even Canadian members of the union.The union on Friday withdrew its petition to an American trade panel, which was filed the preceding Monday, after an aluminum industry group agreed to work with the union to address its main concern: Chinese aluminum production overcapacity and exports. \u201cThe Aluminum Association shares many of the concerns expressed by the United Steelworkers regarding Chinese aluminum overproduction,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cOvercapacity must be addressed to maintain a vibrant and healthy North American aluminum industry.\u201dThe statement provided no specifics, saying only that, \u201cThe industry supports ongoing efforts by the U.S. and Chinese governments to address this critical issue.\u201dChina\u2019s aluminum exports have surged as the country\u2019s economy slows. Those exports have displaced Canadian exports in some international markets, triggering an increase in Canadian shipments to the United States, where they now account for two-thirds of all American imports of raw aluminum.At the same time, American companies including Alcoa have also been expanding in countries including Canada, Iceland and Saudi Arabia while closing less efficient operations in the United States.The union tried to address the issue by invoking Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act \u2014 an obscure trade law not employed since 2001, when President George W. Bush used it to restrict steel imports. That nearly set off a trade war with the European Union. In a Section 201 case, American industries or unions facing serious injury from imports may seek broad tariffs on imports from around the world rather than from a particular country.The union\u2019s petition triggered a strong reaction from government officials and workers in Canada, especially in the province of Quebec. That was awkward for the United Steelworkers, which represents workers across North America.Although it withdrew the petition, the union said on Friday: \u201cWe believe the Section 201 case would have resulted in immediate price increases that would have helped to maintain domestic production and employment as well as ensuring that producers in the United States and Canada would be able to obtain a fairer price for their products.\u201dSection 201 cases are handled initially by the United States International Trade Commission, a bipartisan panel of trade experts in Washington. But the final decision is made by the president, who decides whether to follow recommendations from the commission. Cases that involve substantial imports from Canada or Mexico are sometimes slightly harder for American industries and unions to win because they are covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement.Advertisement"}

To make this film, the director, Douglas Keeve, followed one of the era\u2019s most successful high-fashion designers, Isaac Mizrahi, as he planned his fall 1994 collection. Mr. Keeve\u2019s romantic connection to his subject seems to inform every gorgeous black-and-white frame of 16-millimeter film. This type of character-driven story can make for a riveting movie, and as a filmmaker I am captivated by figures who can draw my camera\u2019s lens in a similarly magnetic way.The editor of Vogue, Anna Wintour, is one of those rare people. So when I had the opportunity to enter her world and follow her work with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, I embraced the challenge of capturing an icon of popular culture. But equally exciting was the prospect of unpacking many complex assumptions that go into our culture\u2019s celebration of fashion, through a combination of v\u00e9rit\u00e9 filmmaking and analytical argument.This Op-Doc goes behind the scenes at the Met and the celebrity-laden gala Ms. Wintour holds there each spring for its Costume Institute.

I think the answer lies somewhere among the stunning works of painting and sculpture inside the Met. Here, works of fashion are interpreted in an art historical context that elevates what we are looking at beyond a consumer good or star vehicle. As I hope you see through the beautiful costumes in this film, ranging from antiquity to the red carpet frocks of Rihanna and Lady Gaga, fashion is certainly capable of serving as art \u2014 if you know where to look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Was America Greatest?", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d His supporters, it turns out, disagree on when that was.The slogan evokes a time when America was stronger and more prosperous. But Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t specify whether he\u2019s expressing nostalgia for the 1950s \u2014 or 10 years ago. That vagueness is reflected by his voters, according to the results of a new survey, conducted online by the digital media and polling company Morning Consult.When asked to select America\u2019s greatest year, Trump supporters offered a wide range of answers, with no distinct pattern. The most popular choice was the year 2000. But 1955, 1960, 1970 and 1985 were also popular. More than 2 percent of Trump\u2019s supporters picked 2015, when Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign began.We asked the Trump campaign to name America\u2019s greatest year, but we haven\u2019t heard back.So, when was the greatest year?Over all, 2000 was the most popular choice, a preference that cut across political party, candidate preference, gender and age. The year\u2019s popularity may partly reflect people\u2019s fondness for round numbers. But many voters explained their choice by referring to a greater sense of security. The Sept. 11 attacks occurred the following year. (An election year also has something for all partisans to grab onto. Bill Clinton was president that year, but George W. Bush won the election to replace him.)Some people, of course, reached farther back into history. The year the Declaration of Independence was signed, 1776, got a few votes. One person chose 1789, the year the Constitution took effect. One person chose 1800. One chose 1860, the year Southern states began to secede from the Union. But most answers were of a more recent vintage.There were partisan patterns in views of America\u2019s greatness. Republicans, over all, recall the late 1950s and the mid-1980s most fondly. Sample explanations: \u201cReagan.\u201d \u201cEconomy was booming.\u201d \u201cNo wars!\u201d \u201cLife was simpler.\u201d \u201cStrong family values.\u201d The distribution of Trump supporters\u2019 greatest years is somewhat similar to the Republican trend, but more widely dispersed over the last 70 years. Supporters of Ted Cruz picked best years that were similar to the party\u2019s trend over all. The sample of John Kasich supporters in the survey was too small to detect any patterns.As a group, Democrats seem to think America\u2019s greatest days were more recent; they were more likely to pick a year in the 1990s, or since 2000. After 2000, their second-most-popular answer was 2016. Sample explanations: \u201cWe\u2019re getting better.\u201d \u201cImproving social justice.\u201d \u201cTechnology.\u201d Even 2008, a year of financial collapse, was pretty popular, perhaps because President Obama was also elected that year. The pattern for supporters of Bernie Sanders was a little different from that of Hillary Clinton supporters: The main difference is that Mr. Sanders\u2019s voters were more likely to pick a year from the 1960s, and more of the Clinton supporters chose best years in the 1990s, when her husband was president.The Morning Consult survey was conducted with help of Lucid, a survey technology firm, over two days last week. The survey, conducted online, consisted of 2,003 interviews with registered voters.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Cruz\u2019s supporters remain seriously frustrated anyway, to the point where they have begun denigrating and demonizing Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, a tactic that can do neither Mr. Cruz nor his party any good.Wisconsin was a big Midwestern contest that provided Mr. Cruz with the opportunity to show he can appeal to a broader constituency than just the hard-line and evangelical conservatives who have been his main strength.White working-class Republicans, reeling from the recession and declining as a proportion of the population, entered this election year driven by that betrayal. Mr. Trump divined their fear and rage. He was there to shout the despicable things other Republicans had merely insinuated, and rewrote the rules of the blame game they invented. He played to the party\u2019s angriest members, and offered a con man\u2019s hope to its most desperate.Kevin Williamson, a correspondent for National Review, which has endorsed Mr. Cruz, wrote last month that it is \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201ca lie\u201d to say \u201cthat the white working class that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside forces. It hasn\u2019t.\u201d Mr. Williamson wrote that these voters have no one to blame for their distress but themselves, and certainly not the Republican establishment.The fight to keep the nomination from Mr. Trump now moves to his home state of New York, whose primary is April 19. Kraig Moss, a Trump supporter, lives in Owego, a town in what Mr. Williamson called \u201chardscrabble white upstate New York\u201d where \u201cthe white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles.\u201dTwo years ago, Mr. Moss\u2019s 24-year-old son Rob was found dead in his bed of a heroin overdose. Last month, as attendees filed into a Trump rally in Boca Raton, Fla., Mr. Moss, dressed in a cowboy hat and boots, played his guitar and sang a song he wrote urging them to vote.Absent any meaningful effort by Republicans in Congress to stem the flow of opioids, Mr. Moss hopes that if Mr. Trump builds the wall, it might keep more drugs from entering the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s my 16th rally,\u201d he said in an interview at the rally. \u201cI\u2019m doing it for my son.\u201dWisconsin suggested that Republicans have begun to understand that Mr. Trump is playing supporters like Mr. Moss for suckers.

To many of these artists and intellectuals \u2014 among them Thomas Mann, Arnold Schoenberg and Bertolt Brecht \u2014 California could feel like a picturesque purgatory in which they were left to idle among palm trees and swimming pools while Europe was being reduced to ashes.Mr. Goerne interwove the Eisler selections with 19th-century songs that traced a lineage going back to the broody Romanticism of Schumann\u2019s \u201cThe Hermit\u201d and \u201cLoneliness\u201d and the chromatic prickliness of Hugo Wolf\u2019s settings of some of the \u201cHarper\u2019s Songs\u201d from Goethe\u2019s \u201cWilhelm Meister\u2019s Apprenticeship,\u201d with their almost masochistic self pity.Bleak?

Asks for Removal of \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label From GE Capital", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 General Electric has asked regulators to lift the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label on GE Capital, saying in a filing on Thursday that its finance arm had shrunk to the point where it no longer met the definition.If successful, GE Capital would be the first financial institution to lose its designation with help from regulators, though the road map for how that process would work is not immediately clear.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a regulatory body created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and led by the Treasury secretary, is responsible for analyzing and designating companies that could take down the banking system in the event of another crisis.The Treasury Department, which leads the regulatory council, said in a statement that the council \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to evaluate developments at any designated nonbank financial company and their potential effect on financial stability.\u201dIt said the council re-examines each of the designations every year and \u201cevaluates whether any changes at the company, or in its regulation or markets, justify a rescission of the designation.\u201cBefore the financial crisis, some of the largest, riskiest nonbank financial companies were not subject to adequate oversight,\u201d the Treasury noted.General Electric filed a \u201crequest for rescission\u201d on Thursday, which states that GE Capital \u201chas substantially reduced its risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to the financial system, and therefore does not pose any conceivable threat to U.S. financial stability.\u201dGE Capital recently received approval to sell its deposit business in the United States to Goldman Sachs. Total assets have shrunk 52 percent, to $265 billion from $549 billion in 2012.Its consumer finance arm, now called Synchrony Financial, was spun off last year. In addition, GE Capital has restructured as a holding company owned entirely by General Electric, with American and British subsidiaries.The company\u2019s remaining businesses \u201cdo not provide a critical function to the economy that could not easily be supported by other entities,\u201d according to the release.At an investor meeting in December, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, was asked about the prospects for GE Capital once the systemically important designation was removed.\u201cLet\u2019s go through the de-designation process; let\u2019s see how the world is working as it pertains to financial services and things like that,\u201d Mr. Immelt said, adding that he thought the shift in investors\u2019 minds would be \u201cIs it as really as much today about how we use it to position our industrial growth as it is necessarily freestanding.\u201dShares of General Electric ended nearly flat in trading on Thursday.A day earlier, MetLife, the country\u2019s biggest life insurer, won a major battle in court against the government, overturning its own \u201csystemically important\u201d designation.Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said in her order that she had upheld arguments that regulators failed to adequately assess MetLife\u2019s vulnerability to extreme financial distress and the potential economic impact of the designation.The Treasury Department has said it is disappointed with the decision, but it has not yet said whether it will appeal. The judge\u2019s full opinion is under seal.The American International Group and Prudential Financial are the other two nonbanks that were given the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label.Appearing on CNBC on Thursday, Peter Hancock, the chief executive of A.I.G., said his company would watch the progress of the MetLife decision if it is appealed.

The Jordanian government\u2019s figure is 1.2 million refugees, mostly Iraqis and Syrians \u2014 and the true number is probably larger. When we think of refugees at all, most of us think of people living in camps. But here in Jordan a vast majority of these transitory souls are living in the community.I was able to spend some time with a Syrian family who moved from a camp into housing in Amman. Abu Emad and his wife welcomed us into their home. Their 10-year-old son, Qusai, has the wisdom of the ages in his eyes, which is heightened by his professorial spectacles. Qusai told us that if he one day becomes a politician, he will try to put his people\u2019s safety before anything else.Abu Emad told me that he loved his hometown, Homs, more than his own eyes and that he dreamed constantly of returning there. He told us the details about the spice market that he ran, the employees he seemed to cherish and the relaxed nature of the neighborhood they lived in. It was clear that they are still shellshocked. Their daughter, Layla, whom we didn\u2019t meet, was 5 when they left. The shelling made her incontinent and left her with post-traumatic stress so bad that she can\u2019t be left alone.Though heavily in debt from medical care for Abu Emad\u2019s diabetes, the family offered us lunch and poured freshly made coffee. The family was expecting cash assistance from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has developed a biometric-triggered system for distributing funds.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Announces Plan for Speech at Vatican, and Clarifications Follow", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont discussed his invitation from the Vatican to participate in a conference on the global economy, calling Pope Francis \"an extraordinary leader\" on the issue of wealth inequality.Mr. Sanders did not initially correct interviewers who suggested that he would meet with the pope, but he later clarified that he had not confirmed whether the two men would actually meet.Further confusion about the trip bubbled up on Friday afternoon when the Vatican press office made clear that it had not issued the invitation, but that it had come from the academy. It said that there was no indication that Mr. Sanders would meet with Francis.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSanders made the first move, for the obvious reasons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Archer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think in a sense he may be going for the Catholic vote, but this is not the Catholic vote, and he should remember that and act accordingly \u2014 not that he will.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut hours later, Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, a senior papal official and the academy\u2019s chancellor, denied that Mr. Sanders had invited himself to the event. He told Reuters that it was his idea to invite the senator.At the end of a week of rising tension between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the Clinton campaign appeared to relish the situation. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, gleefully re-posted a report on Twitter indicating that the Vatican was angered by its dealings with Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders tried to move beyond the controversy and stressed his fondness for the pope and the importance of his visit. In an interview on Friday, he said Pope Francis had played a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofound role in raising consciousness throughout the world, not just within the Catholic community but within all communities.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo me, this a source of real pride and excitement that I have been invited to speak to a major conference at the Vatican on how we can create a world economy that is moral and how we address the massive levels of wealth and income inequality that exist around the world, how we deal with unemployment, how we deal with poverty and how we create an economy that works for all people rather than the few,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.On MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Mr. Sanders explained that while he disagreed with Pope Francis on issues relating to women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and gay rights, he admired the pope for speaking about income inequality and the need for people to help one another.Mr. Sanders also addressed his clashes with Mrs. Clinton this week over their respective qualifications to be president and tried to soften some of the recent rancor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said during a town-hall-style event on NBC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known Hillary Clinton for 25 years.

{"Headline": "A Dodd-Frank Watchdog Still Growls, on a Slightly Tighter Leash", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byOversightAt first glance, two events this week suggest that federal regulators are losing ground against \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions.The 2008 financial crisis revealed that both banks and financial firms that were not banks \u2014 like the American International Group \u2014 could pose a devastating risk to the financial system and the wider economy. Congress\u2019s primary response came in 2010 with the passage of the Dodd-Frank reform law, a sweeping bill that gave regulators broad powers, including a powerful new tool. They could identify nonbanks that were \u201csystemically important,\u201d and then subject them to stricter regulation.Its effect was immediate. Regulators for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who had recently taken residence in the insurer\u2019s offices, had to leave the premises.Another big score for the industry?The week may give the impression of a rollback, but a wider view shows that Dodd-Frank is mostly intact \u2014 and exacting slow, steady results.The act has stamped out many risky practices. The largest banks are operating with substantially higher levels of capital \u2014 the financial foundation of a bank. The largest banks appear to be slowly shrinking.Right now, General Electric can actually be seen as a success story for regulators. Its lending operation slimmed down \u2014 it slashed its assets by more than half, or over $250 billion \u2014 in response to being designated as systemically important.As for MetLife, there is some credence to its argument that it\u2019s not a threat to the financial system. It has nearly $900 billion of assets, which makes it a large firm \u2014 bigger than, say, Lehman Brothers in 2008. But MetLife also contends that insurance is a more stable business that is not as vulnerable to the sort of runs that can take down a bank.Notably, the federal court ruling probably does not give traditional banks, like JPMorgan Chase, a pathway to shed stricter regulations.The Fed has required the largest banks to have significantly higher levels of capital than smaller lenders. But the Fed does not need to go through the Financial Stability Oversight Council when identifying which traditional banks have to operate under these more stringent requirements.Still, the true impact of the MetLife court ruling won\u2019t be known until it is unsealed, as early as next week.Even a ruling that disagrees with the council\u2019s methods, rather than its right to identify systemically risky firms, could substantially restrain the council and embolden the anti-overhaul forces to strike elsewhere.House Republicans, for instance, have said that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the entity that designates nonbanks, is not transparent and has too much power, a criticism they have also made of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another entity set up by Dodd-Frank (to protect consumers against unfair lending practices).A ruling that requires the council to jump through a lot more hoops \u2014 like performing cost analyses \u2014 could slow it down considerably. That might not seem like such a big deal now, when markets appear to be relatively stable.But imagine a situation like the lead-up to 2008. A.I.G. placed huge and risky bets over a relatively short period, rapidly turning itself into a danger to the system. The council, operating under new restrictions meant to slow it down, might not be able to stop another A.I.G. before it\u2019s too late.And then the battles over \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d would be right back where they started.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pulling Away From Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Is Turning to the Fall", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 After months of trying to sideline an unexpectedly deft and well-financed liberal opponent, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday won a series of primaries that freed her to present herself as the de facto victor of the Democratic nominating fight and gave her the impetus to shift focus decisively toward the November election.Now all but certain to clinch her party\u2019s nomination, Mrs. Clinton will continue to face the criticism of her party rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But she is expected to move swiftly to claim an early advantage against the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump. Her advisers and allies say she will spend the coming weeks honing her message for the general election, and stepping up fund-raising that has lagged in the face of Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenge.\u201cWith your help, we\u2019re going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of 1,300 here after she took the stage to \u201cEye of the Tiger.\u201d \u201cAnd we will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together.\u201dAfter a landslide win in New York last week, Mrs. Clinton had already begun to treat Mr. Sanders as a greatly diminished threat, concentrating her fire on Mr. Trump and, to a lesser degree, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Her victories in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Delaware on Tuesday will only accelerate that shift.In recent days, she has sharpened her pitch about the general election\u2019s stakes, heading off Republican attacks on her record as secretary of state under President Obama and delivering a more forceful message about the economy and the need to create jobs and lift wages.\u201cImagine a tomorrow where hard work is honored, families are supported, streets are safe and communities are strong, and where love trumps hate,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday night, drawing applause at her play on Mr. Trump\u2019s name.Mrs. Clinton is not expected to publicly pressure Mr. Sanders to quit the race. Clinton advisers say any efforts to muscle him out could backfire, angering his supporters and Mr. Sanders, both of which Mrs. Clinton praised Tuesday night \u201cfor challenging us to get unaccountable money out of our politics.\u201dBut a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy, Priorities USA Action, may start running general election ads even before the nominating contest ends.Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s chief strategist, said the group might run ads against Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz, \u201cdepending on how the Republican primary develops and whether they decide to launch attacks against Hillary.\u201dIn coming weeks, Mrs. Clinton will campaign in states with looming primaries, but she will also recharge and spend time in New York plotting a general-election strategy with advisers.\u201cShe needs to be smart and calculated and prepare herself for a tough general election, and knowing her, she will be,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, a friend and adviser who worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department.After months of focus on the 2,383 delegates needed for the Democratic Party nomination, her campaign has begun to analyze the Electoral College, working out potential races against Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. And the campaign will begin polling in traditional battleground states like Ohio and Florida.But it will also pore over data in traditionally Republican states like Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia that could be in play, particularly if Mr. Trump is the nominee, and focus on demographics beyond the Democratic primary electorate.\u201cRealistically, the most important part in all of this are white working-class women,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign who is now advising Priorities, citing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emphasis on issues like equal pay for women and an increase in the minimum wage.10 PhotosSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who campaigned alongside Mrs. Clinton in his state, said she must focus on how best to connect to a broader electorate that is in what he called a \u201crevolutionary mood,\u201d alluding to how Mr. Sanders has energized supporters. \u201cYou are not going to win this general election by proposing incremental changes,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, adding that he hoped Mrs. Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t shy away from proposing some big ideas to try to reorder the country, to the benefit of those that are hurting.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign vowed Tuesday to remain in the fight through the California primary on June 7, and perhaps until the party\u2019s convention in July. As word of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victories rolled in on Tuesday night, he gave a defiant speech in West Virginia, predicting he would win the state when it votes May 10.Mrs. Clinton, who doggedly remained in the 2008 primary contest against Barack Obama until June despite his insurmountable delegate lead and Democratic calls for her to bow out, has said she will not call on Mr. Sanders to withdraw, but she has bristled at the implication that he could overcome her big leads in both pledged delegates and the popular vote.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides and allies are pressuring Mr. Sanders to run on issues rather than continuing to attack Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street or her previous support for global trade deals \u2014 attacks that Republicans are likely to use in the fall.\u201cIf he tones down the rhetoric and continues to fight, he\u2019ll go out on a very high note with a lot of people, including me, thinking he did a great service to American democracy,\u201d said Edward G. Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, who supports Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut if he keeps it up, it could be brutal.\u201dMr. Sanders, whose sole win on Tuesday came in Rhode Island, did not attack Mrs. Clinton directly in his remarks on Tuesday night, but argued insistently that he would be a superior general-election candidate. As voters went to the polls earlier in the day, the Sanders campaign sent out a fund-raising email with an image of Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton, at Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding, and accused Clinton allies of being \u201ctraitors\u201d in their treatment of Mr. Sanders.\u201cIf we are sitting here and there\u2019s no sort of mathematical way to do it, we will be upfront about that,\u201d he said.Democrats supporting Mrs. Clinton have pointed to Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Chuck Schumer of New York as potential peacemakers, should the Sanders campaign keep up its pointed attacks on Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI\u2019m going to be optimistic and say it won\u2019t be necessary, but all of us are friends with Bernie and we\u2019d pick up the phone and talk to him at any time,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who is supporting Mrs. Clinton.But Mrs. Clinton would do well to begin \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d to Mr. Sanders, said David Axelrod, a former senior strategist for the Obama campaign.\u201cIt seems certain Bernie will run through the last primaries, which is inconvenient and costly,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, when you\u2019re the winner, you can afford to be big and Hillary should.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Philadelphia, and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "Obama Outlines Goals Tempered by 8 Years of Foreign Policy Lessons", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byHANOVER, Germany \u2014 The speech that Barack Obama delivered to a sea of Germans in Berlin eight years ago underscored his impatience to change the world.On Monday, at the conclusion of his trip to the Middle East and Europe, Mr. Obama delivered another address in Germany. This visit, however, was punctuated by little of the soaring eloquence that expressed Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious foreign policy aspirations. Instead, the president, recognizing the limitations in realizing those aspirations, spoke in more measured tones as he gently urged allies to do more to defend themselves and solve their own problems.Mr. Obama can certainly claim some foreign policy achievements. He restored diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than half a century and concluded a nuclear agreement with Iran. He also largely made good on his 2008 promises to get American troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan.Yet as the trip demonstrated, there are situations in which he has accepted a more incremental approach.In Europe, the president pressed for small victories where they could be found. He lent his credibility to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s effort to keep Britain in the European Union, and he campaigned for reaching an American-European trade deal, even as he conceded that possible ratification would take more time than he had left in his presidency.In Saudi Arabia, the president sought to reassure an ally that was angered over the nuclear accord and feared an American tilt toward Iran. But he also said that the Gulf countries should rely less on the United States for their security. He suggested to King Salman that Saudi Arabia should consider engaging diplomatically with Iran.And in the speech on Monday, Mr. Obama announced the latest move in his step-by-step approach in Syria, saying he would increase the number of military personnel, including Special Forces, to fight the Islamic State in that country. The president said he would add 250 military personnel in the hopes of cementing what he said was progress in pushing back the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from territory that it had held.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be leading the fight on the ground,\u201d Mr. Obama said before meeting with the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Italy to discuss the situation in Syria. \u201cBut they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces.\u201dMr. Obama and his top aides concede that his incremental approach in Syria is unlikely to rapidly \u201cdestroy\u201d the Islamic State \u2014 certainly not in the nine months that he has left in office. They say it will take many years of steady, concerted action by a coalition of nations to rid the world of the terror groups in Syria and Iraq.\u201cThe point that the president made in the Berlin speech is that when the world stands together in collective, multilateral action, we will be able to deal with the challenges that confront us,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser and an architect of his approach.Mr. Rhodes argued that the president\u2019s reluctance to act alone had served him \u2014 and the world \u2014 well. Actions by coalitions of nations, led by the United States, have helped beat back Ebola, turn the global economy away from the brink of collapse, and reach deals on climate change and Iran\u2019s nuclear program, he said.After Mr. Obama\u2019s nearly eight years in the Oval Office, the 2008 speech in Berlin can be seen as a kind of road map to the foreign policy he sought to put into practice. As he marched toward claiming the White House, he spoke of securing nuclear material, bolstering European defenses, reasserting diplomacy as a centerpiece of American power, closing down unpopular wars and \u201cextending our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world.\u201dJust months after he took office in 2009, that vision of a new kind of foreign policy led the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award Mr. Obama the Nobel Peace Prize. In its citation, the committee said it had sought for 108 years to \u201cstimulate precisely that international policy and those attitudes for which Obama is now the world\u2019s leading spokesman.\u201dIn his acceptance speech, Mr. Obama acknowledged being surprised by the honor because \u201cI am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage.\u201dYet even in the 2008 speech, Mr. Obama recognized that \u201cthe road ahead will be long.\u201d And since then, he has increasingly borrowed from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who said the arc of history bent toward justice, to describe the kind of slow progress he wants to make abroad.In the speech on Monday, Mr. Obama said Europe was weakening because the international institutions in which he had expressed so much faith almost a decade ago were under siege \u2014 by migrants fleeing regional wars, Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, a slow economic recovery and mistrust among allies.\u201cDangerous forces do threaten to pull the world backwards, and our progress is not inevitable,\u201d Mr. Obama conceded on Monday. \u201cWe are not immune from the forces of change around the world.\u201dMr. Obama spent much of the European part of his trip urging the British people to vote to remain in the European Union when a referendum is held on June 23. He said repeatedly over the past week that a withdrawal would undercut Britain\u2019s influence and weaken the democratic alliance binding Europe together.In the speech on Monday, Mr. Obama went further, telling the Germans in the audience that they, too, must resist the temptation to go it alone in the fight against the Islamic State, the push for economic security and the need to confront huge new flows of migration.\u201cIf we do not solve these problems, you start seeing those who would try to exploit those fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cIf a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic free-market Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question the progress that\u2019s been made over the last several decades,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cthen we can\u2019t expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Linton, Steadfast \u201980s Wall Street Banker, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byRobert E. Linton, a prominent Wall Street executive who led the swashbuckling investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert in the years before it imploded in scandal but who was largely untainted himself, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 90.The cause was heart failure, his son Jeffrey said.During his tenure atop Drexel in the early 1980s, Mr. Linton oversaw the firm\u2019s rapid expansion into one of the nation\u2019s biggest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 investment banks. At its height, Drexel pioneered the junk bond industry and came to symbolize the 1980s \u201cgreed is good\u201d mentality on Wall Street, inspiring movies and books that detailed the risk-taking of that era.Eventually, however, the federal authorities suspected that something worse than greed was afoot.In 1989, prosecutors filed six felony counts of mail and securities fraud against the firm, which pleaded guilty and later dissolved. Michael R. Milken, the \u201cJunk Bond King\u201d and a central figure in the case, also admitted to crimes, providing the capstone to what was then the largest criminal prosecution in Wall Street history.Although Mr. Linton was a board member during much of that period, he was no longer C.E.O. And Mr. Linton, who was never accused of wrongdoing in the case, had previously denounced some of Wall Street\u2019s excesses.Robert Edward Linton was born on May 19, 1925, in Manhattan. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and forgoing college, he enlisted in the Army in 1943 and served in World War II, attaining the rank of second lieutenant in the Army Air Forces.After the war, Mr. Linton returned to New York, raising his family in Rye. At the time of his death, he had homes in Manhattan and Purchase, N.Y.Besides his son Jeffrey, he is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Margot Tishman; two daughters, Roberta L. Bennett and Elizabeth M. Linton; another son, Thomas; a sister, Marion Benson; and five grandchildren.In 1946, Mr. Linton joined a predecessor to Drexel, then a small brokerage house, as a runner delivering stock certificates around Wall Street. More than three decades later, he was named chairman and chief executive. He was also a director of the New York Stock Exchange and led a Wall Street trade group, known then as the Securities Industry Association.Whether as a shrewd businessman or a prudent steward of the economy \u2014 or both \u2014 Mr. Linton cried foul. Congress repealed Glass\u2013Steagall in 1999, opening the door to the sort of megabanks that ultimately took billions of dollars in bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis, an outcome that arguably vindicated Mr. Linton.At Drexel, it was the junk bond business that drove much of the growth. Drexel designed the instruments to finance companies that were riskier bets. For a time, these bonds outperformed investment-grade securities as they fueled a wave of corporate takeovers.But when one of the firm\u2019s clients, Ivan F. Boesky, was swept into a federal investigation, so was Drexel. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States attorney in Manhattan at the time, led a nearly three-year investigation that focused on the firm\u2019s insider trading and stock manipulation. In addition to pleading guilty, Drexel paid the government $650 million in penalties, a record at the time.Mr. Linton, who remained friendly with Mr. Milken over the years, was not charged or accused of wrongdoing, though the New York Stock Exchange barred him from associating with any member firms of the exchange for one year, saying he had inadequately supervised employees.Despite his prominent role on Wall Street, Mr. Linton largely avoided the spotlight.As a rival banker told The Times in 1977, \u201cBob has been married to the same lady for 25 years, has had the same secretary for 22 years since he became an officer of his house, has a 14-year-old dog,\u201d four children and \u201clives quietly in Rye.\u201d In other words, the executive said, he was a \u201csteady sort who gets things done without much fuss.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Debt Deadline Looms With Washington Still Haggling", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byIn December, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan instructed lawmakers to find a \u201cresponsible solution\u201d to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis in the first three months of this year, giving the island plenty of time to prepare for a May 1 deadline on a $422 million debt payment.So much for that.That deadline is imminent, but Republicans in the House and Democrats in the administration are still haggling over the terms of a bill to rescue Puerto Rico. Missing the payment risks further destabilizing its shrunken economy. And there are concerns that the passage of any legislation could be delayed until the island nears the tipping point of its debt woes: a $2 billion debt payment due on July 1.The May 1 payment consists mainly of principal and interest due from Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank, a uniquely powerful institution that has played a leading role in the island\u2019s borrowing and financial affairs for decades. Its activities are so numerous and critical that analysts have worried for months that the bank\u2019s failure would have untold ripple effects across the island. Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, who has warned about defaults for months, has expressed frustration with Washington\u2019s inability to act quickly.\u201cOn Monday there will be a default,\u201d he said on Wednesday. The bank has until the close of business on Monday, since the May 1 due date falls on a Sunday.But the bigger issue may be that second, larger debt bill due in July, roughly $800 million of which is constitutionally guaranteed, giving the payment of it legal priority even over the funding of essential public services, such as police patrols, ambulances or drinking water. Investors who hold the guaranteed debt say they are prepared to fight to enforce their legal rights, no matter how much it may shock and anger the island\u2019s residents.\u201cThere\u2019s too much discord,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Municipal Market Analytics, referring to the rancor over the rescue bill. \u201cThis was supposed to be a very controlled process, and it just got out of hand.\u201dWhen Mr. Ryan ordered debt relief for Puerto Rico, he may not have known just how intractable the differences were going to be \u2014 not only between Democrats and Republicans, but also among certain classes of creditors, some of whom are intent on avoiding the sort of losses that Detroit bondholders were forced to bear after that city went bankrupt in 2013.In addition to lobbying Congress, some of the bondholders are sponsoring television ads that depict the rescue of Puerto Rico as an odious taxpayer bailout. And some other creditors are in quiet talks with representatives of the Puerto Rican government, testing the waters for a sweeping negotiated debt reduction that might obviate congressional action.Despite the power and importance of the Government Development Bank, its debts are not backed by any taxing power or constitutional guarantee. If it defaults on the looming $422 million payment, its creditors have little legal recourse. And much of the bank\u2019s debt, in the form of municipal bonds, is held by more than 100 credit unions on the island \u2014 financial institutions that tend to serve mom-and-pop savers in Puerto Rico\u2019s poor and remote communities.\u201cThe island\u2019s credit unions represent the nest egg of nearly 1,000,000 Puerto Rican families (one of every four Puerto Ricans) that trust their livelihood and savings in these financial institutions,\u201d said the credit unions\u2019 primary regulator in a statement released last year, when the sector held Government Development Bank debt with a face value of slightly more than $500 million, according to regulatory records. The regulator\u2019s spokesman did not answer messages Thursday.Historically, the credit unions were required to invest only in very safe assets. But in 2009 their regulators made an exception, allowing them to buy and hold riskier bonds, as long as the bonds were issued by some branch of the Puerto Rican government. The change gave the Government Development Bank a new way to raise money, by selling its bonds to the credit unions.As a result, those institutions wound up with outsize exposure to the bank, which itself was found insolvent last year by Puerto Rico\u2019s Commissioner of Financial Institutions. Officials on the island have been seeking a way to protect the credit unions from the bank\u2019s expected default, but it is not clear what the mechanism would be, or whether it could even be put in place in time.A payment default by the Government Development Bank would add to the list of extreme measures that Puerto Rico has undertaken to stretch its dwindling cash while waiting for Congress to enact its rescue package. It has already removed assets from its workers\u2019 compensation pool and public pension system to pay bills, taken cash from low-priority bonds to make payments due on high-priority bonds, and extended a highway privatization, giving up future toll revenue in exchange for upfront payments of $115 million.This group of bondholders, mainly mutual funds and other financial institutions, has emerged as one of four main creditor groups with a stake in the rescue legislation.Another major group consists of bond insurers, known as \u201cmonolines,\u201d which have insured about one-fifth of Puerto Rico\u2019s total $72 billion of outstanding bonds. Their backing promised to make the affected investors whole every time Puerto Rico defaulted on an insured bond. Along with the first group, the monolines are deeply concerned about the methods the rescue legislation would use to ensure that different types of creditors are treated fairly.A third creditor group consists of financial institutions that bought roughly $3.5 billion of general-obligation bonds that Puerto Rico sold in 2014, its last borrowing before losing virtually all market access after ratings agencies downgraded it to junk status. The 2014 bonds were purchased eagerly by hedge funds because they promised a high yield and because general-obligation bonds are explicitly guaranteed by Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution.Holders of this block now argue that Congress should not interfere with Puerto Rico\u2019s constitutional promises; the Treasury Department has argued that none of Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds should be exempt from the bill\u2019s restructuring framework.The fourth major creditor group consists of investors who hold so-called Cofina bonds, which were sold from 2006 onward, backed by a dedicated sales tax. These bonds were advertised as virtually default-proof, but as Puerto Rico\u2019s troubles have mounted over the last year, the Cofina investors have grown worried that the island may decide to divert their sales tax revenue to pay some other creditor group, such as the general-obligation bondholders, who say the constitution gives them first calling rights on all the island\u2019s resources.The Cofina bondholders\u2019 secret weapon is an agreement that the bonds will \u201caccelerate\u201d in the event of a payment default, meaning that instead of waiting for a 30-year maturity, the holders would immediately be entitled their full present value. This feature makes the Cofina bondholders the only group that would actually benefit from a default on their holdings \u2014 and a wild card in the deck that Congress keeps shuffling.Advertisement"}

Last year, nearly 1.7 million people called 911 for medical help, the most since humans started answering telephones. On average that\u2019s about one call every 20 seconds.On the evening of Feb. 25, a radio message came to 911 dispatchers from an ambulance in the Bronx:\u201cOut of service.\u201dIt was the first of many such messages that night, all of them ambulances that signed off from the 911 system and returned to their stations. This was not a strike or a job action, and the people calling from the ambulances were not city employees. They were paramedics and emergency medical technicians employed by TransCare, a private company that provided ambulance coverage to large parts of the Bronx and some areas in Manhattan. TransCare had gone bankrupt.By the end of the evening, 27 TransCare ambulances had been pulled from the street. \u201cThey dropped off the face of the earth,\u201d said Israel Miranda, president of the union representing the city\u2019s paramedics and emergency medical technicians, Local 2507 of District Council 37.For now, the city has patched the problem, though the medics are starting to become frayed from the extra hours or the trips to boroughs outside their regular assignments, and warm weather, the busiest time of the year for medical emergencies, is coming up. Mr. Miranda\u2019s union \u2014 with support from, among others, Elizabeth Crowley, the chairwoman of the City Council\u2019s fire and criminal justice committee, and the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer \u2014 is arguing that the use of private ambulances is a false economy, and that the city should hire enough of its own workers.If it goes too far to call this a crisis, the episode disclosed a vulnerability that most members of the public did not realize existed.Over the next five years, the department\u2019s strategic plan calls for a shift to include more coordinated responses to medical emergencies. As things now stand, the budget commission\u2019s report said, \u201cThe F.D.N.Y. does not efficiently address its most common job: responding to medical emergencies.\u201dGreater efficiency in the Fire Department has long been the stuff of budget officials\u2019 daydreams, but they have rarely made much headway. Tradition-bound, the department enjoyed broad public support long before the valor and sacrifice of firefighters and their leaders during the attacks of Sept. 11. If there were ever a poll of the most popular civil servants, firefighters might very well win in a landslide.The Emergency Medical Service, if more in public demand, is not so potent a political force. Mayor Bill de Blasio recently increased its budget to help cut response times in the Bronx, which happens to be the fastest growing county in New York State. When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was in office, the city made an arrangement with private hospitals that permitted them to operate their own ambulances within the city\u2019s 911 network, and many chose to contract with companies like TransCare. From the city\u2019s perspective, this saved some of the expense of running a fleet of ambulances. Other private operators have failed in the past, but the TransCare collapse \u2014 the loss of 81 tours, and 200 medical workers \u2014 was of a new scale. Joe Conzo, a city emergency medical technician in the Bronx for 19 years and now a union vice president, offered a sobering comparison.\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d Mr. Conzo said, \u201cif an entire police precinct disappeared in the middle of the night?\u201dAdvertisement"}

It would be the first new precinct in the city since 2013, and bring to 78 the number of precincts citywide. A location for it had yet to be found.But, as in January, the message Mr. de Blasio sought to deliver on Tuesday was one of fiscal responsibility, cognizant of potential downward economic trends in the city and beyond. Or, as it was described in a summary document: a blueprint for \u201cprogressive, honest, responsible government.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be very balanced in our approach, very careful, very cautious,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said.\u201cIt is spring, and you have allergies in spring,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said when asked if he had a cold.Officials had previously said the mayor had stripped the funding for that work and decided to delay it; amid criticism, he pledged to accelerate the project.Over all, the executive budget included an increase of 3.7 percent in city spending compared with the final budget approved last year. The mayor\u2019s current proposal must still be negotiated with and approved by the City Council.One hurdle already cleared since January was the looming cuts in state contributions to the City University of New York and the city\u2019s Medicaid costs, proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, but discarded in the final state budget deal.Mr. de Blasio never invoked the name of the governor, with whom he is locked in a bitter feud. Yet Mr. Cuomo was a recurring presence: The mayor repeatedly criticized the state for not making good on financial commitments or reducing the amount of financial support it gives the city. Mr. de Blasio referred to the state\u2019s actions as alarming and a danger to the city.\u201cGod forbid there\u2019s bad times,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cThe state will be absolutely unaccountable to the people of New York City.\u201dMr. de Blasio highlighted the continued growth of the city\u2019s economy but raised concerns about a decline in tax revenues, saying his administration had focused on finding savings at city agencies. The budget includes roughly $1 billion in savings for the 2017 fiscal year from measures like reducing office space, refinancing debt and, at the Environmental Protection Department, switching to natural gas from diesel.After the presentation, the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, issued a lukewarm statement, praising the buildup of reserve funds but criticizing the funding levels for programs aimed at young people and immigrants, as well as the plan for the city\u2019s hospitals. The plan, she said, \u201cto close the Health and Hospitals operating gap is contingent on substantial state and federal cooperation, which has not yet been assured.\u201dCarol Kellermann, president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, said the mayor appeared to be sending mixed messages. \u201cRight now everything is great; we\u2019re going to build a swimming pool and animal shelters and a new police precinct,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, gee, down the road we have to be worried.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Long Island Is Both Hostile Territory and Fertile Ground for Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byBETHPAGE, N.Y. \u2014 On Long Island, many remember Donald J. Trump from before he was a reality television star, a presidential candidate or a serial provocateur. He was the builder of shining towers just west over the horizon in the city. The shrewd buyer of New Jersey casinos. The can-do tycoon who fixed up Central Park\u2019s ice skating rink when the chuckleheads downtown could not.\u201cHe\u2019s like the godfather of New York,\u201d said Carl Pisani, a construction worker who was among those who came to see Mr. Trump speak here last week, packing into an old aircraft factory where Mr. Pisani said he had once helped build F-14s for the Navy. \u201cHe\u2019s going to fix everything.\u201dAs Mr. Trump looks for a blowout win in next week\u2019s New York primary, one that could put him back on track to winning an outright majority of delegates to the Republican convention in July, he will be counting on Long Island, a quintessential American suburb and a power base for New York\u2019s Republicans.Yet Long Island looms as a test of his broader appeal to suburban Republicans, a crucial constituency in national elections, but one that has turned against Mr. Trump in states like Iowa, North Carolina and Virginia. Demographically speaking, Long Island is hostile territory and Mr. Trump\u2019s breadbasket.The densely settled bedroom communities of Nassau County are some of the wealthiest and best educated in the United States, home to stockbrokers and accountants, the kind of place where he has struggled in earlier nominating contests.But there are potential Trump strongholds farther from the city, where parents have withdrawn their children from Common Core-inspired testing at some of the highest rates in the country, and along Long Island\u2019s southern shore, where blue-collar towns still bear scars from the Great Recession.\u201cI just think it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d said Bill Dickhut, an auto service consultant and Republican who lives in the Suffolk County town of Patchogue.His first memory of Mr. Trump, he said, was when the developer bought the New Jersey Generals, a team in the short-lived United States Football League. But he most liked Mr. Trump\u2019s business experience.\u201cThe economy is really struggling,\u201d Mr. Dickhut said. \u201cThe last eight years, it\u2019s been an abortion.\u201dParts of Long Island are also ripe territory for Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on illegal immigration, an issue that remains potent here. Republicans here readily acknowledge that immigration has had a transformative effect on their communities and, for some longtime residents, an unsettling one.So many Salvadorans have moved to the Long Island town of Brentwood in recent decades that the country has a consulate there. Debates over day laborers, some of them illegal immigrants, have rived towns and villages throughout the island. Last fall, a federal judge struck down a law in the wealthy Nassau County town of Oyster Bay aimed at stopping day laborers from gathering in public places to seek work.Rudy Weber, a real estate developer who was strolling through Oyster Bay last week, said he was leaning toward Mr. Trump because he saw him as \u201can extreme of change.\u201d Mr. Weber called himself \u201ca bit of a hypocrite\u201d on immigration issues, because he employs recent immigrants in his business. (All of them are in the country legally, he added.) But Mr. Weber said he appreciated Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for a tighter policy at the border.\u201cThere has been too much, too quick,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cConsequently it\u2019s slowing down our school systems, crowding our housing, depleting our resources for our hospitals.\u201dMr. Trump will make his second Long Island stop of the campaign on Thursday in Patchogue, where he will speak at a fund-raiser for the Suffolk County Republican Party. The choice of location has drawn protests from immigration activists: The event will be held at a nightclub down the street from where Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, was fatally stabbed by a gang of teenagers eight years ago, a turning point in the island\u2019s debate over immigration.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.John Jay LaValle, the Republican chairman in Suffolk County, said there was no connection between the two. The nightclub was booked months before Mr. Trump agreed to speak. Mr. LaValle said he expected a huge turnout at the fund-raiser, which normally draws just a few hundred local party activists.\u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere without people coming up to me and saying, \u2018I\u2019m a Trump supporter,\u2019 \u201d Mr. LaValle said. \u201cI can\u2019t even go to the supermarket.\u201dLast Wednesday, Mr. Trump arrived at the former Grumman aircraft factory here, the symbolic heart of Long Island\u2019s departed manufacturing economy. The building now houses vast soundstages for film and television production. Thousands of Long Islanders \u2014 families, professionals in office slacks, tattooed men in work boots \u2014 trudged through a half-mile-long security perimeter to experience Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of political entertainment.Nick Makropoulos, 61, a Greek immigrant who lives in Massapequa and owns a laundry in Queens, said he had come to hear Mr. Trump talk about the economy. He had friends who had spent years looking for work, Mr. Makropoulos said. He credited Mr. Trump with helping turn a rail yard on Manhattan\u2019s West Side into a string of apartment towers.\u201cHe\u2019s from Queens. He\u2019s a New York guy. And he\u2019s a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Makropoulos said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a billionaire if you\u2019re stupid.\u201dThe passion of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters has led Republican leaders on Long Island to embrace him, even while the party\u2019s leaders in Washington and elsewhere look for ways to deny him the nomination.Republicans have long controlled most or all of Long Island\u2019s State Senate seats, a powerful voting bloc that routinely delivers additional school funding and property tax relief to the region, even in lean years. A strong turnout for Mr. Trump next Tuesday could help the party in a crucial down-ballot race scheduled for the same day: an election to replace Dean G. Skelos, formerly the top-ranking Republican in the narrowly divided State Senate, who was convicted of corruption in December.Mr. LaValle has endorsed Mr. Trump, as has the powerful Republican chairman in Nassau County, Joseph N. Mondello, giving Mr. Trump the support of two of the strongest Republican turnout operations in the state.In an interview, Mr. Mondello, who has been the party\u2019s Nassau chairman for more than three decades, pronounced himself happy that \u201call of the politicians are as nervous as anything.\u201dPolls suggest that Mr. Trump will win New York, buoyed by his local roots and a message on trade that resonates deeply in places, particularly upstate, that have suffered badly from the loss of manufacturing jobs. But some said Mr. Trump was more redolent of the island\u2019s past than its present. The official unemployment rate is below 5 percent, the economy now depends more on financial services and technology than Pentagon contracts, and Suffolk is run by a Democratic county executive who has expanded translation services for non-English speakers.\u201cA successful businessman \u2014 that\u2019s probably the first thought of most Long Islanders. But now I think people have much more particular views of him,\u201d Kevin S. Law, the president of the Long Island Association, an influential business group, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cNow there are people out here who can\u2019t stand him.\u201dThose people are not hard to find. During rush hour at Pennsylvania Station on Monday, as Wall Street workers and legal assistants lined up for their trains home, a mention of Mr. Trump brought a furrowed brow. Some Republicans said he was not presidential enough. Others rued his descent into tabloid mudslinging.Bob Walley, 54, a financial services executive from Northport, said he wished there were a more reasonable candidate on the ballot next week.\u201cEveryone goes to the end of the spectrum, it seems,\u201d said Mr. Walley, a Republican. \u201cI want someone who is levelheaded, with the best team, who can get some real economic policy.\u201dHe thought a moment more.\u201cI\u2019m maybe a not-Trump voter,\u201d Mr. Walley concluded.Nate Schweber contributed reporting from Oyster Bay and Patchogue, N.Y.Advertisement"}

Fina helped popularize bridal registries, and its Park Avenue store was a destination for Manhattan elites. It provided silver for John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration festivities and catered to the likes of Frank Sinatra and Lennox Lewis.But with foot traffic falling more than 80 percent in the last decade, the writing on the wall became clear: If you can\u2019t beat Amazon, join Amazon.On April 16, Michael C. Fina, which had sales of $16 million last year, will close its sole brick-and-mortar store, laying off about 20 workers and bringing to an end an 81-year run in Manhattan.Instead, the retailer is moving entirely online, including teaming with Amazon.com as part of a planned revamping of the e-commerce giant\u2019s wedding registry service.\u201cThe initial reaction was definitely: \u2018What are you, nuts? How do you have a retail business, and no store?\u2019\u201d said Steven Fina, 35, current president and the grandson of the retailer\u2019s founder.\u201cBut we\u2019ve seen in our own lives that the way we shop has changed,\u201d he said.Michael C. Fina is hardly the first retailer to buckle to the ever-mounting shift of shopping to the web. But the company is one of the most storied retailers to take its business online-only as a way to survive.The luxury store\u2019s deal with Amazon provides a glimpse into one way the online retail giant is bolstering its luxury offerings. Michael C. Fina\u2019s wedding registry page on the new site will offer high-end brands, like Baccarat and Buccellati, that have so far been loath to make their goods officially available on Amazon.The partnership also illustrates how deeply Amazon has woven itself into the business of independent merchants. In recent years, the company has experienced huge growth in a service it calls Fulfillment by Amazon, in which independent sellers pay Amazon to hold and ship their products, which extends to customers the fast delivery benefits of Amazon\u2019s Prime membership.It is unclear how the Michael C. Fina brands and products will stand out on the sprawling site. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment about Michael C. Fina, but provided an invitation to an event on April 12 in New York to introduce the new wedding registry site.The invitation said the new site would provide gift ideas in 15 categories, including flatware, cookware, home d\u00e9cor and appliances. The site will feature collections of products including Le Creuset cookware sets, Sonos speaker systems and Black & Decker tools.For Michael C. Fina, going online-only was a difficult yet inevitable choice, Mr. Fina said. The retailer already operates an e-commerce site, but it can take up to 72 hours for a product to be shipped.\u201cIn this day and age, we recognize the fact that was too long,\u201d he said. Amazon has told him that its fulfillment centers will be able to ship an order in as little as two hours. Mr. Fina also said he expected shipping costs to fall by as much as 50 percent, because of Amazon\u2019s economies of scale.Shan-Lyn Ma, founder of Zola.com, said that because couples in the United States were marrying much later than ever, and because they increasingly lived with their partners before tying the knot, their wedding gift needs had shifted away from the housewares and appliances that traditionally went toward setting up a first home.\u201cCouples are really starting to value experiences rather than straight wedding products you might have seen in our mothers\u2019 and grandmothers\u2019 wedding registries,\u201d Ms. Ma said.On Zola.com, couples can list hiking trips, hot air balloon rides and food delivery subscriptions, as well as funds for puppies, honeymoons and even fertility treatments. Zola, started in 2013 by Ms. Ma, a former executive at Gilt, the flash-sales site, has also spent the past year courting Casper mattresses, Sonos wireless audio systems and other brands popular among young adults.But she has since realized that many couples want to add a few traditional items into their wedding registry mix. And a partnership with Michael C. Fina, she said, gave Zola access to brands that the site might have trouble courting.\u201cBaccarat, Georg Jensen: Michael C. Fina has longstanding relationships with brands that we don\u2019t currently offer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of high-low mixing.\u201dMr. Fina said that the retailer\u2019s merchants, marketing team, graphic designers and other back-office employees would largely keep their jobs. Most of the job losses would occur on the sales floor, he said, and the retailer would assist those laid off in finding new jobs in retailing. The company told its employees on Monday.\u201cThis was the most difficult part of our decision,\u201d said Mr. Fina, who runs the retailer with his two brothers and a cousin. \u201cSome of these people have worked for us for decades; they\u2019ve been so loyal.\u201dHe added: \u201cBut we\u2019re doing this because this is what our customers are telling us.

{"Headline": "Automakers Revisit Tactics That Hurt Them Before Recession", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byWheelsWhen the car industry collapsed in the recession, automakers pulled back sharply on aggressive leasing deals and other financial incentives that had artificially increased their sales for years.But now, with carmakers under pressure to maintain last year\u2019s record numbers, they are once again turning to the same tactics that got them into trouble a decade ago.Automakers are offering increasing discounts on economy cars and luxury models alike, relying more on sales to fleets like rental-car companies and bloating dealers\u2019 inventories. More and more auto loans are being stretched out over longer periods of time.But there could be a harsh payback in the future. Automakers that rely heavily on leases end up taking the vehicles back in three or four years and selling them as used \u2014 often at big discounts.\u201cManufacturer incentives are at a dangerous level,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. Pumping up sales through profit-eating incentives and high fleet sales, he added, \u201cis nitroglycerin.\u201dAt the top of Mr. Jackson\u2019s concerns is leasing, which is a way of renting a new car for a specified period of time, like 24 or 36 months. Customers like leases because they typically make lower monthly payments than if they bought cars with loans. Automakers and dealers like leases because they get more flexibility to structure deals that enable customers to get pricier cars with affordable payments.Consider the lease secured by Allen Lin, a teacher from Altadena, Calif.A few weeks ago, he walked into a Lexus dealership and drove out about two hours later with a 2016 RX 350, leased for three years at $408 a month. The small sport utility vehicle \u2014 one of the most popular on the market \u2014 had recently been fully overhauled, and redesigned car models typically sell with little or no discounts. But Mr. Lin paid no money up front, did not trade in his old car and got $5,000 knocked off the car\u2019s list price of $43,779.\u201cIf you can get a deal like this, it\u2019s pretty sweet,\u201d said Mr. Lin, 35.Brian Smith, vice president for marketing at Lexus, said that leasing helped keep customers from straying to other brands but that Lexus did not use it to drive sales volume.Luxury makers tend to lean on leasing more heavily than more middle-of-the-market brands. For example, more than half of all Lexus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Acura cars are leased. Still, all automakers use leasing to some extent, and all shapes and sizes can be leased.The three most-leased vehicles are the Honda Civic, the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry, according to Experian Automotive.A Honda spokesman said the Japanese automaker took a measured approach to leasing to maintain used-car values. Toyota said it also managed leasing with a focus on residual value.In the past few years, some brands have significantly increased leasing. Five years ago, leases made up less than 20 percent of sales for Chevrolet, Hyundai and Mazda. Now it accounts for more than 30 percent of their sales.A spokesman for General Motors said leasing helped Chevrolet increase sales and retain customers. Hyundai\u2019s leasing levels are in line with industry practices, a spokesman said. Mazda limits lease discounting to maximize the value of used cars for customers, a company spokesman said.But while leases can lift sales, they also pose risks for car companies and their finance arms. They have to borrow billions of dollars to finance leases, and then, after leases expire, they take the cars back and sell them through dealerships or at used-car auctions. Selling gently used cars can be a good business for dealers and can help automakers attract new customers.But if they lease too many vehicles, or economic conditions sour, the value of used cars can fall and leave car companies with big losses.That\u2019s exactly what happened in 2008, when the market suddenly crashed and automakers and dealers were left a glut of cars coming off lease.Some analysts worry that the industry could be heading for that kind of situation.This is happening at a time when consumer purchases of new cars are slowing.In the first quarter of the year, sales to individual consumers rose less than 1 percent, compared with the same period a year ago, according to data from J.D. Power and Associates. In March, consumer new-car purchases, known as retail sales, fell 1 percent. But total sales are higher because of a big jump in sales to fleets, such as rental companies.Car companies are also offering auto loans over longer periods of time. Edmunds.com found that more than 27 percent of all new cars sold in the first quarter went to customers who took out loans lasting 73 to 84 months, up from 23.4 percent in the same period a year ago.\u201cIt feels like a tougher market now,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing partner at AlixPartners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see where the growth is going to come from.\u201dAlix is predicting leaner times ahead. It sees vehicle sales rising about 2 percent this year to 17.8 million cars and light trucks, and then declining, slipping steadily to 16.2 million vehicles in 2019.That leaves many automakers pushing lease deals to drive sales. This month, for example, BMW is offering a deal on its i3 electric car. It is available in many parts of the country for just $163 a month for 24 months, with no down payment. The deal is based on a price of $31,999 \u2014 a 32 percent discount from the car\u2019s list price.BMW\u2019s leasing business ensures dealers have a steady stream of well-maintained, used models to offer value-minded customers, a company spokesman said. Such \u201ccertified pre-owned\u201d cars also keep used BMW prices firm, he said.Derrick Oxender, a commercial property owner in Ann Arbor, Mich., still had a few months to go on the three-year lease for his 2013 Ford F-350 diesel truck. He was paying $825 a month based on its list price of about $58,000.But a salesman from his Ford dealer called and said he could turn in his 2013 truck and lease a 2016 model, loaded with extras like heated rear seats. Although his new F-350 is priced at $71,000, he got a new lease with a monthly payment of just $695.\u201cYou have to be stupid not to do it,\u201d Mr. Oxender said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Connecticut Chooses to Cut Jobs Over Increased Taxes in Budget Crisis", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byForced to rely heavily on its highest earners to fill the state\u2019s coffers, and fearful of alienating more of the highest-earning residents after a tax increase last year, legislators are not entertaining additional taxes on the rich.\u201cWe\u2019d price ourselves out of the market,\u201d said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, if the state tried to make up for its $922 million shortfall with a \u201cmillionaire\u2019s tax.\u201d The revised budget Mr. Malloy proposed on Tuesday covers the shortfall, incorporating cuts to expenses and jobs \u2014 as many as 2,500 state positions could be eliminated \u2014 but no tax increases.Connecticut faces a new economic reality, Mr. Malloy said in an interview on Saturday. High-paying finance jobs, which helped the state\u2019s budget, are not expected to return to pre-recession levels.One of those laid off was Gail DeMarco of East Lyme, a supervising psychologist who has a college student and a high school freshman.Ms. DeMarco said she was aware of the state\u2019s fiscal crisis, but because Mr. Malloy had emphasized the importance of mental health services, she did not expect layoffs to include jobs like hers \u2014 therapists working with traumatized children and at-risk teens.But last Monday, after arriving for work at the Connecticut Juvenile Training School, Ms. DeMarco, a union member, was let go from her $91,600-a-year job.She said she worries \u201cabout the kids who have already had significant trauma in their lives, and they are then re-traumatized by this sudden loss of people they have relationships with, who are advocating for them.\u201dMr. Malloy said during a budget address in February that Connecticut needed to \u201calign state employee benefits with our present economic reality.\u201d His current budget proposal asks nonunion employees to pay a greater share of their health care costs.A union representing health care workers launched a television advertising campaign in early February called \u201cOne Connecticut.\u201d\u201cThere are other ways to close these deficit holes instead of coming back to middle-class workers,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cIf we lose 2,500 jobs in the state, that\u2019s only going to harm our economy more.\u201dWith deficits also expected in the coming years, Mr. Malloy and members of the state\u2019s General Assembly increasingly find themselves on a tightrope.States typically generate just over one-third of their revenues from personal income taxes, and another third from sales taxes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Connecticut, by comparison, relies on personal income taxes for more than half of its revenue.While the number of jobs in Connecticut has returned to pre-recession levels, lower-wage positions in finance have taken the place of high-paying jobs, according to a report by the Standard & Poor\u2019s credit ratings agency. That shift translates to lower personal income tax revenues, in a state that relies so heavily on income taxes. \u201cThat makes or breaks Connecticut,\u201d said Arturo Perez, a fiscal research analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.In the long term, Connecticut faces a grim balance sheet. For decades, the state did not fully finance its pension plans, and Connecticut now carries more than $26 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.The lawmaker, L. Scott Frantz, a state senator from Greenwich, said, \u201cThe legislature can\u2019t balance a budget to save its life, and with other shortfalls going forward it does not look pretty for the state of Connecticut unless we as a General Assembly get our act together.\u201dMr. Frantz said he thinks Mr. Malloy has a deeper understanding of the state\u2019s tax base today than when he entered the governor\u2019s office in 2011.\u201cHe knows that he can\u2019t afford to lose one more taxpayer,\u201d Mr. Frantz said. \u201cIf he wants a halfway decent legacy, he\u2019s going to have to make sure this fiscal house is dramatically improved.\u201dAn article in some editions on Monday about a budget crisis in Connecticut that has included layoffs of state employees misidentified the group that started the \u201cOne Connecticut\u201d television campaign, which was meant to put a face on state workers. It was a union representing health care workers, not a consortium of 16 unions. The article also referred incorrectly to the people featured in one of the campaign\u2019s commercials. Only one of the people featured was a client of a social services agency, not all three.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina Restroom Law Becomes a Central Election Issue", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byHIGH POINT, N.C. \u2014 Parrish Clodfelter, a 79-year-old retiree who lives on a central North Carolina farm, professes opinions about transgender people that might get him fired if he worked for a multinational corporation, though for many here, they constitute simple country wisdom.\u201cA man wants to change to a woman, he\u2019s got a mental problem,\u201d Mr. Clodfelter said on Wednesday over lunch at Spiro\u2019s Family Restaurant, where posters by the door advertised classes on carrying concealed weapons and a \u201cHillbilly Sunday\u201d Pentecostal church service.But Mr. Clodfelter has a different kind of problem. As a longtime Republican, he wants to support Pat McCrory, North Carolina\u2019s Republican governor, in his re-election bid. At the same time, he is worried about the boycotts and lost jobs resulting from the law the governor signed in March that limits transgender bathroom access and eliminates antidiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.If the backlash continues, Mr. Clodfelter said, he will consider voting for Mr. McCrory\u2019s Democratic opponent, Roy Cooper, who supports the law\u2019s repeal.\u201cI\u2019m afraid if they don\u2019t change it,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019ll hurt the state.\u201dEven before the law tapped into a national debate about transgender rights, privacy and political correctness, North Carolina, the rare Southern state that is evenly split between liberals and conservatives, was considered to be up for grabs in the November presidential race, particularly if Donald J. Trump tops the Republican ticket.Now the law, and the backlash against it, have introduced a different kind of volatile energy to state politics here, roiling a governor\u2019s race that could be the nation\u2019s most competitive. It is also affecting other crucial contests, including that of Senator Richard Burr, who hopes to fend off a vigorous Democratic challenge from Deborah K. Ross, a former State House member and former state director of the American Civil Liberties Union.Last week, Mr. Burr, who has defended the law, came under attack from Democrats who have leapt at the chance to transform a cultural issue into an economic one, as the state has suffered the retreat of protesting companies, including PayPal, which canceled a plan to bring more than 400 jobs to Charlotte. On Thursday, the N.B.A. commissioner, Adam Silver, said the league would move its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte if the law were not changed.Thus far, the uproar may be doing the most harm to Mr. McCrory, an affable former mayor of Charlotte who has struggled, since taking office in 2013, to maintain his reputation as a moderate in the face of a Republican-dominated legislature that is considerably more conservative than he is.An Elon University poll conducted from April 10 to 15 showed Mr. Cooper, the state\u2019s longtime attorney general, leading Mr. McCrory 48 percent to 42 percent among registered voters. It was Mr. Cooper\u2019s largest lead in the five polls that Elon has conducted in the last year.But November is a long way off, and social issues reverberate in complex ways in a state that has a reputation for moderation but also produced Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative United States senator. Carter Wrenn, a longtime political strategist who worked with Mr. Helms, said Democrats had been winning arguments over the law of late. But he said Republicans would have time to make the case to voters that the law helps ensure privacy and security in public restrooms.\u201cWe\u2019re not sure how this is all going to turn out,\u201d Mr. Wrenn said.The issue is particularly troublesome for Mr. McCrory. Exit polls from 2012 show that he received the support of 49 percent of voters who described themselves as moderate and 19 percent of self-described liberals.Mr. McCrory, 59, last week could barely contain his irritation that the law had taken center stage in the election, siphoning attention from his central message: that he has been a wise steward of the economy who had engineered what he and his team have branded the \u201cCarolina Comeback.\u201dThis hornet\u2019s nest, he argued, was first kicked not by him, but by the Democratic City Council in Charlotte, which passed a nondiscrimination ordinance in February allowing transgender people to use men\u2019s or women\u2019s bathrooms. Before it passed, he said, he emailed the Council to warn it that if it changed \u201cbasic restroom and locker room norms,\u201d he would be forced to support a state law overriding them.On Thursday, he said he suspected that the entire matter had been orchestrated by Democrats and the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, to give Democrats an advantage in a tight governor\u2019s race.The backlash, he said, has allowed for no dialogue on \u201ca very complex issue.\u201d Dissenters to the left-wing position, he said, were being intimidated. Mr. McCrory used the word \u201cOrwellian\u201d twice.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be politically na\u00efve if you think this is not coordinated by a very effective \u2014 a very effective \u2014 group,\u201d he said.Mr. McCrory preferred to talk about the improved state of the economy since he took over from Gov. Beverly Perdue, a Democrat. She had declined to seek re-election after a single term in which North Carolina struggled through the recession and in which she clashed over tax policy with a legislature that Republicans won full control of in 2010.The state\u2019s comeback, Mr. McCrory argues, was bolstered by his ability to deliver $4.4 billion in tax relief, including what his campaign literature describes as \u201cone of the largest income tax cuts in state history.\u201d\u201cI inherited a broken government and a broken economy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we were the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country when I came into office: 9.4 percent unemployment. And we\u2019ve had one of the biggest rebounds in the United States of America.\u201d Unemployment in the state is now 5.5 percent.At a cafe in Raleigh last week, Mr. Cooper, who has served as attorney general since 2001, argued that the Carolina Comeback was a myth, saying that there had been an \u201coverall improvement in the economy across the country.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a Carolina Comeback for everyday working people,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people are working longer, and harder, and for less money than they did before the recession.\u201dMr. Cooper, 58, said his favorite North Carolina governor was Jim Hunt, the Democrat who served two stints in office beginning in 1977 and represents, to many liberals here, a homegrown progressivism that struck a balance between corporate interests and investments in the public good, especially public education.Mr. Cooper has criticized Mr. McCrory for not expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.On Thursday, he criticized the flat-rate income tax Mr. McCrory instituted in 2013 as disproportionately favoring the rich.The law on gender and restrooms, Mr. Cooper said, \u201cis a discrimination issue and an economic issue, and, particularly, you have Governor McCrory trying a political ploy that blew up, and is now hurting people and our economy.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

People waited for hours in lines that stretched several blocks to get into the park, and they seemed spellbound at times as Mr. Sanders held forth against the wealthy and the powerful \u2014 in particular, Mrs. Clinton.\u201cYou can tell a lot about a candidate and the campaigns run by how they raise the money they need to run those campaigns,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, drawing a contrast between his historic success with low-dollar online donations and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s dependence on four-figure donations and \u201csuper PACs.\u201d And when he mentioned the $675,000 in speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs, the crowd roared with boos.Sanders campaign aides said that about 27,000 people attended the rally, a striking number; Barack Obama also filled the park during a rally in 2007, but his campaign said only about 20,000 people had registered.But no matter the exact count, the rally was an event that went viral on social media and drew people who flew to New York specifically for the event. In buildings along the park, New York University students and workers pressed against windows to watch the senator and the vast crowd below on the chilly night.\u201cBernie is promising the change we need when we need it,\u201d said Terence Gardner, 25, a freelance film editor who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Mr. Gardner cited climate change as the policy issue that worried him the most, and said he had great faith that Mr. Sanders would make environmental protection a top priority.\u201cClimate change affects everything in my life, from where I\u2019m going to live to whether I wanted to have kids,\u201d said Mr. Gardner, who added that he did not know many details about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy agenda.Before Mr. Sanders took the stage, several celebrity supporters addressed one of his biggest challenges in New York: He has been a far more popular vote-getter than Mrs. Clinton with independents, yet only registered Democrats are allowed to cast ballots in the primary. They urged the crowd to do everything they could to persuade more Democrats to support Mr. Sanders and help turn out the vote on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton, who will debate the senator on Thursday, has held a comfortable lead over him in recent opinion polls. But Sanders supporters at the rally said they thought the intensity of support for the senator could lead to an upset victory on Tuesday, similar to his win in Michigan last month.\u201cChange will not happen by choosing a candidate who is entirely entrenched in the dysfunction of the past,\u201d said the actor Tim Robbins, who recalled protesting in the park against the Vietnam War as a young man.Mr. Sanders told the crowd that \u201cit\u2019s going to be a tough primary for us\u201d because independents could not vote and young people, among others, could not register at polling places on Tuesday. But he said he was still hopeful.\u201cIf we have a large voter turnout on Tuesday, we\u2019re going to win this thing,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.The large crowd, and the senator\u2019s promises to change politics, had much in common with the 2007 rally for Mr. Obama in the park. Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Obama was running an aggressive campaign against Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Washington Square Park was seen as a shot across her bow. Mr. Obama criticized Mrs. Clinton over Social Security reform, but mostly needled her, such as noting that she had refused to commit to root for the New York Yankees over the Chicago Cubs if the teams ever faced off in the World Series.At Wednesday\u2019s rally, Mr. Sanders was more aggressive against Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Obama had been, assailing her for supporting some free trade agreements in the past and voting to authorize the war in Iraq. He portrayed her judgment as faulty and her pledges to change America as unreliable, based on her ties with bank and corporate executives and major donors.\u201cWhat this campaign is profoundly about is that real change never occurs from the top on down \u2014 it\u2019s from the bottom up,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Some people said they came out because they were still making up their mind between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. Lauri Owens, an undecided voter from Forest Hills, Queens, said she shared Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern that corporations had far too much influence, but was not sure if Mr. Sanders would be able to change anything as president.\u201cI\u2019d like to see someone who thinks about us again,\u201d she said. \u201cRegular people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colorado Weighs Replacing Obama\u2019s Health Policy With Universal Coverage", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byDENVER \u2014 For years, voters in this swing state have rejected tax increases and efforts to expand government. But now they are flirting with a radical transformation: whether to abandon President Obama\u2019s health care policy and instead create a new, taxpayer-financed public health system that guarantees coverage for everyone.The estimated $38-billion-a-year proposal, which will go before Colorado voters in November, will test whether people have an appetite for a new system that goes further than the Affordable Care Act. That question is also in play in the Democratic presidential primaries.The state-level effort, which supporters here call the ColoradoCare plan, would do away with deductibles. It would allow patients to choose doctors and specialists without distinguishing between those \u201cin network\u201d and those \u201cout of network.\u201d It would largely be paid for with a tax increase on workers and businesses, and cover everyone in the state. Supporters say most people would end up saving money.Insurance groups, chambers of commerce and conservatives have already lined up in opposition. They say the plan\u2019s details are vague, its size and cost galling. The proposed health system would have a budget bigger than that of Colorado\u2019s entire state government. A new 10 percent tax on payroll and incomes to pay for the system would push Colorado\u2019s tax rates to some of the highest in the nation.The proposal\u2019s chance of success is dubious. Colorado has a mixed record when it comes to ballot measures, though it has passed some notable ones over the years, including marijuana legalization and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, an anti-tax, anti-spending constitutional amendment.But the proposal had enough support to garner 100,000 signatures, which put it on the ballot. It has also worried insurers, and some in the medical community and the business community, enough for them to organize in opposition, even enlisting a Democratic former governor to help in their campaign.In this season of political discontent, the notion of dismantling the health insurance system has tapped an aquifer of frustration from voters. People say that even after the Affordable Care Act, they still pay too much in premiums, plus thousands in deductibles, and still have to worry about being bankrupted by a disabling car crash or an extended hospital stay.\u201cI think insurance is one of the biggest jokes and crooks,\u201d said Brandon Barta, 38, of Denver. He said his father, Dixon, who worked at a gas station, never received aggressive enough treatment for his prostate cancer. He died last May at the age of 64.\u201cHe was overlooked,\u201d Mr. Barta said.Mr. Barta said he was intrigued by the idea of a universal health plan that covered maternity care, checkups, emergency room visits and hospital stays, all the way through end-of-life care. Like millions of Americans, he has health insurance tied to his work. His coverage lapsed recently when he switched jobs to start working for a golf entertainment complex, and he is still waiting for his new plan to kick in.Still, he has questions about how universal coverage would work and how much it would cost taxpayers like him.The answers: If a majority of voters say yes, the system would start running in 2019, and essentially be a start-up health cooperative bigger than companies like Nike and American Express, according to the Colorado Health Institute, an independent policy group. A 21-person elected board would set the benefits and budgets. The system would be financed by payroll taxes of 3.3 percent for workers and 6.7 percent for employers. It would impose a 10 percent tax on investment income, people who are self-employed and some small-business income.In the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, echoing many moderate Democratic leaders here, has said that she wants to keep and improve the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative legacy. But her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, who won Colorado\u2019s Democratic caucuses last month by nearly 20 points, has advocated abandoning the health law for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach. His proposal is similar to the ColoradoCare plan.The campaign over the Colorado initiative has had the unusual effect of putting conservative critics in the position of defending Mr. Obama\u2019s health plan against an assault from the left. At the same time, it is energizing progressives, who say the Affordable Care Act was a giveaway to the insurance industry that, even with an estimated 20 million people newly insured, has left too many others without coverage.\u201cNo matter how long we hang in there with the Affordable Care Act, we will never cover everybody,\u201d said Jeanne Nicholson, a former Democratic state senator and nurse who is a leading supporter of universal care here. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand why we should compromise and say some people can have bronze coverage, some can have silver and some can have gold. Why can\u2019t we all have platinum plus?\u201dNathan Wilkes, 42, who lives in the Denver suburbs, said that years of trying to get care for his son, who has hemophilia, had worn his family thin and made him an advocate for universal coverage. He said the family had spent thousands of dollars and destroyed its credit because of insufficient coverage. The Affordable Care Act offered some benefits, he said, but its gaps were still too big and \u201cnot sustainable.\u201dUnlike its conservative neighbors, Colorado jumped to get on board with the Affordable Care Act. It set up its own insurance marketplace and expanded Medicaid coverage for poorer residents. But there have been stumbles. People in mountain towns with few providers faced eye-popping premiums for coverage. Colorado\u2019s biggest health cooperative, Colorado HealthOP, shut down in October, forcing more than 80,000 people to find new plans.Colorado\u2019s plan would replace many private workplace plans, but it would sit alongside Medicare and federal health coverage for veterans, and private insurers could still sell coverage to people who wanted more.The Colorado Health Institute, an independent policy group, said the plan\u2019s passage would be \u201cthe most far-reaching health care reform in any state\u201d since the Affordable Care Act.\u201cIt\u2019s replacing a system that I think has become really dysfunctional,\u201d said Irene Aguilar, a Democratic state senator and physician who is leading the effort. \u201cThe game has been rigged by the for-profit corporations to ensure they win.\u201dOpponents say that it could wreck the state\u2019s humming economy and drive away doctors and businesses, and that its costs could spiral out of control.If it passes, ColoradoCare would become part of the state Constitution, and become virtually impossible to significantly alter without a statewide vote. It would also fall outside the reach of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, a 1992 amendment to the Colorado Constitution that put strict limits on spending and new taxes.\u201cIt would be a disastrous economic impact on the state,\u201d said Walker Stapleton, Colorado\u2019s treasurer and a co-chairman of the opposition campaign. \u201cIf you think legalized pot brought a lot of people to Colorado, you should try free health care.\u201dLike many other Republicans here, Mr. Stapleton opposed the Affordable Care Act and continues to criticize how it has been put in place. But to defeat the new initiative, he now finds himself defending the federal health law.Sean Duffy, a Republican and a spokesman for the opposition campaign, said many of his neighbors in the conservative Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch had eagerly signed the petition to put the question on the November ballot because they saw it as a way to get rid of Obamacare.Some Democratic officials also oppose the state\u2019s universal care effort. They include Gov. John Hickenlooper, who said during his 2014 re-election fight that he was \u201cno big fan of the Affordable Care Act.\u201dColorado\u2019s previous Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, also opposes it.Michelle Lucero, general counsel at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, is among the health care officials lining up against the measure. (The hospital itself also opposes it.) She worries that it could threaten research dollars or drive away doctors.\u201cThey\u2019re going to choose to go to a state that\u2019s not hamstrung by this,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discord Grows Among the Parties Over Greek Debt Talks", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Executives of the International Monetary Fund mutter darkly about Greeks tapping their phones in Athens. Greek government officials accuse the fund of torpedoing their economy via tough austerity measures.And both the Greeks and the fund moan about the refusal of Germany to consider any form of debt relief for Greece.Signs of the growing tensions over Greece and its debt were evident at meetings of the I.M.F. in Washington last week. But nothing exemplifies the growing discord more than a simple chart on a draft memorandum drawn up by the fund that has been making the rounds at meetings here.The chart depicts just how wide the gap is between Europe and the I.M.F. in terms of assessing Greece\u2019s ability to pay down its growing debt burden \u2014 currently close to 180 percent of its gross domestic product \u2014 in the coming decades.And it highlights the danger that, just as it was last summer, Greece may be pushed to the edge of bankruptcy as a result of an inability, if not an unwillingness, of the fund, Europe and Greece to reach a compromise.Ever skeptical of Greece\u2019s capacity to keep a lid on spending and to increase taxes over the years, the fund\u2019s economists project that the debt will approach 300 percent of G.D.P. by 2060 \u2014 an outcome depicted vividly on the chart as a line sloping sharply upward.The stance of Europe, which is on the hook for a much larger chunk of the debt than the I.M.F., is represented by a line trending defiantly downward.In the view of finance ministers in the euro area, Greece will meet the demands of the toughest austerity program ever imposed upon a nation and will generate enough cash to bring the debt below 100 percent of G.D.P.The implication of the chart and the accompanying memorandum \u2014 neither of which has been made public \u2014 is that the I.M.F., as things stand, will not be able to support the next bailout agreement that Greece and Europe reach.Late last week, the managing director of the I.M.F., Christine Lagarde, said publicly what many senior fund officials have said quietly for months: Europe\u2019s assumption that Greece, in the decades ahead, can annually achieve a budget surplus (minus interest payments) of 3.5 percent of G.D.P. and pay down its debt is \u201chighly unrealistic\u201d and would require a \u201cheroic\u201d sacrifice from an austerity-battered populace.That assessment is hardly a surprise. Since the spring of 2010, the time of the first Greek bailout, I.M.F. economists have been saying that Greece would never be able to pay back such a tremendous amount of debt.They contend that in terms of money borrowed and economic output lost, the Greek crisis has far exceeded even the classic emerging market busts in Latin America and Asia \u2014 many of which were resolved via various forms of debt restructuring.As a result, they conclude, the very thought that Greece can pay its way out of this mess without having its debt reduced in some way is fantasy.\u201cThere is no exit for Greece without debt relief,\u201d Mr. Gourinchas said.Part of the problem is that the fund\u2019s role now is highly unorthodox. While the fund is owed $12 billion, it is not promising to lend any new money this year, which, at least in the view of the Greeks, reduces its credibility. Isn\u2019t it hypocritical of the fund, some Greek officials say in private, to push us so hard when it is not willing to lend new money? At least the Europeans are promising to put more money on the table, they point out.Fund officials have responded: How can we be your enemy if we are the ones pressuring Europe to give you a break on your debt?In the phone transcript, published by WikiLeaks, it was suggested that the only way to get an agreement would be to push Greece once again to the precipice of default.\u201cI brought this up with my Greek colleagues,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister from the Netherlands, who is leading Europe in the talks with Greece. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of trust \u2014 how can the I.M.F. do its work if they have to worry all the time about having their phones tapped?\u201dAs to the matter of Greece\u2019s debt, Mr. Dijsselbloem remained adamant: It is not being discussed.While it remains most unlikely that the I.M.F. would walk away from the talks, that such a step is even being suggested underscores how uncertain the negotiations have become.That is because Germany has frequently said that it requires the I.M.F. to be an active participant in the process. So if the fund does not bless an agreement, Germany will be very unlikely to embrace it.Despite all the tensions, negotiations are continuing. Greece, unlike in past years, sent its full team of negotiators to Washington last Thursday to resume talks that had been temporarily suspended.They include the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos; the debt expert Stelios Papadopoulos; the economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis; and the Greek government\u2019s longstanding financial adviser, Glenn Kim, an independent investment banker who previously worked for Moelis and Lehman Brothers.The crux of the talks has long been Greece\u2019s bloated pension program, which still pays out about 10 percent of G.D.P. annually. Fund officials have always said that without significant pension cuts, they could not approve any new deal.Greece has argued that, in depression-like economic conditions, Greeks cannot afford pension cuts, especially when pensioners are now the only breadwinners in many families.Under the labor minister, Georgios Katrougalos, the Greek government is now pushing a plan that would freeze current payouts and cut future ones and that would increase contributions from employers.Whether that will be enough to win over the I.M.F. and, ultimately, Europe regarding the debt question remains to be seen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Milan the Real Capital of Italy?", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byMILAN \u2014 IF you walk around Rome, and you survive the speeding mo-peds and the taxi drivers fuming at the tourists wandering across the road, you soon understand why locals claim to live in the most beautiful place in the world. The city is a breathtaking concentration of history, art and charm \u2014 every corner could fill your eyes, your camera and your typical American romantic comedy.But Rome, despite all of this, is a gloomy place these days. The economy is stagnant, corruption is rife and no one seems to know or even care how to get things moving again.In contrast, if you walk around Milan, and you survive the bus drivers swearing at pedestrians who cross against the lights, hunched over their phones, you soon understand why the Milanese think their city is Italy\u2019s actual guiding light. It has become, in the last few years, an irresistible magnet for young people from all over the country, who flock here to work in design, media, fashion and food.You can hear regional accents from every corner of the country and see all kinds of faces, from wiry, dark-haired Sardinian girls to tall, blond boys from Alto Adige. That\u2019s why Milan, today, is happy.Rival cities are commonplace: New York and Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing and Shanghai, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Madrid and Barcelona. In Italy, it\u2019s Rome and Milan. But the match has never been more uneven.Rome is in a foul mood. It\u2019s gone from scandal to scandal, some of them truly embarrassing. Last year a major investigation known as Mafia Capitale revealed the cozy relationship between organized crime and Italian politicians. As a result, Rome\u2019s mayor, Ignazio Marino \u2014 not an accomplice, more of a hapless bystander \u2014 resigned in October.Then it got worse. The city is plagued not only by widespread corruption but also by everyday inefficiency and insiderism. Francesco Paolo Tronca, who replaced Mr. Marino, found out that the municipality owns more than 28,000 real estate units, on which the unpaid rents amount to $400 million. Apparently, 85 percent of the tenants don\u2019t care to cough up, or don\u2019t have to. Or they pay $36 a month for a villa with a view over the Colosseum \u2014 or $5.50 for a place on the Campo de\u2019 Fiori. Yes, really.Milan, on the other hand, is in an ebullient mood. Last year\u2019s expo, with 21 million visitors, seven million of them from abroad, was an unexpected success. The city\u2019s annual Salone del Mobile, the annual furniture fair, is now the benchmark for the furnishing and design industries, the largest of its kind in the world. This month it attracted 400,000 visitors \u2014 70 percent of them foreigners \u2014 and transformed the city in another weeklong movable feast.High-rise towers are going up across the city, transforming the skyline. Fashion, design, art, advertising, publishing \u2014 Milan is the go-to city for all these sectors, as well as, increasingly, manufacturing and finance. Rome stays afloat with politics, public television and cinema.The comparison is even harsher when it comes to the public sector: hospitals, garbage disposal, transportation and infrastructure. Around 40 percent of Rome\u2019s streets have major cracks and potholes; there are several blogs and Facebook pages devoted to the \u201cbuche di Roma\u201d (\u201choles of Rome\u201d). Milan, in contrast, does all these things right.Exacerbating the difference is Rome\u2019s indifference. A columnist wrote last week in Corriere della Sera: \u201cRomans believe they know everything. They look down cynically at the world from what they call the Eternal City.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a little harsh, but there\u2019s some truth in it. The place is so beautiful that its residents think beauty alone is enough. When they realize that modern urban life needs more than that \u2014 efficient public transport and honest managers, for instance \u2014 they say they want to change things. But change is painful. And beautiful, seductive Rome is there to whisper: \u201cWhy bother? Don\u2019t!\u201dIn June, both cities will choose new mayors. In Milan the picture is clear. Two previous city managers, Beppe Sala and Stefano Parisi, represent left and right. Both are considered competent (Mr. Sala was the boss of the Expo). Either way, Milan will be fine.One thing is true of both cities: Whoever wins will have his or her work cut out. Rome must learn to combine its spectacular heritage with higher standards in daily life. La dolce vita must meet la vita pratica halfway. You don\u2019t enjoy the Colosseum if you waste an hour waiting for a bus that never arrives.Over the past hundred years, many of Italy\u2019s pivotal changes \u2014 good and bad \u2014 began in Milan: socialism, Great War fever, Fascism, the resistance to Fascism, the economic boom of the \u201960s, the political turmoil of the \u201970s, the Clean Hands anti-corruption campaign, the populist Northern League. And now, this young, lively and colorful renaissance.Milan\u2019s challenge is to spread its current success to the rest of the country. Show that there\u2019s an entrepreneurial spirit across Italy, and that the young people who flock to Milan to find it might be persuaded to stay at home, if they could find the same opportunities. Give a chance to the smart new Italians that fill the piazzas on these spring nights.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Rescue Bill Nears Completion in House Committee", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byLegislative staff members in Washington were said to be close on Friday to completing a revised bill that would give Puerto Rico extraordinary powers to wipe out debt under close federal supervision.Puerto Rico owes even bigger debt payments, totaling about $2 billion, on July 1.The House\u2019s draft bill still contains certain provisions that creditor groups have been fighting, and Natural Resources Committee aides said further refinements were likely. The committee is scheduled to take testimony on the rescue package on Wednesday, and aides said they hoped to send a finished bill to the House on Thursday.The package still calls for Puerto Rico\u2019s financial affairs to come under the supervision of a federal oversight board and to shed debt in a bankruptcylike federal court proceding after meeting certain requirements. Now, however, the composition of the oversight board is less certain.Officials in Puerto Rico objected strenuously last week to what they saw as the colonialist overtones of an oversight board whose voting members would all be selected by the president.Drafters have scaled back some of the board\u2019s more intrusive powers. They preserved the board\u2019s authority to ensure that Puerto Rico\u2019s government adheres to an agreed-upon fiscal plan. The board would also be kept in place until Puerto Rico regained its ability to sell debt in the municipal bond market. The number of board members, previously seven, may change, legislative aides said.Another contentious provision is the so-called cramdown, which allows a court to force creditors to accept less money for their claims than they want.To prevent abuses, lawmakers are considering whether to require Puerto Rico to work out all settlements before entering the court-supervised phase of its restructuring. The oversight board would, in effect, hold the keys to the courthouse, and not let Puerto Rico petition the court until all creditors had approved their settlements by class.Another contentious provision that is still being resolved is whether to halt creditor lawsuits while Puerto Rico is under federal oversight \u2014 the way a bankruptcy court can offer debtors shelter from lawsuits with its \u201cautomatic stay.\u201dCreditors have warned that if lawsuits against Puerto Rico are stayed, the island might have the ability to pick which creditors it wants to pay, exhausting resources that ought to be divided among all creditors equally.As of Friday, the lawmakers were considering whether these concerns might be allayed by staying all lawsuits for a short period \u2014 perhaps just six months, for example.Conservatives in the House, the aides say, have taken creditors\u2019 concerns to heart, and are worried that if Puerto Rico gets extraordinary powers to abrogate debt, distressed states like Illinois will soon come to Washington seeking the same thing.Advertisement"}

But the president\u2019s tone is less reflective than frustrated that the American public does not see his achievements the way he does.In two recent interviews, with The New York Times Magazine on his economic legacy and with The Atlantic on his foreign policy legacy, Mr. Obama expressed a common sentiment: He had achieved big things and avoided even bigger mistakes, and yet most people just shrug.In both cases, Mr. Obama suggested that the problem was not him, but one of perception. \u201cIf you ask the average person on the streets, \u2018Have deficits gone up or down under Obama?\u2019 probably 70 percent would say they\u2019ve gone up,\u201d the president told The Times Magazine. (In fact, deficits have declined.)Not bombing Syria in 2013 was the right decision, Mr. Obama said, but one that played badly with the public because it defied foreign policy orthodoxy. \u201cIn the midst of an international challenge like Syria,\u201d he told the Atlantic correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg, \u201cyou get judged harshly if you don\u2019t follow the playbook, even if there are good reasons why it does not apply.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s challenge, at least on economic and foreign policy, is that he is often trying to prove a negative: Without the steps he took \u2014 or didn\u2019t take \u2014 he asserts that things would have turned out so much worse. He notes, for example, that he has avoided the military misadventures of his predecessor, George W. Bush. His bailouts of the economy and the auto industry, he says, prevented the Great Recession from hemorrhaging into a Great Depression.Many historians agree.\u201cHe\u2019s made a huge difference in the fact that the country didn\u2019t suffer more greatly,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian who has discussed Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy with him. \u201cBut saving the country from a deeper crisis, from a Great Depression, is not exciting. Incremental gains don\u2019t capture the public\u2019s excitement, the excitement of young people.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s problems have been magnified by an election in which the candidates who have generated the most excitement \u2014 Donald J. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 have painted the nation\u2019s economy and national security in near-apocalyptic terms.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump laid out a foreign policy that he said would be the antithesis of that of Mr. Obama and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray \u2014 a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.\u201dIn February, Mr. Sanders said after winning in New Hampshire, \u201cGiven the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for the same old, same old establishment politics and establishment economics.\u201dIn search of the middle class.The administration has assigned staff members to schedule further interviews and articles that will allow Mr. Obama to showcase his major achievements. But a full accounting of them is not likely to come until the president writes his memoir \u2014 a prospect that has publishers salivating, given his track record as a best-selling author.\u201cHe\u2019s going to be his own best advocate,\u201d said Mr. Dallek, who has written biographies of John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, \u201cbut he\u2019s being eclipsed by this campaign and the hullabaloo that surrounds it.\u201dMr. Dallek diagnosed another problem. Mr. Obama, he said, tends to avoid describing the threats he faced or his response to them in dramatic terms. His foreign policy constituted a radical departure from that of his predecessor. But when he summarized it for reporters in 2014, he used a saltier version of the line, \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s economic policy featured the greatest fiscal rescue package ever enacted. But for political reasons, to avoid more charges of out-of-control spending from Republicans, Mr. Obama resisted using such superlatives, just as he resisted dramatizing the economic crisis he inherited. \u201cIt was a delicate balance throughout 2009 and 2010 to be straight with the American people about the depths of the problem, how close we were to disaster, without scaring the heck out of them,\u201d Mr. Obama told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The Times.The president has shown a similar aversion to exaggerating the threat from militant groups like the Islamic State.\u201cISIL does not speak for Islam,\u201d Mr. Obama said in December, using the administration\u2019s preferred acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cThey are thugs and killers, part of a cult of death, and they account for a tiny fraction of more than a billion Muslims around the world \u2014 including millions of patriotic Muslim Americans who reject their hateful ideology. Moreover, the vast majority of terrorist victims around the world are Muslim.\u201dRepublican candidates assailed Mr. Obama\u2019s low-key response as evidence of his failure to lead. On the campaign trail, even Mrs. Clinton used starker language than he did in describing the threat.Few issues illustrate Mr. Obama\u2019s communication gap more vividly than his decision to hold off an airstrike on Syria after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people. The decision, which critics portrayed as a heavy blow against the credibility of the presidency, nevertheless led to an international agreement under which the vast majority of the Assad regime\u2019s chemical weapons were removed. Privately, Mr. Obama expresses frustration that the critics rarely acknowledge that positive outcome or what might have happened had he bombed.\u201cI\u2019m very proud of this moment,\u201d he told The Atlantic. \u201cThe overwhelming weight of conventional wisdom and the machinery of the national security apparatus had gone fairly far. The perception was that my credibility was at stake. And so for me to press the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically.\u201dIt may be difficult to make a crisis-avoidance presidency sound dramatic, but it is not impossible, Mr. Dallek said. He invoked Franklin D. Roosevelt, who guided the nation through the Great Depression. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to use the right language,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Roosevelt closed the banks, he called it a bank holiday.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The reason? Increasing numbers of students are applying to the most selective institutions.When students apply to all the most selective schools, many of which are very different, is it about fit? Or is it only about prestige?The admission frenzy will stop only when colleges, students and, frankly, parents refuse to play the game anymore \u2014 when we admit that more doesn\u2019t equal better. Parents \u2014 and colleges \u2014 need to encourage students to approach the college search in a thoughtful, intentional way, with fit and match as the goal.With great respect I say to all parents, \u201cRelax.\u201dStudents have many options. Focusing on the narrow list of so-called top colleges ignores the rich diversity of the nation\u2019s higher education choices \u2014 including community colleges, online courses, residential colleges and large research universities.Students often combine study at different types of colleges and accrue credit for all of these varied experiences. Remember, \u201chighly selective\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better for a student \u2014 it just means more selective.When I talk to prospective students and parents, I often quote Frank Sachs, former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling: \u201cCollege is a match to be made, not a prize to be won.\u201d The ideal pairs a student with the school that best fulfills that student\u2019s academic, social and aspirational needs.The best fit is where a student will thrive and be happy.DEB SHAVERDean of Admission, Smith CollegeNorthampton, Mass.More immediately, colleges must stop accepting the Common App, and the \u201cjust another click\u201d ease that it has brought to applying to multiple schools. Finally, colleges must stop trying to have it both ways: Quit selling yourselves to the applicant pool with unending mailings, glossy brochures, slick websites and other promotional efforts, while simultaneously bemoaning how \u201coverwhelming\u201d the odds against admission have become. Indeed, stop promoting yourselves based on those ridiculous selectivity numbers you yourselves bemoan.ERIC M. NELSONNew YorkThough the college I currently attend is vast in both its educational and extracurricular offerings, the feeling that I am not where I am supposed to be has been strong over the past year. The broad liberal arts curriculum, despite its numerous benefits, means that I cannot study in a program more specialized toward my true interests.Raised in a generation where acceptance to a selective college is every parent\u2019s wish and child\u2019s goal, the idea of walking away from my spot at one is almost unheard-of. With the semester coming to an end, the most common question I am asked is, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll regret it?\u201d My answer is always the same: \u201cMaybe, I can\u2019t tell you yet.\u201d I ask myself that question a lot, too, but the decision that I made is the one that is truest to me and my values, and that\u2019s what matters most.SOPHIA ZUPANCWellesley, Mass.There are many paths to success, and where you go to college is only one of many factors. It is indeed a wonderful characteristic of American higher education that there are many paths to getting a college education. But I worry that advice to relax and not aim for a selective college will suggest to talented lower-income and first-generation students, who are underrepresented at these schools, that they shouldn\u2019t worry about aspiring to this when there are significant benefits to doing so, from greater need-based financial aid to higher graduation rates and access to great graduate schools and job opportunities.CATHARINE HILLPoughkeepsie, N.Y.The writer is president of Vassar College and a professor of economics there.STEPHEN J. HAGENGainesville, Fla.Elite colleges must recognize that they tacitly condone the hysteria and be the ones to lead the change. How? Boycott the rankings surveys, curtail the marketing mailings, be frank about how institutions differ, offer prequalification assessments, encourage high school counselors to entice the underrepresented students to apply, pull back the curtain on how decisions are made, and collaborate among yourselves to shift the process in favor of the applicants who are, ultimately, your entire reason for being.H.E. BALLARD-GARDNERTucsonThe only way out of this cycle is to stay grounded: Focus on your work (even during second semester), figure out what you want and need from a school, be nice to your parents and friends (you\u2019ve got only a year left with them), and don\u2019t forget to write thank you notes to your interviewers.CONSTANCE DUVernon Hills, Ill.The writer was admitted to Vanderbilt University\u2019s class of 2020.BLAKE MAGNUSONEvanston, Ill.At this point in the year, one senior after another leaves class to attend \u201caccepted student days\u201d and orientations, scheduled by the colleges without regard to the fact that the high schools are still in session, and we are still doing important work with their future students. The frenzy could be mitigated if due value were placed on the high school years as formative and enriching in their own right, and not solely as a steppingstone.JOAN CALDARERASan FranciscoMONA MOLARSKYNew YorkThe writer is an independent college counselor.At Colorado College, we happily waive the application fee if the amount represents a hardship for families, but we have resisted doing so for all students. Furthermore, we remain committed to our two supplemental essay questions. The first of which simply asks \u201cwhy Colorado College?\u201d and can be answered in a paragraph or more. The second question asks students to be more reflective and to design a class.While we know that we likely lose hundreds of applications a year from students who are unwilling to answer these two prompts, we also believe that students should be able to articulate why our institution (or another) may serve their intellectual needs. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act in which we don\u2019t want our application to be overly burdensome but we also believe that students must be reflective in explaining why they are choosing to apply to Colorado College.MARK J.

She is probably not going to simultaneously be a 5.0 G.P.A. student and get a perfect score on the SAT while winning athletic and musical competitions, developing an effervescent personality and solving world hunger and homelessness. Of course I am being facetious, but not that far from the truth of what we expect from college-bound teenagers these days.I already have an amazing, intelligent, poised child. Why would I want to turn her into a stressed-out, dysfunctional, crazed young adult all in the pursuit of \u201cprestige\u201d?J. ATHANIKARAnn Arbor, Mich.No doubt economics plays a role in the college admission frenzy. As Mr. Nelson points out, our current economy lacks sufficient opportunities for college graduates.

What are we doing to our children? Less than 1 percent of four-year colleges admit less than 10 percent of their applicants, and yet we spend 99 percent of our time talking about those schools.

{"Headline": "Mitsubishi Admits Cheating on Fuel-Economy Tests", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 In the latest scandal to hit the automobile industry, Mitsubishi Motors said on Wednesday that it had cheated on fuel-economy tests for an ultrasmall car it produces in Japan. The company acknowledged that its engineers had intentionally manipulated evaluations.The cheating affected about 620,000 cars sold in the Japanese market starting in 2013, Tetsuro Aikawa, Mitsubishi\u2019s president, said at a news conference.But the problem could stretch beyond that make of car. Mr. Aikawa said that the same testing method, which was in violation of Japanese standards, was used on other models in the country and that Mitsubishi was investigating whether fuel-economy ratings for other lines had been exaggerated as a result.\u201cIt has become clear that improper testing methods were used to improve the appearance of fuel efficiency,\u201d Mr. Aikawa said before he and other company leaders bowed in apology. Company executives called the manipulation of tests on the microcar, called the eK, \u201cintentional.\u201dThe revelation of cheating put the fuel ratings of other Mitsubishi vehicles under scrutiny. Its shares fell 15 percent on Wednesday after the company released a brief statement saying it had engaged in \u201cimproper\u201d fuel-economy reporting. It disclosed the details after the market closed.The cheating at Mitsubishi appears to have been exposed by an unexpected source: another Japanese carmaker, Nissan Motor.Mitsubishi manufactures the eK and sells it at dealerships in Japan. But it also supplies versions of the car to Nissan, which markets them under a different name, the Dayz. Nissan, a larger company with a more extensive dealer network, actually sells more of the vehicles than Mitsubishi does.Such arrangements are increasingly common in the global auto industry, as manufacturers pursue greater scale in an effort to lower costs. And for smaller manufacturers like Mitsubishi, whose sales of 1.2 million vehicles a year make it only the sixth-biggest carmaker in Japan, they can be financially indispensable.Nissan took over development and design work on the eK and Dayz last year. It was then, Mr. Aikawa said, that Nissan\u2019s engineers noticed the discrepancy in the published fuel rating \u2014 ostensibly an impressive 25 to 30 kilometers per liter, or 60 to 70 miles per gallon, depending on the version \u2014 and confronted Mitsubishi. He said the company would pay compensation to Nissan; the amount is subject to negotiation.Mr. Aikawa said he and other top executives were unaware of the manipulation until it was pointed out by Nissan, at which point Mitsubishi began an internal investigation. It remained unclear who ordered the cheating, he said, but Mitsubishi plans to ask an independent commission of experts to conduct a more thorough inquiry.\u201cWe had problems in the past, and we thought that we had overcome them as an organization, but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d said Ryugo Nakao, a Mitsubishi executive vice president in charge of product development.The car is a \u201ckei,\u201d a category of tiny vehicles with engines under 660 cubic centimeters \u2014 smaller and less powerful than many motorcycles \u2014 that is specific to Japan. Subject to lower taxes than full-size cars, keis were introduced in the lean years after World War II to promote car ownership, and they remain popular with budget-conscious buyers.The manipulation of the eK\u2019s fuel rating involved the way Mitsubishi calculated the effect of wind and tire resistance during simulations. Resistance fluctuates, depending on a car\u2019s speed and other conditions, and makers are supposed to operate test vehicles in a way that produces an average over the course of a test. That, presumably, gives a result closer to real-world conditions.But Mitsubishi said it had secretly used a test method that can produce lower resistance and can make the vehicle appear to travel farther on less fuel. It said that it had used the same method on an unspecified number of other models, and that it was examining test results dating to 2002 to determine if they were faulty.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, which regulates the automobile industry, said the method Mitsubishi used differed from Japan\u2019s nationally mandated standard.Many countries, including the United States, set their own detailed rules for fuel-economy testing, and Mr. Nakao said Mitsubishi, like other carmakers, tested the cars it makes for export with methods different from those used on cars it sells in Japan. But he said Mitsubishi would also review the fuel-economy standards it had reported overseas for possible discrepancies.Mr. Nakao said the method that Mitsubishi used to calculate resistance was similar to the standard used in the United States. The United States and Japan both conduct their fuel-economy tests in a laboratory setting, using a device called a dynamometer in which the car\u2019s wheels rest on large rollers that can simulate driving uphill or other road conditions.The United States test involves driving at higher speeds and with harder acceleration to mimic Interstate driving, said Ryan Harty, an environmental project manager at American Honda in Torrance, Calif. As a result, official gas-mileage ratings in Japan are usually higher than those determined by the Environmental Protection Agency, he said.\u201cThe results in Japan come out quite high, and customers know that and accept it,\u201d Mr. Harty said. \u201cU.S. customers want to get the same mileage as the number on the window sticker.\u201dMitsubishi\u2019s admission is the latest blow to the credibility of automakers, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at AutoTrader.\u201cThis has left a cloud over the auto industry that suggests it isn\u2019t honest,\u201d Ms. Krebs said. \u201cIt leads consumers and regulators to be suspicious.\u201dVolkswagen is still reeling after its acknowledgment in September that it had equipped millions of cars worldwide with software intended to cheat on tailpipe emissions tests. The vehicles spewed far more pollutants than allowed under federal standards.Ms. Krebs said the willingness to take shortcuts reflected difficulties that automakers face as they strive to meet new standards for emissions and fuel economy that regulators in Europe, the United States and elsewhere have set.\u201cThere\u2019s intense pressure to reach these standards,\u201d she said, \u201cand some are doing it by not actually having the performance to back it up.\u201dNeal E.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Wins Wisconsin Democratic Primary, Adding to Momentum", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySenator Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday, his sixth straight victory in the Democratic nominating contest and the latest in a string of setbacks for Mrs. Clinton as she seeks to put an end to a prolonged race against an unexpectedly deft and well-funded competitor.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat does not significantly dent her comfortable lead in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination. But the loss underscores her problems connecting with young and white working-class voters who have gravitated to Mr. Sanders\u2019s economic message \u2014 a message he will now take to economically depressed parts of New York State ahead of the April 19 primary there.Mr. Sanders\u2019s victory came after he had hardly left Wisconsin in recent days, pouring his energy and resources into securing a win that would help him put to rest any doubts that he could capture a major primary state, and providing his campaign with renewed focus as he strives for an upset in New York, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s adopted home state.He used his victory speech to remind voters of how far his long-shot candidacy had come, defining the word \"momentum\" as exceeding the expectations set by a skeptical news media and establishment political class. \u201cMomentum is starting this campaign 11 months ago and the media determining that we were a \u2018fringe\u2019 candidacy,\u201d Mr. Sanders told a crowd of more than 2,000 on a college campus in Wyoming, which holds its caucuses on Saturday and where he is also favored to win. \u201cDo not tell Secretary Clinton \u2014 she\u2019s getting a\u00a0little\u00a0nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe we\u2019ve got an excellent chance to win New York and a lot of delegates in that state.\u201dHis victory signaled vulnerabilities that have trailed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy amid persistent criticism of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks and her email practices while serving as secretary of state. In Wisconsin, Mr. Sanders held a significant edge among voters who said they wanted a candidate who cares about people like them. Nine in 10 voters said the Vermont senator was honest and trustworthy, compared with six in 10 who said the same about Mrs. Clinton, according to exit polls of voters from Edison Research.Wisconsin provided a friendly setting for Mr. Sanders\u2019s brand of economic populism. Liberals made up two-thirds of the overwhelmingly white Democratic primary voters, and the economy, followed by income inequality, topped the list of voters\u2019 concerns, according to exit polls.As Mrs. Clinton shifted focus to New York, Mr. Sanders embarked on a week of campaigning through Wisconsin, speaking to crowds of thousands in Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay and La Crosse and visiting more sparsely populated or rural areas like Eau Claire, Onalaska and Wausau.Mrs. Clinton spent most of her time in the state in Milwaukee, where she held a discussion about gun violence at Tabernacle Community Baptist Church alongside black mothers who had lost children to gun violence or clashes with the police.About seven in 10 black voters in Wisconsin, mostly concentrated in Milwaukee, supported Mrs. Clinton. She also outpolled Mr. Sanders among voters over 45. Mr. Sanders won among men, younger voters, independents and white voters.Mr. Sanders also captured a majority of voters who said the economy was the most important issue, and about two-thirds of those who cited income inequality. The more than four in 10 voters who said trade with other countries took away from American jobs favored Mr. Sanders by a large margin, exit polls showed.Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides said his victory in Wisconsin signaled that his anti-trade message would appeal in areas of upstate New York that have been eviscerated by companies\u2019 moving jobs overseas. \u201cThere are parts of western New York that have been severely hurt by these bad trade deals that the secretary has consistently supported,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager.The victory on Tuesday, like most of Mr. Sanders\u2019s recent wins, was expected to bring a deluge of online donations to his campaign, allowing it to buy television ads in expensive media markets in New York and in Pennsylvania, which votes on April 26.In March, Mr. Sanders raised $44 million mostly from small-dollar Internet donations, compared with $29.5 million raised by Mrs. Clinton, who has frequently left the campaign trail to attend fund-raising events, including one on Tuesday night in the Bronx, asking donors for the maximum of $2,700 per person.The Sanders campaign spent more than $3.3 million on ads in Wisconsin, roughly $1 million more than the Clinton campaign, according to Kantar Media.But Wisconsin, with a population that is 88 percent white, does not reflect the larger and more diverse populations of New York and Pennsylvania, more comfortable terrain for Mrs. Clinton. In 2008, Barack Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton in Wisconsin by 17 percentage points. As Mr. Sanders focused on winning Wisconsin, Mrs. Clinton courted African-Americans in New York on Sunday by visiting black churches. Mr. Weaver rejected the notion that Mr. Sanders performed well only in overwhelmingly white states, pointing to victories in Michigan and Hawaii. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said on Monday that Mr. Sanders\u2019s unlikely path to the nomination would amount to \u201coverturning the will of the voters\u201d by trying to flip pledged delegates at state and party conventions, as was done in Nevada.Even with his recent resounding wins in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Hawaii and Wisconsin, Mr. Sanders would need an estimated 56 percent of the remaining pledged delegates to overtake Mrs. Clinton. The preliminary Wisconsin results gave 45 pledged delegates to Mr. Sanders and 31 to Mrs. Clinton, who maintains a lead of roughly 250 delegates.The contest in New York is expected to be a rough-and-tumble one. After weeks of bickering, the Sanders and Clinton campaigns agreed to hold a debate in Brooklyn on April 14, less than a week before New Yorkers head to the polls. Mr. Sanders is planning a rally in Washington Square Park in Manhattan the day before.And while Mrs. Clinton is a battle-tested veteran of New York\u2019s voracious news media, Mr. Sanders is not, and only recently has he gotten a taste of how tough it can be.In an interview with the editorial board of The Daily News last week, he struggled to provide the specifics of his plan to break up the Wall Street banks. He was even stumped about how to ride the New York City subway. \u201cYou get a token and you get in,\u201d he said, even though tokens were long ago replaced by MetroCards.\u201cNew Yorkers don\u2019t really care all that much about what other folks do,\u201d Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said about the effects of the Wisconsin results on New York. \u201cNo one has ever said, \u2018As Wisconsin goes so goes New York.\u2019 \u201dYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used.\u201cThe scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,\u201d said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. \u201cWhen we get better economies of scale, we\u2019ll use that to our advantage.\u201dThis economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.Google charges pennies for search ads and spends $9.9 billion annually building out a global computing business. Given enough software, in the realm of millionths of pennies, it could do even better. Good luck to any new entrant without the scale of these tech giants, however, as customers come to expect that sort of cheap metering.Cloud-computing companies are not the only ones focused on the small. Banks, of course, have for years been content taking a sliver of big transactions, so long as there are many of them. Uber, which enables private cars to temporarily become taxis, can monitor drivers and riders to adjust prices and routes, changing the value of things throughout the day. An auto insurance company called Metromile charges customers based on how many miles they drive a year.As tech companies get better at measuring things, other businesses can pick up on the techniques, and the fine counting at the big clouds augurs for more precise measurements and pricing everywhere. Mitch Hedberg\u2019s joke about rice being a good meal when you are hungry for 2,000 of something may turn out to be a prophecy.A.W.S. was an early leader in public cloud computing, or renting access to computing equipment or software over an Internet connection. It started in 2006 as a barely noted fluke by Amazon. It now has over two million computer servers and a million customers, including Netflix, Shell and Brooks Brothers.The per-millionth pricing began last November, in the A.W.S. product Lambda. Lambda runs a customer\u2019s line of code in response to a request, like looking up a ZIP code when given an address. Customers never rent servers, but pay for the moments of computing.Microsoft last month announced that it would have its own \u201cserverless\u201d product. Google has something similar in early release, which is likely to be a product by the third quarter of this year.Microsoft is even trying to do A.W.S. one better by microslicing the cost to rent some of its software licenses into the minutes of actual use. \u201cWe\u2019re renting the sand and charging for the sun\u2019s UV rays that hit you,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, who runs Microsoft\u2019s cloud.For the big clouds, microslicing is also a way of coping with a tough task: Customers have to feel like they can rent all the computing they want, and the providers must always run at near full capacity. If someone is using cycles, and not whole machines, more people can be packed in.\u201cThe secret to cloud economics is utilization \u2014 every minute unsold is money you don\u2019t get back,\u201d said Greg DeMichillie, the head of product for Google\u2019s cloud. \u201cThere are very few of us who can work at this scale.\u201dLike any important new tech trend, the microsliced, serverless model is already attracting investors and start-ups eager to work in the new world \u2014 and in this case, wary of what the giants will do next.An Oakland, Calif., company called Serverless makes software that other engineers can use to develop products for computing in Lambda and its ilk. \u201cWe think this could be the focal point of A.W.S., even though I have no idea how they make money charging this little,\u201d said Austen Collins, the founder of Serverless.One way they make money is by adding on other products and servers. So does Mr. Collins think A.W.S. could thwart his business? \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think Amazon won\u2019t be in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018What if Amazon does it?\u2019 We assume they will, and try to do something a little better and faster.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, Bernie Sanders Knows Something About Breaking Up Banks", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceIn the interview, with The Daily News\u2019s editorial board, Mr. Sanders does appear to get tangled up in some details and lacks clarity. Breaking up the banks would involve arcane and complex regulatory moves that can trip up any banking policy wonk, let alone a presidential candidate. But, taken as a whole, Mr. Sanders\u2019s answers seem to make sense. Crucially, his answers mostly track with a reasonably straightforward breakup plan that he introduced to Congress last year.Here are the most relevant parts of the exchange.The Daily News comes back to the mechanics of breaking up the banks.Mr. Sanders\u2019s recognition here of the need for legislation is significant. Many banking experts say that Congress would need to pass a new law to give regulators the explicit authority to introduce direct caps on bank size. The Federal Reserve has introduced many measures since the financial crisis of 2008 that have created incentives for banks to shrink \u2014 and many banks are declining in size.The problematic word for Mr. Sanders in his answer above is \u201cor.\u201dIt suggests he believes that the secretary of the Treasury, using powers already given under Dodd-Frank, can press the banks to break up even without new legislation. This might be an option he\u2019d take if Congress refused to pass new breakup legislation. Under Dodd-Frank, the Fed could in theory raise its capital requirements to such a high level for the largest banks that they quickly decide to break themselves up. But such a path might face stiff legal resistance. As a result, Mr. Sanders\u2019s apparent suggestion that the Treasury secretary could act unilaterally might betray a weak grasp of Dodd-Frank. Or he may simply be confused about what it contains.It makes sense for Mr. Sanders to hedge here about the Fed. The Daily News asks if the Fed has that power \u201cnow.\u201d As we have seen, the Fed currently has a lot of power but maybe not all the power it might require to break up the banks without facing serious legal challenges from the financial industry. And Mr. Sanders is also correct that an administration can obtain that power \u2014 that is what his bill is for.Mr. Sanders is mostly cogent here. This is more or less how a breakup would work under his legislation. Doing what he outlines here would be far easier if Congress passed his breakup bill, or something like it. Mr. Sanders is on shaky ground if he thinks it would be easy to slash the size of the banks with Dodd-Frank alone. But, taking the interview as a whole, as well as his past positions, that does not appear to be the path he favors.Advertisement"}

She already owns 49.9 percent of Banco de Fomento Angola, indirectly through Unitel, an Angolan telecommunications company that she jointly owns with Sonangol, the Angolan state oil company.The deal was announced to stock market regulators just before a midnight Sunday deadline that had been set by the European Central Bank to force BPI either to reduce its exposure in Angola or to provision fully for the debt of Banco de Fomento Angola. Had it not met the deadline, BPI would have faced heavy fines for falling short of the European Central Bank\u2019s new rules.In a short statement, BPI said the deal provided \u201ca solution to the breach of the large exposures limit\u201d set by the European Central Bank.BPI reported a profit last year of 236 million euros, or about $269 million, with a strong contribution from Banco de Fomento Angola. However, the fall in oil prices has been hitting the economy of oil-producing Angola, raising concerns over the level of provisions in its banking sector.This year, Fernando Ulrich, the president of BPI, told a news conference that his bank would \u201cexamine the conditions\u201d once Novo Banco was put back on sale. The Socialist government of Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa, which came into office in late 2015, is hoping to sell Novo Banco after a failed auction last year under the previous, conservative administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Recovery\u2019s Two Sides: Weak Growth Even as Hiring Surges", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byThe nation\u2019s gross domestic product advanced at a mere 0.5 percent annual growth rate during the first quarter after a mediocre increase for the final quarter of 2015, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday, suggesting that the economy is stalled.But the job market, according to Labor Department figures released in recent months, appears to be at its healthiest point since the boom of the late 1990s.Which picture is right?On one side of the equation, hiring and wages \u2014 of particular importance to the 95 percent of the labor force that already has a job \u2014 are moving firmly in the right direction. On the other, the economy\u2019s expansion continues to be lackluster: The pace of growth in the first quarter was the slowest in two years.Both yardsticks contain a measure of truth. And the explanation is the apparent lack of improvement in productivity \u2014 the output of individual workers \u2014 despite dazzling advances in Silicon Valley, America\u2019s technological frontier, and a continuing economic recovery that is nearing its seventh anniversary.For now, at least, many businesses, are finding it more advantageous to hire more workers than to invest in new technology or equipment to increase output and meet growing demand.In the short term, this could be seen as a positive, especially with millions of Americans just now coming back into the job market after being sidelined during and after the Great Recession.But in the long term, this phenomenon threatens to undermine the nation\u2019s prosperity, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.\u201cEconomists view productivity growth and technological change as driving improvements in standards of living over time,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cA permanent slowdown in productivity growth would suggest that living standards rise more slowly.\u201dHe noted that productivity had been increasing at an annual rate of about half a percentage point over the last five years. That is well below the Internet-driven 2.5 percent gains recorded annually in the second half of the 1990s, and below the more typical 1.5 percent rate of productivity gains in previous decades.\u201cWe can tell stories about why it\u2019s so weak, but nobody really knows,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201c\u201cI think productivity growth can rebound, but the fear is that it won\u2019t.\u201dWhatever the answer, it\u2019s clear that businesses have grown much more wary of new investments recently, and the clearest evidence of that has emerged in the last two quarters.Much of the recent downturn in business spending is a result of much lower prices for oil, metals and other commodities, and fears of a slowdown in China and elsewhere around the world that are putting a crimp on investment opportunities.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any danger of recession, but the global economy and commodities are weak,\u201d said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC. \u201cThe global commodity shock has affected growth in the U.S. in a way that was unexpected, especially in terms of the energy industry.\u201dStill, Mr. Logan said, \u201cThe consumer is fundamentally sound, as is the housing market.\u201dHe added: \u201cThings are O.K. domestically, with growth in sectors like leisure, health care and technology, and spending is moving along steadily.\u201dIn a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits last week rose by 9,000 to 257,000. Despite the increase, the number was slightly smaller than expected, and new jobless claims remained very close to lows last seen in the early 1970s.The first-quarter results reinforced what has become something of an annual economic rite in recent years \u2014 a weak first quarter, followed by optimistic predictions that a rebound is just around the corner. (The gross domestic product report on Thursday is the first of three estimates; subsequent revisions could move the number significantly higher or lower.)In 2015, the economy barely grew early on, recovered its footing in the spring and summer, but finished the year with a mediocre growth rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter.The optimists may be right that growth will pick up for the rest of 2016 as it did last year, but the trajectory of the economic recovery remains frustratingly uneven. And over all, the growth in the United States has been lackluster ever since the nation pulled out of recession in 2009.After a shaky start to this year, the stock market has rebounded and energy prices have stabilized, providing some comfort to the oil industry, which has undergone big cuts in hiring and investment in Texas, Oklahoma and other oil patch areas.Recession fears, which dominated the headlines and fixated traders on Wall Street three months ago, have largely faded. Volatility in Europe and Asian markets has also eased.In the United States, after years of stagnation, wages are perking up.While ADP\u2019s figures show a bigger increase than similar government metrics for the entire working population, the basic message from the data is the same: As labor markets tighten, American workers are finally getting a raise.\u201cWe have good momentum in terms of the job market,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, ADP\u2019s head of research.On Wednesday, Federal Reserve policy makers put off any move to raise interest rates, in part because of the persistent weakness in growth. But in a statement after the meeting, they acknowledged crosscurrents in the economy.\u201cLabor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed,\u201d the Fed concluded, adding that household income, consumer sentiment and the housing sector all looked reasonably healthy.Despite the overall improvement, there is plenty of pain in some corners of the economy.Factories shed nearly 50,000 jobs in February and March, wiping out all of the gains recorded last year. The proportion of Americans in the active labor force remains depressed by historical standards, and more than six million workers say they are in part-time positions because they cannot find full-time work.But for the winners in the American economy, be they individuals or companies, there is a lot less to complain about these days.\u201cSince we launched four years ago, our business has been growing like a rocket ship,\u201d said Bayard Winthrop, chief executive of American Giant, which makes sweatshirts, T-shirts and other types of activewear at mills in North Carolina.American Giant is focused on casual, comfortable clothes, and eschews stores in favor of direct sales through its website. \u201cMade in U.S.A. really appeals to people,\u201d Mr. Winthrop said.His company has more than 300 employees and \u201cwe are hiring sewers as fast as we can,\u201d Mr. Winthrop said. \u201cGrowth has not been our problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cramped and Costly Bay Area, Cries to Build, Baby, Build", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "An activist who calls her group BARF is pushing for more housing, pitting cranky homeowners and the political establishment against newcomers who want the region to make room for them, too.Supported bySan Francisco does not have enough places to live. Sonja Trauss, a local activist, thinks the city should tackle this problem by building more housing.This may not sound like a controversial idea. But this is San Francisco.Ms. Trauss is a self-described anarchist and the head of the SF Bay Area Renters\u2019 Federation, an upstart political group that is pushing for more development. Its platform is simple: Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.Ms. Trauss supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. \u201cYou have to support building, even when it\u2019s a type of building you hate,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.\u201dThe organization also inflamed Sierra Club volunteers in San Francisco by trying to elect its own pro-development candidate to the environmental group\u2019s executive committee. That effort failed, and last week her candidate, Donald Dewsnup, was arrested and charged with voter fraud \u2014 a move that Ms. Trauss claims is political retaliation. \u201cThere\u2019s no other explanation for why the district attorney of a major city would investigate and charge one person for registering at an inaccurate address,\u201d she said.In an interview, Mr. Dewsnup said he was homeless and simply used an address near the place where he was sleeping at the time.Across the country, a reversal in urban flight has ignited debates over gentrification, wealth, generational change and the definition of the modern city. It\u2019s a familiar battle in suburbs, where not-in-my-backyard homeowners are an American archetype.In San Francisco, though, things get weird. Here the tech boom is clashing with tough development laws and resentment from established residents who want to choke off growth to prevent further change.Ms. Trauss is the result: a new generation of activist whose pro-market bent is the opposite of the San Francisco stereotypes \u2014 the lefties, the aging hippies and tolerance all around.Ms. Trauss\u2019s cause, more or less, is to make life easier for real estate developers by rolling back zoning regulations and environmental rules. Her opponents are a generally older group of progressives who worry that an influx of corporate techies is turning a city that nurtured the Beat Generation into a gilded resort for the rich.Those groups oppose almost every new development except those reserved for subsidized affordable housing. But for many young professionals who are too rich to qualify for affordable housing, but not rich enough to afford $5,000-a-month rents, this is the problem.Adding to the strangeness is that the typical San Francisco progressive and the typical mid-20s-to-early-30s member of Ms. Trauss\u2019s group are likely to have identical positions on every liberal touchstone, like same-sex marriage and climate change, and yet they have become bitter enemies on one very big issue: housing.\u201cWe have liberal Democrats, and very liberal Democrats, and yet we are as polarized as the rest of the country,\u201d said Tim Colen, executive director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition.Ms. Trauss is smart and energetic and unpolished. She called her group the Bay Area Renters\u2019 Federation because \u201cfederation\u201d reminds her of \u201cStar Trek\u201d and because her roommate thought it would be funny if her group\u2019s acronym spelled \u201cBARF.\u201dThis might make it tempting to dismiss Ms. Trauss as just another colorful activist in a place where activism is a local sport. But the anger she has tapped into is real, reflecting a generational break that pits cranky homeowners and the San Francisco political establishment against a cast of newcomers who are demanding the region make room for them, too.Every few weeks, when a company like Zillow puts out a new price report, both sides hold up the numbers as an example of how San Francisco has failed the middle class. Zillow puts the city\u2019s median home price at $1.1 million, neck and neck with Manhattan. The region\u2019s rent, at $3,500 a month for an average apartment, is the highest in the nation.\u201cBARF is an important voice in this housing debate, and that is the voice of young people who are asking the question: \u2018What is my future in this city?\u2019\u201d said Scott Wiener, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. \u201cAnd you can agree or disagree with them, but they have activated a new generation of pro-housing activists.\u201dThe group\u2019s build-more platform may be politically contentious, but economically speaking, it is anything but controversial. The Bay Area was expensive even before the tech boom. And the supply of new projects, while increasing, remains decades behind population growth.Much of San Francisco\u2019s progressive establishment feels the city is building too much market-rate housing. Some go so far as to argue that the appetite for real estate here is so high that supply-and-demand rules don\u2019t really apply.To get prices down, \u201cYou\u2019d have to, like, build another city on top of the city,\u201d said David Campos, a progressive-wing member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He thinks the city should focus the vast majority of future development on affordable housing limited to people making well below the city\u2019s median income.\u201cMany housing programs \u2014 vouchers, rent control and inclusionary housing \u2014 attempt to make housing more affordable without increasing the overall supply,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis approach does very little to address the underlying cause of California\u2019s high housing costs: a housing shortage.\u201dMs. Trauss, 34, is a born activist from Philadelphia whose father is a lawyer who defends low-income homeowners against foreclosure. She moved to the Bay Area in 2011, shortly after getting her master\u2019s degree in economics from Washington University in St. Louis, and taught math at local community colleges. She intended to live in San Francisco, but settled across the bay in Oakland.Today BARF is her full-time job, allowing her the financial wherewithal to become one of those strangely persistent people who speak regularly at City Hall. To an outside observer, this can feel like watching an obscure and slow-moving sport.This is a town with an app for everything and where people get fussy when an Uber driver takes more than five minutes to arrive. City Hall, with its Beaux-Arts architecture and government-grade wait times, can feel like an anachronism.Ms. Trauss may be a plugged-in millennial, but she loves it. \u201cEven in this modern era of, whatever, the Internet and people like interacting in a place that\u2019s no place at all, City Hall is still a center,\u201d she said.One recent afternoon, she spent an hour on the hard wooden benches in the chamber of the Board of Supervisors. She was there to make a two-minute public comment in favor of a dull-but-important proposal to streamline the permitting process for some affordable-housing projects.Three days later she was back, this time to support a \u201cdensity bonus\u201d \u2014 a proposal to let developers build taller buildings in exchange for including more affordable housing as well. When she arrived, Mr. Campos, from the Board of Supervisors, was blasting the proposal from the City Hall steps, surrounded by 70 or so supporters.Ms. Trauss and another member of her group stood opposite and held up signs that said \u201cStop Affordable Housing.\u201d This was meant to be ironic. Their point was that Mr. Campos was opposing legislation that would create more market-rate housing \u2014 but also more affordable housing.Nobody seemed to get it, so Ms. Trauss went inside City Hall to add her name to a list of people making public comments before the planning commission. Her chance to speak would be hours away, so she trekked around City Hall, past bronze busts and wedding parties, in search of a quiet place to take a lunch break. She was joined by a man whose legal name is Starchild.Starchild is the sort of only-in-San Francisco character you end up making friends with if you spend enough time at City Hall. He works nights as an \u201cerotic service provider.\u201d Asked if this meant he was a prostitute, he said, \u201c\u2018Prostitute\u2019 is O.K. as long as it\u2019s said in a respectful way.\u201d Starchild spends his days campaigning for libertarian causes and running doomed campaigns for office.\u201cThis is my life,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dMany longtime San Franciscans view groups like BARF as yet another example of how the technology industry is robbing San Francisco of its San Francisco-ness. Far from the hippies of the 1960s, many of today\u2019s migrants lean libertarian \u2014 drawn by start-up dreams or to work for the likes of Google or Apple, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They tend to share a belief, either idealistically or na\u00efvely, depending on who is judging, that corporations can be a force for social good and change.But BARF members are so single-minded about housing that they can be hard to label politically. They view San Francisco progressives as, in fact, fundamentally conservative. That is because, to the group members at least, progressive positions on housing seem less about building the city and more about keeping people like them out.On a drizzly Sunday in December, Ms. Trauss hosted the SF YIMBYParty Congress, a gathering of pro-housing groups held at a Market Street co-working space full of start-up touches like mismatched furniture, a foosball table and lots of white men. Toward the beginning, a debate broke out about whether they should call themselves moderates to distinguish themselves from progressives.Ms. Trauss joked that she liked moderate because you can shorten it to mod, and mod sounds cool. Mr. Wiener, the supervisor, disagreed, noting that in San Francisco, a moderate Democrat \u201cmight have a Bernie Sanders sticker on their car.\u201dOne man, who seemed exasperated by the discussion and the idea of using his Sunday to talk about politics, said, with more colorful language, that he did not give a hoot about progressives versus moderates \u2014 he just wanted some darn housing.The tech boom takes much of the blame for soaring housing prices. But the pro-development movement has less to do with tech as an industry, and everything to do with newcomers as a class.Brian Hanlon, a federation member who regularly attends Board of Supervisors meetings with Ms. Trauss, has a day job doing administrative work for the United States Forest Service. Two years ago, when he started worrying that his claim to an $835-a-month room in a rent-controlled apartment might be in jeopardy, he reacted in classic San Francisco fashion. He started marching in anti-eviction protests next to people beating drums and signs that said things like \u201cTech = Death.\u201dBut he quickly broke ranks. Many of his fellow protesters also opposed building new apartments \u2014 putting him at odds with them.\u201cThey want to be on the side of tenants, but they don\u2019t have any real plan for how do we become a welcoming metropolitan area for new people who don\u2019t have money,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cTheir plans are only to allow current incumbent renters to stay in their place, presumably until they die and some rich person comes along.\u201dThe progressive movement has played a guiding role in creating the quirky and picturesque San Francisco that many people love today. Progressives battled plans to crisscross the city with freeways and opposed urban renewal programs that destroyed black neighborhoods. They have fought for, and won, rent-control protections and funding for affordable housing, along with various open-space amenities that many newcomers take for granted.The question is how to handle a long-run demographic reversal in which cities across the country have regained population following years of \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs. After losing population for two decades through the 1970s, San Francisco resumed growth in the \u201980s and has only accelerated from there.\u201cThere\u2019s that book, \u2018What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u2019\u201d said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, an urban policy research organization. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with San Francisco? Why is it that in a city that\u2019s two-thirds renters we have adopted a housing policy that is horrible for renters?\u201dOf the 11 propositions on San Francisco\u2019s ballot in November, seven were either directly or indirectly related to high home prices and the influence of the technology industry. Michael Hankinson, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate who is studying land-use and housing prices, surveyed voters for his dissertation and found renters skeptical that new development would do anything other than raise prices.For instance, a recent proposal to temporarily stop market-rate development in the city\u2019s Mission District, a gentrifying neighborhood popular with technology workers, failed citywide. But Mr. Hankinson found that a majority of renters favored it because they did not think that new development would do anything for them \u2014 and feared that it might, somehow, get them evicted.\u201cBARF has to convince renters that neighborhood change will benefit them in the long run,\u201d he said. Today, when eviction is a hot party topic, most renters are unwilling to take that gamble.So Ms. Trauss is taking her campaign to the courts. In December she sued the city of Lafayette, Calif., an East Bay bedroom community, after it took a parcel that had been set aside for higher-density apartments and office buildings and rezoned it for single-family homes instead.She wrote the petition herself, saying the move violated the California Housing Accountability Act, a 1980s law and \u201canti-Nimby\u201d statute that limits cities\u2019 ability to downsize housing developments. Recently, she hired a lawyer to litigate the case.Asked about Ms. Trauss\u2019s lawsuit, Steven Falk, Lafayette\u2019s city manager, said the city actually faced another lawsuit over the same development.

{"Headline": "\u2018American Amnesia,\u2019 by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byIf Bernie Sanders were a book by two leading politics professors, it would be \u201cAmerican Amnesia.\u201d This is the story of how government helped make America great, how the enthusiasm for bashing government is behind its current malaise and how a return to effective government is the answer the nation is looking for.How America came to forget about the merits of good government, and the price now being paid, is the meat of \u201cAmerican Amnesia,\u201d the third book by Jacob S. Hacker (Yale) and Paul Pierson (Berkeley), whom Bill Moyers calls the \u201cSherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson of political science.\u201d According to these academic detectives, America\u2019s amnesia is no accident. The country has been brainwashed by a powerful alliance of forces hostile to government: big business, especially Wall Street, spending unparalleled lobbying dollars to advance its narrow self-\u00adinterest; a new wealthy elite propagating wrongheaded Ayn Randian notions that free markets are always good and government always bad; and a Republican Party using a strategy of attacking and weakening government as a way to win more power for itself.You don\u2019t need to Feel the Bern to take this book seriously. The unexpected popularity of both the senator from Vermont and Donald Trump in this year\u2019s primaries arguably reflects their tapping into widespread anger toward the American establishment. \u201cAmerican Amnesia\u201d provides chapter and verse on why the public has good reason to be angry.For the country\u2019s first 200 years, Americans combined healthy skepticism about government with an acceptance of its necessity. Today conservatives, in particular, have \u201cforgotten\u201d that balanced view. Woodrow Wilson, No.\u202f1 on Glenn Beck\u2019s list of \u201cTop 10 Bastards of All Time\u201d (above Hitler, Pontius Pilate, Pol Pot), actually ushered in valuable improvements in government. His innovations \u2014 the Federal Reserve and income tax, trustbusting the robber barons \u2014 paid off handsomely. By the 1950s, America was leading the world across a \u201cGreat Divide\u201d separating centuries of \u201cslow growth, poor health and anemic technological progress\u201d from \u201chitherto undreamed-of material comfort and seemingly limitless economic potential.\u201dAmerica has always had freewheeling entrepreneurial capitalists. Hacker and Pierson argue persuasively that the 20th-century change that enabled them to create extraordinary wealth for all was \u201ceffective governance\u201d \u2014 reflected in such crucial foundations of a \u201cmixed economy\u201d as better physical infrastructure, health care and education for the \u00admasses, and generous funding for \u201cblue skies research\u201d that made possible everything from antibiotics to the Internet.As recently as the 1950s, government was broadly appreciated by Americans. In his first State of the Union address, the Republican president Dwight Eisenhower mentioned \u201cgovernment\u201d nearly 40 times, almost always positively. Such sentiments were even shared by business. The \u00adbosses of great companies, like Kodak and General Motors, worked closely with government through the Committee for Economic Development to solve the country\u2019s most pressing problems. Yet by the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was memorably saying the \u201cmost terrifying words\u201d in the English language were \u201cI\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d As the public mood changed, the Democrats soon joined in, though without wholly embracing the Republican philosophy. In his first State of the Union, Bill Clinton mentioned government only around half as often as Eisenhower, mostly negatively.Clinton felt he had to declare that \u201cthe era of big government is over\u201d \u2014 even though it had already shrunk considerably: By 1989 there was only one federal government worker for every 110 Americans, compared with one for 78 in Eisenhower\u2019s day (and around one for 150 today). Now America is paying the price for beating up its government, Hacker and Pierson argue. It is sliding down international rankings of social progress that it used to top, in areas like public health and education. America ranks only 25th in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for the share of 3-year-olds in early childhood education, for example.Hacker and Pierson highlight three main prongs of the Republican attack: \u201cDenounce crony capitalism\u201d while catering to narrow business interests; \u201cFeed political dysfunction and win by railing against it\u201d; and \u201cUndermine the capacity of government to perform its vital functions\u201d and at the same time \u201cdecry a bungling and corrupt public sector.\u201dStill, the authors are suffering their own amnesia about the troubled state of the economy and American business during the 1970s, which is when the public fell out of love with government. This gets only a few pages, with observations like \u201cthe decade was not the economic wasteland it is often remembered as today.\u201d Yet experiencing stagflation and other economic troubles for the first time in the era of mass prosperity provided ample reason for Americans to question the prevailing mixed-economy orthodoxy and ask whether government was overreaching.What\u2019s more, for all that bashing, government has become the dominant American political narrative, and for all the Randian resources deployed by the Koch brothers and others, antigovernment \u00adforces have been unable to stop the current Democratic president from introducing a huge expansion of government in health care, and then getting re-elected. The authors also bury near the end their surprising belief that despite everything, as a society, \u201cwe really have never had it so good.\u201dThen there is the excessive nostalgia for the heyday of trade unionism. While Hacker and Pierson acknowledge the negative role played by teachers unions in blocking education reforms that might have kept America higher in those international performance rankings, that fact gets barely one sentence. And as for Wall Street, they are too one-sided the other way. Though Wall Street deserves much blame for the crash of 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession, the financial sector is not all a giant rip-off. Many of its innovations over the past 50 years have been adopted around the world because they can yield significant economic benefits.As for solutions, Hacker and Pierson say \u201cthere is no magic bullet.\u201d They offer several sensible suggestions \u2014 further limit the use of filibusters in the Senate; institute campaign finance reform; make it easier for people to vote; introduce regulatory reform to tackle today\u2019s robber barons in finance, energy and health care. Yet their big call is for a new, broad-based movement to restore America\u2019s love for effective government \u2014 the modern successor to the Progressives of a century ago.Is this realistic? There are a few hopeful straws in the wind. The popularity of Bernie Sanders with younger voters hints at a generational change in attitudes. Some enlightened business leaders \u2014 Bill Gates, Howard Schultz, Marc Benioff \u2014 are emerging as a different sort of role models, on issues like inequality, the treatment of veterans and gay rights. Perhaps the unexpected strength of Donald Trump will provide a wake-up call \u2014 if it isn\u2019t already too late \u2014 to the Republican establishment, reminding it that if all you ever do is bash government, you risk creating a vacuum that may be filled by something you will really want to forget.Matthew Bishop is a senior editor at the Economist Group and the author of several books on economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear of Crying: The Problem of Babies and Airplanes", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Dr. Perri Klass on family health.Welcome to Well Family, Well\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new home for news about parenting, child health and relationships with advice from our experts to help every family live well.First of all, nobody takes a small child on an airplane for the fun of it. I have been there and I know. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no airplane saint; you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t generally catch me offering to hold someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kid, or making friends around the seatback. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually admit to being a pediatrician, for fear of hearing a medical saga. But I have put in my time on airplanes with my own infants and toddlers and small children, and I certainly know how it feels.Probably the best thing that can be said for traveling with young children is that it teaches you to appreciate traveling without them, however puzzling the inflight announcements, however long the delays, however tightly spaced the seats. I did enough economy-class traveling with children while my own were young that my reflexive reaction to all flight cancellations, turbulence or the moment when the person in front of me reclines the seat very suddenly, knocking my laptop closed, is now: At least I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a small child with me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thank heavens.Babies do not cry on airplanes for the fun of it either. Nor do they cry, by and large, to let you know that their parents are neglectful or callous. They cry for infant versions of the same reasons that adults snap at one another about reclining seats, or elbow each other with quiet savagery over the armrest. They cry because their ears hurt and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being made to stay in a certain position when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to or the air smells strange and the noises are loud, or their stomachs feel upset or the day has been too long and they still aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there yet or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just plain cranky. As are we all.Crying is an evolutionary strategy to summon adult aid; over millennia, crying has probably evolved to be hard to ignore. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any comfort, but when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the parent with the crying baby, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly help to be an expert.Many children behave remarkably well \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even delightfully \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on airplanes. Many more manage pretty well, but occasionally give way to despair. Many parents are full of interventions and distractions. All of this deserves at least a smile or a word of praise.So do your best, and let people see that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing your best. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf your child is crying, start talking to the people around you, explain to them how bad you feel, ask the flight attendant if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a seat somewhere else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Neumann suggested. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore they get angry around you, tell them you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sorry, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing the best you can and likely they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be on your side.\u00e2\u0080\u009dParents sometimes wonder about sedating babies, usually with antihistamines, and pediatricians advise against that. In general, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not good to give extra medications to the young. The effects can be unpredictable, and in some cases paradoxical; there are children who get more active with the medications that are supposed to make them sleepy. And a groggy child may actually be crankier and harder to console.Airplanes, like it or not, are common spaces, at least for those of us who fly commercial. We need to go easy on one another. We do not know the stories of the people jammed up against us. That played out parent who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem up to coping with that energetic toddler may be on leg three out of five of a tragic transcontinental journey to attend a family member\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death bed. That parent who dared to sneak a quick nap may have been up three nights straight with a bout of teething, stomach flu or diaper rash. By and large, people do their best, and no, everything was not much more orderly and children were not much better behaved 20 years ago, or 50 years ago. I have been that baby, and I have been the parent of that baby, and I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust try flying the Eastern shuttle with a baby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wrote Nora Ephron in \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeartburn\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 1983. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry flying any plane with a baby if you want a sense of what it must have been like to be a leper in the 14th century, but try the shuttle for the ultimate in shunning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Eastern shuttle is no more. But babies on airplanes we will have with us always, along for the ride, all of us doing our best.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

I will spend 72 hours, moving stealthily among armies of watch journalists (some 4,000), watch executives (representing hundreds of brands), watch publicists, watch obsessives and watch celebrities.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Economy, After 8-Year Detour, Is Fitfully Back on Track", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byBy one measure, the economic crisis that has long ravaged Europe is finally over.That gain, equivalent to an annual rate of 2.2 percent, brought the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product for the period \u2014 the total value of goods and services produced \u2014 to slightly above the previous peak reached in the early months of 2008, before the crisis emerged and Europe\u2019s core economy descended into a pair of crippling recessions.\u201cThe long-awaited recovery may finally be consolidating,\u201d said Iain Begg, a research fellow at the European Institute of the London School of Economics.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a lost decade,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist and a professor at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable testimony to the economic failure of the euro and the eurozone.\u201dThe strongest economies in the eurozone \u2014 major exporters like Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 have recovered more handily. But in the worst-hit countries \u2014 Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Italy \u2014 ordinary people continue to grapple with the consequences of deep job losses and wage cuts, which have slashed incomes.In Italy, disposable income for the average household \u2014 essentially, take-home pay \u2014 shrank 4 percent from 2008 to 2014, according to European Union data. Over those years, Greek households lost 24 percent of their disposable income, and Cyprus suffered declines of 22 percent. At the same time, German households gained more than 15 percent.So much time has passed with overall European fortunes frozen or even sliding backward that doubts pervade about the ability of the Continent to ever again achieve sustained robust growth. In a place that is home to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries \u2014 founts of precise German engineering, Italian luxury goods and French gastronomical excess \u2014 children have been born and raised to primary school age while commercial life around them has achieved practically no gains.And there are few signs that things will improve soon. Major banks across the Continent remain reluctant to lend, starving even healthy businesses of capital needed to expand and hire. Concerns about the global economy \u2014 especially the slowdown in China \u2014 threaten to crimp Europe\u2019s export growth, which has been at the center of the recovery.To be sure, Friday\u2019s preliminary data \u2014 a new early-stage snapshot of growth released by the European Union \u2014 showed the eurozone advancing during the first quarter at a stronger pace than the United States economy, which managed only a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the same period.Many economists now discuss Europe\u2019s prospects with the grim vernacular long used to describe Japan. There, a real estate bubble in the 1980s gave way to a calamitous bust that left banks reeling. Decades of half-measures aimed at finessing the economy to better days kept the ship of state afloat but left it in the doldrums.\u201cEurope is just sort of hanging on,\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who is a professor at Harvard. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like Japan, where Japan chose not to grab the bulls by the horns. It\u2019s still a very rich country. It\u2019s stable, but it\u2019s in decline.\u201dEven \u201changing on\u201d may amount to an aspiration. The terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have left Europe on knife\u2019s edge, with policy makers and investors cognizant that people with lethal intentions are no doubt plotting more. Refugees and migrants continue to stream toward the Continent, propelled by terrible conflicts in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. This has thrown another fraught and complex problem at European governments that have shown little mastery of coordinated action.The United States engineered a faster and more vigorous recovery from the Great Recession via a burst of government spending and tax cuts, combined with aggressive central bank action. By late 2011, less than four years after the downturn began, G.D.P. was back to its precrisis level, reaching $15 trillion.The eurozone, which generated \u20ac2.48 trillion in economic activity during the first quarter, is only now on track to surpass its 2008 full-year gross domestic product. of just below \u20ac10 trillion, or about $11.3 trillion.Unlike the United States, which surpassed its pre-bubble peak in 2011, the eurozone as a whole has stumbled along. Here are some of the bloc\u2019s notable leaders and laggards.It has been hobbled by the basic afflictions of its peculiar setup: The euro currency is a shared enterprise, yet the 19 national governments that now use it operate their own budgets, while having to abide by limits on borrowing.In other countries, economic weakness generally pushes down the value of the currency, making goods cheaper on world markets relative to competitors\u2019 and lifting exports. But in the eurozone, all the countries are stuck with the same value for their currency, regardless of their individual troubles.\u201cThe crisis began in the United States, yet the rigidities associated with the euro meant that it was the eurozone that wound up the big loser,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that, over that period, Japan, the rest of Europe and the United States all performed better. This is a euro disease.\u201dGermany, which plays the dominant role in setting eurozone economic policy, has been unwilling to allow national governments to run larger deficits to stimulate their economies, while demanding that they enact policies that make it easier for employers to hire and fire. The result has been Continentwide austerity marinated in acrimony.\u201cThe French and Italians have been shouting at the Germans, \u2018You should expand and then we\u2019ll all be better off,\u2019\u201d Mr. Begg said. \u201cThe Germans have been shouting back, \u2018No, you should sort out your mess and then we\u2019ll all grow together.\u2019\u201dThe eurozone economy has made progress since the crisis hit, even if its size is roughly the same. Eight years ago, finance and construction made up a greater share of the economy than today, a reminder of the overbuilding that left banks tallying disastrous lending losses. Now, exports are more pronounced, a trend enhanced by the decline of the euro, which has surrendered 28 percent of its value against the dollar since the summer of 2008. This has made European goods cheaper on world markets.But the ability of European businesses to continue to rack up export growth faces challenges. China, the European Union\u2019s second-largest trading partner behind the United States, absorbed roughly 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exported wares last year, according to the bloc\u2019s data. As China slows, that will most likely diminish its appetite for Europe\u2019s products.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much help for the eurozone in the broader global economy,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Beyond the worries of the moment, a rapidly aging population appears very likely to constrain Europe\u2019s fortunes. While Europe\u2019s high levels of productivity should continue to support a comfortable standard of living and a strong social safety net for much of its population, fewer people working means fewer goods being produced and services rendered.\u201cThe potential growth rate in Europe is probably 1 percent,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard added. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t therefore expect growth to be much greater than it is today. This is, quite frankly, as good as it gets.\u201dDavid Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Holds Activists as Migrants and Police Clash Anew at Macedonia Border", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Clashes erupted at Greece\u2019s northern border for the second time in three days on Wednesday, with the Macedonian police firing tear gas on scores of migrants as they protested border closings that have left more than 12,000 stranded in a makeshift refugee camp.The protests in Idomeni, a town in Greece on the border with Macedonia, came as Greek authorities arrested 14 activists there, saying that they had incited the migrants to storm the razor-wire fence dividing the two countries.The police accused the activists, from Britain, Germany and other European countries, of encouraging the migrants to protest by telling them that doing so would arouse sympathy among European governments and in that way help reopen borders and let them proceed on what was once the main migrant path to Germany, where most say they want to go.Greek television showed a crowd of migrants on Wednesday, their faces covered with scarves, chanting, \u201cOpen the border!\u201d as the Greek police moved in to restore calm. Macedonian police officers could be seen sitting on several tanks lined up on their side of the fence.Less than two months after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece warned that Europe\u2019s migration policies risked turning his country into a \u201cwarehouse for souls,\u201d Athens is struggling to manage the tide of people trapped in Greece since Balkan nations, like Macedonia, closed their borders, trying to avert a chaotic flow of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants into Europe like that of last year.The Greek government is overwhelmed by asylum applications from tens of thousands of migrants who realize they cannot move. Many are biding their time in Greece as they try to figure out what to do if their applications are rejected and they face deportation.The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, warned on Tuesday that it might soon authorize member states to extend border controls for up to two years instead of the normal six months, if Greece does not quickly outline how it plans to tighten control of its borders.Greece, which does not have the resources to process and assist the migrants, has been waiting for more than 1,000 police officers and asylum experts to arrive from other European countries to help.In the meantime, the authorities in Greece are trying to confront growing tensions among migrants on the mainland as well as among thousands held at detention camps on Greek islands, where migrants are living in increasingly squalid and dangerous conditions.Just over two weeks after Greece began carrying out the terms of the March 20 deal and started deportations from the Greek islands back to Turkey, Pope Francis is scheduled to visit the Greek island of Lesbos on Saturday, a trip aimed at highlighting the plight of migrants.Greek officials have also been trying to clear the camps in Idomeni and another migrant camp in Piraeus, the port of Athens, where more than 4,000 have been living in tents and warehouses for over a month. The migrants have been reluctant to move to military-style camps amid fears that, once there, the government might shut them in.In the last two days, however, around 15 busloads of people have agreed to be transferred from Idomeni to nearby camps, while hundreds have agreed to leave Piraeus. Still, large numbers of migrants at both places have insisted on staying, leading the government to warn that they may soon be forcibly cleared.Advertisement"}

The cabinet tried to suggest that the transfer, pending approval from Parliament, merely returned Saudi Arabia\u2019s own territory.The announcement elicited vivid protests from Egyptians who have for decades considered the islands to be Egyptian land. And it set off a debate over whether President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had made a humiliating concession to a wealthy ally.A small demonstration erupted in Tahrir Square, the site of the 2011 protests that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. At least five people were arrested there on Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said.\u201cWhatever the legal situation, the optics of this move are terrible,\u201d said Samer Shehata, an associate professor of Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma, referring to the transfer of the two islands.\u201cHere you have Salman coming to Egypt, pledging billions of dollars in aid and investment, and in exchange these islands are handed over,\u201d Professor Shehata said. \u201cIt seems to many Egyptians that the president is selling land for Saudi riyals.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden, everyone is acting as if they were vacationing there, when none had gone anywhere near it,\u201d the television presenter Amr Adeeb said in an impatient outburst on his show, \u201cAl Qahera Al Youm.\u201dKing Salman\u2019s visit has dominated life in Cairo for days, exacerbating the city\u2019s notoriously snarled traffic as he attended meetings at the presidential palace and visited the ancient Al Azhar mosque. Egyptian and Saudi officials signed at least 15 agreements during the king\u2019s visit, including a development package for Sinai and an oil deal worth $22 billion to Egypt over five years, state news media reported.The transfer of the two islands, which are less than five miles from the coastlines of both countries, was the product of a six-year negotiation over maritime boundaries, officials said. The islands\u2019 value is mostly strategic, and they have been unoccupied except for a handful of soldiers, usually American, stationed on Tiran as part of the 1979 peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.After Mr. Sisi came to power that year in a military takeover, he introduced a clause in the Constitution that explicitly prohibited ceding Egyptian territory.\u201cThe irony of the post-2013 regime ceding Tiran to Saudi Arabia after having inserted this clause will not be lost on those with any political memory of the controversies of Morsi\u2019s year in office,\u201d Nathan Brown, a scholar at George Washington University, said in an email.For Mr. Sisi, losing the islands might be worth it for the potential diplomatic gains. Since 2013, Saudi Arabia has propped up Egypt\u2019s ailing economy by injecting at least $12 billion into Egyptian coffers.Tensions between the countries have grown in recent months, with Saudi Arabia angered by Egypt\u2019s reluctance to follow its aggressive military policies in Yemen and Syria.\u201cAt the end of the day, this is not a hugely important concession for Egypt,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation in New York. \u201cBut it does show that Sisi sees the Saudi relationship as a fence that needs mending.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Quiet War on Corporate Accountability", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsLet\u2019s back up. Current accounting standards require corporations to make financial disclosures of information that \u201ccould\u201d influence investors. If this sounds wishy-washy, it is. The accounting board\u2019s proposal would rewrite this already subjective standard to require corporate disclosure only when there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that information \u201cwould\u201d significantly alter investor decisions.The language change is troublesome because it lowers the bar for excluding important or \u201cmaterial\u201d information. Even just changing \u201ccould\u201d to \u201cwould\u201d is a big deal. \u201cCould\u201d connotes possibility and invites broader disclosure; \u201cwould\u201d connotes more certainty and can be used by firms to exclude disclosure.Imagine a pharmaceutical company that discovers that a promising new drug in the pipeline is performing poorly in patient trials. Such information \u201ccould\u201d sway investing decisions, and, under current rules, there\u2019s a strong case for disclosure. But it\u2019s much harder to establish that there is \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that disclosing this information \u201cwould\u201d significantly alter investor choices. If the new proposal is enacted, the drug company gets a free pass to avoid disclosure.Given the technological advances, we support re-examining the current rules that govern \u201cmaterial\u201d corporate disclosure. After all, these rules haven\u2019t exactly served investors well. Consider the examples of Enron and Lehman Brothers.Disclosure is the cornerstone of fair and efficient markets. Investors can make educated decisions only if they have access to relevant information about public companies. Weakening disclosure standards imperils the integrity of markets.In principle, the S.E.C. has final authority to set disclosure rules for public companies. But the S.E.C. decades ago turned over much of this work to the private-sector accounting standards board. This body draws its members largely from the accounting and finance professions, citing the need for expertise from industry. It\u2019s this state of affairs that has partly gotten us to where we are today.The board\u2019s changes contradict the S.E.C.\u2019s own strategic plan, which notes that \u201can educated and informed investor ultimately provides the best defense against fraud and costly mistakes.\u201d The accounting board should abandon its efforts to undermine disclosure rules. Even better, the S.E.C. should use this opportunity to step in and strengthen them.Karthik Ramanna is an associate professor of business administration at Harvard and the author of \u201cPolitical Standards: Corporate Interest, Ideology, and Leadership in the Shaping of Accounting Rules for the Market Economy.\u201d Allen Dreschel is a lawyer at Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that promotes the public interest in the financial markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Hollowed-Out Society", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAIRO \u2014 On Wednesday, three judges in Cairo will decide whether to allow prosecutors to pursue their case against me and my co-defendant, the journalist and human rights advocate Hossam Bahgat, in the government\u2019s continuing attack on nongovernmental organizations in Egypt. The case against me has centered on my role in founding the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, which aims to educate the Egyptian public about their civil and human rights.As for Mr. Bahgat, it is widely known that his investigative reporting has rattled the government. But the case against him has focused on the activities of the organization he founded, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.We have been targeted because our groups provide critical resources to those facing human rights abuses in Egypt. We have represented victims of torture from across the spectrum: Muslim Brotherhood members, liberals, leftists, victims of arbitrary arrest and even government supporters. We have stood for the ideas that human rights belong to all, no matter their ideology, and that civil rights belong to all citizens, no matter their wealth or power.This week, the judges will also decide whether to allow prosecutors to impose on me, Mr. Bahgat and our organizations office closings, travel bans, asset freezes and criminal charges. If the court so rules, it will be tantamount to the Egyptian government shutting down not only the organizations named in the case, but all nonstate institutions that are independent of the security agencies and criticize violations of rights.The accusations against us are that our activities harm Egypt\u2019s reputation, that our groups were formed outside the framework of the law regulating nongovernmental organizations and that we received foreign funding to support terrorism. These charges are baseless, and if our trial is legal rather than political, we will prove this.Murky as this case is, the underlying message is clear: This is how the military-backed regime of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi intends to eliminate the last independent civic organizations in the country.Authoritarian regimes are, in general, averse to a strong civil society. Egypt is no exception. Yet under President Hosni Mubarak, and despite routine government harassment, we did build a critical, independent civil society. During that era, the police could shut groups down, but it was rare for organizations to be closed for long and almost unheard-of for staff members to be jailed.Five years after Mr. Mubarak\u2019s ouster, things couldn\u2019t be more different. If Mr. Mubarak was confident enough to tolerate independent groups operating outside state control, Mr. Sisi lacks such self-assurance.Civil society matters in a country like Egypt because these groups can play an important role as mediators in situations of tension and conflict. In 2011, when millions took to the streets to protest the Mubarak regime, it was groups like ours, along with labor unions, professional associations and charities, that made a crucial difference to the outcome \u2014 giving structure to the demonstrations that kept them nonviolent and constructive. Our counterparts in Syria and Libya were not so fortunate, and the protests there quickly dissolved into armed conflict.\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0636\u0627\u0629 \u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0633\u064a \u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0638\u0645\u062a\u064a\u060c \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0623\u0633 \u0648\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u0645\u0629.After Mr. Mubarak was deposed, groups like ours also worked overtime to translate chronic problems and longstanding needs into workable demands that were included in political negotiations. In 2011, for instance, my organization led an initiative involving hundreds of judges, lawyers, police officers, journalists and others to reform the then-feared Ministry of Interior. We held training sessions with police officers and consulted with ministry officials.Sadly, our project with the Interior Ministry was eventually blocked by factions that did not want reform. Indeed, everything changed with Mr. Sisi\u2019s accession to power in 2013, which ushered in a new, more repressive era.First, there was an assault on Muslim Brotherhood charities, then came the trials and closings of independent cultural organizations. The Sisi regime went on to close and prosecute nongovernmental organizations that were promoting health care, education, press freedom, democratic reform and good governance. While some, like mine, were frank critics of official policy, most stayed out of politics, dedicating themselves instead to delivering basic services that the government neglected to provide.Today, there are very few of us left. We know that without the mediating role of independent civic institutions, ordinary social tension can easily escalate into nationwide conflict. The powerful can manipulate routine differences between communities, ethnic groups and social classes into a politics of brute force. When that happens in a country under authoritarian rule, the entire public sphere is transformed into a zero-sum game between those wielding near-absolute power and those whose basic rights are in jeopardy.With a crumbling economy, a vicious counterinsurgency in Sinai and widespread public dissatisfaction, the Sisi regime faces difficulties far larger than those confronting Mr. Mubarak in the final days of his rule. It is hard to imagine the current government weathering these crises without the bedrock of civic organizations, which is why Mr. Sisi\u2019s attacks on civil society seem so shortsighted.If we lose this week\u2019s round of our legal fight, my personal life may take a painful turn. But it will be the Egyptian people who bear the brunt of the consequences, since they will soon be left with nothing between them and a crumbling state.Gamal Eid is an Egyptian lawyer and the director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information.

{"Headline": "Economic Gravity in the Oil Industry: What Goes Up Comes Down", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersIT\u2019S not rocket science. What shoots up quickly usually comes back to earth.But a lot of people who hold leases to drill for oil on their land forgot that. Clarke and Sally Keeshan, whose income from leases on their Texas ranches fell by 60 percent in the last two years, are an exception.So is John Baen, a college professor who moonlights as a negotiator of drilling leases. When oil prices were at their peak, he said, the 150 wells that were on his land or land where he had negotiated the prices were bringing in about $100,000 a month. Now, he said, the amount has fallen by 80 to 90 percent.But both the Keeshans and Mr. Baen said they had learned lessons from previous oil and gas cycles. They treated the money they were receiving from leases on wells on their land almost like found money.\u201cAfter 33 years in the oil and gas industry, I\u2019m somewhat familiar with the up and down cycles,\u201d Mr. Keeshan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had other means of income. Those leases have been secondary. We always planned for the day when this was coming.\u201dBut the low price of oil \u2014 around $45 a barrel, up from the $30 range a few months ago but far from its $100-plus price two years ago \u2014 and what it has done financially to people associated with the oil and gas industry serves as a reminder to the rest of us: Some planning and a bit of pessimism can go a long way in any career with inherent uncertainty, which is most of them.Before the advent of fracking, the drilling rights on many pieces of land \u2014 including the Permian Basin in West Texas, Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota \u2014 were worthless.But the same technology that led to booms in these areas, and large lease payments for the people who owned the mineral rights on the land, contributed to the glut of oil worldwide and today\u2019s low prices. That, in turn, means less drilling.\u201cOil is too easy to get out of the ground and too easy to find,\u201d said Paul Midkiff, national director of the oil, gas and mineral management group at Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cI truly believe it won\u2019t go back up to $100 a barrel.\u201dMr. Midkiff said there was too much oversupply, which would be used up only \u201cif the global economy kicks it into high gear.\u201dYet a great reduction in cash flow for leaseholders has given them an opportunity for estate planning, even if the opportunity is not as great as in past busts.Mr. Keeshan said his family had set up a family partnership to own its land and mineral holdings. These partnerships allow the people setting them up to get discounts on the assets they are putting in, in the belief that family members would struggle to sell shares in the partnership at full value to outsiders.Yet, he said, he recently had some of the family\u2019s 10,000 acres of ranch land valued and it did not reflect the drop in oil prices.\u201cThe value is up on the land even though we\u2019re not removing any oil,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, the commodity will come back to the point where it will be economical to remove it again.\u201dAnd that has been a challenge for estate planners. The existence of fracking has reduced the ability of appraisers to justify a greatly discounted price for the land and the mineral rights.\u201cThe drilling success for wildcat drilling was one in 10 wells,\u201d Mr. Midkiff said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about shale drilling, you\u2019re not going to find dry holes any more. You\u2019re going to find it and frack it out and have success nine out of 10 times. That\u2019s changed how we value these things.\u201dThe lower cash flow, though, has scared off some people from estate planning, for fear that if they put the leases into irrevocable trusts, which require them to give up the cash flow, they will not have enough money to live on. That could be shortsighted.Allison Elliott, senior wealth planning strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said she worked with a couple in their 50s who were set to do extensive estate planning at the peak of the oil boom. But as oil prices fell, and their lease income with it, they went from wanting to use both estate tax exemptions, which were worth over $10 million, to using one, to not returning her calls.\u201cBy the end of 2015, their net worth was about a third,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir cash flow was also cut back by two-thirds. But they\u2019re still well above the estate tax limits.\u201dNow, she said, they are looking to put $3.5 million worth of leases into trust for their heirs. They got to that point by realizing that even if prices stayed low, they would have enough to live on.\u201cAs the money kept rolling in, they started buying things, but they had a safety net first,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was where we showed them that their safety net was going to work even if they didn\u2019t get more cash flow.\u201dDane E. Crunk, managing director of Syntal Capital Partners, said that the people in the production and oil service industries best poised to make it through this downturn were the ones with the lowest debt. And low debt is usually sensible advice for anyone. But that was more difficult to do in this boom, where production companies asked servicing firms to quickly add employees and equipment, he said.\u201cEven some of our more savvy service business owners were forced to take on more debt and grow more quickly than they would have done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really sore subject right now, this idea of partnership.\u201dFor oil and gas executives, the drop has been a mixed bag. Jonathan A. Blumenthal, managing director at United Capital in Dallas, said he had clients who retired after working 35 years at companies like Exxon Mobil and their retirement packages were good. He said that because interest rates were so low, the sizes of lump sum pension payouts were as high as they had ever been.But executives at other oil companies like Chevron and BP, which have not been doing as well and are laying off people before they have fully funded their pensions, may find themselves struggling.\u201cThose defined-benefit plans look like a hockey stick,\u201d he said. \u201cYou miss those last five years and it\u2019s impactful.\u201dFor people who thought, seemingly rationally, that they could retire early and the lease income would replace their salaries, the shock has been mighty. In some cases, given their careers in the oil industry, these retirees had other money invested in oil producers and pipeline companies that have lost value.Mr. Blumenthal said the clients who managed the decline in oil prices best were the ones who could imagine other sectors, like rental real estate, where the cash flow dried up when those properties were no longer rented.\u201cYou have to show them what it looks like if they don\u2019t have that income,\u201d he said. \u201cOur process is to show you how the decisions in your life impact the process. You have to make decisions based on the things you can control.\u201dYet the best attitude with fluctuating wealth in a cyclical business is to look at it as money to be saved first and spent slowly.\u201cWe never expected to receive this,\u201d Mrs. Keeshan said. \u201cEven when things are bad, we\u2019re blessed. We\u2019ve always had good jobs. We were lucky we had a family member who left this to my mother and my aunt. We never get ahead of ourselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Heir Who\u2019s Ready to Take the Reins at New York Magazine", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byAdam Moss, the editor in chief of New York magazine, was having dinner at Sant Ambroeus, an upscale restaurant in the West Village, with Pamela Wasserstein and her two brothers when she mentioned that she was ready for a career change.The next day, Mr. Moss called Ms. Wasserstein, then working for the company behind the Tribeca Film Festival, and floated an idea: She should run the magazine.Nearly two years later, that plan is finally coming to fruition. On Monday, Ms. Wasserstein, 38, will become chief executive of New York Media, the magazine\u2019s parent company, giving the family more direct control of the publication and making it something of a New York media dynasty.Instead, Mr. Wasserstein\u2019s children held on, and proved to be devoted owners. Ms. Wasserstein and her two brothers, Scoop and Ben, a former editor at the magazine, had monthly meetings with the management team and were part of discussions about the publication\u2019s strategy. And in November 2014, a few months after that phone call with Mr. Moss, Ms. Wasserstein joined the magazine full time as co-chairwoman and head of strategy. (Scoop Wasserstein is a film development executive and Ben now works for a production company based at HBO.)\u201cIt\u2019s all family, every aspect of this place,\u201d Mr. Moss, who has edited New York since 2004, said in an interview last week at the magazine\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan. About Ms. Wasserstein, he added, \u201cShe\u2019s really been kind of one of us for a long time.\u201dMs. Wasserstein, a graduate of Harvard Law School and former corporate lawyer who previously led corporate development for Tribeca Enterprises, is taking the helm of a publication for the first time, and many would not envy her position. Magazines in particular have struggled to offset decreasing print advertising revenue and falling circulation.New York magazine, with a circulation of about 400,000, was down 12 percent in ad pages last year compared with the previous year. But the publication has several things in its favor.\u201cOn editorial grounds, they\u2019ve been terrific since the Wassersteins have owned them,\u201d said Nicholas Lemann, a professor and former dean at Columbia University\u2019s journalism school and a longtime staff writer for The New Yorker. \u201cWhen you find a benign owner like the Wassersteins, you\u2019re happy if you like magazines.\u201dDigitally, the magazine has become something of a force. It has built up a collection of online brands, including Vulture, The Cut and Daily Intelligencer, and its sites now have roughly 16 million unique online visitors a month, up 19 percent in the last year, according to comScore.Ms. Wasserstein said she expected digital sales, which grew 10 percent last year, to make up 60 percent of the magazine\u2019s advertising revenue this year (digital ad revenues surpassed print ad revenues for the first time in 2015, partly because of the decision to go biweekly, she said). And Mr. Moss, a former editor of The New York Times Magazine, is widely considered one of the best in the business.The magazine is privately owned, so it does not disclose financial information, but Ms. Wasserstein said it was \u201cstrongly positioned for growth.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re happy with our strategy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019re amplifying.\u201dTo that end, she outlined a plan for New York centered on increasing its online audience and its digital revenue. The magazine is focusing on pumping up video offerings and building out a new branded content studio that it hopes will bolster ad revenue.There is certainly no shortage of technology-focused sites, but Mr. Read said Select All would be different by approaching technology \u201cfrom the culture side\u201d and focusing on \u201cthe way we live our lives.\u201dSeparately, the magazine is exploring a cable television deal and trying to build out its live events business. Lest the publication itself be forgotten, Ms. Wasserstein said she was still dedicated to the print product. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a key part of our identity,\u201d she said.If it seems like New York is trying a bit of everything, it is not alone in the industry.\u201cAny media company is a laboratory right now,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cThere is no established way to do anything.\u201dHowever the magazine manages to navigate out of the industry\u2019s uncertainty, installing Ms. Wasserstein as its leader seems to indicate the family is willing to see it through. She will replace Anup Bagaria, a managing partner at the private equity firm Wasserstein & Company, who has been chief executive of New York Media since Bruce Wasserstein bought the magazine.\u201cWe are committed, and we see a bright future for the company,\u201d Ms. Wasserstein said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to take this on if this wasn\u2019t a place that I felt we could build value and an opportunity that I was excited about and my family is excited about.\u201dBut she added: \u201cCould circumstances change someday?

{"Headline": "Fed Still Waving Caution Flag on Resuming Interest Rate Increases", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byThe Fed is in a patient mood despite the continued expansion of the American economy because the pace of domestic growth is still modest and the global economy remains weak. Officials still see more reasons to worry about raising rates too quickly than reasons to worry about waiting, according to an official account of the March policy meeting, which the Fed published on Wednesday.Indeed, several officials at the March meeting said they were already leaning against a rate increase in April because that \u201cwould signal a sense of urgency they did not think appropriate.\u201dYet the account also described significant divisions among the 17 officials on the committee regarding basic issues, like the strength of inflation and the risk weak global growth poses to the domestic economy.\u201cAs I look historically at when policy has gotten off-track, I think it is that desire, which I absolutely understand, to wait for more certainty,\u201d said Ms. George, the only member of the policy committee who voted to raise the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate at the March meeting. \u201cYou want to see that the economy is on as stable a footing as it can be. But historically those waits can be costly.\u201dThe Fed raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis. It held short-term rates near zero for seven years to encourage borrowing and risk-taking. By raising rates as the economy gains strength, the Fed now plans to gradually reduce those incentives.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have emphasized since the meeting that they do not see evidence of economic weakening. The meeting account described domestic growth as \u201cresilient.\u201dBut a tightening of financial conditions has done some of the Fed\u2019s work, raising borrowing costs without an increase in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate. And the account said officials saw an increased risk that problems elsewhere could disrupt the relative strength of domestic growth.\u201cSeveral participants expressed the view that the underlying factors abroad that led to a sharp, though temporary, deterioration in global financial conditions earlier this year had not been fully resolved and thus posed ongoing downside risks,\u201d the account said. While the Fed\u2019s economic forecast held steady, the number of officials who saw underperformance as the most likely alternative outcome jumped to eight, from just three in the last survey, in December.There\u2019s also a strategic argument for caution. The Fed still has little room to respond to any signs of weakness by cutting rates, its traditional and most powerful tool. At the same time, Ms. Yellen and her allies argued the Fed could respond to faster growth by raising rates more quickly.\u201cThis asymmetry,\u201d the March meeting account said, \u201cmade it prudent to wait for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking another step to reduce policy accommodation.\u201dMs. George said this understated the risks of moving quickly. \u201cWhen I hear people say, \u2018We can raise rates quickly,\u2019 mechanically, that\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that desirable? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dMs. George and one other official, who did not have a vote at this meeting, agreed that rates should be raised in March. A broader group, however, wasn\u2019t ready to write off April. Several officials, the account said, thought a rate increase then still \u201cmight well be warranted.\u201dThe account made clear that the Fed\u2019s primary focus is on the strength of the economy, with little concern about faster inflation. Instead, officials debated whether inflation remained too weak or whether it was returning to a normal pace.Some inflation measures have increased in recent months. The Fed\u2019s preferred gauge estimated that prices increased by 1.7 percent over the 12 months that ended in February, the highest reading in some time and close to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials, however, have said they are not yet convinced that a strengthening trend has taken hold. Fed officials\u2019 latest projections, published in March, showed most expected somewhat weaker inflation this year.\u201cSome participants saw the increase as consistent with a firming trend in inflation,\u201d the account said. \u201cSome others, however, expressed the view that the increase was unlikely to be sustained, in part because it appeared to reflect, to an appreciable degree, increases in prices that had been relatively volatile in the past.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Junk Bonds: Never Stodgy and Steadier Than You Might Think", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, high-yield bond funds had a strong start to 2016 with a first-quarter gain of 2 percent. But if you were paying closer attention, the ride was anything but smooth.In the first six weeks of the year, the largest high-yield bond fund, BlackRock High Yield Bond, lost 4.6 percent, and the biggest exchange-traded fund, iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond, shed more than 5 percent. During that time, the Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund, the largest fund that sticks with stodgy Treasuries and other high-grade bonds, gained 2.4 percent.The steep losses through mid-February were the latest illustration that high-yield bonds are an unequivocal failure when it comes to delivering on the classic role of fixed-income investments: ballast that steadies your portfolio when stocks are off on one of their depressive jags. While it makes perfect sense to shun high-yield bonds \u2014 also known as junk bonds \u2014 for the part of your portfolio that you rely on for stability and predictability, completely swearing off junk could be a failure of portfolio imagination.Junk bonds can play a useful role, as part of the riskier, stock side of your portfolio. In that context, junk bonds are fairly reliable, delivering higher income than dividend-paying stocks. For example, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate bond fund has a current yield near 6 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the Vanguard High Dividend Yield index fund. The lofty income payouts of high-yield bonds have been the major driver of equitylike total returns over long stretches.From 1983 through the end of 2015, the 8.8 percent annualized return of an index of high-yield bonds captured 80 percent of the gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with about half the volatility of the stock index. An analysis by AllianceBernstein found that if you kept 75 percent in stocks over that stretch and moved the other 25 percent into high-yield bonds, the 10.4 percent annualized return trailed the all-stock return by less than a half a percentage point, while clocking in with 16 percent less volatility than the all-stock portfolio.\u201cThere\u2019s a pervasive attitude that high yield is scary, but that misses the big opportunity,\u201d said Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein. \u201cUsed in place of stocks it dampens your volatility without costing you much in return.\u201dOne way to measure value is to compare interest payouts. The long-term trend is that junk yields are on average 5.25 percentage points higher than yields from Treasuries. Right now this so-called spread is seven percentage points, meaning investors are getting paid more than the historical norm to dip a toe into the junk bond market. Mr. Swaffield found that in the two dozen times since the late 1980s when the spread was that wide, the annualized total return for high yield over the next three years ranged from 8 to 16 percent.Robust economic growth could in turn spur solid earnings growth, which would help stocks post strong returns from today\u2019s lofty levels, but that isn\u2019t expected. S&P Capital IQ, a research firm that serves the financial industry, projects that the S.&P. 500 will post 1 percent earnings growth this year.\u201cAn economy that feels like it is running through mud doesn\u2019t look good for stocks at current valuations,\u201d said Raymond Kennedy, a portfolio manager of the Hotchkis & Wiley High Yield fund. \u201cBut high yield can do well in a slow-growth economy.\u201d As long as cash flow remains positive, high-yield issuers can make interest payments even if earnings growth slows to a crawl.While junk bonds are generally less volatile than stocks, don\u2019t presume this will be a placid cruise.Defaults are always a front-and-center concern. In a recent analysis that made the case for junk being one of the better asset values in the market, Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, noted that the 4.6 percent average default rate for the bonds since 1988 ranges from a high of 15 percent to a low of less than 1 percent.Defaults are expected to rise this year from 2015\u2019s 3.5 percent pace. Junk issues tied to energy, metals and mining represent about 18 percent of the value of outstanding junk debt. Mr. Swaffield of Eaton Vance said the entire junk market is currently trading at a level that prices in a default rate of about 18 percent \u2014 as if everything linked to the battered commodities market were doomed. Moody\u2019s forecasts an overall default rate of 4.7 percent over the next 12 months, a bit lower than the 6 percent projected by Eaton Vance.With a hypothetical 6 percent default rate, the damage to a broad junk portfolio would be about 3.6 percentage points based on typical net losses on defaulted high-yield bonds. If you\u2019re starting at a yield of 7 or 8 percent, a 3.6 percentage point cut still leaves you with a return of around 4 percent. And there\u2019s the potential for actively managed funds backed by a team of credit analysts to sidestep some of the carnage. Last year as junk came under pressure from commodity-related defaults and investors running for the exits, two-thirds of actively managed junk funds did better than their benchmark index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.There\u2019s also the \u201claw of small numbers\u201d to contend with, said Carl Kaufman, a manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. \u201cWith growth already anemic, any disappointing news, no matter how small, will trigger an amazing amount of volatility,\u201d he added.A shift in the trading mechanics of the junk market is also fueling volatility. The role of banks as middlemen in the bond market has diminished since the financial crisis. That has made bond trading a choppier endeavor. For example, after falling 4.5 percent in the first six weeks of this year, high-yield bonds then rallied to a near 7 percent gain over the next four weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen whipping around like this,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, who has been running portfolios with high-yield bonds for 30 years. \u201cVolatility is here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to close your eyes for a few years you are going to do well.\u201dAn article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly last Sunday about the role of junk bonds in an investment portfolio miscalculated the effect a 6 percent default rate would have on a broad junk bond portfolio. The loss would be 3.6 percentage points, not 2.4 percentage points. A further calculation based on that number misstated the return that would be left after that loss. It would be around 4 percent, not 5 percent or more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Court Deals Another Blow to Opposition Lawmakers", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byYet time and again, the country\u2019s courts \u2014 packed by leftist loyalists of Mr. Maduro only days before they handed over power \u2014 have fiercely chipped away at the new legislature\u2019s efforts, leaving some here wondering whether Venezuela\u2019s lawmakers who are pushing for change have any real power at all.Already, the courts have limited lawmakers\u2019 power to remove judges, overturned a law meant to stabilize the economy and ratified an emergency decree that was rejected by legislators on the grounds that it overstepped Mr. Maduro\u2019s authority.But perhaps the biggest blow yet came on Monday night when the country\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the law that would have freed about 120 prisoners, many of them activists or opposition politicians jailed in antigovernment protests. The judges rejected the bill as unconstitutional.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear strategy of the Maduro government to render the Assembly completely impotent,\u201d said Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete stalemate for them.\u201dOn Tuesday, opposition politicians voiced disbelief at the court\u2019s decision.\u201cObviously this puts the government against the Constitution and against the people,\u201d Freddy Guevara, a legislator with the Popular Will party, said in an interview. \u201cIf the people voted for us, it\u2019s clear those who voted agreed with our agenda \u2014 including this amnesty law.\u201dThe clash over the prisoners was one manifestation of an increasingly fierce conflict that has been playing out all year: Venezuela\u2019s leftist old guard still controls most of the government, and the opposition wields a large majority in its Congress.One telling example has been the dueling threats by the president and lawmakers to remove one another from office. The Assembly is exploring a number of strategies against Mr. Maduro, from a popular recall vote to an effort to change the Constitution to cut his term short. Mr. Maduro recently embraced a proposal to write his own constitutional amendment that would end the lawmakers\u2019 terms.\u201cIf I see it as the way to avoid the path to a coup and the co-opting of the National Assembly, then I myself will push for this,\u201d Mr. Maduro said last week to a group of supporters at the presidential palace.The political clashes come against the backdrop of increasing economic uncertainty for most Venezuelans. The country has suffered from shortages of basic foods for more than a year and soaring inflation. Meanwhile, oil prices, the economy\u2019s main support, slumped this year and have stagnated since.Water and power are in short supply. In a sign of the increasing desperation, Mr. Maduro went on television last week to declare three-day weekends for public workers for the next two months to save power. The president then urged women not to use blow dryers for the same purpose.While the prisoner amnesty offered little to lessen these woes, it was seen as a bellwether of the Assembly\u2019s powers to eventually act in the country\u2019s larger crises.Opposition officials say 120 people have been charged in cases stemming from their political views, including party leaders and former mayors. A large number of the arrests took place during a wave of protests in 2014, in which thousands of middle-class Venezuelans took to the streets in an effort to get Mr. Maduro to resign.Perhaps the most high-profile arrest was that of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the former mayor of a district in Caracas who headed the Popular Will opposition party. He was arrested after a speech during the protests and later sentenced to a 13-year sentence on charges like inciting violence.The fate of the prisoners is a central point of tension between Venezuela and the United States. Last week, Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson, met with Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife, Lilian Tintori, in Washington.\u201cThe release of political prisoners in Venezuela is long overdue, I join with their families to call for their immediate release,\u201d Ms. Jacobson wrote on Twitter after the meeting.Mr. Maduro and his supporters argue that those incarcerated are criminals, not political prisoners.The president and his allies appear prepared for a long fight ahead in fending off the opposition through the country\u2019s courts. Before the new assembly was seated, leftists replaced 13 of the court\u2019s 32 justices with trusted jurists, ensuring that the court would remain loyal. The new court soon moved to block the election of four legislators from rural districts, denying the opposition a supermajority in the National Assembly.Mr. Shifter at the research group said that if the Assembly finds the rest of the laws it passes this year overturned, it would strengthen the hands of hard-liners in the party who favor opposing Mr. Maduro by sending protesters into the street rather than fielding politicians in elections.\u201cThat argument is going to be revived,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faction that wants to increase pressure at the streets is going to say \u2018I told you so. The ballot box strategy doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201dMar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz and Patricia Torres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock, Hurt by Volatile Markets, Reports Slide in Profit", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byVolatile global markets had their effect on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, as its earnings for the first quarter of this year declined by 14 percent.Bonds and stocks rallied in March, but persistent selling rattled the markets in the first two months of the year, as oil prices slid and concerns mounted over China\u2019s slowing economy.For the quarter, BlackRock said on Thursday, its net earnings declined to $711 million, compared with $830 million in the quarter a year ago. The firm\u2019s assets under management, the most critical gauge of an investment managers success, declined by only 1 percent, to $4.7 trillion.\u201cIn a volatile quarter, we only had a 1 percent drop in assets under management,\u201d Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cGrowth in E.T.F.s helped, and we continue to see strong flows into our funds from institutional investors.\u201dCompared with other less diversified asset managers that have been experiencing pronounced investor withdrawals more several years now, BlackRock was buoyed by its exchange-traded funds division, which was responsible for $24 billion of the firm\u2019s $36 billion net inflow for the quarter.Some $27 billion of the inflows came from passive, index-based strategies, which continue to attract more funds than higher-priced actively managed approaches. Exchange-traded funds are low-priced funds that track a variety of different indexes and investment strategies.So even in a quarter when investor sentiment swung from negative to positive, BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit was able to lure investors into its defensive Treasury bill funds in the beginning of the year and its riskier high-yield and emerging market funds last month.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.BlackRock Solutions, the firm\u2019 advisory practice, also bucked the down quarter, increasing revenue 16 percent from the quarter a year ago.Growth was driven by the Aladdin risk management platform, which acts like a central nervous system of sorts, allowing an investment manager to assess the risk and liquidity of its assets at any given moment.BlackRock uses the platform itself and has become increasingly successful in selling this service to its institutional clients who are under persistent pressure from regulators to disclose the risk of the securities they own and their ability to sell them in a pinch.As to the future, Mr. Fink said he expected equity markets to remain robust on the expectation that there would not be a hard economic landing in China. He did caution, though, that there could be a number of political surprises in the months ahead that could influence investor sentiment \u2014 including worries over Britain leaving the European Union and the uncertainties of the United States presidential race.\u201cWe are living in a world of political uncertainty,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of net investments that BlackRock reported for its exchange traded funds division for the first quarter. It was $24 billion, not $26 billion.Advertisement"}

And that is exactly the point.In the Haven, as this ship within a ship is called, about 275 elite guests enjoy not only a concierge and 24-hour butler service, but also a private pool, sun deck and restaurant, creating an oasis free from the crowds elsewhere on the Norwegian Escape.If Haven passengers venture out of their aerie to see a show, a flash of their gold key card gets them the best seats in the house.

{"Headline": "JPMorgan Chase Reports Lower Quarterly Profit", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWith investors expecting a weak first quarter for the banks, JPMorgan Chase delivered results that were slightly better than the forecasts.JPMorgan, the first of the major banks to report its financial results for the first three months of the year, said on Wednesday that both revenue and profit slid in the first quarter, from a year earlier, largely as a result of bad conditions in the financial markets.The bank\u2019s overall revenue fell 3 percent from the quarter a year earlier, while profit fell 7 percent. The bank earned $5.2 billion in the first quarter, or $1.35 a share. Analysts had been expecting profit to fall to $1.26 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u201cDespite challenging market conditions we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with investors Wednesday morning.JPMorgan\u2019s success in beating expectations helped push up its stock price 4.2 percent on Wednesday. The stocks of other big banks, which will report their earnings over the next week, also rose.The first quarter is typically a strong time for global banks, as clients prepare to put their money to use \u2014 but this year has not followed that trend because of all the volatility in the global markets.The falling prices of oil and stocks pushed down results in JPMorgan\u2019s Wall Street division. Revenue from both stock and bond trading were down, depressing overall market revenue by 13 percent from a year earlier. The volatile markets also put a damper on mergers and acquisitions. Revenue in that business fell 19 percent.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.JPMorgan put aside another $529 million to cover for potential losses on loans it has made to oil and natural gas companies, which have been hurt by the falling cost of oil. It put aside another $162 million for metals and mining companies.The numbers looked better in JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank.Consumers took out more mortgages and credit card loans, suggesting some optimism in the economy. Profit in the consumer division rose 12 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.The firm\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said in a statement: \u201cWhile challenging markets impacted the industry, we maintained our leadership positions and market share in the corporate and investment bank and asset management, reflecting the strength of our platform. Even in a challenging environment, clients continue to turn to us in the global markets and we saw positive net long-term asset flows in asset management.\u201dMs. Lake said that on the Wall Street side of the company, the bad market conditions had abated at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter.But she warned that it was too soon to tell whether that would continue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Papers: Why No Big Splash or Times Participation?", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Updated, 4:22 p.m., Wednesday, to add\u00c2\u00a0mention of Univision News.Quietly displayed and delayed as it was, the story nevertheless was among The Times\u2019s 10 most widely read articles on Monday morning.Blake Burton of Tulsa was one reader who wanted an explanation. He wrote:Is there a reason that the New York Times is underplaying the Panama Papers? They are front-page news, usually as the top story, in both mainstream outlets (CNN, NBC, The Guardian, The Times of London, etc.) and further afield, from Argentina (Clarion) to Zimbabwe (The Mail). Even \u201cbanking friendly\u201d outlets like the FT and Bloomberg are giving them top billing. As of this writing (noon eastern on the second day of public availability), the word \u201cPanama\u201d does not appear on your homepage, and the only article avoided the front page of my paper edition this morning (A3). Is there a good reason why?I asked Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor, to respond. He told me by phone that The Times is very interested in the data leak, and the articles produced from it. But he said Times editors believe that they owe it to their readers to do their own evaluation of the material. And that, he said, is happening now.Because The Times was not a part of the global consortium and was not aware that the story was coming, it needed some time to get its own story going. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know these documents were out there and being worked on,\u201d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to the documents, and that is a very big issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But Mr. Purdy said he hoped, and had good reason to believe, that that would change soon.Mr. Purdy was quick to say that the consortium journalists \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid a really good job\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the Panama Papers reporting.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tried to put something in place, to do our best without the documents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me.Why did it take so long to post a staff-written story? Many Times readers told me that as soon as they heard the news, they went to the Times website for its version, and were disappointed not to find anything until late in the evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was not a case of a single-fact story that we could simply confirm and go with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Purdy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was a case where hundreds of reporters had been working on it for a long time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe pointed out that the article that was published added some information from The Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own previous digging on Russian financial holdings.I talked Tuesday afternoon with Marina Walker, the deputy director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, who told me that her organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which she calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has not proved a good fit for every news organization. In previous projects, she said, ICIJ worked with, or tried to work with, other news organizations, including The Times, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cit wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always a good fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPart of that, she said, is the idea of sharing all material, not keeping anything exclusive. Another part is agreeing to observe embargoes for when material would be published.In this case, James Asher, until recently the Washington bureau chief for McClatchy newspaper group, made a strong case to the consortium that his organization would be a good fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe told us, we have a good reputation, we did well before the Iraq War, and we will follow your rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Walker said. (The precursor to the McClatchy Washington bureau, the Knight Ridder Washington bureau, has earned high praise for its skeptical reporting before the Iraq invasion.)\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not always pick the biggest media organizations to work with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Walker said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe pick those that will be collaborative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as having the right investigative talents. She said that some of the largest American organizations (and she mentioned, in different contexts, CNN, The Times, and the Wall Street Journal) were approached at various times, not necessarily for this project.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe heard something like \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not our model \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Walker said, however, that the organization is not ruling out working with The Times in the future. In fact, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe would love to work with the New York Times \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who would not want to work with The Times?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0The Times is one of the first major news organizations to take a firm stand against a growing and disliked practice.  \nThe Times has dismantled its environmental pod and discontinued the Green blog.\nThe public editor looks into a test drive of an electric car that caused a storm. The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. \nReaders complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya.  \nThose who reveal classified material are being punished like never before.When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Rules Out Free Money as Antidote to Falling Prices", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 With the eurozone economy still listless, despite the aggressive stimulus measures being taken by the European Central Bank, economists at a conference here on Thursday were full of advice on aggressive next steps.But top officials of the central bank pushed back against one of the most radical proposals: to print money and hand it out to citizens in an approach known as \u201chelicopter money.\u201dStill, the central bank acknowledged its deep concern about the risk that the eurozone\u2019s economic doldrums, characterized by a worrisomely low rate of inflation, could devolve into outright deflation, a vicious circle of falling prices and demand that can undercut corporate profits and cause unemployment to soar.A growing number of economists argue that central banks must use radical measures \u2014 even helicopter money, largely a textbook notion \u2014 to prevent deflation from becoming entrenched in Europe.\u201cThe decline recorded in February was a new element,\u201d the summary said. Members of the council agreed that \u201ceuro area growth momentum would be slower and inflation lower for longer than previously anticipated.\u201d\u201cWe have a deflation risk,\u201d Ignazio Visco, a council member and the governor of Italy\u2019s central bank, said at the Frankfurt conference on Thursday.The event was a gathering of economists and other analysts who follow central banking, some of whom expressed doubts that the E.C.B.\u2019s actions so far would be powerful enough to counteract the effects on the eurozone economy of a slowdown in global trade.The term helicopter money was coined in 1969 by the economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, more as a thought experiment than as a serious policy proposal. The idea was that when conventional policy tools no longer worked, central banks could print bills and toss them from helicopters to eager citizens who would spend the money and stimulate the economy.Deflation sets in when falling prices prompt people to delay purchases because they expect prices to fall even further. Consumer spending and investment collapse, companies dismiss workers, and spending falls even further as people lose their jobs and incomes. Central bankers fear deflation because once it sets in, it is notoriously difficult to reverse.Helicopter money has long been seen as a hypothetical last resort. But the idea has been taken more seriously as inflation in the eurozone has remained stubbornly near zero. Inflation has been below 0.5 percent since July 2014 and was at negative levels in both February and March.The E.C.B. does not expect inflation to reach the bank\u2019s official target of close to, but below, 2 percent until after 2018.\u201cWe face continued disinflationary forces,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B., said in the bank\u2019s annual report, published on Thursday.But handing out free money would not be easy. The E.C.B. has no procedure for distributing cash fairly to the roughly 335 million people in the eurozone. One mechanism might be to give everyone a tax cut. But that is probably illegal under eurozone rules, which bar the bank from getting involved in member governments\u2019 financing.Charles Bean, a professor at the London School of Economics, said at the Frankfurt conference that Britain, arguably, had already distributed helicopter money. The Bank of England has printed money to purchase government bonds, and the government in turn has made tax cuts.\u201cPeople mistakenly think this is some magical policy that has not yet been tried,\u201d Mr. Bean said. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s a mix\u201d of policies.Some economists say that the E.C.B. has already introduced a form of helicopter money by deciding last month to offer interest-free funds to banks, on the condition that they lend the money to businesses and consumers. If banks meet certain lending benchmarks, they will get a bonus from the E.C.B. in addition to the interest-free funds. In effect, the commercial banks will be paid by the central bank to lend money.But central bank officials clearly do not want to raise expectations that they are about to start carpet-bombing the eurozone with freshly minted bills.V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the vice president of the central bank, also ruled out helicopter money during an appearance at the European Parliament on Thursday. He argued that actions already taken by the E.C.B., which include penalizing banks for hoarding cash, have been working.\u201cWithout these measures,\u201d Mr. Const\u00e2ncio said, \u201cthe euro area would have been in outright deflation last year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Budget Deal With Higher Minimum Wage Is Reached", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders announced on Thursday that they had reached a budget agreement that would raise the minimum wage in New York City to $15 by the end of 2018, but initiate slower increases elsewhere, even in the city\u2019s wealthy suburbs.For Mr. Cuomo, the wage agreement came with clear concessions, as some lawmakers outside the city won a softer phase-in period. Long Island and Westchester County will not reach a $15 wage for nearly six years; areas north of Westchester are assured only of reaching $12.50 by 2021.The wage issue was one of the final obstacles to reaching a timely accord on the next state budget, estimated to be more than $150 billion, which mixes high-profile policy measures with nuts-and-bolts infrastructure spending and aid to schools.With the minimum wage deal and another hard-fought measure \u2014 one that would eventually provide employees across the state 12 weeks of paid time off to care for newborns or sick relatives and for families dealing with military deployments \u2014 the governor was able to claim victory on two signature issues.Still, Mr. Cuomo, who had fought hard for the higher wage, cast the increase as a major accomplishment on Thursday, both for working people and for his own political brand.\u201cWe\u2019re leaders,\u201d he said, \u201cin economic justice.\u201dThe governor, a Democrat, also announced a plan for billions in income tax cuts beginning in 2018 \u2014 affecting families earning less than $300,000 \u2014 and to end the Gap Elimination Adjustment, which had drained money from local school districts for state uses.Mr. Cuomo also backed off two plans adamantly opposed by fellow Democrats in the State Assembly: one asking New York City to shoulder $485 million in funding for the City University of New York, and another seeking hundreds of millions of dollars more in Medicaid savings, largely drawn from the city.The budget was still being debated and voted on by legislators even as Thursday\u2019s midnight deadline passed, officially making for a late budget. But work was expected to be completed Friday \u2014 the first day of the fiscal year \u2014 close enough to the fiscal target protect Mr. Cuomo\u2019s reputation for efficient governing. (He has passed five previous budgets more or less on time.)On-time budgets have become such a point of pride for the governor that lawmakers could not resist needling him once midnight came and went. \u201cJust so you know,\u201d State Senator Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz rose on the Senate floor to say at 12:12 a.m., \u201cthe budget is late.\u201dThe 11th-hour nature of the announcement prompted some concerns from lawmakers who were expected to review and vote on the bills with little time to read them. \u201cDespite a lot of a good content in the budget, the process at arriving at the conclusion left a lot to be desired,\u201d said State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Queens Democrat.And if the budget accomplished two cherished liberal goals \u2014 higher wages and paid leave \u2014 it was still notable for what it left out. Mere months after the former legislative leaders of both the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges in what government watchdogs have taken to calling a \u201cWatergate moment\u201d for New York, there was no hint of ethics reform in the deal on Thursday.On the wage issue, in areas north of Westchester, the minimum wage \u2014 now $9 \u2014 will rise by 70 cents a year over the next five years, eventually hitting $12.50 by the end of 2020, though the governor said it would continue to rise toward $15, depending on its economic impact. Indeed, in announcing the wage increase and brokering a deal with Senate Republicans, Mr. Cuomo seemed to be treading a fine line between confidence that $15 would eventually be reached statewide and cautioning that the wage could be suspended if it was determined to be hurting the economy.The plan also included other caveats: Businesses with 10 or fewer employees will have nearly four years to institute the wage increase in New York City.In describing a so-called safety valve, the governor explained how the wage\u2019s move toward the $15 benchmark upstate would be determined by state labor and budget analysts \u2014 both parts of the executive branch \u2014 who would review the wage\u2019s economic impact using studies conducted beginning in 2019. The state would then use that information to plan increases in the upstate wage \u2014 or to suspend the increase temporarily, statewide, depending on economic data.\u201cThis is the smartest, safest way to go about it, in my opinion,\u201d he said.Senator Catharine Young, a Republican and chairwoman of the Finance Committee, described the idea of different rates for different regions as \u201cvery helpful,\u201d adding that initially limiting the rate to $12.50 upstate would allow \u201ca pause, for study,\u201d after five years.Public-school spending accounted for nearly $25 billion of the budget agreement, which, after several failed attempts in past years, eliminates the deeply unpopular Gap Elimination Adjustment that the state first used in 2010 to cover a huge budget deficit at public schools\u2019 expense. Both Republicans and Democrats supported restoring the funding. The budget also boosted funding for charter schools across the state by roughly $430 per student.But CUNY and its statewide counterpart, the State University of New York, were unable to persuade lawmakers to allow them to raise tuition over the next few years.As city leaders have grappled with a homelessness and affordable housing crisis, the governor has repeatedly promised bold interventions from the state. He delivered $20 billion toward that effort in the budget, though details of the plan remain scarce three months after he first announced it.Both upstate and downstate areas received roughly $27 billion in transportation investments, restoring about $500 million for the second phase of the Second Avenue subway in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s 2015-19 capital plan.Under the family leave plan, agreed to by Senator John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who serves as the majority leader, and Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the Democrat-dominated Assembly, state residents will be eligible for such leave starting in 2018 after working for six months at a job. The leave would eventually be extended to 12 weeks, and would be funded by deductions from employees\u2019 pay.Republicans like Ms. Young were excited about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s tax cut, which will reduce state revenue by more than $4 billion annually by 2025. But Mr. Cuomo presented relief as long overdue for taxpayers in New York.\u201cEconomically, I believe, it will be a net plus,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo said he felt no competitiveness with California, where legislators approved the wage increase on Thursday, sending it to Gov. Jerry Brown. New York\u2019s governor was magnanimous, saying working people \u201cneed a raise\u201d everywhere. But he did note that New York City residents would see that raise quicker than those in Los Angeles, where the wage will rise by 2022.Asked whether he worried whether future governors might undo his wage proposal \u2014 Mr. Cuomo is up for re-election in 2018 \u2014 the governor smiled.\u201cI plan to be governor,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

As a result, she said, growth rates worldwide could become mediocre.The antidote to slow growth differs from country to country, Ms. Lagarde said. The United States, she said, should expand tax credits granted to lower-income workers, increase the federal minimum wage and offer more government benefits for families.In the eurozone, she said, countries should do more to train people for available jobs and to reduce unemployment, which is at 10.3 percent in the 19 countries that use the common currency.Countries that produce oil or other commodities should do more to diversify their economies, Ms. Lagarde said.\u201cOvercoming the voices of despair and exclusion requires an alternative path,\u201d she said, \u201cone that leads to prospects for more employment, higher incomes and more secure lives.\u201dMs. Lagarde, who took just one question from the audience after the speech, did not address the increased tensions between the I.M.F. and Greece since last week, when a conversation between two officials at the organization was leaked.Ms. Lagarde was scheduled to travel to Berlin later on Tuesday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel.

{"Headline": "General Mills and 7-Eleven Join the Venture Capital Crowd", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAt first glance, the maker of Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs might not fit the image of a cutting-edge venture capital investor.But with the food business moving to healthier offerings and online distribution, General Mills has created a venture capital unit that recently led a $3 million investment in Rhythm Superfoods, a specialty start-up that makes kale chips and broccoli crisps.General Mills, based in Minneapolis, is part of an increasing number of old-economy companies, including the convenience chain 7-Eleven and the Campbell Soup Company, that have joined a crowd of technology companies to create venture capital funds. Through them, they scout for new products or services and promising potential business partners.Their moves have accompanied a surge and recent crest in the valuations of many venture capital-backed start-ups. Critics say the corporate-run funds have contributed to inflated valuations for start-ups, and some funds have begun selling stakes even as they face reduced valuations on some holdings.Reports recently surfaced that Intel\u2019s fund, the largest of its kind, might sell up to $1 billion of its holdings as it narrows its strategy under its chief executive, Brian M. Krzanich.With valuations of many young, private companies faltering as interest in initial public offerings of stock has waned, corporate venture investing faces a test.\u201cI think some of the corporate V.C. will get a little less enamored as the venture market goes from euphoria into a little more normal period,\u201d said J. Sanford Miller, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif.Since 2011, the number of companies making venture capital investments has risen 79 percent, to 801 globally, according to Global Corporate Venturing, a data provider. The ranks include Verizon Ventures, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Chevron Venture Capital, Pfizer Venture Investments and Blue Cross Blue Shield Venture Partners.Even as total venture capital investment more than doubled from 2011 to 2015, to $58.8 billion, the amount invested by corporate venture funds quadrupled to $7.6 billion in the same period, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Corporate funds make up 12.9 percent share of the total, the highest since 2000.As a sign of how start-up valuations have waxed and waned, the size of the median late-stage fund-raising roughly tripled from 2012 to 2015, but it has fallen by 23 percent so far this year, according to Global Corporate Venturing.For many company funds, financial gain is less important than finding the next big idea.Arvind Sodhani, who led Intel\u2019s venture unit for 10 years, until mid-2015, said corporate venture investing has grown partly because of interest by chief executives. \u201cC.E.O.s who are worried they\u2019re going to get disrupted want to have an outpost in Silicon Valley to discern where the disruption is coming from,\u201d he said.Such corporate funds have \u201cclearly been driving up valuations,\u201d he added.For General Mills, which has also invested in the plant-based food maker Beyond Meat and two other start-ups, the venture capital fund is a way to keep pace with the growing number of small food brands that have found consumer success, especially online.\u201cThe traditional consumer packaged goods model of big advertising budgets, trade leverage and scale \u2014 a lot of those factors have been neutralized by these small brands,\u201d said John Haugen, who heads the General Mills venture fund after managing brands such as Nature Valley, Yoplait and Hamburger Helper. Emerging brands, he added, \u201chave alternative pathways to market online.\u201dTechnology companies pioneered corporate venture funds 30 years ago, followed by media, finance and health care companies. The two giants of the field are Intel, with stakes estimated by outsiders of more than $5 billion in more than 400 companies, and Google, now Alphabet, which has a $2.4 billion venture fund called GV with more than 300 investments.Comcast Ventures invests in companies it can later introduce to its cable and broadcast television customers. In 2009 and 2011, it took stakes in iControl Networks, a broadband home security and energy management service, and it later offered it to its customers through Xfinity Home.Comcast\u2019s portfolio also includes stakes in DocuSign, Birchbox and TiVo, as well as FanDuel, the fantasy sports betting site. Comcast introduced FanDuel to its NBC broadcast TV unit and its large customer base of sports fans.Other corporate venture funds acknowledge that their growing ranks have pushed up private company valuations. \u201cIn the last few years, there has been more and more corporate V.C. money coming in, and I do think that\u2019s had an impact on valuations,\u201d said Rob Salvagno, head of corporate development at Cisco Investments, which has $2 billion of stakes in 100 companies and 40 venture funds.Some funds have had bubble-style returns \u2014 as well as bubble-style losses. Qualcomm, a maker of chips for mobile phones, participated in a $25 million early-stage funding round for Waze, a crowd-sourced traffic application, in 2010. When Waze was acquired by Google for about $1 billion in 2013, Qualcomm\u2019s return was 10 times its investment.But some of Qualcomm\u2019s investments have struggled, too. It invested $5 million in the fitness device maker Fitbit in 2013 and had a paper profit of about 20 times its cost after Fitbit\u2019s initial public offering in mid-2015. However, Fitbit shares have since come back to earth, falling 67 percent from their post-I.P.O. peak in August.Qualcomm is prepared to invest through downturns because such stakes offer a ringside seat for \u201cthe next generation of disruptive innovation around our mobile core,\u201d said Brian Modoff, who oversees strategy, mergers and acquisitions and ventures for the company.Microsoft is renewing a venture investing push, hiring Nagraj Kashyap, the former head of Qualcomm Ventures, in January. The software giant was a big investor in tech and telecommunications companies in 1999 and 2000, but after losing about $5 billion from such investments in the three years that ended in mid-2003, it curtailed the effort in favor of more acquisitions.Venture investments have mushroomed recently at Salesforce, a maker of customer relations software, which began investing in 2009. Since 2011, Salesforce has increased its investments to $505 million, from $27 million. Five of its 150 companies have had I.P.O.s, and another seven or eight are waiting in the wings.Salesforce was one of five named participants in a $350 million investment in the cloud-storage start-up Dropbox in January 2014 that valued the company at $10 billion. Recently, however, one mutual fund investor that was part of the same investor group cut its valuation of Dropbox to less than $5 billion.John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures at Salesforce, said that he did not agree that corporate venture funds have helped inflate valuations. Prices for most investments are set by the traditional venture capital firms that lead the deals, not by the corporate participants, he said.As for Dropbox, Mr. Somorjai called it \u201ca very small investment.\u201d Salesforce does try to reflect such fluctuations in valuing its holdings, but \u201cno single investment is going to move the needle,\u201d he added.Sue Siegel, the chief executive General Electric\u2019s GE Ventures, said the company got into venture investing in 2013 to identify up-and-coming entrepreneurs in the health care and energy industries. She added that G.E. planned to stick with venture investing in the current valuation downturn. \u201cWhen you have these down cycles, it\u2019s a wonderful time for us to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Generation\u2019s Anger Resounds From a Packed Plaza in Paris", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 There are denunciations of \u201cspeciesism,\u201d of multinational corporations, capitalism, G.M.O.s, the police and nuclear power. There are pleas for Julian Assange and African workers. There are drumming, guitar playing, free soup and 20-somethings swigging beer.A jolly ragged man, unsteady on his feet, takes the microphone to denounce \u201cwords, words, words.\u201d Another announces, mysteriously, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be on the side of the dominated!\u201dThis is France\u2019s newest political movement, open every night to the public on a main square in Paris, the Place de la R\u00e9publique, which has been transformed into a giant outdoor sit-in recalling the demonstrations of May 1968 in multicultural form.The plaza has been packed with young people every night for nearly a month, venting their anger \u2014 at just about everything. The news media here cannot seem to get enough of the movement, which calls itself Nuit Debout \u2014 or \u201cNight, Standing Up\u201d \u2014 a phrase some in the movement say is inspired by the 16th-century writer \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie\u2019s line, \u201cThey are only tall because we are on our knees.\u201d Others say it comes from the \u201cInternationale,\u201d the hymn of the 19th-century revolutionary left.But the movement is more than just a freewheeling free-for-all of inchoate frustration.On Thursday night, the protest at the Place de R\u00e9publique took a violent turn as police arrested several dozen demonstrators when they refused to disperse at midnight. Some of the protesters threw blocks of concrete and glass bottles at the police, who responded with tear gas. At other protests across France, 24 police officers were injured, three seriously.At a moment when disgust with mainstream parties is high, the movement is also being observed warily by the country\u2019s politicians, who recall how such citizen protests led to potent political parties in Spain and Italy.To say that the plan backfired is an understatement. The answer from the younger generation trying to elbow its way into the work force was simple: We don\u2019t want what you are offering; we want what our parents have, and then some.All through March students and unions took to the streets to demonstrate. The protests spread to the provinces. The government quickly backed down, gutting its own plan.\u201cOur youth feel neglected by society,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls mused carefully in an interview with the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cNuit Debout is expressing this, in its own way.\u201dThe concessions were quick in coming. Fearful of an unbudging 25 percent youth unemployment and a permanent mobilization in the streets, the government two weeks ago called in student union leaders and agreed to spend upward of 400 million euros (about $450 million) in subsidies, taxes and allowances aimed at helping young people find work.High school graduates looking for work will now get government help for four months. Temporary work contracts \u2014 the bane of new entrants to the job market, since they represent most hires \u2014 will be taxed, to encourage more employers to hire people permanently. (The effect so far has been the opposite: Employer associations are infuriated.)Nuit Debout\u2019s organizers say they are not organizers, and the man anointed its \u201cmaster thinker\u201d in the French news media \u2014 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lordon, a left-leaning economist at France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research \u2014 scoffs at the idea.\u201cIt would be claiming a position of authority, and that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a \u2018master thinker.\u2019 They are producing ideas in every direction. They don\u2019t have a leader or a spokesman.\u201d Nuit Debout, he added, was practicing \u201chorizontal democracy.\u201dAmong the rank and file, that sentiment is shared. Andrea, 27, who was working in the \u201cLogistics\u201d tent at the Place de la R\u00e9publique, refused to give her last name \u2014 in the style of Nuit Debout\u2019s organizers \u2014 because she said she did not want to be singled out as a leader.But she described the evolution of the movement. \u201cAfter one of the demonstrations, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s not go home,\u2019 \u201d she explained.Starting as a reaction against the labor-code overhaul, the protest organizers pondered the question: \u201cHow can we make them scared?\u201d said Andrea, who said she was also on Nuit Debout\u2019s \u201clegal team.\u201dNot everyone is pleased, of course.The government\u2019s grasp, indeed, appears to be slipping. A headline in Le Figaro on Thursday read: \u201cGovernment paralyzed in the face of Nuit Debout.\u201dIts economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, a former banker despised by France\u2019s left for being too pro-capitalist, announced he was forming his own political movement, as his colleagues in the government grumbled about him anonymously in the press.President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, facing near-certain defeat in elections next year, told television interviewers that \u201cthings are getting better,\u201d which only provoked derision in the news media and on the streets.The president\u2019s soothing words were not enough to clear the Place de la R\u00e9publique, nor has a sometimes heavy police presence hovering in the background.For now, the movement\u2019s daily twists and turns are chronicled anxiously on the left and the right as if it were a pop star: \u201cNuit Debout Thinks About Its Future,\u201d was the front-page headline in Lib\u00e9ration last weekend.While they try to make up their minds or decide their next moves, the participants seem to be having too good a time to leave, just yet.\u201cIt\u2019s an agreeable movement. It shows we\u2019re still living in a democracy,\u201d said Emmanuel Colas, 22, a computer software expert, watching the action recently on the side. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes me love France. There are loads of people here. It\u2019s not going to change things radically. But all these people are showing they love liberty.\u201dOn a rare temperate evening the appeal seemed obvious. \u201cThey are attempting another way of doing politics,\u201d said Florent Chappel, an engineer at the Housing Ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s stimulating; it\u2019s a taking-hold of conscience. A sort of vitality, a will to re-enchant the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Offers to Loosen Restrictions on Iran Air", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Almost six years ago, the European Union sharply curtailed access to its airspace for Iran\u2019s aging airline fleet. But officials in Brussels say they are now prepared to loosen some of those restrictions as the easing of Western sanctions gradually allows new planes and spare parts to enter Iran after decades of isolation.In an interview before this weekend\u2019s visit, Violeta Bulc, the European Union\u2019s transport commissioner, said that easing flight restrictions on Iran Air was a \u201ckey priority\u201d for Brussels, which is also keen to expand European airlines\u2019 access to Iran\u2019s $400 billion economy.Ms. Bulc expressed cautious optimism that European Union inspections of the airline\u2019s maintenance operations, scheduled to begin next month, would pave the way to increase air transport links between Iran and Europe, which she argued would have economic and diplomatic benefits.\u201cWe need to re-establish these connections,\u201d Ms. Bulc said. \u201cWe need to re-establish trust.\u201dDespite the restrictions, Iran Air has continued to serve about a dozen European cities with 12 planes \u2014 all older Airbus A300 and A310 models \u2014 that have passed the bloc\u2019s safety inspections. Another Iranian carrier, Mahan Air, which is privately owned, recently upgraded its fleet to newer Airbus models and flies without safety limitations to several European cities, including direct flights to Athens, Milan and Munich from Tehran.But those air links remain relatively infrequent, and the high cost of operating such an antiquated fleet leaves Iranian airlines at a competitive disadvantage to European rivals like Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways, which have recently resumed or plan to resume direct flights to Tehran.Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations decades ago, and Iran has been seeking a reciprocal resumption of flights with the United States for years. That possibility has been renewed because of the easing of Western sanctions.Ms. Bulc cited air transport as a \u201ckey enabler\u201d of economic growth and credited air services agreements that the European Union has concluded in recent years with several countries in the western Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa with significantly bolstering air traffic between those regions and Europe.\u201cEvery new destination opens new potential for business development,\u201d Ms. Bulc added.The possible loosening of European airspace restrictions on Iran comes at a delicate time, however. The United States has charged that planes owned by Iran Air and Mahan Air have been used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran to ferry weapons and fighters to Syria in support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, in violation of a United Nations arms embargo.Ms. Bulc acknowledged the United States\u2019 concerns but declined to comment further before the commission\u2019s visit.\u201cI do not at all expect any easy steps to be taken,\u201d she said of the negotiations, emphasizing that Europe\u2019s dealings with Iran on aviation issues had always been focused on safety, rather than on political concerns.\u201cIn air transport, safety is the highest priority,\u201d Ms. Bulc said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Few Expect Mexico\u2019s Government to Suffer at Polls, Despite Outrage Over Abductions", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 In a drab white tent along Reforma Avenue here, across from offices of the attorney general, a small group gathers each day to maintain the vigil for the 43.The tent bears their black and white images: forty-three students from a teachers college, seized by the police in the city of Iguala in September 2014 and never heard from again; literal and figurative reminders of their absence.Yet that rage, like the crowds themselves, has dissipated, raising fears that in spite of its handling of the case, which was recently criticized by an international panel of experts, the government will face few political consequences.\u201cJust like any social movement, the tide goes out,\u201d said Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez, 22, a student in Mexico City and one of the volunteers who has lived on-and-off in the tent for the last year. \u201cPeople have jobs, run out of money, they get distracted. The government bets on this exhaustion, and the forgetting, but what we are here for is to remind society that they should never forget.\u201dWithout the experts, or an outpouring of popular outrage, the families wonder if their cause is lost. \u201cWe have seen the support from society drop, perhaps because many people do not think it important and others believe the government,\u201d said Bernab\u00e9 Abrajan Gaspar, the father of one of the students, Ad\u00e1n Abrajan.Other families interviewed Monday expressed similar dismay, and a belief that they will never know what happened to the young men.And though it will likely define the presidency of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, his political party, the P.R.I., may not suffer. In past elections, the party has managed to outperform its rivals in the face of controversy, and some in and outside of government say the discontent, frustration and grief over the students will do little to dampen the party\u2019s status as the dominant political force in the nation.\u201cIt should hurt them, and if it was the P.R.I. against two united opposition parties, it might,\u201d she added.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval ratings plummeted after the disappearances and a political scandal that involved his wife. But last year, the party managed to win the midterm elections anyway. And recent polling suggests that the party is expected to retain majority control in governors\u2019 elections in June.\u201cThe P.R.I. strategists understand very clearly that the levels of rejection and disapproval won\u2019t have an effect on electoral results,\u201d said Alfonso Z\u00e1rate, a political analyst and consultant.Still, the government faces a renewed wave of international condemnation over its handling of the case, even as Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been trying to project Mexico as an emerging economic power. As he flies across the world, signing trade agreements and visiting dignitaries, the case of the missing students, and other domestic troubles, have tarnished the image his government has cultivated from its arrival in 2012.\u201cThey know they have lost the battle for international public opinion, but they think they can win the domestic public opinion battle,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a political analyst and former foreign minister. \u201cThey may be right. There may be no serious consequences domestically.\u201dCommenting on the panel\u2019s report, the United States State Department said in a statement Monday that it trusted that \u201cthe Mexican authorities will carefully consider the report\u2019s recommendations, evaluate suggested actions to address the issue of forced disappearances, provide support to the victims\u2019 families, and continue their efforts to bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.\u201dIn part, the frustration stems from the government\u2019s insistence that its initial conclusion is correct: that the students were abducted by the local police and handed over to gangs who killed them and incinerated the bodies in a dump in the city of Cocula.Despite experts who testified that such a fire could not have taken place where the bodies were said to have been burned, the government has defended its inquiry and criticized the experts for not solving the case after a year. Officials cited a separate panel that indicated a fire might have occurred at the site.\u201cThere are certain levels of the government that have the clumsy idea that if you talk about the economy and spend a lot on advertising, it will all disappear,\u201d Mr. Z\u00e1rate said. \u201cBut I think that their image depends on what they are doing and not what they say they are doing.\u201dIf that is true, the strategy is not playing well abroad. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recently issued a scathing report on the use of torture by the security forces in Mexico. And the United Nations special envoy on torture in Mexico, Juan E. M\u00e9ndez, made similar criticisms last year.Mr. M\u00e9ndez said that torture in Mexico was \u201cgeneralized,\u201d a finding that was disputed by the Mexican government. He said in an interview Monday that such responses did not help the state.\u201cThough these things happen in other countries, it is more serious because Mexico looms so large in the international arena and because Mexican citizens have the right to expect better after decades of exclusion,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9ndez said. \u201cIt is about time that a serious democracy starts delivering.\u201dPaulina Villegas and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "International Monetary Fund Forecasts Slow Growth in Developing Nations", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday about persistently slow growth in developing economies, highlighting a growing concern that these countries will not soon regain the high rates of growth that distinguished them in the past.Although emerging economies, headlined by China, Brazil, India and Turkey, account for a significant share of the global economy, their pace of growth remains sluggish \u2013 a good 2 percent below the average of the last decade.Such a trend, if it continues, would increase the likelihood of another round of financial shocks in the years ahead, the fund explained in its most recent World Economic Outlook, which was published on Tuesday as the fund\u2019s spring meeting swung into gear.If emerging economies, many of which taken on a lot of new debt, grow at a slower pace, global investors will have less incentive to buy Chinese or Brazilian bonds \u2013 choosing instead to put money to work in developed markets where the risks are not as pronounced.To the extent that the Federal Reserve moves to increase interest rates in the coming months, this dynamic is likely to continue, raising the possibility of another emerging-market panic roiling markets.\u201cA flight from riskier asset classes could spark disruptive declines in asset prices and currency values, generating contagion effects and harming growth further,\u201d I.M.F. economists explained in their report.Markets shuddered this year on fears that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would be more abrupt than anticipated. Dollar-based investors, who had bought high-yielding Chinese securities, pulled their money out as it became clear that the Chinese authorities were willing to depreciate their currency to jump-start growth.Of late, there has been less pressure on the renminbi and other emerging-market currencies. Money has started to return to select emerging markets, but economists at the fund emphasized how important it was that large developing nations do all in their power to bring growth rates up some more.Emerging-market bond funds, which experienced steep outflows this year, had inflows of more than $1 billion in the first week of April \u2014 the highest since early 2014 \u2014 according to EPFR Global, a research group that tracks investment flows.Economists at the fund expect these economies to grow at 4.1 percent this year, barely up from 4 percent last year.Chinese growth is set to shrink to 6.5 percent in 2016 and 6.2 percent in 2017, from 6.9 percent last year, the fund forecasts.And the economies of Russia and Brazil, which together make up 6 percent of global activity, have been shrinking since the middle of 2014, the I.M.F. reported.\u201cLower growth means less room for error,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the I.M.F.\u2019s new lead economist. \u201cPersistent slow growth has scarring effects that themselves reduce potential output and with it, demand and investment.\u201dOn a positive side, the I.M.F. took note of the recent bounce in emerging market assets over the last month thanks in part of a modest recovery in the price of oil and a growing sense that the Chinese government was going to do everything in its power to defend its currency.Still senior fund officials say that one of the pressing issues to be discussed this week is the notion of trying to institutionalize a global safety net which could, in theory, help a country in crisis before it runs out of money.In that vein, the fund has tried to promote so-called precautionary financial arrangements, whereby a country experiencing a short-term outflow of funds could sign up for a line of credit from the I.M.F., in the hope that this would reassure skittish investors.A country like Brazil, which is in the midst of a political and economic crisis, would be a logical candidate for such an initiative.These programs have not taken off, however, as countries remain fearful that any form of pact with the fund brings with it a negative stigma that would only make the situation worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revelations From Panama Papers Are Old News for Africans", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byLetter From AfricaJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Outsiders have long claimed the moral high ground in accusing African elites of endemic corruption.True, a clutch of senior officials and relatives of political leaders from African nations have been identified in the leak of millions of documents from a Panamanian law firm relating to offshore havens that can facilitate the circumvention of taxes.There has been no suggestion of illegality. But the disclosure tapped a vein of rage for Britons laboring under the government\u2019s austerity measures who saw the papers as signaling a parallel universe of fiscal duplicity inhabited by the privileged and the rich.The view from here is different. Long before the Panama Papers were published, African governments were made explicitly aware of the damage inflicted by financial practices that have robbed countries of tens of billions of dollars a year.The consequences run deep. About 414 million Africans live on less than $1.25 a day. On average, the report said, Africans\u2019 per capita share of their continent\u2019s economic output is only one-fifth of the global average.\u201cPoverty in Africa is also multidimensional, in the sense of limited access to education, health care, housing, potable water and sanitation,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis situation puts the loss of more than $50 billion a year in better perspective.\u201dIn other words, for people living threadbare lives, scrambling to get by in bleak shanties, subsisting in gray economies, every dollar spirited to some far-flung tax haven plays into a zero-sum game that makes their existence even more precarious.Mr. Cameron said he sold the contentious stake shortly before he became prime minister in 2010 and paid the requisite taxes.Mr. Zuma, for his part, has been censured by his country\u2019s highest court for flouting the Constitution, and his story reflects a familiar battle between legitimacy and the politics of survival.But the Panama Papers also evoked the newest chapter in a wider continental struggle, played out this time in hidden dealings and sleight-of-hand bookkeeping.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change Hits Hard in Zambia, an African Success Story", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byLAKE KARIBA, Zambia \u2014 Even as drought and the effects of climate change grew visible across this land, the Kariba Dam was always a steady, and seemingly limitless, source of something rare in Africa: electricity so cheap and plentiful that Zambia could export some to its neighbors.The power generated from the Kariba \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric dams, in one of the world\u2019s largest artificial lakes \u2014 contributed to Zambia\u2019s political stability and helped turn its economy into one of the fastest growing on the continent.But today, as a severe drought magnified by climate change has cut water levels to record lows, the Kariba is generating so little juice that blackouts have crippled the nation\u2019s already hurting businesses. After a decade of being heralded as a vanguard of African growth, Zambia, in a quick, mortifying letdown, is now struggling to pay its own civil servants and has reached out to the International Monetary Fund for help.\u201cThe Kariba Dam was a big eye-opener, sort of a confirmation that, yes, there could be this problem of climate change,\u201d said David Kaluba, national coordinator of the government\u2019s Interim Climate Change Secretariat.On a continent especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Zambia\u2019s rapid fall shows how the phenomenon threatens economic development across Africa, and how easily it can contribute to wiping out the fragile gains made in recent years.While the global drop in commodities prices has devastated Africa, drought and other weather patterns related to climate change over decades have also undermined some of the biggest economies across the continent, from Nigeria in the West to Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa to South Africa at its bottom tip.Over the next decades, Africa is expected to warm up faster than the global average, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Despite an agreement reached in Paris in December, which committed nearly every country in the world to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, it is far from clear how much money African nations will have to mitigate climate change and adapt to it.Zambia remains largely dependent on foreign assistance to manage climate change, and has been slow to plan for the consequences on its own.\u201cUnfortunately, what is going in Zambia is pretty much what is going on in the rest of Africa,\u201d said Danny Simatele, a climate change expert at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.To many in Zambia, the current power crisis has focused attention on climate change in a way that changes over years and decades, like rising temperatures and irregular rainfall patterns, had not. People across the nation now track Kariba\u2019s water level \u2014 it was 13 percent of capacity on a recent visit, up from a low of 11 percent in January \u2014 as closely as they follow their favorite soccer teams.At the J.S. Butchery in the capital, Lusaka, the light had just come back on after an unscheduled, eight-hour blackout, hardly ideal for the food sitting in its glass refrigerator. Joe Mulenga, a 28-year-old butcher, said he had first learned about climate change on television about a year ago and then did an Internet search about it.\u201cNow it\u2019s here, we started experiencing it, it\u2019s real,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very worried.\u201dFrancis Ndilila, who leads the energy committee at the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that climate change had had the direct \u201ceffect already of slowing down our economic development.\u201dProjections for growth in Zambia, which averaged more than 7 percent for the decade up to 2015, have been cut in half.The problems at the dam here stem from an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern that has brought the worst drought in decades to parts of Africa. Farmers, who rely on rain and lack irrigation facilities, have been hit hard.But so have countries dependent on hydroelectricity, like Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania and Malawi. In Zambia, hydropower accounts for 95 percent of the electricity. Production at Kariba Dam, which usually generates more than 40 percent of the nation\u2019s power, has fallen to about a quarter of capacity.On a recent morning, not a drop came out of the dam\u2019s sluices. Rocky patches on the riverbed that feeds Lake Kariba lay exposed, and sections of the dam\u2019s walls, usually submerged, were discolored. The rains had come late to Zambia this season, and then only in small quantities, though recent strong rains up north have given officials some hope.\u201cOnce the inflow reaches us in a few weeks, we expect some fair rise, not much,\u201d said Pherry Mwiinga, a hydrologist at the Zambezi River Authority, which manages the dam.Between 1960 and 2003, Zambia\u2019s average annual temperature rose by 1.3 degrees Celsius, and rainfall has decreased by 2.3 percent each decade. The rainy season has become shorter, marked by more frequent droughts. When rains fall, they do so with greater intensity and tend to cause floods.African governments say that big investments are needed to build irrigation facilities, canals and other climate-resilient infrastructure, in addition to developing renewable energy sources.In the climate deal reached in Paris in December, wealthy nations, which are the biggest emitters of greenhouses gases, pledged $100 billion a year starting in 2020 to developing nations to help deal with climate change. But the amount is not legally binding, and terms were left vague.\u201cIt\u2019s very unclear,\u201d said Mr. Kaluba of Zambia\u2019s climate secretariat. \u201cWe see $100 billion scattered all over documents, but what it means has not hit the ground.\u201dRobert Chimambo, an environmental activist at the Zambia Climate Change Network, a private group, said that \u201cthe government could do a lot of things without the help of donors.\u201dZambia\u2019s reliance on hydropower has compounded its problems. The price of copper, its main export, fell because of decreasing demand from China. As the lack of rains led to low water levels here, Zambia was forced to carry out scheduled \u2014 and often unscheduled \u2014 blackouts. As the blackouts increased production costs, copper miners laid off thousands of workers.In a country accustomed to a secure supply of power, the drought and the resulting blackouts immediately affected businesses big and small.For Good Time Steel in Lusaka, the nation\u2019s biggest steel maker, the power cuts meant losing a third of its production capacity and frequent breakdowns in its machinery. Unable to meet production deadlines, the company became unprofitable for the first time last year.Good Time Steel was established in Zambia a decade ago, part of a big wave of Chinese investments in the country and elsewhere in Africa. At the time, Chinese businessmen did not weigh a government\u2019s response to climate change as part of their investment decision making, said Jacky Huang, the manager of Good Time Steel, which employs 600 Zambians and 60 Chinese.\u201cNow we consider what the government is doing about climate change,\u201d Mr. Huang said, adding that his company had recently abandoned an expansion plan because of the erratic power supply. \u201cIt\u2019s a factor we have to consider.\u201dIn an area in Lusaka called Kalingalinga, small informal businesses also complained of losing customers and money. Many business owners now sleep when the power goes off and work when it comes back on.The only thriving business appeared to be rentals of diesel generators, a popular source of power \u2014 and pollution \u2014 in many African nations without enough electricity.At one such place, business has been so brisk that its five employees had not had a single day off since opening more than three months ago.\u201cWe don\u2019t go to church,\u201d said Sheila Kandala, 20. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. Sunday, we\u2019re supposed to rest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Better the Saudis We Know", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsSAUDI ARABIA is dismayed by President Obama\u2019s Middle East policy. Its leaders feel that he does not play by the rules that have governed the Saudi-American alliance for decades: The United States provides security guarantees in return for the Persian Gulf states\u2019 reliable stewardship of their oil reserves and support for American regional dominance.In the Saudis\u2019 view, Mr. Obama has betrayed their interests, often in favor of their enemy, Iran. Having concluded that the United States is no longer a reliable ally, they've decided they must go it alone as a regional power, while also strengthening the country\u2019s domestic economy. In both instances, though, the kingdom is overplaying its hand. The Saudis can\u2019t, in reality, stand up to Iran, nor can their domestic reform agenda deliver, especially if the country remains embroiled in regional conflicts. Failure on both fronts could drag the United States back into the region militarily.The relationship has been rocky since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when it became clear that 15 of the plane hijackers were Saudi citizens. Mr. Obama\u2019s visit coincided with controversy over a bill before Congress that would enable victims of the attacks to sue the Saudi government \u2014 a vivid reminder of the long-running tensions. (The Saudis have threatened economic reprisals if the bill passes, even though the White House has said the president would veto it.)Yet there is truth to the Saudis\u2019 sense that the Obama administration has attenuated the alliance. The Saudis were shocked when America withdrew its forces from Iraq in 2010 and left Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a pro-Iranian Shiite, in charge as prime minister. This abandoned Iraq\u2019s Sunnis to the sectarian Mr. Maliki\u2019s mercy, which indirectly abetted the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq.The final straw came with the American-led nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. While this froze Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for lifting economic sanctions, it placed no constraints on Iran\u2019s ability to project power, either directly or through proxies, across the region, from Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen.Saudis and non-Saudis alike used to complain about the paralysis of Saudi policy making. Not any more. Now the complaints are of sudden, erratic shifts. The result has been more instability in an already turbulent region. Saudi Arabia will not be able to militarily dominate Iran: It has neither the manpower and the expertise nor the broad network of proxy forces that the Iranians have.The kingdom has also thrown caution to the wind in the domestic arena. The House of Saud knows it must diversify its economy, moving away from oil and providing new sources of employment for its young population. The plan to sell off a share of the highly prized national asset, the state-owned oil and gas company Saudi Aramco, as well as privatizing parts of the health and education sectors, shows how far Riyadh is prepared to go.Yet the Saudi economy \u2014 still deeply dependent on state spending \u2014 is unlikely to generate the $100 billion of annual non-oil government revenue envisaged for 2020. Outside the oil sector, its technocratic resources are limited and its capacity for private enterprise is stunted. Many seasoned technocrats believe that playing with the governance of Saudi Aramco, by far the kingdom\u2019s best-functioning institution, is risky.The kingdom\u2019s understandable desire to increase its geopolitical standing and economic autonomy risks overreaching. America can help mitigate this situation. Saudi Arabia needs the American alliance for economic as well as security reasons. It needs to increase foreign investment to finance both the reform program and its ballooning deficit. A clear signal that the United States, the Saudis\u2019 biggest investor, will continue security cooperation would ease foreign investors\u2019 jitters, as well as calm the Saudi leadership.Despite the surface tensions, King Salman and Prince Mohammed are by temperament and conviction deeply pro-American. It would be a desperately wasted opportunity for Washington not to take advantage of this.As unpalatable as cooperation with the kingdom might be for some, cutting it adrift is worse. Whatever the resentments, neither side has a realistic alternative to the other \u2014 something President Obama has clearly had difficulty reconciling himself to.Bernard Haykel is professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton.

{"Headline": "A Cashless Society? Not Before Tubman\u2019s $20 Arrives", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After more than a century-long wait, women and African-Americans are finally going to be represented on the country\u2019s paper currency. But with the new bills years away, how many people will even be carrying cash by the time they go into circulation?Although the long-discussed cashless society is unlikely to have arrived by then, the trend is clear: Americans are relying less on paper money and more on plastic for all manner of transactions.Among them is Matt Bretzius, 31, the president of FischTank Marketing and P.R. in New York. Using cards, he said, makes it easier to manage his spending and record-keeping, and his employees, most in their 20s, use digital payment services like Venmo or PayPal even to reimburse each other for a coffee.\u201cI very rarely see cash exchanged,\u201d he said, \u201ceven for just three bucks.\u201d When he was forced this month to use cash for several days after his credit card number was stolen, it \u201cwas sort of a weird, dirty feeling,\u201d he said.Mr. Bretzius acknowledged that \u201cthe historical significance of putting Harriet Tubman on the bill obviously is fantastic.\u201d But he continued: \u201cIn 20 or 30 years when the bills are circulating, are we going to see a lot of people that have a bunch of $20 bills in their pockets or purses? I don\u2019t think so, personally. I think we\u2019re going to keep trending toward this digital way of spending, especially as the older generations still carrying cash are dying out.\u201dTo argue that there will still be a receptive public for the new notes, Treasury officials on Friday pointed to Federal Reserve data that show a steady increase in the amount of currency in circulation. The $20 bills will feature Tubman, the former slave, abolitionist and suffragist, instead of the slave-owning President Andrew Jackson; $10 bills will feature five suffragists on the back; and $5 bills will honor on the back Eleanor Roosevelt, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the African-American classical singer Marian Anderson.From 1995 to 2015, the number of paper notes in circulation more than doubled, to more than 38 billion from just over 17 billion. Much of that is used in transactions outside this country, since the dollar is the international exchange currency.\u201cWe may be a cashless society one day, but not as soon as some imagine,\u201d Mark Patterson, a former Treasury chief of staff, wrote in an email.He added: \u201cA lot of people dislike paying with a device, even if it\u2019s more convenient. (See the lines at non-EZPass toll lanes.) Many Americans remain unbanked, making electronic payments impossible. And as long as there are babysitters, bellhops, doormen, street vendors and Christmas stockings, there will be cash.\u201d\u201cBut what do I know?\u201d added Mr. Patterson, 54. \u201cI still use cash at Starbucks.\u201dGreg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, echoed that skepticism about the speed of a transition to a cashless economy.\u201cGreenbacks aren\u2019t going to disappear, simply because there are a lot of places on this planet that from the moment you step outside the airport, people love U.S. dollars,\u201d Mr. McBride said.He offered other reasons for the staying power of American cash.

{"Headline": "Is Cheap Oil Contractionary?", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "First, a priori, falling oil prices shouldn\u2019t affect expectations for the rate of inflation of non-oil goods and services, or at least it\u2019s not obvious that it should \u2014 and that\u2019s the inflation rate that should matter for investment. Still, you could argue that oil is in fact driving those expectations, whether it should or not. What Matt does is question whether correlation is causation.I\u2019d make another point: even using market expectations, real interest rates have in fact gone down, not up, in the face of falling oil prices:How is this possible, given the zero lower bound? It\u2019s all about the term structure: long-term rates aren\u2019t at zero, although they\u2019re at least somewhat supported by the floor on short-term rates. And as it turns out, during the recent oil crash long-term rates fell enough to more than offset the decline in expected inflation.Of course, Maury could be right in an other things equal sense. But my guess is that the oil-price disappointment comes less from expectational channels than from two facts: oil is now a big driver of investment, via shale, and oil exporters are actually cash-constrained these days, with an arguably *higher* marginal propensity to spend than oil consumers.Anyway, interesting stuff.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After WikiLeaks Revelation, Greece Asks I.M.F. to Clarify Bailout Plan", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byGreece called on the International Monetary Fund on Saturday to explain whether it was seeking to usher Athens toward bankruptcy ahead of a pivotal referendum in June on Britain\u2019s membership in Europe. Greece\u2019s comments came after I.M.F. officials raised questions in a private discussion published by WikiLeaks about what it would take to get Greece\u2019s creditors to agree to debt relief.The I.M.F. declined to comment on the WikiLeaks transcript, but said in a statement that Greece needed to be put \u201con a path of sustainable growth\u201d supported by reforms and further debt relief. The document touched off a fresh political frenzy inside Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government, which accused the I.M.F. of trying to \u201cpolitically destabilize Europe.\u201dPrivately, however, the fund has discussed pulling out of the bailout deal unless European creditors agree to reduce Greece\u2019s mountain of debt, without which Greece could be dealt a new economic blow. An I.M.F. exit would put the bailout in jeopardy and raise the risk of a Greek default in July, when Athens must repay a large loan. But the European creditors, especially Germany, have resisted, and are pushing the fund instead to soften the austerity terms it is trying to wrench from Greece.In the transcript, Mr. Thomsen suggests that only a precipitous event might push the Europeans to give in on debt relief and keep the I.M.F. from leaving the bailout.\u201cWhat is going to bring it all to a decision point?\u201d Mr. Thomsen asks, according to the WikiLeaks document. \u201cIn the past, there has been only one time when the decision has been made and then that was when they were about to run out of money seriously and to default. And possibly this is what is going to happen again,\u201d he said.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Mr. Thomsen added that the June timing of the British referendum on whether to exit the European Union was crucial, because European leaders would be preoccupied with it for at least a month before then and would not want to return to discussions about the Greek bailout until after the vote. That could pose problems for whether Greece receives financial aid from the bailout in time to meet its July debt repayments.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government met in an emergency session on Saturday to discuss the implications. \u201cThe Greek government asks the I.M.F. for explanations whether pursuing the creation of bankruptcy conditions in Greece, just before the British referendum, is the fund\u2019s official position,\u201d Olga Gerovasili, a Greek government spokeswoman, said in a statement.As a condition for it to stick with the bailout, the I.M.F. has pressed Germany hard to agree to Greek debt relief. The I.M.F. has leverage because the German Parliament might not agree to release funds to Greece unless the I.M.F. participates in the program. But Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has said he sees \u201cno argument\u201d for acceding to the I.M.F.\u2019s demands.The I.M.F. has countered that debt relief is needed not only to help the economy, but also because the Greek government is politically constrained in carrying out all the austerity needed to begin improving its tattered finances. Those frustrations boiled over in the private discussions published by WikiLeaks.\u201cThese guys agree on something and then they give it up the next day,\u201d Delia Velculescu, the I.M.F.\u2019s mission chief for Greece, is reported to tell Mr. Thomsen in the transcript. \u201cWe have said this time and again, we know that they don\u2019t do what we say,\u201d she added. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t function. For them, everything is subject to change \u2014 if the authorities want it.\u201d\u201cI am surprised that it has not happened, is that, because of the refugee situation, they take a decision, that they want to come to a conclusion,\u201d Mr. Thomsen said of the creditors, according to the transcript.If a conclusion does not come rapidly, he added, the I.M.F. would use the threat of quitting against the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who cannot afford for Greece to spiral downward at a time when it is keeping the bulk of new refugees from reaching her country.\u201cYou face a question,\u201d Mr. Thomsen suggests the fund could tell Ms. Merkel. \u201cYou have to think about what is more costly: to go ahead without the I.M.F.,\u201d he said, \u201cor to pick the debt relief that we think that Greece needs in order to keep us on board.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Way to Get to $15", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byEditorialTo their credit as trailblazers, both California and New York are now headed for a minimum wage of $15 an hour, but they are taking different paths to get there. California\u2019s is more direct and offers a better model for other states and the federal government.The two-tiered approach in New York was a political compromise to win over upstate lawmakers who said $15 would be too burdensome for employers in the state\u2019s poorer areas. But it is flawed policy.Historically, minimum wage increases have not been a drain on businesses because they lead to greater labor productivity, lower turnover and more consumer spending, all of which are good for business and thus help employers pay the higher wages.When the minimum wage is kept low, that virtuous cycle is short-circuited. With a minimum of $12.50 in 2021 (and indefinitely thereafter) in upstate New York, low-wage workers will still be struggling and the financial and economic boosts associated with a robust minimum will still be lacking.The big wage differential is for white-collar jobs: Corporate managers upstate make much less than those in New York City. That suggests that what rural areas need is not a lower overall minimum wage, but a longer phase-in to $15. New York City has roughly three years to reach $15. Upstate could surely get there in, say, six years.The problem is political resistance. The minimum wage has always been a battlefield in larger fights between rural and urban interests and, nationally, between the relatively lower-wage South and the higher-wage North. It is important for policy makers to remember that the point of the minimum wage is to set a foundation for broad prosperity. A two-tiered approach, in contrast, would only entrench a two-tiered economy.Advertisement"}

The outcome in Hotchkiss, a town of 900 in the western mountains, was one of a handful of votes on Tuesday in which rural residents rejected efforts to bring marijuana retailers and cultivation operations to their towns. While marijuana is legal across the state, Colorado lets cities decide whether to allow shops within their borders. Marijuana advocates in Hotchkiss had hoped the allure of jobs and new taxes could persuade their neighbors to set aside their aversion.

{"Headline": "Investors Look for Solid Footing After Market Recovery", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byStocks went nowhere fast in the first quarter, plunging into an abyss and rocketing right back out to end modestly above where they began. It\u2019s as if traders concluded first that economic and corporate conditions were profoundly disappointing, and then, with equal certainty, that conditions were much better than they had come to expect.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the quarter with a gain of 0.8 percent after falling more than 10 percent. The benchmark index ended March at 2,059.74.The quarter had two halves for other assets, too, often taking investors on even wilder rides. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, down 16 percent at one point, ended down 1.7 percent; emerging-market stocks lost almost as much before ending up nearly 7 percent; crude oil fell about 30 percent, then recouped all of the deficit and more to finish up 3 percent.Investment advisers make persuasive cases that stocks will trade as they did in the first quarter \u2014 either the first part or the second, maybe both. Likewise they contend that oil, emerging markets and the other dead cats may have been given a second life or are just bouncing. It\u2019s hard to know what to prepare for, because while sentiment clearly changed in February, economic indicators and prospects for corporate results remain murky.\u201cEarnings beats are being done through buybacks and lower tax rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a quality way to beat expectations.\u201dBuying back stock increases earnings per share by dividing profits over a smaller number of shares. There may be no gain in real earnings.Yet as earnings expectations continue to be cut, stocks get more expensive, even with the market going nowhere. The S.&P. 500 ended the first quarter at roughly 17 times estimated 2016 earnings. With valuations high and profit growth hard to come by, Mr. Wilhelm said, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty cautious on the market.\u201d\u201cThere is no margin for safety for any kind of bad news,\u201d he warned.\u201cYou have to have everything working positively\u201d for the market to be worth its present valuation, he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. The economy is weak relative to history, and revenue growth is not there, as well, relative to expectations.\u201dThe move off the lows has been striking in assets that had the largest declines, including value stocks, emerging markets and commodities. That signals an attitude adjustment that persuades Mr. Turnill that the rally will persist.\u201cIn the last six weeks, we\u2019ve had a V-shaped rebound in risk assets accompanied by a change in market leadership,\u201d he said. That indicates to him that the economy and markets have entered \u201ca sweet spot where growth is good enough and fears of recession have diminished, but there\u2019s still no material evidence of renewed inflation.\u201dThe sugar rush late in the first quarter helped domestic stock funds tracked by Morningstar to erase most of their earlier losses, but not all. They fell 0.1 percent on average, eroded by declines of 13.7 percent in portfolios that specialize in health care, 5.9 percent in financial sector funds, 4.1 percent in small-company growth and 2.9 percent in technology.Utility funds bucked the trend, rising 11.4 percent. Portfolios devoted to natural resources were up 6.1 percent, and specialists in precious-metals mining stocks rose 38.9 percent.Bond funds were uniformly solid. The average taxable one rose 2.1 percent. High-yield funds were up 2 percent and municipal funds 0.6 percent.Central banks in Europe and Japan have been even more accommodating, keeping rates at historically low \u2014 even negative \u2014 levels and supporting markets through the asset purchases called quantitative easing.\u201cPart of the reason that the risk of recession is lower is the coordinated policy response globally,\u201d Mr. Turnill said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the story of why markets are in better shape.\u201dHe cautioned that they might drop out of their sweet spot if a deflationary threat emerged. Energy prices could reverse recent gains, for instance, or Chinese authorities could make a misstep in managing their currency. A danger in the opposite direction could occur, he said, if \u201cinflation risk picks up and the Fed looks like it\u2019s behind the curve.\u201d\u201cYou can see the improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation is better,\u201d meaning the risk of deflation is diminishing, \u201cand unemployment is steadily falling.\u201dFunds that own foreign stocks were down 1.1 percent in the first quarter, held back by losses in Europe and India portfolios and supported by a 16 percent gain in Latin America funds that helped the average diversified emerging-market fund return 4 percent. Emerging-market bond funds were also strong, rising 5.9 percent.Mr. Crooke finds good investment opportunities in Britain, where stocks and the pound have suffered from worries about the outcome of a June 23 referendum on continued membership in the European Union. He expects that \u201cpeople will vote for their jobs and to stay in the second-largest trading bloc in the world.\u201dHe likes \u201cquality names listed in London that do business around the world\u201d and also favors stocks of companies in core European countries such as France, the Netherlands and Switzerland that engage in activities in ordinarily stable sectors like health care and consumer staples.Mr. Crooke added that he was not buying into the rally in the most beaten-down market segments.\u201cI\u2019m not getting sucked into this commodity updraft\u201d or the rally in emerging markets, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s telling us conditions are getting better.\u201d\u201cCommodities have recovered, emerging markets have outperformed the developed world for the first time\u201d in quite a while, \u201cand value has outperformed growth,\u201d Mr. Hallett said. \u201cIt looks to us that there\u2019s at least a possibility that more cyclicality is coming back into favor. Whether it lasts the whole year remains to be seen, but it seems to be a little more than a dead-cat bounce.\u201dIn his view, oil prices, which ended the first quarter above $35 a barrel, should stabilize between $40 and $60 rather than \u201ccrash back down.\u201d As for emerging markets, he anticipates strong returns, especially for banks and industrial companies, as stock prices rise and local currencies, which also have been hit hard, revive.Mr. Turnill agrees that the rebound in commodities and emerging markets has further to run.\u201cIn a world where there are very few cheap assets, these are areas where there\u2019s real value,\u201d he said. He also finds good value in Europe and in stocks generally over bonds.Mr. Wilhelm is emphasizing large businesses with low debt and low fixed costs in Touchstone Focused. He tends to find them in traditionally defensive sectors like health and consumer staples and in industrial companies that sell large amounts of services with their products.It can take some time for a market to reach its peak, he said. \u201cIt takes a while for people to wake up and realize that things are a little tougher than they thought. With each retest of the highs, more people become aware that we might have a problem.\u201dIt\u2019s one that central banks might not be able to solve, he warned.\u201cThe Fed often creates excitement through monetary policy, but at some point the fundamentals have to be there,\u201d Mr. Wilhelm said.Mr. Freeman at Westwood has a similar affinity for high-quality companies in the same sectors and industries, and for the same reasons. But he also recommends energy stocks for anyone with a large appetite for risk and lots of patience. Echoing Mr. Wilhelm\u2019s misgivings, he suggested that his own patience with the Fed might be running low.\u201cWhen we\u2019re in this extremely low-nominal-growth and earnings-challenged environment, investors are looking for someone else to provide support,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only game in town is central banks, but that\u2019s not something we can hang our hat on. We need to get some stability in the earnings outlook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Papers Leak Casts Light on a Law Firm Founded on Secrecy", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byIn January, a prosecutor investigating the sweeping corruption in Brazil publicly called their law firm \u201ca huge money launderer.\u201dThe partners had become very wealthy, and Mr. Fonseca leveraged the firm\u2019s success to gain an influential role in the upper ranks of politics. He told associates that he wanted to clean up the government, serving as a special adviser to President Juan Carlos Varela until the corruption scandal in Brazil forced Mr. Fonseca to resign this year.In an interview, he said that entering politics was, in part, a way of giving back. \u201cI believe in sharing the pizza,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt least to give others one slice.\u201dPanama\u2019s president has vowed to cooperate with any judicial investigations stemming from the leaked information, which could put him in the awkward position of allowing an inquiry into his former adviser.Mossack Fonseca has denied that it committed any wrongdoing, and Mr. Fonseca proclaimed his firm\u2019s innocence.\u201cAt the end of this storm the sky will be blue again and people will find that the only crime is the hacking\u201d of the firm\u2019s documents, he said in an hourlong interview conducted over the messaging platform WhatsApp.But some in Panama who know Mr. Fonseca say the leak\u2019s contents are at odds with how he has tried to portray himself and his role in the country.Carlos Guevara Mann, a fellow party member and former government official, said he had once asked Mr. Fonseca, already a successful novelist, why he would bother with politics. The lawyer, he recalled, told him that he wanted to set straight the nation\u2019s human rights record.\u201cWhen you match that conversation with the fact that the firm was providing services to all of those notorious human rights violators \u2014 Qaddafi, Mugabe, Assad and Putin \u2014 it really is repugnant,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cThis is dangerous!\u201d Mr. Mossack wrote in an email to Mr. Fonseca and others at the firm. \u201cA red flag should have been raised immediately.\u201dMr. Mossack placed blame for the oversight on employees in the law firm\u2019s London office who were \u201cnot doing their due diligence thoroughly, (or maybe none at all).\u201dThe leaks have roiled Panama\u2019s legal and banking sectors, bedrocks of the country\u2019s economy, and chilled Panama\u2019s business class. The country\u2019s bar association has come to the firm\u2019s defense, saying the leak amounted to an attack on the country\u2019s reputation.\u201cTerrible damage is being done to them, to all lawyers and their country at large,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Alberto Alvarez, the association\u2019s president, said in a news conference on Monday.There is a lot at stake for Panama, a country whose economy heavily relies on the legal and financial services industries.The rise of Mossack Fonseca coincided with the emergence of Panama as a capital of the worldwide offshore banking industry. The increasing flow of global capital across borders during the 1970s and 1980s fueled a market for lawyers and accountants capable of sheltering the money, and Panama was primed to take advantage of the boom.Beginning in the early 1900s, its station as a trade and shipping center \u2014 at the intersection of two continents and at the convergence of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea \u2014 made it an obvious candidate for offshore accounting. International ships flew the Panamanian flag to take advantage of its advantageous corporate tax structure, which some experts say was copied almost directly from the state of Delaware.\u201cBecause it has always been at the center of international trade, it was a natural fit for things like offshore finance and international offshore tax planning,\u201d said Victor Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is justified or not, but people have always thought of Panama as a little bit shady.\u201dThe firm was aggressive and nimble, capable of responding to an evolving regulatory landscape. Its reputation flourished.But other Panamanian law firms joined the fray, too, including larger and more prominent practices than Mossack Fonseca.\u201cAll the important Panamanian law firms have a division like this,\u201d said Roberto Eisenmann, the founder of the newspaper La Prensa in Panama.In fact, Mossack Fonseca is just one of countless firms around the globe dedicated to a worldwide industry that harbors trillions of dollars and may deprive nations of as much as $200 billion in tax revenues each year, tax and legal experts say.Mossack Fonseca\u2019s founding partners bought large homes in exclusive neighborhoods in Panama City as well as luxurious weekend retreats. Growing up, their children borrowed the company plane and took friends on trips.But despite their parallel ascents in business and society, Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca apparently kept their social lives separate. Friends and associates describe their personalities as completely distinct.Mr. Mossack has maintained a low profile, eschewing the party scene of Panama\u2019s high society while adopting a disciplined approach to his work. Though he is more focused on the day-to-day operations, he has so far declined to comment publicly about the document leak.Mr. Fonseca, by contrast, has for years been something of a man about town. Born in Panama in 1952, he studied at the London School of Economics and later worked for several years at the United Nations in Geneva \u2014 \u201ctrying to save the world,\u201d as he described it in the interview.It was then, he said, that he first began to ponder writing a novel. Decades later, in the 1990s, he became famous as a novelist, twice winning Panama\u2019s highest literary prize.But he had even greater ambitions: politics. One day, when complaining to his father about the shabby state of Panamanian politics, the elder man snapped at him. \u201cMy father told me: It\u2019s not fair to criticize the bullfighter from your seat,\u201d he wrote in the interview. \u201cEnter the ring!\u201dBy the 2000s, he was well ensconced with the Paname\u00f1ista party and became a close adviser to Mr. Varela. After Mr. Varela became president in 2014, Mr. Fonseca joined his cabinet as an adviser.Within Mossack Fonseca, both founding partners had swagger. Former employees said the firm had a staff of aides, whose job it was to arrange hotel, car service and entertainment for wealthy clients when they came to town \u2014 like tours of the old city or the Panama Canal.\u201cThere were no kings or princes that I remember,\u201d said Tarina Rodr\u00edguez, adding that she worked at the firm for three years and served as the \u201chead of hospitality.\u201d The visitors, she said, \u201cwere very low-key businessmen, who wanted to keep a low profile.\u201dSeveral former employees described a disciplined culture, arguing that the partners appeared to run an ethical business. Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca, they said, were sticklers for compliance, insisting on detailed procedures concerning most business matters at the firm.\u201cThere were so many processes you had to follow,\u201d said Mileidy Castillo, who said she worked at the firm from 2011 to 2013.Experts say, however, that checking boxes is not the full measure of compliance. Rather, it comes with a law firm\u2019s willingness to push its clients to reveal the true identity of those involved in offshore transactions, and the source of their money.\u201cToo often, these offshore firms are willing to take on just about any customer and follow their instructions,\u201d said Jack Blum, a former Senate investigator who now specializes in examining money laundering and tax evasion.As offshore accounts have multiplied during the past several decades, they have increasingly been used to launder money, evade taxes or finance terrorism. Those seeking to break the law have often enjoyed the same secrecy as accounts used for legitimate purposes.An international transparency movement developed over the past decade, spearheaded by major international agencies. But Panama, long accustomed to following its own path, was far behind in compliance.\u201cIn the last 25 years or so, there has probably been 15 years of almost no regulation,\u201d Mr. Eisenmann said of Panama.In 2014, the Financial Action Task Force put Panama on its list of countries where transparency and accountability systems were woefully lacking, a major blow to the nation. Mr. Varela quickly pushed through legislation to address the issue, leading to Panama\u2019s removal from the list in February.But Panama has been more reluctant to follow a transparency initiative started in 2009 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While most other international financial centers, like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and Singapore, quickly agreed to the initiative, Panama held back.\u201cPanama is the last major holdout that continues to allow funds to be hidden offshore from tax and law enforcement authorities,\u201d the group\u2019s secretary general, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, said in a statement on Monday.But several tax experts pointed out that Panama, in its refusal to comply with international transparency standards, is in esteemed company: the United States.Foreign nations have had trouble getting information about accounts their citizens hold in America as well.\u201cPanama isn\u2019t the real story,\u201d said Matt Gardner, the executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group based in Washington. \u201cThis leak is giving a window into a much broader world, but it should be understood as giving a window into how things work in the U.S. as well.\u201dSince the data leak last weekend, both the firm and Mr. Fonseca have said that they are not responsible for the actions of the shell companies they create.In the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Fonseca said that the company was careful to vet clients, and that it would drop any it discovered with a \u201cbad reputation.\u201d But he was insistent that his clients were lawyers, accountants and intermediaries \u2014 not dictators, for instance.\u201cWe are like a car factory who sells its car to a dealer (a lawyer for example), and he sells it to a lady that hits someone,\u201d he wrote in a message. \u201cThe factory is not responsible for what is done with the car.\u201dMr. Fonseca said his firm tried to determine \u201cto the best of our knowledge\u201d the actual owner of a shell corporation.\u201cThe industry is becoming more regulated and serious about being used by the bad guys and we welcome this,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cBut pls remember that 15 years ago the term due diligence was unknown.\u201dOver the years, courts and government investigators have occasionally managed to puncture Mossack Fonseca\u2019s shield of secrecy.In Brazil, Mossack Fonseca was linked to a corruption investigation into bribes paid to politicians by companies doing business with the state-run oil company. Investigators began focusing on the firm after finding an array of apartments in the names of relatives of an imprisoned politician.Recent litigation in the United States uncovered a connection between a shell company set up in Nevada and Mossack Fonseca\u2019s headquarters in Panama. The breakthrough came after almost three years of legal wrangling by the plaintiff, one of the world\u2019s best-financed hedge funds, run by the billionaire Paul Singer.The hedge fund was trying to track down money that had been siphoned from public coffers in Argentina into illegal shell companies. The hedge fund owned $1.7 billion of Argentine debt dating to the nation\u2019s financial crisis in the early 2000s, and the country was refusing to pay it.But the hedge fund\u2019s task was not so simple. A shell company known as MF Nevada was claiming that it had no relationship with Mossack Fonseca.Even the judge found this hard to believe, at one point asking the company\u2019s lawyer what the \u201cMF\u201d in MF Nevada stood for, according to a court transcript.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the lawyer responded, eliciting laughter in the courtroom.During questioning, the person listed on the incorporation documents acknowledged that she took her directions from individuals at Mossack Fonseca. The federal judge in Nevada found that the shell company was essentially an alter ego of Mossack Fonseca, in effect granting the hedge fund access to information ordinarily held behind the law firm\u2019s impenetrable facade in Panama.\u201cAs attorneys we have the duty to provide privacy,\u201d Mr. Fonseca said in the interview.He feels his firm, in particular, has been robbed of it.Mr. Fonseca said he was currently working on a novel about an investigative journalist who is \u201chonest and looking for the truth without agendas.\u201d And he has already begun outlining another book.The working title: \u201cIs privacy a lost human right?\u201dAn article on April 7 about Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm that became a powerhouse of secretive offshore banking for the world\u2019s elite, misstated the surname of the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, who said Panama has been reluctant to follow an international banking transparency initiative started by the organization in 2009.

{"Headline": "Aggregate Supply and Depression Economics (Wonkish)", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Be that as it may, it\u2019s quite ironic given recent events that some critics of the old paper warned that higher expected inflation might get built into wage and price setting \u2014 because that\u2019s what you *want* to happen. It\u2019s a feature, not a bug.Indeed, the biggest problem with Abenomics \u2014 which is the closest thing we\u2019ve seen yet to an attempt to bootstrap an economy out of the liquidity trap by promising higher inflation \u2014 is precisely that so far inflation expectations, while they have moved asset markets, haven\u2019t translated into sufficiently higher inflation in the real economy. The idea that inflation promises might go directly into prices is a hope, not a worry.So why did smart people get so confused by all this (and some still are)? Partly, I think, because liquidity trap economics \u2014 depression economics \u2014 is deeply counterintuitive to many people, including economists. I tried to make it more intuitive with an extremely simple model, but evidently that didn\u2019t work for everyone.Beyond that, in the late 1990s, and even now to some extent, we were suffering from the tyranny of the 1970s, with too many people seeing stagflation around every corner. In fact, it\u2019s still happening now, despite the reality that the post-2008 crisis was far worse for the world\u2019s major economies than the stagflation of the 1970s ever was. Again, I tried to break through that obsession, with some modeling that I\u2019m still very proud of, and with a book that I think looks very good in retrospect.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate Declares Debt Moratorium", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rico took steps on Tuesday toward a unilateral moratorium on all government debt payments, rejecting efforts in Washington to allow it to restructure only under close federal supervision.The Puerto Rican Senate authorized a declaration of emergency and a debt moratorium at around 3 a.m., after hours of debate. The island\u2019s House of Representatives was debating such a measure late Tuesday but had not yet voted. Any bill would need to be signed by the governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla.The sudden moves seemed likely to complicate efforts in Washington to enact a rescue package for Puerto Rico. The House Natural Resources Committee, which has been drafting the rescue in consultation with Democrats in Congress and the Treasury Department, said it still planned to issue an updated version on Wednesday, despite Puerto Rico\u2019s action.The rescue involves sensitive constitutional issues, and the drafters have been trying to strike a balance between Democratic and Republican Party priorities. So far, the lawmakers in Congress have called for sending a federal oversight board to Puerto Rico, auditing all major branches of government there, promoting fiscal reforms and eventually providing certain restructuring tools that are normally available only in bankruptcy.On Tuesday, Daniel Watson, a Treasury Department spokesman, said the agency continued to closely monitor the situation in Puerto Rico and was in contact with the government there. \u201cThe steps Puerto Rico is considering serve as yet another reminder that the commonwealth is in crisis and urgently needs the ability to comprehensively restructure its financial liabilities, along with independent oversight that respects the commonwealth\u2019s self-governance,\u201d the representative said.But the oversight board, which may have seemed a reasonable requirement in Washington, has been seen on the island as an intolerable vestige of colonial rule. Puerto Rican legislative aides also said Congress was moving too slowly, forcing them to enact their own rescue before their economy deteriorated even further.In addition to halting debt payments, Puerto Rico\u2019s lawmakers are acting to limit activities by the island\u2019s Government Development Bank, a crucial part of the local financial system and a participant in virtually all government debt deals. They want to preserve the bank\u2019s cash to finance essential public services.The Senate bill sets a \u201cmoratorium period\u201d that would run until at least Jan. 31, 2017. It also creates a receivership for the Government Development Bank and carves off a \u201cbridge bank\u201d that would continue to honor certain claims during the moratorium.Bank creditors whose claims are not assumed by the bridge bank would be entitled only to the amounts they would receive if the Government Development Bank were liquidated, the Senate bill says.Groups representing some of Puerto Rico\u2019s many bondholders expressed surprise at the call for a moratorium. Hector Negroni, a major bondholder at the investment fund Fundamental Credit Opportunities, said he had just landed on the island for scheduled debt negotiations when he heard.\u201cI came down here to advance a dialogue for a consensual deal on the general obligation bonds,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about this. I got here and it happened.\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds are explicitly guaranteed by the island\u2019s Constitution, and investors holding that type of debt say it would be unconstitutional for Puerto Rico to do anything but pay in full.Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer representing holders of general obligation bonds, said he thought the moratorium had been deliberately timed to throw cold water on the bondholders\u2019 negotiations. Even as lawmakers declared Tuesday afternoon that \u201cPuerto Rico is not for sale\u201d on the floor of the island\u2019s House, Mr. Rosenberg was distributing the terms of his group\u2019s proposal, which included halting principal repayments on $2 billion of bonds for five years.\u201cWhile we would like to negotiate with the Puerto Rican government in private and in good faith,\u201d he said, the debt moratorium had prompted him to reveal, in his view, what a good deal Puerto Rico was walking away from.The president of the Government Development Bank, Melba Acosta Febo, issued a statement rejecting the proposal Tuesday evening. She called it \u201cexactly the type of \u2018Wall Street\u2019 solution that led us to the precipice we are now looking over,\u201d because she said it would add debt and raise costs over the long term.Others with financial dealings in Puerto Rico said they were caught off guard and did not know how to respond. Some said they thought the legislation was intended not so much to trip up creditors or elicit offers as to pressure Washington to speed up its work on the federal rescue package.Some said they continued to hope on Tuesday that Puerto Rico\u2019s House might enact a narrower moratorium than its Senate had, perhaps excluding certain types of debt or agreeing to pay interest but not principal. But as the hours passed, their hopes were waning.For months Puerto Rico and its Government Development Bank have been meeting with the holders of the island\u2019s $72 billion in debt, trying to interest some of them in a consensual debt restructuring. Parties to some of these discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private, said they became aware late last week that the development bank\u2019s assets were being hastily transferred to other financial institutions, for reasons that were not explained.Rumors then began to fly on the island that the bank was about to be shut or privatized.A confidential regulatory review of the development bank last November found that it was insolvent and would have a $1.3 billion deficit by the end of June, which raised the prospect of dedicated funds being diverted to other purposes.The turmoil at the bank threatened to spread quickly to other parts of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, which is already deeply distressed. Much larger debt payments, totaling about $2 billion, are due from other branches of the government on July 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why There\u2019s Hope for the Middle Class (With Help From China)", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAmerica has often thought of itself as a middle-class nation \u2014 one in which most people are merely comfortable and neither very rich nor very poor.That notion has come under siege lately. Income inequality has been rising since the early 1980s, and the median household income is now lower than it was in 1999. The status of the middle class has become a highly charged political issue. Nonetheless, a sober look at the trends of recent years reveals some reason for optimism: Pathways that already exist offer some chance of rejuvenating the middle class.The weakness of recent middle-class wage growth has stemmed from a number of factors, including foreign competition, technological changes that favor highly skilled workers and persistent poverty. Let\u2019s consider each in turn.Better times may be ahead, though. Higher wages in China \u2014 and other emerging nations \u2014 are now limiting the competitive advantage of those economies. And perhaps more important for Americans, as China reaches technological maturity, it is likely to shower innovations on consumers, creating a net gain for people in the United States.This would mean more competition from China, of course, and lost jobs in some fields, but to simply focus on the negatives would be shortsighted. The reality is that innovators do not capture all or even most of the benefits they bring to the world. Once an idea emerges, its benefits begin to expand, and those benefits will surely spread to the United States.What economists call skill-based technical change may also shift in a more egalitarian direction. The advent of information technology increased the value of workers and managers who could manipulate these new talents effectively, while smart software eliminated the jobs of many travel agents and paper-filing clerks. But consider a universe in which all it takes to work with a computer is to talk to it. That could lower the wages of technicians, while opening a new world where less skilled laborers could work with information technology effectively.Finally, income inequality may begin to reverse itself through the evolution of social norms. Poor people who see no way out of their plight won\u2019t all be able to advance without outside help, but some of the impoverished will succeed despite the barriers they face.Mormons have done relatively well in economic terms, perhaps, at least in part, because their religious culture encourages behavior consistent with prosperity, such as savings, mutual assistance, family values and no drug and alcohol abuse.I am not a Mormon and am not advocating that religion or any other. But it seems reasonable to observe that changing social norms, sometimes associated with religion, can help improve living standards.All of these mechanisms involve some degree of speculation, and the speed at which they will develop will vary. Still, these processes can already be found around us to a limited degree. Furthermore, all of them could happen without requiring any major change in American public policy and thus they could bypass possible government gridlock.Most people agree there is plenty of unfairness built into the current political system, such as bad public policies, which often favor the well-off and erect barriers to the advancement of poorer and less educated individuals. How to change these policies will no doubt continue to be a matter of political debate.But there is reason to believe that when inequality trends start to run in reverse \u2014 whenever that might be \u2014 it will be because of processes that are operating largely outside of politics. Technology, trade and even religion may help restore prosperity to the middle class.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brussels Mentor Who Taught \u2018Gangster Islam\u2019 to the Young and Angry", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byWhen the Belgian police seized the computer of the man, Khalid Zerkani, in 2014, they found a trove of extremist literature, including tracts titled \u201cThirty-Eight Ways to Participate in Jihad\u201d and \u201cSixteen Indispensable Objects to Own Before Going to Syria.\u201d In July, Belgian judges sentenced him to 12 years in prison for participating in the activities of a terrorist organization, and declared him the \u201carchetype of a seditious mentor\u201d who spread \u201cextremist ideas among na\u00efve, fragile and agitated youth.\u201d\u201cMr. Zerkani has perverted an entire generation of youngsters, particularly in the Molenbeek neighborhood,\u201d the Belgian federal prosecutor, Bernard Michel, said in February.During his trial, Mr. Zerkani, 42, denied any involvement in terrorism. His Brussels lawyer, Steve Lambert, declined to comment for this article.But court documents and interviews with Molenbeek residents and activists, as well as with Belgian security officials, suggest that he had direct or indirect connections with several crucial figures who are now dead or under arrest in connection with the November massacre in Paris that killed 130 people and the bombings last month in Brussels that killed 32.His younger brother, Souleymane, traveled to Syria with help from Mr. Zerkani, according to security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do otherwise. The brother reportedly died there in 2014 while fighting with the Islamic State. Reda Kriket, another veteran of the conflict in Syria who was arrested in France last month in connection with the thwarted attack, stayed in Mr. Zerkani\u2019s apartment for a time and lent him his French-registered Mercedes, prosecutors said.Hawa Keita, an immigrant to Brussels from Mali, said her son, Yoni Mayne, had become radicalized in a matter of months under Mr. Zerkani\u2019s influence. (She believes her son died in battle in Syria in 2014.)\u201cHe is a sorcerer,\u201d she said of the now-imprisoned Mr. Zerkani in an interview at her apartment in a Brussels high-rise. \u201cHe is Satan.\u201dThe role in Molenbeek of Mr. Zerkani, a surly man more versed in the ways of the street than in those of the mosque, helps explain why a small and not particularly destitute district of the Belgian capital keeps cropping up in relation to terrorist investigations. It also highlights a pronounced shift over the past decade from the often arcane theological debates of an earlier generation of jihadists linked to Al Qaeda to what Hind Fraihi, who wrote a book about Molenbeek, called \u201cgangster Islam.\u201dMs. Fraihi, a Belgian of Moroccan descent, said that when she first started researching in Molenbeek more than a decade ago, the radical scene was dominated by extremist clerics well versed in religious texts. This has mutated under the influence of Islamic State propaganda, she said, into a criminal enterprise driven by \u201cthe synergy between banditism and Islam.\u201dThe Islamic State recruits among \u201cbandits and gangsters because it needs them for their knowledge of guns, safe houses and the underground scene,\u201d Ms. Fraihi said. \u201cMix this with a little Islam, and this is what you get in Molenbeek.\u201dSome trace the roots of radicalism in Molenbeek to the 1990s, when Bassam Ayachi, a Franco-Syrian former restaurant owner, set up the Belgian Islamic Center, a makeshift mosque that promoted the dogmatic Salafi strand of the religion. Residents and some municipal officials repeatedly warned the authorities that it was sheltering extremists.Philippe Moureaux, Molenbeek\u2019s mayor from 1993 until 2012, said that on meeting Mr. Ayachi, \u201cit was clear he was an extremist,\u201d but that he considered this the responsibility of the Belgian federal security service, not of municipal officials like himself.Mr. Leman, who was serving on the government\u2019s anti-discrimination commission, filed a lawsuit accusing the Islamic Center of promoting anti-Semitic and anti-American views. The court ruled in 2006 that the center had indulged in hate speech, he said. Around the same time, the Belgian police raided Mr. Ayachi\u2019s apartment, carting away computers and documents.Mr. Ayachi subsequently moved to Syria with his son, who later died in battle against government forces. Mr. Ayachi did not reply to a request for comment.Mr. Zerkani, a Moroccan who became a Belgian resident in 2002, moved on the fringes of Mr. Ayachi\u2019s milieu but did not attract close attention, people in his neighborhood said. While the Islamic Center had championed an ascetic and rigid form of Islam that had only modest appeal to young people who liked to drink alcohol and carouse at night, Mr. Zerkani, Belgian investigators said, was able to bridge the divide by channeling the criminal energies of young delinquents.Mr. Zerkani was born in Zenata, an area of northern Morocco inhabited by the country\u2019s often rebellious Berber-speaking minority, and spent time in Spain and the Netherlands before moving to Belgium when he was 28. In Brussels, his associates included supporters of the Shabab, a militant group in Somalia affiliated with Al Qaeda. Belgian investigators say he shoplifted and committed other petty crimes before becoming a prolific recruiter for the Islamic State.A senior Belgian terrorism investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to do otherwise, said that it was not clear how Mr. Zerkani had become a trusted operator for the Islamic State and its predecessors, and that the extent of his involvement with people connected to plots was only now coming into focus.One theory is that Mr. Zerkani was recommended to the militant group\u2019s leadership in Syria by Fatima Aberkan, a friend of the wife of the Qaeda militant who killed Mr. Massoud, the Afghan warlord. In the 2015 trial that featured Mr. Zerkani, a Belgian court sentenced Ms. Aberkan to five years in prison for participation in a terrorist organization; she and five of her children, three sons and two daughters, have spent time in Syria with the Islamic State, prosecutors said.There is no record of Mr. Zerkani traveling to Syria. But prosecutors said that at least 18 people he was in regular contact with went there to fight between mid-2012 and 2014.At least two of the attackers are believed to have had roles in both plots.Belgian security officials and people who know Mr. Zerkani said he had assured Molenbeek\u2019s wayward youth that past criminal convictions were not an obstacle to the Islamic cause, but a vital foundation. At his trial, according to the judges\u2019 summary of the verdict, witnesses testified that he had preached that \u201cto steal from the infidels is permitted by Allah,\u201d and necessary to finance travel to \u201czones of jihad.\u201dHe had been arrested carrying 4,397 euros (about $5,000) and $1,235, as well as currency from Singapore, Morocco and six other countries. The police also seized stolen passports and found multiple cellphones, computers and a device to foil shoplifting alarms.And he had rung up large phone bills, making 47 calls to Islamic State contacts in Syria and 89 to others in Turkey in just 10 days in December 2013, according to court documents.Investigators struggled to balance these findings with the fact that Mr. Zerkani had no known job since 2008, yet for years had doled out money to volunteer fighters. Mr. Zerkani told the authorities that he had worked \u201cau noir\u201d \u2014 in the shadow economy \u2014 trading \u201cvarious objects.\u201d But surveillance teams reported that they never saw him sell anything.Belgian prosecutors said in a report that Mr. Zerkani had secured the obedience of disaffected young men \u201cby progressively cutting them off from their previous bearings and from their family, school and social ties in Belgium.\u201d Most were 15 to 20 years his junior and shared his Moroccan origins.\u201cThey\u2019ll catch a North African because they know the inside of his head,\u201d said Bachir M\u2019Rabet, a youth counselor in Molenbeek. Recruiters like Mr. Zerkani, he added, \u201cwon\u2019t go to a Turk or an Albanian because they\u2019re not culturally close.\u201dMohamed Karim Haddad, the brother of an acolyte who left for Syria, described Mr. Zerkani \u201cas a charlatan who, for a bad cause, misled youths or men who are socially unstable.\u201dMs. Keita\u2019s son, who would have been 25 now, was convicted of drug charges in Brussels in 2013. But his mother said it was not until he started hanging out in Molenbeek that he showed any interest in Syria, and criticized her for being insufficiently devout.Mr. Zerkani did not lecture these recruits on arcane theological justifications for violence, like Mr. Ayachi of the Islamic Center, but instead used a few crude religious ideas to give legitimacy to the criminal path they had already chosen.Long before jihad became fashionable on the fringes, crime was endemic in parts of Molenbeek, a breakdown for which many blame Mr. Moureaux, the former mayor who won election after election.He set off an uproar in 2010 when he joined the mayor of the Brussels region in dismissing a gun attack on police officers by a Belgian-Moroccan armed with a Kalashnikov rifle as a \u201cfait divers,\u201d or a titillating news item of no consequence.The gunman, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison but released after four, was Ibrahim Bakraoui, one of the two brothers who the authorities say staged suicide attacks in Brussels on March 22.Advertisement"}

Acres of paper records on demographics, public health, traffic patterns, energy consumption, family incomes and many other topics have been digitized and posted on the web.This abundance of data can be a gold mine for discovery and insights, but finding the nuggets can be arduous, requiring special skills.Cesar A.

So for those of us appalled by this prospect \u2014 what are we supposed to do?Well, not what the leaders of the Republican Party are doing. They\u2019re going down meekly and hoping for a quiet convention. They seem blithely unaware that this is a Joe McCarthy moment. People will be judged by where they stood at this time. Those who walked with Trump will be tainted forever after for the degradation of standards and the general election slaughter.Trump\u2019s success grew out of that pain, but he is not the right response to it. The job for the rest of us is to figure out the right response.That means first it\u2019s necessary to go out into the pain. I was surprised by Trump\u2019s success because I\u2019ve slipped into a bad pattern, spending large chunks of my life in the bourgeois strata \u2014 in professional circles with people with similar status and demographics to my own. It takes an act of will to rip yourself out of that and go where you feel least comfortable. But this column is going to try to do that over the next months and years. We all have some responsibility to do one activity that leaps across the chasms of segmentation that afflict this country.We\u2019ll probably need a new national story. Up until now, America\u2019s story has been some version of the rags-to-riches story, the lone individual who rises from the bottom through pluck and work. But that story isn\u2019t working for people anymore, especially for people who think the system is rigged.I don\u2019t know what the new national story will be, but maybe it will be less individualistic and more redemptive. Maybe it will be a story about communities that heal those who suffer from addiction, broken homes, trauma, prison and loss, a story of those who triumph over the isolation, social instability and dislocation so common today.We\u2019ll probably need a new definition of masculinity, too. There are many groups in society who have lost an empire but not yet found a role. Men are the largest of those groups. The traditional masculine ideal isn\u2019t working anymore. It leads to high dropout rates, high incarceration rates, low labor force participation rates. This is an economy that rewards emotional connection and verbal expressiveness. Everywhere you see men imprisoned by the old reticent, stoical ideal.Maybe the task is to build a ladder of hope. People across America have been falling through the cracks. Their children are adrift. Trump, to his credit, made them visible. We can start at the personal level just by hearing them talk.Then solidarity can be rekindled nationally. Over the course of American history, national projects like the railroad legislation, the W.P.A. and the NASA project have bound this diverse nation. Of course, such projects can happen again \u2014 maybe through a national service program, or something else.Trump will have his gruesome moment.

{"Headline": "Global Warming Feels Quite Pleasant", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byGray MatterCHRISTMAS in New York was lovely this year \u2014 especially for those who prefer to spend the day working on their tans. It was the city\u2019s warmest ever, with temperatures peaking at 66 degrees.Of course, people\u2019s preferences about weather vary widely. Some want a snowfall every winter, while others would rather wear sandals year-round. So we sought to develop a measure of the average American\u2019s weather preferences. To do this, we made use of research by economists who study local population growth in the United States. They have found that Americans have been moving to places with warm winters and cool, less humid summers. We made the inference (not true in every case, but reasonable to assume in general) that Americans prefer such conditions.Then we evaluated the changes in weather conditions that Americans have experienced over the past four decades (i.e., roughly since climate change emerged as an issue in the public sphere). Climatologists customarily report weather changes averaged over the land surface \u2014 an approach that counts changes in sparse Montana just as heavily as shifts in populous California. But because we were interested in the typical American\u2019s exposure to weather, we took a different tack, calculating changes over time on a county-by-county basis, weighted by population.Our findings are striking: 80 percent of Americans now find themselves living in counties where the weather is more pleasant than it was four decades ago. Although warming during this period has been considerable, it has not been evenly distributed across seasons. Virtually all Americans have experienced a rise in January maximum daily temperatures \u2014 an increase of 1.04 degrees Fahrenheit per decade on average \u2014 while changes in daily maximum temperatures in July have been much more variable across counties, rising by an average of just 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over all. Moreover, summer humidity has declined during this period.As a result, most people\u2019s experiences with daily weather since the time that they first heard about climate change have generally been positive. By our calculations, the mild winters now regularly experienced in New York City make its weather nearly as pleasant as that of Virginia Beach back in the 1970s.And it will change for the worse. Under all likely scenarios, seasonal trends are projected to eventually reverse: Future warming in the United States will be more severe in summer than in winter. Should greenhouse gas emissions proceed unabated, we estimate that 88 percent of Americans will be exposed to less pleasant weather at the end of this century than they are today.In order to more effectively raise awareness and increase public concern about climate change, our research suggests that we need to stop talking so much about rising temperatures. A focus on extreme weather events \u2014 which are easily understood by the public and have potentially much greater impact on human health and the economy \u2014 may be a better strategy.And when we do discuss temperatures, we should acknowledge the temporarily pleasant side effects of global warming. But then we should stress that these agreeable conditions will one day vanish \u2014 like ice on a warm winter day.Advertisement"}

His surging runs turned defense into attack, covering distances of 70 yards or more. His awareness of his colleagues and his ability to find them with subtle passes allowed Sergio Ag\u00fcero to score three goals.And for once, the man who enabled the hat trick deserves to be credited just as much as the man who scored the goals.De Bruyne is coming back into peak form after missing more than two months from a knee injury suffered in late January.How important is he to the team? City has won 22 of the 36 games that De Bruyne has played this season, but lost eight of the 16 games he missed.During that time, Ag\u00fcero and others also found it a lot harder to score. When De Bruyne has played, City has amassed 79 goals, but the club scored only 26 when he was out.De Bruyne is far from a one-man team; in fact, he may not be the best player on the squad. Manchester City\u2019s coach, Manuel Pellegrini, rates Ag\u00fcero the best striker in the Premier League, by far.But De Bruyne scores goals, too. His fine goals, both home and away, were instrumental in City\u2019s beating Paris St.-Germain in the Champions League quarterfinals.If there is a manager who understands how the feeling of being unwanted can be turned into a positive force, it is Pellegrini.The 62-year-old Chilean has known since the turn of the year that Manchester City has hired Pep Guardiola to replace him after this season. Pellegrini suffered the same indignity when he was coach at Real Madrid, when Madrid gave his job to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho despite the team\u2019s racking up a record number of wins and points under Pellegrini.There is a perception among club owners and presidents that winning \u2014 even winning stylishly, as Pellegrini\u2019s teams generally do \u2014 is not enough. Madrid went for Mourinho, and City now is going for Guardiola as it looks for that extra dimension.It has to do with making good players play. It also has to do with charisma. Guardiola and Mourinho are as good in front of the TV cameras as they are in the locker room.In Mourinho\u2019s case, that is in question right now because it was Chelsea \u2014 coached by Mourinho \u2014 that imploded this season after winning the Premier League last year. And it was Mourinho who discarded De Bruyne.In two years as a Chelsea player, De Bruyne made only three starts in the league. Mourinho had an embarrassment of riches, a surfeit of midfield talents, and the coach said at the time, \u201cIf you have a player knocking on your door and crying every day that he wants to leave, you have to make a decision.\u201dDe Bruyne corrected that version of the story before Saturday\u2019s game. He told reporters that Mourinho had called in all the attacking midfield players, showed them the statistics and said that De Bruyne was last in assists, goals, passing percentage and dribbles.\u201cI said that wasn\u2019t logical. I\u2019d played less games than the others; how could you compare me to them?\u201dWithin a month, Chelsea had sold De Bruyne to Wolfsburg in the German league. He was 22 at the time, and Chelsea received more than double the fee it had paid two years earlier to get De Bruyne from Genk, a club in his home country of Belgium.After a spectacular season in which De Bruyne was voted the Bundesliga\u2019s top player, the fee for him tripled, with Manchester City spending about $78 million to acquire him.The returns on the field are still coming. De Bruyne is more of a player and more of an adult than he was in his Chelsea days. He recently became a father, and he certainly doesn\u2019t \u201ccry\u201d in the manager\u2019s office.But he makes others cry, at least metaphorically. It was breathtaking to see him on Saturday when, after a corner kick against City, he burst with the ball past one, two, three of the Chelsea players who were preferred over him during his time in London.The run kept on going until De Bruyne spotted Samir Nasri, another City player who has just come back from injury. De Bruyne slipped the ball to Nasri, who almost instantly passed it between the two remaining Chelsea defenders.And there, making space with his movement as he so often does, was Ag\u00fcero. The dynamic play of De Bruyne, the sharp stiletto pass of Nasri and the cool chip past the goalkeeper unraveled whatever defense Chelsea possessed.\u201cThey outplayed us on 60- to 70-yard counters,\u201d said Guus Hiddink, filling in as Chelsea coach until the Italian Antonio Conte arrives to rebuild the team in July.Ag\u00fcero\u2019s economy defines him as a born striker. The Argentine had four attempts on goal and scored on three of them. In 492 games for his three clubs \u2014 Independiente in Argentina, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Manchester City \u2014 he has scored 257 goals.If Ag\u00fcero stays sharp, De Bruyne stays strong and David Silva is fit, Manchester City will be quite a test for Real Madrid in the Champions League this month.Advertisement"}

Why would HBO lower the curtain on Season 5 of \u201cGirls\u201d with two episodes on Sunday rather than the usual one at a time? Why not give the show\u2019s 10 episodes a full 10 weeks? But there are the mysteries. Then there are the realities.And the presumable reality is that decks needed clearing and hatches needed battening for next weekend\u2019s simultaneous resumption of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d \u2014 and the Saturday unveiling of whatever this ultra-top-secret Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cLemonade\u201d thing is supposed to be.So Sunday\u2019s economy-size \u201cGirls\u201d finale points to the national indifference that\u2019s accrued around a show whose fealty to discomfort, poor choices and social cannibalism, which felt new in 2012, are now just part of television\u2019s oxygen. In the last two seasons, the show\u2019s senses of satire and pathos are stronger and more pungent than everBut it\u2019s true: Funny narcissists are indeed easy to come by (even on HBO). Perhaps instead you\u2019re watching \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cTogetherness\u201d \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst.\u201dAnd \u201cGirls\u201d didn\u2019t invent them. There they were, for instance, on \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201c30 Rock.\u201dBut \u201cGirls\u201d keeps finding ways of dramatizing its satire so that it doesn\u2019t always seem satirical. Few shows better explore the complications of personality and behavior. Even if it doesn\u2019t appear as robust, refined and specific an achievement as, say, \u201cTransparent,\u201d the show still has the confidence to jump along a tightrope of displeasure.The show\u2019s self-obsessives, ringmastered by its chief protagonist, Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham), pinball off one another, going from friends to lovers to frenemies. What set the show apart this year \u2014 from both its previous seasons and most of its peers \u2014 is the use of the space, place, framing, allusion and mood to house that narcissism. Bad manners are met with mannerism. Shoshanna\u2019s first adult job landed her in Tokyo and, for a few episodes, the show went with her. Her intoxication with the culture \u2014 without her Japanese pals losing sight of her foreignness \u2014 felt like a gentle rebuke of the incurious insularity of a movie like \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d She wasn\u2019t a citizen. Nor was she a tourist.This season\u2019s seventh episode was particularly handsome. Written by Sarah Heyward and directed by Richard Shepard, it turned the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese into a piece of immersive theater staged inside and around a stately apartment complex, which was meant to evoke the building near where Genovese was killed, while her neighbors went about their business.The killing inspired decades of social-science research; the show used the case as an ideal test for the characters\u2019 own emotional nearsightedness. (\u201cHello Kitty\u201d is the episode\u2019s title.) Hannah enters the building lobby mid-argument with her current boyfriend, Fran (Jake Lacy), and leaves devastated that her ex, Adam (Adam Driver), might be sleeping with one of her best friends, Jessa (Jemima Kirke).As usual, the comedy comes, in part, from Hannah\u2019s obnoxious rebellion against propriety, which tends to be represented by poor Ray (Alex Karpovsky). His morality, civic engagement, loyalty and earnestness (culturally, he\u2019s a generation older) are constantly disrupted, compromised and exploited by everyone else. This time he just wants to lose himself in some theater and no one will let him.The small silences in this episode are rich and absorptive. They\u2019re too much, though, for Hannah, who keeps breaking them to muse about the artifice of it all. When her friend Marnie (Allison Williams) enters one apartment, newly single and almost radioactively aglow, she doubles the obliviousness. It\u2019s unclear she even knows she\u2019s at a play.They\u2019re there to see Adam perform as half of a squabbling married couple, but by the time the play reaches its grisly climax, none of these people are really paying attention. Adam looked across the courtyard at Jessa, who\u2019s vamping at him on a fire escape, while Hannah watches them both in disbelief. They ignore the screams and barely notice the amateurish plaster statues that stand in for the victim and her killer. There\u2019s just Brenda Lee misting up the soundtrack.Basically, a re-enacted crime loses out to a figurative one. It\u2019s one of the show\u2019s most sophisticated and most intricately filmed gags about selfishness. The camera glides toward windows. It cranes downs at the plaster stand-ins. It oscillates from Jessa to Adam to Hannah. Perhaps you think about \u201cRear Window,\u201d \u201cMonsieur Hire,\u201d \u201cStakeout\u201d or any other movie involving voyeurism, danger and a little melodrama. And the atmosphere is so rich you can practically feel the balm of warm spring air. But Hannah and Marnie peel off to commiserate. And by the time you see these two spread out on somebody\u2019s bed, they\u2019ve cast themselves in their own sitcom: \u201cThe Sorrow and the Self-Pity.\u201dBut the show manages to maintain the gravity of both transgressions: an ambitious if seemingly dumb take on real tragedy and the tragedy that Hannah thinks is her life. It\u2019s a kicky, poignant half-hour of television \u2014 half of which is spent elsewhere at a Manhattan party, featuring Hannah\u2019s roommate, Elijah (Andrew Rannells), who is trying to hold his own among greasy gay celebrities. Each plot warranted its own episode, but that was \u201cGirls\u201d this year: so many good ideas, so little space to unfurl them.There were moments during the series\u2019 underrated fourth season when, between Hannah\u2019s damningly indulgent stint at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and the invention of a carnivorous art-monster named Mimi-Rose (Gillian Jacobs), the show looked as if it had found its groove as a creative-class farce. This fifth season ended on a not-dissimilar note, after Hannah runs into Tally (Jenny Slate), a college classmate, with a dark cloud of hair, who has become a literary star. She\u2019s like Bizzaro Hannah: Her narcissism doesn\u2019t repel success; it vacuums it up.On that show, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson mount a perfectly calibrated celebration of millennial obnoxiousness, while also nailing the ridiculousness of 21st-century consumer culture. The two shows have unruly young women and Brooklyn in common. That\u2019s about it. But the way Ms. Slate is made to look resembles \u2014 passingly, cartoonishly \u2014 Ms. Glazer. These scenes between Ms. Slate and Ms. Dunham suggest a lunatic road not taken. \u201cGirls\u201d has some great slapstick. But it\u2019s bending toward maturity that \u201cBroad City\u201d doesn\u2019t care about.When it started, \u201cGirls\u201d was received as an anthem for entitled white women. Detractors had a field day with Ms. Dunham, who created this show and has written and directed much of it, for privileging privilege, as if she couldn\u2019t be aspiring to the withering heights of Luis Bu\u00f1uel or Carrie Fisher.Through 52 episodes of television \u2014 some of them, like that Kitty Genovese episode, marvelous \u2014 \u201cGirls\u201d has never stopped looking for the grander, harsher psychological picture. It\u2019s never stopped looking for tough laughs. It fights real-life American absurdity with its own version of it, as it does in the final episode of the season, in which Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet, a crayon turning at last into a scalpel) rebrands Ray\u2019s coffee shop as a hipster-free haven for people who actually work \u2014 that is, for \u201cadults,\u201d in other words.But in its highest gear, the show peerlessly vanishes the line between sociocultural satire and mental instability, between send up and crack up.That business with Hannah, Adam and Jessa closes the season with an unnerving cliffhanger. Hannah performs her pain for the storytellers\u2019 radio hour \u201cThe Moth,\u201d which obviously she takes to like a you-know-what to a flame. The night\u2019s theme is jealousy. In her tale, she proves she\u2019s overcome it by delivering a peace offering in the form of a fruit basket. But the story deepens and darkens a deranged argument that took place a few minutes earlier. Suddenly, Hannah\u2019s narcissism seems terroristic. Her personality disorder has the power to disorder other people\u2019s personalities. Maybe, she\u2019s the disorder.One of the last shots hovers about a demolished living room. But it\u2019s not exactly a cliffhanger for the show\u2019s next and final season. It\u2019s a cliff-edged view of the wreckage in the canyon. Plus, there\u2019s something about the way the camera lingers on the basket outside the door that makes Hannah\u2019s offering seem more than a gift. It looks like a bomb.A Critic\u2019s Notebook article on Tuesday about the season finale of the television show \u201cGirls\u201d referred incorrectly to the basket Hannah leaves as a peace offering for Adam and Jessa. It is a fruit basket, not a flower basket. The article also misidentified the bed where Hannah and Tally smoke a joint. It is Hannah\u2019s bed, not Tally\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Bernie Sanders, a Challenge for Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Bernie Sanders, taking his campaign to Upper Manhattan and a crowd of about a thousand, on Saturday took issue with Hillary Clinton over economic justice issues like trade agreements and the minimum wage, and accused her of being \u201cvague\u201d on Social Security benefits.Mr. Sanders began his day with a rally in Washington Heights  at the ornate United Palace, where he challenged Mrs. Clinton  to say whether she would support increasing taxes for Americans making more than $250,000 a year  to increase the amount of money people on Social Security are paid, and to increase the money set aside to pay out Social Security benefits in future years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSecretary Clinton has avoided this issue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you prepared to expand benefits for millions of seniors and disabled veterans who need it? Stop being vague on this issue. Yes or no, are you going to lift the cap?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders also planned to hold rallies in the Bronx and Long Island City before hosting a town-hall-style event at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The senator  told supporters he was looking forward to his coming trip Vatican City, where he is attending a conference hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, a scholarly association in Vatican City. The Sanders campaign announced the trip with some fanfare on Friday, but was quickly caught up in some controversy of how he got invited and whether he was going to meet the pope.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must tell you that I am very fond of the role Pope Francis has been playing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has been out there talking about the need for a moral economy, an economy in which we have the moral responsibility to pay attention to what he calls the dispossessed:  and that is the unemployed, the children who are living in poverty, the elderly who are alone, sometimes hungry, sometimes depressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders then went on to talk about his commitment to fixing economic inequality, raising wages, and expanding social security in America. He  criticized Mrs. Clinton for standing alongside  Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York as he recently signed into law a bill that increased New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum wage to $15 an hour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe still wants a $12 an hour minimum wage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said of Mrs. Clinton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goal if elected president is $15 an hour in 50 states in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (In fact, Mrs. Clinton supports a $12 federal minimum wage, with states free to go higher if they see fit.)The senator also nodded to his squabble with Mrs. Clinton earlier this week over whether he or she were qualified to be president. While, he did not refer specifically to either candidate\u2019s qualifications, he did say he that he had started getting attacked more after he began winning states.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we started this campaign, everyone was very, very nice to me because they thought we were irrelevant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the last 11 months things have changed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later, at Bronx Community College, he spoke about issues that often affect New Yorkers, including the need for affordable housing, strong public schools, immigration reform  and changes in policing. \u201cInner cities from one end of this country to the other are falling apart,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentrification is wiping out neighborhoods.\u201dThe senator said that he was closing the gap nationally with  Mrs. Clinton and that a win in New York could propel him to the White House. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are in striking distance here in  New York,\u201d he said, asking people to turn out in high numbers.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "The Donald and the Veg-O-Matic", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "When you see Veg-O-Matic claims, you should always be suspicious. Sometimes a policy does kill two or more birds with one stone \u2014 there\u2019s a very good case that infrastructure investment under current conditions, with interest rates very low and economies still under capacity, would create jobs now, enhance long-run growth, and even improve fiscal prospects. But conclusions like that shouldn\u2019t be accepted without a lot of hard thinking and self-criticism; you need to bend over backward to avoid falling into wishful thinking.That consideration in itself should have flashed warning signs about, to take one important example, the embrace by Very Serious People of the doctrine of expansionary austerity \u2014 it was all too obvious that the austerians wanted a reason to cut government spending, and they should have been extremely wary of studies purporting to say that doing so would actually create jobs in a depressed economy. The fact that they instead seized on those studies was a very bad sign.In modern America Veg-O-Matic economics has tended to be a right-wing thing, for a couple of reasons. One is that if your party\u2019s central mission is to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted, you need to claim that all kinds of wonderful side effects will take place from what might otherwise look like a combination of greed and cruelty.  Another is that the parties are different; the monolithic GOP has, until just now, been able to get all its followers declaring that we\u2019re at war with Eurasia, or Eastasia, with no awkward challenges from independent-minded wonks. The Democrats are a coalition in which the wonks have a fair bit of autonomy, and at least believe that they have a professional ethos to uphold.That said, the Veg-O-Matic temptation exists for everyone. Yes, we see some of it in the populist uprising within the Democratic party, where anyone questioning the happy talk can be dismissed as a corrupt tool of the corporations. But the big example of Veg-O-Matic reasoning I see right now \u2014 in this case the anti-VOM version \u2014 is coming in what we might call the mainstream critique of Donald Trump.I come here not to praise Trump \u2014 God no \u2014 and would be happy to see his political ambitions buried, with maximum ignominy. He would destroy American civil society; destroy our hopes of containing climate change; destroy U.S. influence by trying to bully everyone in sight. It\u2019s very scary that there\u2019s any chance that he might end up with his (long) finger on the button.But too many anti-Trump critics seem to have settled on one critique that happens not to be right: the claim that a turn to protectionism would cause vast job losses. Sorry, that\u2019s just not a claim justified by either theory or history. Protectionism reduces world exports, but it also reduces world imports, so that the effect on overall demand is a wash; textbook economic models just don\u2019t say what conventional wisdom is asserting here.History doesn\u2019t support this line of attack either. Protection in the 1930s was a result, not a cause, of the depression; the early postwar years, when tariffs were still high and exchange controls were pervasive, were marked by very full employment in many countries. But bad arguments are bad arguments, even if used against a bad guy. And the choice of this argument is telling us something about what\u2019s wrong with a lot of people beyond Trump.

{"Headline": "Can Donald Trump Win Every Delegate in New York?", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceUnless every poll is wildly wrong, Donald Trump is going to win in New York on Tuesday, and he\u2019s going to win big. But exactly how he wins really matters. A few votes here or there could make the difference between a solid or shaky road to the Republican nomination.New York\u2019s 95 delegates would keep Mr. Trump on a narrow path to avoid a contested convention. But New York awards its delegates in a fairly unusual way: proportionally but with a 50 percent winner-take-all trigger for each district and for the pool of statewide delegates. So Mr. Trump would need 50 percent of the vote statewide and in each congressional district to win all of the delegates.To win 50 percent of the vote statewide, he needs to run up the score in the relatively Republican areas where he\u2019s expected to do well: Staten Island, Long Island and upstate New York.But to maximize his delegate haul, he needs convincing wins in every congressional district \u2014 including in some of the most Democratic places in the country. Every pocket of weakness could cost him delegates.If you don\u2019t want to get too far into the details of New York, the easy thing to watch is whether Mr. Trump is winning 50 percent of the vote statewide. If he clears 50 percent, it means he gets all 14 of the statewide delegates; it would probably mean he would also clear 50 percent in many or most of the state\u2019s 27 congressional districts. All things considered, if he went over 50 percent statewide, he would probably win at least 75 delegates.Every recent survey shows Mr. Trump clearing 50 percent of the vote, with many of the most recent surveys even placing him in the mid-50s.He is probably so strong in part because he has been a ubiquitous presence in New York for decades. But the state\u2019s demographics also favor him; he would have a very real shot to get 50 percent of the vote in New York even with no home-state advantage.New York isn\u2019t quite perfect for him \u2014 even his strongest areas have average or above-average educational attainment. But it\u2019s a lot like highly educated Massachusetts, which gave Mr. Trump 49 percent of the vote and has been his best state so far.Mr. Trump fares best in places that look nothing like the old Republican Party. New Yorkers aren\u2019t very religious, they have low marriage rates, and they\u2019re less likely to work in the old resource-based economy. They are far more likely to be Catholic than Republicans nationwide. It\u2019s the sort of place where a Republican from 1950 might look around and think that America needs to be made great again.These strengths make Mr. Trump a favorite to clear 50 percent in congressional districts on Staten Island and Long Island, along with many districts in upstate New York, according to a demographic-based statistical model of Mr. Trump\u2019s support. Over all, our model places Mr. Trump just short of 50 percent statewide; the model may underestimate him a bit because it doesn\u2019t account for a home-state edge.His best district might be New York\u2019s 11th, which includes Staten Island and which has many voters of Italian ancestry. The model estimates he\u2019ll receive 58 percent of the vote there.It might seem strange to focus on something like Italian ancestry, but the number of voters with ancestry from predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Europe (like Italy, Ireland or Spain) is one of the strongest drivers of Mr. Trump\u2019s support. Conversely, a high share of voters with ancestry from Protestant northwest Europe (like England, Germany or the Netherlands) has predicted lack of support. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s support in the area includes two prominent Catholic politicians, Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie.Mr. Trump might fare nearly as well in upstate New York, but here demographics alone suggest Mr. Trump might have a harder time reaching 50 percent.This may be a bit surprising; Mr. Trump has received a lot of high-profile endorsements from upstate New York. One possibility is that his strength there is a little bit of an illusion: Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters may make up a particularly large share of the population (since there are more Republicans upstate), but they might not represent quite as large a share of Republicans as they do in a more Democratic region like Long Island.To really win big, and claim nearly all of New York\u2019s delegates, Mr. Trump won\u2019t just need to clear 50 percent statewide with strong showings in upstate New York and Long Island; he\u2019ll need to fare well closer to Manhattan, where his advantages rapidly fade.His strength starts to tick downward in Westchester County and on the north side of Long Island, where white voters are better educated and where old-money enclaves start to eat into Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest advantages.The disadvantages grow even greater in New York City (outside Staten Island), where white voters are among the best educated in the country.Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest challenges are five well-educated congressional districts near or including Manhattan \u2014 the 9th, 10th, 7th, 12th and 13th Districts.The 12th District\u2019s white voters, which includes the Upper East Side, are the best educated in the country; the 13th, which includes most of Manhattan north of 96th Street (but not Columbia University), ranks fifth. Mr. Trump has tended to struggle in areas like these: He lost the affluent white wards on Chicago\u2019s north side to John Kasich.Indeed, the model estimates that Mr. Trump will lose several of these New York City districts to Mr. Kasich or perhaps Ted Cruz. Whether that happens matters a lot: New York City may not have many Republicans, but it has a lot of congressional districts. If it turns out that Mr. Trump is weak here, it could prevent him from getting much more than 80 delegates, even if he\u2019s easily clearing 50 percent statewide.But Mr. Trump could do better here than one would guess from the area\u2019s demographics. These areas are heavily Democratic \u2014 it\u2019s possible that the Republican voters in these areas are nothing like the overall population of white adults (the model uses census data for non-Hispanic whites, since Republican voters are overwhelmingly white).For example, the large number of Republican Orthodox Jews in the otherwise heavily Democratic 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th Districts could easily vote very differently than one would guess from statistics on the broader population.A different version of the same analytical challenge occurs in places where nonwhite voters represent a large share or even a majority of Republican voters.The model, relying on data from white voters (who will still represent the majority of Republican voters in most of these districts), makes Mr. Trump a clear favorite in all of the districts where nonwhite voters represent a majority of adult citizens, except for New York\u2019s 12th District \u2014 which includes the Upper East Side.There\u2019s reason to think Mr. Trump really is a favorite in these nonwhite areas. He carried all of the majority Hispanic wards in Chicago, including those with the smallest number of non-Hispanic whites.He could likewise win the overwhelmingly nonwhite districts of New York. If so, just a handful of voters in some of the most heavily Democratic areas of the country could swing several delegates.The result is an overall picture that\u2019s quite uncertain, even as Mr. Trump is all but assured to win easily. In the worst case for him, he wins something like 48 or 49 percent of the vote (with strength in places like Long Island and Staten Island, but without clearing 50 percent in parts of upstate New York and with weakness in many New York City districts.) He would receive as few as 60 or so delegates.Even if he clears 50 percent over all, a few pockets of weakness in heavily Democratic, well-educated or diverse stretches of New York City could cost him 15 delegates. There\u2019s very little way to know whether he\u2019ll win these delegates based on the polls because so few of the state\u2019s Republican voters live in these areas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Largely Forgotten and Hugely Influential: The Race for Marco Rubio\u2019s Senate Seat", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byMIAMI \u2014 Representative Patrick Murphy, a two-term Democrat now running for United States Senate, looked exultant, maybe even a bit star-struck, as he greeted patrons and posed for selfies with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at Jackson Soul Food Restaurant in the city\u2019s Overtown neighborhood.\u201cVote Murphy!\u201d Mr. Biden shouted to the adoring crowd, which for the most part had neither seen nor heard of the young congressman until that moment last Monday.Florida is again likely to play a crucial role in who wins the White House this year, but the wild, wide-open and largely forgotten race to replace Senator Marco Rubio could also determine which party controls the Senate, which in turn could decide the ideological balance of the Supreme Court.In an election cycle when political outsiders are holding outsize appeal for voters, Florida is posing an important test of the power of the party establishment for Democrats. With the future of all three branches of government in the balance, the White House has weighed in heavily, and remarkably early, in favor of Mr. Murphy in his primary fight against Representative Alan Grayson, who has cultivated a reputation as a liberal firebrand with a willingness to buck party leaders.In Miami, Mr. Biden did not mention Mr. Grayson, but the contrast he sought to draw was inescapable. \u201cThis guy is the real deal,\u201d the vice president said of Mr. Murphy. \u201cHe understands the difference between being authentic and being caustic. He understands the difference between being straight and just being vicious.\u201dBut even with the backing of the White House, Mr. Murphy is in no way assured of victory in the Aug. 30 primary.When it came to Mr. Murphy, the report showed a photograph not of the youthful Florida congressman but of another Patrick Murphy, the former Democratic representative from Pennsylvania, who is now serving as acting secretary of the Army.And on the campaign trail, Mr. Grayson, a lifelong Democrat who at 58 is a quarter-century older than Mr. Murphy, seems far more sure-footed, gleefully skewering Republicans, ridiculing the Washington establishment as beholden to special interests, and passionately making the case of his priorities.But he has bucked his party\u2019s establishment by endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president over Hillary Clinton.Mr. Murphy, who switched his party affiliation to Democrat from Republican before his first campaign for Congress in 2012, stresses that his own family includes Democrats, Republicans and independents. He talks generally about his concerns about the environment, the economy and education; points to his efforts in Congress to reach across the aisle, particularly on the bipartisan SAVE legislation, a series of bills to cut government spending; and stresses his commitment to running a positive campaign.\u201cThe No. 1 thing holding this country back right now is the partisanship,\u201d he said at the restaurant with Mr. Biden. \u201cThe dirty campaigns, the name-calling, the finger-pointing, people are tired of it,\u201d adding, \u201cI am going to have a positive message about what we are going to do to change their life and help them out.\u201dStill, there are lingering pains of the recession. More than 17 percent of home-mortgage holders still owe more than their homes are worth \u2014 second only to Nevada, underscoring the continuing economic insecurity expressed by voters here and throughout the country.In the Senate race, the Republican field is perhaps even more unsettled, and includes some of the dynamics of the presidential contest. It includes two members of Congress, Representatives David Jolly and Ron DeSantis; the lieutenant governor, Carlos Lopez-Cantera; and two wealthy businessmen, Carlos Beruff and Todd Wilcox.Mr. DeSantis, for instance, is a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, and like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has advocated shutting down the government. Mr. Jolly, who worked as general counsel to his predecessor, Bill Young, is viewed as more of an establishment, conservative insider, while the businessmen are hoping to capitalize on the nationwide Republican backlash against traditional politicians.Republican insiders said they recognized that the stakes could not be bigger and that they would be particularly glad to run against Mr. Grayson, though they expressed confidence of victory either way.\u201cFlorida will decide who the next president will be and will decide the balance of the U.S. Senate,\u201d said Joe Gruters, the Republican Party chairman in Sarasota, who is also leading Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in Florida. \u201cThe two races, no question, are very tied together.\u201dSuch calculations certainly help explain why the White House and the national Democratic establishment have taken the unusual step of intervening. A report by the House ethics committee on Mr. Grayson\u2019s investment activities is due out this week and could deal a further setback to his campaign.The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, has called on Mr. Grayson to exit the Senate race, saying his actions \u201cdisgrace the halls of Congress.\u201dMr. Grayson, however, has denied any wrongdoing and has used the criticism to portray himself as an underdog. Asked about Mr. Reid\u2019s comments at the College Democrats event, he shot back, \u201cHarry Reid is a liar. Harry Reid is a hatchet man.\u201dMr. Murphy, more temperate by comparison, acknowledges that the White House interest is bigger than his own candidacy. \u201cMy campaign was recently endorsed by the president and the vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it has anything to do with me,\u201d he added. \u201cFrankly, I think it has more to do with the importance of the state of Florida.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Brazil in Turmoil, Rio Counts Down to Olympics", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byWith less than 100 days before the Olympic Games come to South America for the first time, Rio de Janeiro faces more than the usual challenges that bedevil host cities, like delayed stadium construction and transportation concerns. (Rio has those, too.)The mood here, however, is hardly one of panic. Officials in charge of executing the Summer Games say they feel insulated from Brazil\u2019s turmoil at this late stage. The Olympics, after all, tend to exist in their own bubble, elaborately coordinated to ensure that the multibillion-dollar operation goes off smoothly.\u201cThe machine is in place, and it\u2019s relatively stable,\u201d Ricardo Leyser, Brazil\u2019s sports minister, said in an interview this week. \u201cMy biggest concern isn\u2019t any individual issue. It\u2019s the small demands that all come at once.\u201dLocal organizers are beginning to lay colorful comforters \u2014 patterned with the silhouettes of cartoon cyclists, fencers and swimmers \u2014 on the twin beds in the athletes\u2019 village. They are monitoring the growth of 14-month-old grass that will be transplanted to Maracan\u00e3, the storied soccer stadium that will also be used for the opening and closing ceremonies. They are pulling trash from Guanabara Bay, where the Games\u2019 sailing events will be held; mopping up standing water to minimize mosquito breeding; and ramping up a round-the-clock security operation \u2014 all while publicly expressing little worry about the unrest encircling them.On Wednesday, with the handoff of the Olympic flame in Greece and the start of a journey that in little more than a week will bring it to Brazil, the official countdown to the Aug. 5 opening ceremony began.In Rio, the race to be ready is intensifying, with construction workers here still laboring on mass transit projects that were key promises seven years ago in the city\u2019s bid to host the Games. Costing several billion dollars, those projects include a new subway line and express bus lanes that connect the Olympic Park in Barra da Tijuca to the rest of the city, which is expected to swell with more than half a million visitors.As the value of the Brazilian real has drastically declined over the last year, some have expressed doubt that the transit projects will materialize beyond the sleek, modernist weather shelters that have been built at various stations. At a news conference Wednesday, the city\u2019s secretary of transportation said the new routes would be ready in time but did not specify when.To the vast majority of people watching the Games on television, however, such infrastructure may not matter.The permanent venues for competitions here are mostly complete \u2014 all but those for tennis and track cycling \u2014 and athletes from around the world have competed in dozens of test events in Rio in recent months. \u201cIt\u2019s about the filling of the cake,\u201d Mr. Leyser said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the stadiums; it\u2019s about the scoreboards.\u201dAs of the latest counts, 62 percent of the 5.7 million tickets on the market had been sold \u2014 roughly half of the total tickets for the Olympics \u2014 and 24 percent of tickets available for the Paralympics had been sold. But compared with past Olympics, the buyers of those tickets may be disproportionately international, said Andrew Parsons, the president of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee.\u201cIt\u2019s more an administrative issue than a corruption scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a question of the numbers.\u201dMr. Leyser called the devaluation of Brazil\u2019s currency an opportunity because it increases the buying power of foreign money coming into Brazil for the Games.But not everyone sees the event as a boon to the country. Shirlei Alves, who lives in the Santa Marta favela of Rio, criticized the government for spending on the Olympics in the face of Brazil\u2019s problems.\u201cThe world is just getting worse here,\u201d Ms. Alves said, noting that she was without medication and electricity. \u201cThe government is making a mistake. I\u2019d like if they\u2019d take a better look at the poor people and not help people who are already rich.\u201dEduardo Paes, the mayor of Rio, said Wednesday that the city had a \u201ccomfortable financial situation\u201d and had spent on stadium construction 1 percent of what it spent on health education.\u201cI know people are skeptical,\u201d Mr. Paes said, citing the \u201chuge deliverables\u201d for the Olympics. \u201cOf course the situation here has been difficult. But there is a commitment of the Brazilian state to deliver the Olympics.\u201d\u201cThe Olympics is a pretty effective way of taking whatever disease is local and making it global,\u201d said Ashish K. Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard.Some scientists have suggested that by the time the Olympics start in August \u2014 wintertime in Brazil, when mosquitoes are less numerous \u2014 the virus might be more prevalent in the southern United States.\u201cZika\u2019s been spreading effectively on its own, but there\u2019s very good reason to think the Olympics will accelerate the spread,\u201d Dr. Jha said.But the virus poses a unique problem because it is so far beyond the control of local organizing officials, and so many questions about it remain unanswered. Few athletes have publicly expressed concern, but it is unclear how many might withdraw as the Games draw closer.\u201cAt this point you just keep going,\u201d David Wallechinsky, an Olympics historian, said. \u201cYou have to continue as if everything\u2019s going to be fine. These are real concerns \u2014 Zika, the water quality. But even if Dilma is forced out of office, it\u2019s not going to stop the Olympics.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taiwan Accuses Kenya of Illegal Deportations as More Are Sent to China", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Usually prisoners want to get out of jail. But on Tuesday, a group of Taiwanese citizens did all they could to stay in \u2014 barricading themselves in a small cell as Kenyan police officers tried to storm in with assault rifles.The officers succeeded, however, in dragging the prisoners out \u2014 Taiwanese officials say after using tear gas, which Kenyan officials deny \u2014 and put them on a plane not for home, but for mainland China.The episode outraged Taiwanese officials, who accused Kenya of violating international law and trying to curry favor with China, which views the self-governed island as part of its territory.This would not be the first time an African nation did something contentious to please China, the new heavyweight on the continent. Zambia, South Africa and others have bent over backward \u2014 often provoking the ire of their own people \u2014 to keep China happy.Analysts say that for authoritarian governments, which is the case for many in Africa, Chinese support is like a dream. China drops billions of dollars on splashy infrastructure projects all across Africa without pressuring governments to improve democracy or human rights, like Western nations often do.In recent years, Chinese workers and Chinese money have transformed Kenya, building thundering new highways, bridges, malls, a flagship airport and a railroad; the Chinese are even helping on secretive national security matters, like installing electronic eavesdropping equipment for the Kenyans.According to Taiwanese officials, Chinese pressure explains why the Kenyan government deported several dozen Taiwanese nationals to mainland China in recent days, even though Taiwan considers itself politically separate from mainland China.The Taiwan and Kenya governments had conflicting information on how many Taiwanese were deported and when. Taiwan officials in Taipei said eight Taiwanese had been flown from Kenya to China on Friday and 37 on Tuesday.Mwenda Njoka, the spokesman for Kenya\u2019s Interior Ministry, said eight Taiwanese had been deported on Monday and 16 on Tuesday. There were unconfirmed reports that one of the deported Taiwanese had American citizenship. Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said he was aware of the reports but could not comment further.Even though many of the suspects were recently acquitted, all had violated Kenya\u2019s visa policies, the Kenyan authorities said. Mr. Njoka insisted that they were deported, along with 12 Chinese suspects, to mainland China simply because the Kenyan policy is to return people to the country they flew from, and that all the Taiwanese had traveled to Kenya from China.Kenya does not have direct flights to Taiwan, though there are daily flights to Guangzhou, China, and regular flights to Hong Kong. \u201cThe Taiwanese are trying to draw us into a dispute with China,\u201d Mr. Njoka said. \u201cIt\u2019s their dispute, not ours.\u201dThis case has kicked up quite a ruckus in Taiwan and China. Zhang Zhijun, the director of the Chinese government\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, indicated that the Taiwanese are being held on suspicion of of telephone and Internet fraud that targeted Chinese people.While Chinese authorities promised the deportees would be able to receive visits from family and Taiwanese officials, they face less likelihood of due process in China than in Taiwan.Last May, a court in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang held trials of two defendants accused of taking part in a phone-fraud scheme based in Kenya that had been orchestrated by Taiwanese ringleaders using mainland Chinese recruits, a Chinese newspaper reported at the time. It is unclear whether that case was related to the suspects sent to China.Antonio C. S. Chen, the official in charge of West Asian and Africa at Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanded that China return the Taiwanese who had been deported.China often intervenes to block international recognition of Taiwan. But such acts generally involve vetoing Taiwan\u2019s participation in bodies like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Rarely has it meant laying claim to Taiwan passport holders overseas.A spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs thanked Kenya during a regularly scheduled news conference on Tuesday.\u201cMaintaining the One-China principle is an important prerequisite and a necessary basis for all countries in the world in developing relations with China,\u201d the spokesman, Lu Kang, said. \u201cWe highly appreciate the Kenyan government\u2019s long-term commitment to the One-China principle.\u201dThere is a symbiotic relationship between African governments and China, in which China secures good relations with countries that produce minerals or other natural resources necessary to keep China\u2019s manufacturing-based economy going. In return, the African nations get favorable infrastructure deals with few strings attached.Though Kenya does not have huge amounts of natural resources like South Africa or Zambia, two of China\u2019s key allies on the continent, it is strategically important because it has the largest economy in East Africa. Kenya does not maintain official relations with Taiwan and considers the island part of China, in line with Beijing\u2019s position.While her predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, pushed for closer economic relations with China, Ms. Tsai advocates a more cautious approach to cross-strait ties.Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, which handles cross-strait relations, said its head, Andrew Hsia, had contacted his Chinese counterpart, Mr. Zhang, through a hotline on Tuesday to express concerns about the deportations.Mr. Hsia said in a statement that the handling of the cases was not in accordance with previous cross-strait understandings and that it \u201cseriously harmed our people\u2019s rights.\u201d\u201cToday the mainland side is again forcibly taking 37 of our people to the mainland, disregarding our previous call to return the eight people who have already been sent to the mainland and the 15 who were in Kenya,\u201d Mr. Hsia said.Mr. Hsia added, \u201cThis seriously harms the cross-strait mutual trust built up over the past eight years.\u201dJeffrey Gettleman reported from Nairobi, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "MetLife and the Threat to Dodd-Frank", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe decision is a blow to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, established by the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law. The council\u2019s job is to identify and defuse systemic risks to the economy from nonbank financial firms, including insurance companies and finance companies. The absence of such oversight let Lehman Brothers, American International Group and GE Capital run amok before the financial crisis of 2008, among other disastrous and interlocking developments.Congress put senior officials on the council and gave them a powerful weapon. Its 10 voting members include the secretary of the Treasury, the head of the Federal Reserve and top financial regulators. The weapon is their authority to designate big and complex financial firms as \u201csystemically important\u201d \u2014 in other words, too big to fail. The label subjects a firm to heightened regulatory standards and higher capital requirements.MetLife argued in court that the council used flawed and inadequate analyses in 2014 when it deemed the insurer to be systemically important. The court agreed with MetLife and removed the label. The judge\u2019s full opinion is under seal and is likely to be released only in redacted form, a move intended, in part, to protect MetLife\u2019s privacy. That is unacceptable. Why would MetLife\u2019s privacy concerns outweigh the public\u2019s right to know?One baffling aspect of the ruling is that other nonbanks labeled systemically important by the council \u2014 A.I.G., GE Capital and Prudential Financial \u2014 did not challenge their designations. A.I.G. and GE Capital have undertaken reforms to shrink themselves to less threatening proportions.MetLife is also moving ahead with similar reforms, despite having fought to shed the too-big-to-fail label. This suggests that the lawsuit was intended not to avoid downsizing but to weaken the council.As has happened at the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies that have lost court battles over their regulatory authority, the case could have a chilling effect on the council\u2019s exercise of its power and consume valuable time and resources if it decides to appeal. All of which could undermine the panel\u2019s ability to spot and tame systemic risks before they explode.The Dodd-Frank reforms need defending and strengthening, not weakening. The law is the main bulwark against renewed recklessness in the financial system. It is working, if slowly, to reduce risks of another crisis, and it is under attack. It needs champions in high places.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cheating Politicians of Iceland", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFor days now, thousands of protesters have filled the square outside the Parliament, calling for resignations and elections, hurling eggs at the building and, for a bit of Icelandic flair, the occasional salmon fillet.There\u2019s no evidence that the prime minister\u2019s family\u2019s offshore investment (like those held by our finance minister, internal affairs minister and others) included stolen funds, or anything illegal like that. That\u2019s not why people are angry. They\u2019re angry because we thought we had put news like this behind us. It has been only eight years since the economy collapsed and the country was nearly bankrupted. We were then forced to face uncomfortable truths about officials\u2019 involvement in the failed banking sector, as well as about inattentive government watchdogs. Iceland may have been considered a nanny state, but the nanny was dipping into the sherry bottle hidden in the pantry.Trust in government has been rebuilt, slowly and painstakingly, in the years since. And now we find out that our new leaders have been sneakily shipping their money from our small island to another small island, halfway around the world, most likely to save a little on their taxes. For an ordinary citizen that might look like bad form; for a politician it looks like corruption. It ridicules the fundamental Icelandic expectation that all people are equal.It is usually easier to solve problems in small nations like ours than in large and complex societies. That is not the case, however, when facing the corruption of an entitled elite. In the United States, you talk about six degrees of separation between people. Here in Iceland, with our minuscule population, it\u2019s more like one degree. Within a few minutes of meeting someone you will find a common relative, friend, colleague, enemy or former flame. That makes it hard to escape nepotism and crony capitalism.This is one of the reasons the financial crisis got so bad: Many executives of financial institutions had political, social or family ties to government officials and others who were responsible for keeping them in check. To make matters worse, some of those people monitoring the banks had been hired based on connections instead of competence. Many politicians had accepted huge campaign contributions from the banks. And so on. Of course, the main blame lies with the bank managers, but an investigation into the collapse showed an inclination in all levels of government to overlook the negligence or deceptive accounting that was rampant.We thought we were done with this, rid of the old politics. But the same old networks are still in place. The same old people are sharing the same shady tax lawyers and investing advice. Those who set the rules still aren\u2019t able to follow them.Icelanders yearn for the change we were promised. We want to move on. References to the 2008 crash are no longer heard daily, only weekly. People have stopped discussing the fallen banks and have begun to share again their opinions on the European Union. (Which, incidentally, we applied to join soon after the crash, then changed our mind and sent a letter saying we no longer wanted in, to which the union replied that it did not care, it intended to continue the negotiations, with or without us. We have not heard how that is working out.)At present we have an interim prime minister, who appeared a bit lost and underdressed for the occasion when he was introduced to the public on Wednesday. He does not seem to own a tie. But neither does he hold an offshore account. Nor an Ashley Madison account. That\u2019s something, I guess.Yrsa Sigurdardottir is the author of the Thora Gudmundsdottir crime series and the novel \u201cI Remember You.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Start-Stop Technology Is Spreading (Like It or Not)", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byWheelsDr. Keith Tao, a radiologist in Danville, Calif., owns three late-model Mercedeses, each equipped with a fuel-saving technology called start-stop.The system saves fuel and reduces emissions by cutting the engine when the car comes to a full stop and restarting when the foot is taken off the brake.One of the first things Dr. Tao does after starting the engine: He turns off the feature.The problem, Dr. Tao says, is that the stopping and restarting is rather intrusive. \u201cYou actually feel it restarting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terrible stop-and-go traffic this thing comes on and off constantly. In 20 minutes you can have 50 stop-and-start cycles. It can drive you totally insane.\u201dMercedes defends its technology, known as ECO Start/Stop, calling it \u201cone of the most seamless systems,\u201d according to Christian Bokich, a company spokesman. \u201cCustomers with any concerns always have the option of defeating the system each time they enter and start the vehicle.\u201dWhile start-stop technology may make some people crazy, the technology is here to stay.That\u2019s because manufacturers are under intense pressure to meet strict fuel economy standards by 2025 and they are using ever more creative ways to wring out every last bit of fuel efficiency from conventional gasoline and diesel engines.Other approaches include increasing transmissions from six speeds to nine or 10; using electric rather than mechanical power steering systems; decreasing tire rolling resistance; and directly injecting fuel at high pressure into the cylinders.The fuel savings with start-stop can add up. Under average driving conditions, savings are 3 percent to 5 percent. But with a lot of stops and traffic lights that stay red for extended periods, that can rise to 10 percent, said Robert Fascetti, vice president for powertrains at Ford.\u201cStart-stop clearly helps use less gas,\u201d Mr. Fascetti said. \u201cThere\u2019s no debate. You save fuel when the engine is off.\u201dDr. Tao said he had not experienced that level of savings; he estimates the cut in fuel use to be about one mile per gallon.Regardless, start-stop is destined to be on the majority of cars in the next few years. Ford now has it as a standard feature on its Escape and Focus vehicles, and on some engines in its top-selling F-150 pickup trucks. Eventually, 70 percent of Ford\u2019s models will offer it, Mr. Fascetti said.By the 2018 model year, all Buicks will come equipped with the technology. Currently Buick\u2019s Encore and Envision offer it. In addition, it is available on several models from Cadillac and Chevrolet, including the ATS, Cruze, Impala and Malibu.At Fiat Chrysler, the Pacifica offers the technology, and \u201cthe majority of our vehicles will have it over time,\u201d said Mike Duhaime, a Fiat Chrysler powertrain director.Still, not many Americans have yet experienced the technology. And despite its environmental and fuel-saving benefits, many who do have it, like Dr. Tao, don\u2019t like it.\u201cOur primary research says almost to a person, people say they turn off their stop-start systems,\u201d said Tim Barnes, a director of product planning for Mazda in the United States.That\u2019s one of the reasons that Mazda has no plans to introduce the technology in the United States, even though Mazda has been offering it in Japan since 2010.For the technology to work for consumers, the experience needs to be seamless, manufacturers say.\u201cRestarts must be fast, smooth, with no noise and little vibration,\u201d said Ulrich Muehleisen, head of marketing and product development for Robert Bosch, a company that has sold 15 million start-stop units in Europe since 2007.Most manufacturers use similar technologies to create and manage their own systems. Heavy-duty batteries provide the juice necessary for 10 times the number of starts of standard vehicles. Rugged starter motors last longer. Engine mounts are designed to be placed to minimize vibration.Regardless of technique, vehicles with the technology are meant to start instantaneously.\u201cTake your foot off the brake and the car will start by the time you hit the accelerator,\u201d Mr. Muehleisen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a couple of a hundred milliseconds,\u201d compared to the several seconds it typically takes to start a vehicle using a key.Engines in the vehicles with the systems will not always stop when the vehicle does. A sophisticated set of sensors monitors the engine and cabin temperatures. If the air-conditioning needs to run continually to cool the interior, the engine will restart or stay on. In stop-and-go freeway traffic, the engine will most likely remain running to avoid repetitious, annoying restarts. And if the battery is getting close to the end of its life, the vehicle\u2019s engine will not shut off, no matter how perfect the other road conditions are.In addition to customer resistance, the technology faces other obstacles to consumer acceptance.A vehicle\u2019s official mileage estimates as seen in a new car\u2019s window sticker reflect the existence of a start-stop system. But in calculating those numbers, the Environmental Protection Agency assumes that half the people who have the technology disable it, reducing the sticker appeal to fuel-economy-minded car buyers.And typical fuel savings also won\u2019t save a consumer that much money. With today\u2019s gas prices, a 5 percent savings in fuel may amount to around $40 a year, or about 80 cents a week.But minor cost savings and consumer disinterest are not dissuading manufacturers from introducing the technology.\u201cAt some point, virtually every vehicle will have stop-start,\u201d Mr. Muehleisen of Bosch said. \u201cOnce you get used to it, you\u2019ll wonder why the engine is running when you\u2019re stopped. It\u2019s like brushing your teeth with the water on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Met Secretly With Interest Groups", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Donald J. Trump\u2019s private meeting in Washington on Thursday featured nearly a dozen industry leaders, including a veteran lobbyist and the chief executive of a major airline trade organization, attendees confirmed. Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting, like others he held that day, was at the hotel he is building in the gutted body of the Old Post Office, and was kept secret, with attendees invited by phone. Nicholas E. Calio, a former lobbyist who worked on legislative affairs for President George Bush, was in attendance. Mr. Calio is now the president and chief executive of Airlines for America, a large trade group. There was also Juanita Duggan, the president and chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business, another major trade group. She is a former aide who served in the first Bush and Reagan administrations, and she was once an official with the tobacco giant Philip Morris Companies. An aide to Ms. Duggan confirmed her attendance, but said that she was respecting a request not to discuss what took place. Penny Kozakos, an aide to Mr. Calio, said in an email that \u201cMr. Calio regularly meets with leaders of industry, members of Congress, other elected officials, including those seeking office, about the airline industry and its importance to the economy and jobs.\u201d  Yet Mr. Trump routinely makes \u201cspecial interests\u201d and lobbyists a focus of derision in his stump speeches, making the meeting something of a surprise. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said that the candidate\u2019s adviser, Senator Jeff Sessions, had arranged a meeting with people for whom he has \u201cgreat respect.\u201d \u201cMr. Trump didn\u2019t know them, but it was a brief meeting that took place right after the lengthy foreign policy team meeting,\u201d Ms. Hicks said in an email. In a town-hall-style forum hosted by Greta Van Susteren of Fox News on Sunday night, Mr. Trump was asked about a potential merger of airlines, asking what his antitrust division might look like as president. \u201cI\u2019d look at it very carefully,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d look at a lot of that. You know, and that might be not the Republican thing to say. But if we don\u2019t have competition and keep some competition, we\u2019re going to have a lot of problems in the country.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd I see mergers of different things. I won\u2019t say it because what do I need certain industries against me for? But the fact is that you\u2019ve got to have competition to be great. And when you see these big fat mergers and the companies get bigger, they get bloated and they don\u2019t do well.\u201d \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Antismoking Coalition Gives Big Tobacco a Fight in Indonesia", "Date": "2016-04-30", "News": "Supported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The densely packed houses along Yogyakarta\u2019s Kali Code River went from drab to a riot of reds, blues, yellows and whites.It turns out the village\u2019s benefactor was Philip Morris International and its \u201cShow Your Colors\u201d advertising campaign. On the side of the Gondolayu bridge that overlooks the settlements sits a giant picture frame, with tag lines hung above it reading, \u201cCreate your own story\u201d and \u201cGo ahead.\u201dThe village had been transformed into a giant advertisement for a brand owned by the tobacco company.Yet that push has been met by an increasingly potent coalition of mayors, health officials and antismoking groups that has scored some important victories.The Bloomberg Initiative has designated Indonesia one of its five priority countries, and has donated more than $10 million since 2007. The initiative is largely focused on establishing local and regional tobacco control laws in a nation with a highly decentralized government structure.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle \u2014 like a war,\u201d Yayi Prabandari, a professor of public health at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, said of the clash between tobacco companies and tobacco control organizations.The Bloomberg Initiative has also created a backlash from smokers\u2019 rights groups, who portray Mr. Bloomberg as a foreign oligarch determined to stamp out Indonesia\u2019s proud tobacco tradition.\u201cPeople who smoke today are stigmatized \u2014 we\u2019re discriminated against,\u201d said Alfa Gumilang, the chain-smoking secretary general of Komunitas Kretek, a smokers\u2019 rights group that accepts funds from the tobacco industry.The Indonesian government relies on the tobacco industry for around 10 percent of state tax revenue. Although tobacco is not nationalized, the government issues growth targets; in 2015, the Industry Ministry released a \u201croad map\u201d for the industry calling for expanded cigarette production.Philip Morris\u2019s success \u2014 it controls 35 percent of Indonesia\u2019s tobacco market through its local subsidiary, Sampoerna \u2014 ushered in a new age of foreign expansion. In 2009, British American Tobacco purchased Bentoel, a local tobacco company that is now Indonesia\u2019s fourth largest, with around 7.5 percent market share.According to Health Ministry officials, Indonesia\u2019s fragmented government ministries often work at cross purposes when tackling the issue.Because of the difficulty of making sweeping changes to tobacco control laws nationally, Indonesia tobacco control advocates are increasingly pushing for changes at the local and regional levels, where money from the Bloomberg Initiative comes in handy.Dr. Theresia Sandra, a specialist in chronic lung disease at the Health Ministry, credits the Bloomberg Initiative with helping local governments counter the influence of big tobacco. The group \u201cbuilds organizations to balance against the strength of industry and opens local governments to the necessity of protecting their communities,\u201d Dr. Sandra said.In one national success, the Indonesian government, with help from the Bloomberg Initiative, passed a law in 2014 requiring manufacturers to put warning labels on cigarette packaging.The tobacco fight in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation, even extends to the country\u2019s most powerful Muslim organizations, and shows just how central the issue is for society and the economy.Muhammadiyah, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest Muslim organization, became the first major Muslim group in the country to issue an edict declaring that smoking is forbidden in all circumstances, citing smoking\u2019s devastating consequences to public health.The 2010 decision was significant: Muhammadiyah operates thousands of schools, universities and hospitals around the country. Almost overnight, those places became smoke-free zones.But the Indonesian media quickly pounced on a funding detail. Posted on the Bloomberg Initiative\u2019s website was a $393,000 grant to Muhammadiyah in 2009. According to Bloomberg\u2019s website at the time, the grant sought \u201cthe issuance and dissemination of religious advice on the dangers of tobacco use among Muhammadiyah/Islamic institutions.\u201dCritics accused Muhammadiyah of seeking to unite Muslim opinion against tobacco in return for the grant money.Dr. Sudibyo Markus, who led Muhammadiyah\u2019s health department at the time, said there had never been any quid pro quo.Meanwhile, religious leaders affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama, Muhammadiyah\u2019s main rival, criticized Muhammadiyah for supposedly bowing to Bloomberg\u2019s money. But Nahdlatul Ulama, which does not view smoking as forbidden in most circumstances, receives funding from the foundation wing of Djarum, Indonesia\u2019s third-largest tobacco company.The group\u2019s vice chairman, Maksum Mahfudh, said there was \u201cno relationship whatsoever\u201d between the funding and its decision that it would not forbid smoking. He added that moving \u201cdrastically\u201d against tobacco would impoverish the farmers and sellers who are \u201cgrass-roots people of N.U.\u201dFor now, the two sides appear to have fought to a draw. After steadily rising for a decade, the smoking rate has plateaued, according to the Indonesian Family Life Survey, funded by the United States National Institutes of Health, that was released in April.\u201cWe remain optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market thanks to its growing adult population and rising income levels,\u201d he told them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Doha, Major Oil Exporters Fail to Agree on Production Freeze", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Officials from 18 oil-producing nations failed on Sunday to reach a deal to freeze oil production at current levels.A sharp fall in oil prices could also feed into equity prices, which have recently tended to rise and fall along with oil prices.Oil fell sharply in early trading on Monday in Asia, at one point dropping nearly 6 percent to fall below $38 a barrel. Asian stock markets were mixed. Japanese shares were down nearly 3 percent in morning trading, but stocks across the rest of Asia saw more modest declines. Markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong opened around 1 percent lower.\u201cThere will be a lot of people who they have disappointed,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, chief executive of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, a British firm that advises hedge funds and other businesses on the oil markets. The oil exporters, he said, \u201craised expectations.\u201dA major stumbling block in the talks appears to have been pressure from Saudi Arabia for Iran to participate in the freeze, a measure to address the current global oversupply of oil. The Iranians, who are rapidly increasing production after the end of most sanctions over their nuclear program, have refused to cap production at current low levels.The oil producers seemed to head into the meeting full of confidence that a deal to stabilize oil markets could be reached. In fact, a draft agreement calling for a freeze at January levels through October was circulated Saturday.Talk of a potential freeze had already helped lift the oil markets from their January lows below $30 per barrel to about $43 per barrel for Brent crude. \u201cI think at least the discussion and expectations around the Doha meeting have contributed to higher prices,\u201d Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, said in an interview before the meeting.A deal was unlikely to quickly change the amount of oil on the market because most participants in the freeze were pumping at high levels. And the failure is unlikely to have much of an impact on supply and demand balances.What might limit the reaction is a strike on Sunday by Kuwaiti oil workers. That has cut into the country\u2019s oil production by what appears to be a substantial amount. \u201cYou would expect the market to sell off but the downside might be limited, \u201c said Mr. Farren-Price, who was observing the Doha meeting.Analysts on Sunday also raised the question of how Saudi Arabia and the other countries could have scheduled the meeting if they knew it was doomed to failure. After all, the idea was to calm the markets, not roil them.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cThis implies really poor communication by the lead members of the group,\u201d particularly Saudi Arabia and Russia, said Richard Mallinson, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm. \u201cWhy even schedule this meeting if you did not have a compromise agreed over Iran.\u201dSaudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed in principle on a freeze at a meeting in February, but made it contingent on participation by other major producers. The idea of a freeze gained favor because it would involve little or no sacrifice for anyone.Analysts and some OPEC officials thought that a way could be found to accommodate Iran\u2019s desire to make up ground lost under sanctions.Either they misread the Saudis or the kingdom\u2019s leadership hardened its position. Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals in the Middle East, clashing over Yemen and Syria. The competition increasingly extends to oil, where a resurgent Iran is vying with the Saudis for market share among customers in Asia and Europe.In the days before this meeting, a mixed message emerged from Saudi Arabia. Its oil officials, led by Ali al-Naimi, an 80-year-old veteran oil minister, evidently sought accommodation with other big producers, including Iran, while, the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who has become the kingdom\u2019s chief policy maker, indicated that Saudi Arabia might not go along with a freeze if Iran did not also comply.\u201cIf all major producers don\u2019t freeze production, we will not freeze production,\u201d Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News recently.The deal was scuppered by Saudi Arabia\u2019s insistence that language requiring that all OPEC members participate in the freeze be inserted in the draft. There was little question that Iran, which was not represented at the meeting, would agree. After lengthy negotiations among Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar, which convened the meeting, the talks broke up on Sunday.Saudi tactics on the freeze appear to be a part of a shift in the kingdom\u2019s oil policy, analysts say.The Saudis, analysts say, increasingly seem to accept that they can no longer control oil prices through OPEC, in part because the huge increases in supply from the United States in recent years have undercut OPEC\u2019s leverage.\u201cThis is the new world of oil,\u201d said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets and scenarios research at IHS, who was also observing the meeting. \u201cThe oil market is a reflection of the world. Power is more decentralized.\u201dThe Saudis are shifting instead toward producing whatever oil they need to supply their growing network of domestic refineries and petrochemical plants and their expanding body of overseas customers.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.Prince Mohammed, who has authority over the Saudi oil industry, warned that the kingdom could increase production by a million barrels per day in the coming months if it chose.With low production costs, estimated at $3.50 to $5 per barrel, Saudi Arabia can compete on price with any producer. So can Russia, which can produce oil for about $4 per barrel, according to IHS. While Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are feeling the pinch of lower revenues, they are in far less immediate trouble than OPEC members like Venezuela and Algeria, analysts say.Some of the less well-off oil producers clearly wanted a deal in hopes that it would raise prices and revenues. \u201cThis is something that affects the whole oil industry whether you are in OPEC or not,\u201d Ecuador\u2019s oil minister, Carlos Pareja Yannuzzelli, told reporters on Sunday.While plans are far from fully delineated, Prince Mohammed appears to be charting a more independent course for the Saudi oil industry. For instance, he has said he plans a public listing of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil-producing company. A public listing might require the company to pay more attention to the requirements of outside investors than to other OPEC members.Prince Mohammed increasingly seems to see oil as a potential political instrument \u2014 an approach that Mr. Naimi eschewed.\u201cThere is a lot of change happening in Riyadh,\u201d Mr. Mallinson said. Oil policy is becoming \u201cless insulated from politics.\u201dSome analysts speculate that Mr. Naimi \u2014 who has long been skeptical that other producers, including Russia, would honor production ceilings \u2014 is going along with the idea of a freeze to help insulate Saudi Arabia from criticism.The Saudis might have been \u201ccovering their backs,\u201d said Paul Stevens, an analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research firm. \u201cThey can say, \u2018We tried.\u2019\u201dRussia had reason to go along with a freeze. Russia\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on oil revenues, is in recession. The Kremlin\u2019s desperation for higher prices is palpable; the country is committed to two wars, in Ukraine and Syria. At home, wages are being cut, bringing signs of social unrest ahead of a parliamentary election in September.Russia\u2019s energy minister, Alexander Novak, who attended the Doha meeting, has been a crucial supporter of a freeze. A role assigned to Mr. Novak was to bring in Iran, but he has failed so far.Russia and Saudi Arabia trade places for the top spot among oil producers. Russia has been in the lead of late, pumping 10.9 million barrels of oil a day in January compared with Saudi Arabia\u2019s 10.2 million. But because of Russia\u2019s larger population and industrial base, it consumes more oil at home, leaving Saudi Arabia the leader in exports.Since the Soviet period, OPEC has looked on Russia as a freeloader on price-boosting production cuts: Russia benefited but never joined in.Analysts say that OPEC\u2019s efforts to involve Russia and other outsiders underlines its diminished clout. Joining with Russia is \u201cwhat is left for an organization that has lost its core reason for being, at least for now and possibly for the longer term,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the market research firm IHS, who was observing the meeting.Stanley Reed reported from Doha, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}

A bubble and subsequent bust are not a matter of whether, but when. Overspeculation leads to poor investments, and the debt overhang becomes so big that it eventually causes the bubble to burst. I hope this book will serve as a wake-up call, because the window for defusing this time bomb is closing, given how fast debt has increased in the past few years.Interestingly, some readers in China complained about the title. Some thought I meant that the bubble is guaranteed by the government and therefore will never burst. There are a lot of people scared of the bubble bursting, but just as many who believe we\u2019re already in a bubble and are waiting for the bubble to burst to snap up assets.So no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable, as long as China engages in active reform. However, time is running out. With ballooning debt and slowing growth, the Chinese government will have fewer deployable resources going forward. Given the already high valuations in the stock market and housing market, it\u2019s not clear how far one can push the bubble without it bursting and having a catastrophic impact on China and the global economy. Now that China shoulders a large portion of global economic growth, whatever happens in China will have far-reaching implications for the rest of the world.To diffuse the risks, the government has to phase out its guarantees. It should stop providing guarantees for economic growth and investment performance and let the market play a maximum role in allocating resources.I\u2019d like to add that this challenge is not unique to China. In the February G-20 central banker and finance minister summit meeting, leaders from major economies agreed to use more active fiscal policies to boost global economic growth. We may have reached a point, at least in some major economies, where leaders are setting unrealistic objectives for economic growth. I think global leaders need to realize that high economic growth is very difficult to achieve after a certain threshold, and can in fact cause much unwarranted risk for future generations.Advertisement"}

The plans would also make it somewhat easier for employers to dismiss workers.The film has also been shown in Lyon and Marseille as the protests against the labor proposals have spread across France.\u201cMerci Patron!\u201d follows Mr. Ruffin\u2019s efforts on behalf of Jocelyne and Serge Klur, a couple in the northern town of Forest-en-Cambr\u00e9sis who lost their jobs in 2007 with the closing of a factory that had been subcontracted to make suits for LVMH brands. Production was moved to Eastern Europe.Mr. Ruffin coaches the Klurs, who are now destitute and whose home is threatened with foreclosure. Posing as their son, with dyed blond hair, he guides them on a quest to demand 35,000 euros, about $40,000, to settle their debts and to win a minimum-wage job for Mr. Klur from LVMH and Mr. Arnault.Olivier Labesse, a spokesman for Mr. Arnault, said the company was not commenting about the film. But he emphasized that LVMH employed 120,000 workers around the world, including more than 20,000 in France. Last year its revenue totaled \u20ac35.7 billion.\u201cEveryone on the right and the left gets media training to go on television,\u201d Mr. Ruffin said of the criticism. \u201cAnd it seems to me that the Klurs have the right to media training as well.\u201d\u201cMerci Patron!\u201d has also benefited from accusations of censorship. Mr. Ruffin said he had been shut out of the television talk show circuit in a nation where most of the mainstream media is controlled by a few conglomerates. In March, the union for journalists from Le Parisien \u2014 a daily newspaper that LVMH acquired last year \u2014 publicly accused their new editor of blocking reviews of the film because he argued that the Klurs were being manipulated.Although Mr. Moore never managed in \u201cRoger & Me\u201d to reach his goal of getting Mr. Smith to visit Flint, Mich., Mr. Ruffin was somewhat more successful. After the Klurs, under his guidance, threatened to send letters to major news outlets about their financial woes, a tough-talking LVMH representative visited their home to offer a settlement.\u201cAbove all,\u201d the emissary urged, according to a camera hidden between the paws of a cheetah sculpture, \u201cdon\u2019t talk to anyone!\u201dJean-Pierre Garnier, a sociologist in Paris and an expert on urban politics, said LVMH was simply being pragmatic. \u201cBernard Arnault is very conscious of his image,\u201d Mr. Garnier said. \u201cHe is a patron of the arts. And here are these workers who could stain that image of him as cynical and indifferent to their misery and despondence.\u201dThe Klurs, who declined to be interviewed for this article, are satisfied with their portrayal in the film, said Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bourlard, a former factory worker who introduced Mr. Ruffin to the couple.\u201cIt\u2019s an amusing film because ordinary people challenged a powerful businessman, and they won,\u201d Ms. Bourlard said. \u201cThey bluffed him.\u201dMr. Ruffin has appeared at screenings around the country to take questions from audiences. At one event last month in Rouen, he was joined onstage by Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of LVMH, who is also a Socialist politician.In the film, Mr. Ruffin and Mr. Jamet are filmed by a hidden camera at a restaurant while discussing a deal for the Klurs \u2014 with Mr. Ruffin wearing a Mexican sombrero with gold tassels.Speaking to the crowd, Mr. Jamet praised Mr. Ruffin\u2019s \u201cextraordinary courage.\u201dThen Mr. Jamet noted that most of the audience members were probably wearing clothing made in foreign countries, as Mr. Ruffin\u2019s \u201cI Love Bernard\u201d T-shirt probably was.\u201cThat was made in China by child laborers,\u201d he said, and then \u2014 drowned out by jeers and whistles \u2014 he walked off the stage.\u201cI feel I have created many hundreds of jobs annually,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when they reproach me for the loss of two jobs, I find that childish, unfair and not very democratic.\u201dbecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this story misstated the conversion into dollars of the annual revenues of LVMH.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Stands Pat at Meeting, but It Explores Next Options", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank left its main interest rates and stimulus tools unchanged at its meeting on Thursday, with its president forcefully arguing that the bank\u2019s aggressive monetary policy moves had bolstered economic growth and warded off negative inflation in the eurozone.\u201cOur policies are the necessary policies for the return of the inflation rate to our objective,\u201d Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank\u2019s president, said at a news conference in Frankfurt after the interest rate decision.He added that the policies had provided \u201cthe necessary conditions for the return of growth to a higher level, and the necessary conditions for the return of interest rates to a higher level.\u201d\u201cOur monetary policies have been supporting growth,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi reacted with vehemence when asked about criticism of central bank policy last week by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble was quoted blaming low interest rates, which he said hurt German savers, as a factor in the rise of right-wing populist parties in the country. He later said that was not what he meant.\u201cCriticisms of a certain type could be viewed as endangering the independence of the E.C.B.,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. Such criticism would only undercut the effectiveness of central bank policy and force it to do even more, he said.Mr. Draghi faulted political leaders for not doing enough to improve their economies. \u201cIf there were also structural reforms, the effect of these policies would be quicker,\u201d he said.Arguing that countries had to do more to overhaul their economies and provide fiscal stimulus, he added, \u201cOur monetary policy has been the only policy in the last four years to support growth.\u201dMr. Draghi said that an internal central bank study indicated that economic growth from 2016 to 2018 would have been lower if it had not put in place the measures over the past two years, and that inflation would have been negative this year.At its last monetary policy meeting, on March 10, the central bank surprised economists and investors with an array of moves that in some cases had never been deployed by a major central bank. Those included a program that allows banks to draw central bank money for free, and then to receive a bonus if they lend the money to businesses and individuals. Banks have to meet certain benchmarks to qualify for the bonus.At the March meeting, the central bank cut its benchmark rate to zero from 0.05 percent. It also increased the penalty it charges banks to park money in its vaults \u2014 a so-called negative interest rate \u2014 to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent.Some analysts have expressed concern that the central bank could run short of bonds to buy because the market supply is finite.But Mr. Draghi dismissed those concerns, saying the bank did not \u201csee risks of scarcity.\u201dDespite the array of measures, inflation in the eurozone has been stubbornly low. It has not exceeded 0.5 percent in two years and has fallen below zero on several occasions.The fear is that the eurozone could become trapped in deflation, a vicious downward cycle of falling prices that leads people to delay purchases in hopes of even lower prices. The result could be a rise in unemployment as corporations cut costs in the face of falling sales.\u201cIn the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.The central bank\u2019s policies, he said, \u201chad the effect of avoiding the second round effects\u201d of low inflation filtering into wage negotiations and the determination of prices.Economists have even begun to debate the wisdom of so-called helicopter money, which would be printed by the central bank and handed out to citizens or used to finance public works. Once considered a radical idea, helicopter money has become a more mainstream proposal the longer inflation has resisted central bank remedies.\u201cThe concept is fraught with operational, legal and institutional difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the bottom line is, we have never discussed it.\u201d\u201cIt would become very difficult after that to control expectations,\u201d analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients on Wednesday. \u201cWe would also be very surprised if Draghi had the Governing Council\u2019s majority backing to explore this publicly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Impasse, Irish Leaders Agree on a Government", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byThe agreement is the start of a unique experiment in Irish politics under which the governing party, Fine Gael, is expected to lead a minority administration, with the tacit support of its main rival, Fianna Fail.\u201cBoth Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have reached a political agreement to facilitate a Fine Gael-led minority government,\u201d both parties said in a statement, the Irish broadcaster RTE reported.\u201cBoth party leaders are now being briefed, extensive drafting has to be done, and then both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael will hold separate parliamentary party meetings to outline the details of the confidence and supply arrangement,\u201d the statement added.Although both parties are ideologically from the center-right, they have been fierce opponents, tracing their rivalry to the aftermath of Ireland\u2019s struggle for independence.Together they have dominated Irish politics, but they have never shared power, and the deal struck on Friday does not call for a formal coalition.The agreement resulted from fraught negotiations after the February election, from which Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Fine Gael emerged without a majority.In the aftermath of Ireland\u2019s financial crisis, Mr. Kenny\u2019s government appeared to pay an electoral price for pursuing austerity policies, although the economy has rebounded recently.The elections on Feb. 26 left Fine Gael with 50 seats in Parliament, Fianna Fail with 44, Sinn Fein with 23 and the Labour Party with 7, plunging Ireland into its longest period of political limbo since independence in the 1920s.The agreement reached on Friday means that Mr. Kenny is likely to return as prime minister, but this time at the head of a minority government. Without a formal coalition, he is likely to face a constant battle to secure support for parliamentary votes, though he is expected to have the support of some independent members of Parliament.\u201cIt is going to be a very challenging scenario for everybody involved, but we have to make it work,\u201d Mr. McGrath said.The agreement still needs to be ratified by lawmakers, and there will be a parliamentary vote to elect a prime minister.But if Fianna Fail\u2019s lawmakers abstain as expected, Mr. Kenny is likely to receive the most votes, giving him the authority to form a new cabinet.An earlier version of the capsule summary with this article misstated the given name of the Irish prime minister. He is Enda Kenny, not Edna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ecuador, Political Aftershocks", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe earthquake is historic not only for the magnitude of the destruction and human suffering, but also for giving rise to the most impressive mobilization of civil society in Ecuador I can remember. The country has become one huge relief center, and in almost every neighborhood, in towns large and small, there are collection points for donations of clothing, food and blankets.So many people have joined the aid effort that in some places, they have been asked to stop sending volunteers. Social media has become a citizens\u2019 channel for messaging about offers of help or calls for relief: everything from medicine and mattresses to drinking water and toys for children, and even powdered lime to cover the hastily buried corpses of loved ones.What is striking about this huge humanitarian operation is that it has pushed the state into a secondary role. This may be normal in other countries, but in Ecuador this is an immensely significant development.The earthquake revealed that the vast and expensive official media apparatus worked perfectly when it came to producing government propaganda, but was next to useless at providing vital information for people in a crisis.This news is particularly awkward for Mr. Correa, who still has more than a year in office. The government finances were already in a mess, but now the president could be forced to seek assistance from organizations like the I.M.F. that he despises for ideological reasons.Is the country ready to cope with such an event? Mr. Correa says it is. But it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not. For now, what we see is that civil society is doing the work that the government was not prepared for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "By Opposing Obama, the Republicans Created Trump", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byMEMO to Republican legislators biting your nails over the New York primary, wondering if you can finally derail Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy with, gulp, Ted Cruz: You brought it on yourselves.Not just by failing for too long to take Mr. Trump seriously or by lacking an effective response once you did. That\u2019s well-covered territory. Most important, you created the anger that lifted his candidacy by years of systematically and effectively preventing passage of legislation that might have ameliorated the tough economic state of Mr. Trump\u2019s core voters.Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest supporters are disproportionately white, middle-aged, working-class men without college educations, a group whose fortunes have flagged as globalization and new technology have rendered millions of jobs obsolete and cut into the wages of many more. While the trade agreements that Mr. Trump bashes have played a role, the mistake was not having entered into them, but having failed to sufficiently help affected workers adjust to the new dynamics.For too many, those new dynamics have been painful indeed. In Michigan, where Mr. Trump won big, wages in manufacturing have fallen from a high of $28 per hour in 2003 to $21 at present, after adjustment for inflation, a stunning 25 percent decline.Meanwhile, the number of manufacturing jobs in the state has fallen from almost 900,000 in September 1999 to just under 600,000 at present, a picture that is repeated across the country.Throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama has put forward constructive proposals to help those displaced workers. For its part, the Republican Congress has been behaving like Nero.Take, for example, the administration\u2019s 2011 proposal of a $447 billion package of measures including payroll tax cuts and the creation of an infrastructure bank that would have led to the creation of thousands of construction jobs, as well as other substantial economic benefits.Designed to be bipartisan and fully paid for by higher taxes on rich Americans and some corporations, the American Jobs Act was nonetheless dead virtually upon its arrival on Capitol Hill.That\u2019s not all. During his administration, Mr. Obama put forth proposals for larger tax credits for child care; community college investments; expansion of the earned-income tax credit; changing retirement plans to be portable across employers and available to part-time workers; and tax credits for manufacturing communities.All these \u2014 and many more \u2014 were ignored by Congress. Even seemingly obvious steps, like continuing federal emergency benefits for the large number of long-term unemployed, have been blocked. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 19 states \u2014 mostly with Republican governors \u2014 have declined Mr. Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan.In its most recent budget, the White House put forth a robust plan for wage insurance, a concept with much support among economists. Under it, a worker who lost his or her job and was forced to take a lower-wage one that paid less than $50,000 per year would receive half of the lost wages for two years, up to $10,000.Like many of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals, that wouldn\u2019t be a game changer for working-class Americans, but it would have been a constructive piece of a more comprehensive solution.The Republican congressional leadership has refused to even hold hearings on the Obama budget.To be sure, Mr. Obama was successful in achieving passage of some of his initiatives last year, such as making permanent the earned-income tax credit, the child tax credit and modest assistance for older Americans adversely affected by trade. And Mr. Obama deserves substantial credit for the drop in joblessness on his watch.But that\u2019s not sufficient progress. For one thing, Mr. Trump\u2019s support tends to be concentrated in areas with low labor force participation. For another, with real wages declining for many Americans, the enactment of relatively minor initiatives is small beer.Whoever wins the Republican nomination, it\u2019s too late to address the concerns of Mr. Trump\u2019s core constituents before November. The anger felt by so many will not be eased until Washington takes affirmative steps.To ease the immediate pain, we need a much stronger safety net: extended unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed, wage insurance, a higher minimum wage and the like. Cutting our irrational austerity frenzy to step up investment in infrastructure is a no-brainer. All of this can \u2014 and should \u2014 be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy.Mr. Trump may have succeeded in directing the anger of his supporters toward Washington in general and President Obama in particular. But Republicans should take heed: Given your shutdown of legislation that would help downtrodden Americans, their anger should really be focused on you.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pressure on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to Shine at Home", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byAfter a week of canvassing matzo factories, cheesecake bakeries, hot-dog stands and pizza shops, the presidential candidates put local delicacies aside on Monday and told New Yorkers what they were really hungry for: votes.The five remaining contenders sought to leave nothing to chance the day before New York\u2019s primary, dashing across the city and state to make their final pitches while assailing their rivals as unelectable and incompetent. With the Republican and Democratic races becoming extended delegate battles, the spotlight on the state is unusually intense, with Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump both desperate to avoid disappointing performances in a place where they have deep roots.Polls show Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump holding wide leads in New York, but that did not mean the pressure was off. Senator Ted Cruz continues to peel Republican delegates away from Mr. Trump at state conventions across the country, and Senator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist who has sharpened his tone against Mrs. Clinton, has defied the odds before.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign events took her to a veritable United Nations of voters around New York City, where her campaign has left hardly any ethnic group unturned ahead of the primary.\u201cYou know, I never count any chickens before they hatch,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters after stopping in for a bubble tea at Kung-Fu Tea at the Queens Crossing\u2019s food court in Flushing, when asked if a big victory on Tuesday would mean that she had locked up the nomination. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anybody or anything for granted.\u201dAnd Mr. Sanders showed no signs of easing up either. The Vermont senator spent most of the sunny Monday face-to-face campaigning, an unexpected shift for a candidate who has spent most of his days holding mega-rallies before thousands of supporters. Mr. Sanders shook hands on sidewalks across the city, visited a public housing complex in the Bronx, hosted a round table with local community leaders, and stopped to eat a B.L.T. sandwich in Queens. He also hit the streets, walking 14 blocks through Midtown and speaking to striking Verizon workers.\u201cI just want to say a word to thank all of you for the courage to stand up for justice and against corporate greed,\u201d Mr. Sanders said through a megaphone as the strikers chanted his name. \u201cWe will not tolerate large profitable corporations sending jobs to low-wage countries, throwing American workers out on the street, cutting back on health care benefits, and then paying their C.E.O. $18 million a year.\u201dAs Mr. Sanders courted union workers, Mr. Trump was across town trying to improve his standing with members of minority groups.At Trump Tower, he gathered with select members of a recently formed \u201cdiversity coalition,\u201d the brainchild of his company adviser, Michael Cohen, who drew on longstanding relationships with some black pastors to form an umbrella group meant to rebut questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude about race and criticism that he appeals only to white voters.There was confusion around the meeting, which was expected to draw about 40 people but mushroomed into a crowd of more than 100. Mr. Trump\u2019s guests all entered by the Trump Bar on the ground floor of the building, then were shepherded downstairs by the Secret Service and screened for weapons before they went down the escalators. Reporters and attendees jostled for position.A look at where the candidates are competing for votes.Mr. Trump eventually descended from his office and offered brief remarks, expressing cautious optimism about the Tuesday election results and hitting his Republican opponents as New York pretenders.\u201cWe love the city \u2014 you look at the other folks running, they couldn\u2019t care less about New York,\u201d he said. \u201cWe care about New York a lot.\u201dMr. Trump then went to Buffalo for a campaign rally.Although they appeared to be long shots in New York, Mr. Cruz and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio continued to pound the Republican front-runner from afar. Mr. Kasich, who has won only his home state, held town hall events near Syracuse and in Schenectady, pressing his positive message and lamenting Mr. Trump\u2019s tone.\u201cHe feeds into their anxieties and their fears,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cDoes he have any solutions for how he\u2019s going to deal with it? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dMr. Cruz, who squeezed in a campaign stop in Maryland between two private events in New York City and national television appearances, also hammered Mr. Trump for offering empty solutions on the economy and foreign policy. On ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d the Texas senator warned that Mr. Trump would be crushed by Mrs. Clinton in a general election and suggested that he was nothing more than a vapid celebrity candidate.\u201cHe\u2019s always interesting to watch,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fun entertainer.

{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma, Under Siege, Finds Political Refuge in Rural South Africa", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byEven as urban South Africans were calling for his resignation, thousands of supporters in Melmoth, a small town in the country\u2019s southeast, many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with his face, cheered and chanted for him on Sunday.\u201cAs your shepherd, let me lead you,\u201d Mr. Zuma told the crowd, according to news reports of his appearance.At the event, officially about the nation\u2019s drought, organizers handed out food and Mr. Zuma spoke of the importance of black South Africans voting as a bloc. That was the only way, he said, to make gains, like the recovery of land seized from their ancestors.He has succeeded thanks to the backing of rural communities like Melmoth, where his party, the African National Congress, has established a vast network of patronage that is expected to yield electoral victories for years, and perhaps decades. More than any of his predecessors, Mr. Zuma, himself a product of rural South Africa, has championed towns and villages.\u201cBut behind this unified front, something is building within the A.N.C.,\u201d said Somadoda Fikeni, a political analyst. \u201cThe mood is far more fractured than what you hear in the party\u2019s public statements.\u201dOn Thursday, the Constitutional Court ruled that Mr. Zuma had violated the Constitution in his handling of a long-running corruption scandal involving expensive upgrades to his home in Nkandla, a town in the southeast. For years, Mr. Zuma waved away criticism \u2014 and then findings by the nation\u2019s public protector \u2014 that he had misused public money on the home improvements, totaling more than $16 million at current exchange rates.After failing to impeach the president, opposition leaders said they would use street protests and other means to keep the pressure on Mr. Zuma. On Wednesday, in a sign of widening popular discontent, an umbrella group of leaders from churches, unions, academia and other institutions said they would begin a campaign to press Mr. Zuma to step down.But within the A.N.C., there has been only a trickle of calls for Mr. Zuma\u2019s resignation, coming from a few retired, though prominent, officials.In comments widely interpreted as being directed against Mr. Zuma, David Makhura, a party member and the premier of Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and is the nation\u2019s richest and most urban, said this week that loyalty to the country was more important than loyalty to the party. In November, Mr. Zuma said the A.N.C. was more important than South Africa, refusing to retract his statement after it elicited widespread criticism.\u201cWhen the A.N.C. was going to consider what next to do, we knew that the A.N.C. would act in the best interest of the people and the country,\u201d Mr. Makhura said at a memorial service for a party veteran. \u201cWe should ask ourselves whether we can still say that today.\u201dThe A.N.C. chapter in Gauteng Province has not backed Mr. Zuma as the party\u2019s presidential candidate in the past. Voters, especially in Johannesburg, the provincial capital and the country\u2019s largest city, have gravitated to opposition parties in recent elections. For the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994, the A.N.C. is expected to face serious challenges in Johannesburg and some other cities in local elections scheduled for August.The split inside the A.N.C. reflects wider cleavages inside South Africa itself, said Steven Friedman, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg.In urban pockets, a growing black middle class, participating in the formal economy, looks to politicians for good government, Mr. Friedman said. These include A.N.C. members who are opposed to Mr. Zuma and his politics.\u201cIf you imagine the South Africa of 1994 as a country run by an exclusive club consisting of white people, what has happened over the last 21 years is that new members have been admitted to the club,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial, but it still means it\u2019s an exclusive club.\u201dThe vast majority of South Africans are excluded from this club, with many living in rural areas like Melmoth, the town Mr. Zuma visited. In those areas, there is often little beyond the jobs and money provided by the A.N.C.\u201cFor a lot of the A.N.C. members, supporters and even leaders there, outside the party government, there isn\u2019t really much they can do,\u201d said William Gumede, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and the executive chairman of the Democracy Works Foundation, a good-government group. \u201cThey\u2019re not professionals who can go back to teaching or being medical doctors after being kicked out of power. The party and the party patronage system is the only place for them.\u201dFor now, the party\u2019s rural and urban factions have united behind Mr. Zuma for the coming local elections, Mr. Friedman said. After the elections, the factional fighting is likely to emerge and intensify before a 2017 party conference when delegates will choose a successor to Mr. Zuma, who is limited to two terms as president.But until then, the A.N.C. could face growing popular discontent in the cities for continuing to stand behind Mr. Zuma. At a news conference announcing their anti-Zuma campaign on Wednesday, civil society leaders called on the president to step down.\u201cThe formal political process has failed,\u201d said Prince Mashele, the executive director of the Center for Politics and Research, a private group participating in the campaign. \u201cThe only thing that remains now is for ordinary South Africans to organize themselves under the banner of civil society to put pressure on the A.N.C. to make Jacob Zuma resign or to pressure Jacob Zuma himself to throw in the towel.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

According to a recent poll by Datafolha, a research institute, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s approval among the poorest Brazilians has dropped to 16 percent, down from 50 percent in December 2014. Among working-class Brazilians with a basic education, the numbers were similar: Support sagged to 18 percent from 54 percent during the same period.Such figures reflect the disillusionment sweeping through a constituency that once helped propel the Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cEverything has gotten worse \u2014 job opportunities, health care and crime,\u201d said Helen Brand\u00e3o, who was selling sandwiches, candy and bottled water from a food truck on Saturday outside the Chamber of Deputies, the body that will vote Sunday on whether to begin impeachment proceedings.Once firmly in the middle class, Ms. Brand\u00e3o, 30, said she turned to street hawking six months ago after losing her job as a receptionist at a home repair company, which went bankrupt. A mother of three young children, she earns about $340 a month, nearly a quarter of her previous income, and said she had lost her dental insurance and cut back on family vacations.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten so bad, there are no doctors in the hospitals,\u201d Ms. Brand\u00e3o said. \u201cA few years ago, no one imagined life would get so hard.\u201dOnce a supporter of the Workers\u2019 Party, she said it was time for Ms. Rousseff to go. \u201cI\u2019m for impeachment,\u201d she said.Across the street, Erisvaldo Rodrigues Marques, 43, has spent the last two decades polishing the shoes of politicians who stream in and out of the building. He credits a magnanimous politician with giving him the prime spot, and over the years Mr. Marques was able to buy a house in Planaltina, a 40-minute bus ride from the capital.\u201cI used to have four or five people waiting to have their shoes shined,\u201d he said.Mr. Marques, often idle now, blames Ms. Rousseff. \u201cI favor the impeachment, only to see if something changes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a new country.\u201dFrom his perch at a reception desk inside the Congress building\u2019s entrance hall, Francisco Raimundo Rodrigues has seen it all: naked corruption, political betrayals and protesters who forced their way through the front doors, among them landless petitioners who once crashed a vehicle into the lobby.\u201cI could write many books, but I can\u2019t say anything until after I retire,\u201d he said.But Mr. Rodrigues, 59, said the current government had been among the worst of his 30 years as a civil servant. \u201cDilma said she supported the poor, but it was just an illusion,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "In Wyoming, Hard Times Return as Energy Prices Slump", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWRIGHT, Wyo. \u2014 For 17 years, Scott Pearce worked as a mechanic here in the Powder River Basin, a Saudi Arabia of Western coal deposits. But about a week ago, he became a casualty of the declining local economy, one of nearly 500 people laid off from the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle mines. It was among the latest and worst rounds of job losses to hit Wyoming.Hard times have come crashing back on energy-reliant towns like this one in northern Wyoming, where lives and fortunes hinge on the coal, oil and gas buried beneath the rolling plains.A church in Gillette, about 40 miles north, held a prayer vigil for laid-off miners last week, and state officials were scrambling to find them seasonal work with state parks or jobs as prison guards. But U-Haul vans and trailers are already starting to carry people away from Wright, a town of 1,800 that sprouted up in the 1980s to serve the mines. Mr. Pearce, 52, is leaving for Alaska to chase work with his brother in the gold mines.\u201cI\u2019ll have to turn my house back in to the bank. We\u2019re not going to be able to sell,\u201d he said one afternoon last week as he watched television at a friend\u2019s electronics shop. \u201cThis is a sinking ship.\u201dBankruptcies in the coal industry and a slowdown in oil drilling have sown economic pain and budget shortfalls from Appalachia to Alaska, but the effects have been especially concentrated in Wyoming.The state\u2019s unemployment rate has climbed by 1.2 percentage points over the past year, more than in any other state. While Wyoming\u2019s overall jobless rate is about even with the national average, 5 percent, the layoffs in mining country have created pockets of a new recession, raising fears that rural economies here are veering away from the rest of the country\u2019s economic progress.\u201cIt is, no question, a hard time for the state,\u201d Gov. Matt Mead said in a telephone interview. \u201cAs difficult as it is now, I think it can get worse. If these people pack up and leave, the local restaurant won\u2019t even get that occasional business. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see.\u201dThe layoffs have forced an economic reckoning in a state where oil, gas, coal and uranium provide 60 to 70 percent of revenue. Tourists and second-home buyers are still flocking to Jackson Hole, wind turbines are blooming along the plains and Microsoft is expanding a data center in Cheyenne. But those pale in comparison with the shadow that energy extraction \u2014 much of it on federal lands \u2014 casts across the economy.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to diversify the economy,\u201d Mr. Mead said.Falling tax revenue forced deep budget cuts this year and prompted lawmakers to draw $180 million from the state\u2019s rainy-day fund. The budget crunch also intensified a debate within the Republican-dominated state government over whether to expand Medicaid under President Obama\u2019s health care law.Mr. Mead, a Republican, opposed the Affordable Care Act, but in 2014 started urging the Republican-controlled State Legislature to accept the Medicaid expansion, saying it would bring in about $268 million in federal dollars and cover about 20,000 low-income people. But the Legislature balked, saying it would force Wyoming to shoulder a huge government expansion with an unknown price tag down the line.\u201cWe care about our people,\u201d said Phil Nicholas, the State Senate president. \u201cBut we also believe you can create problems by creating straight-out entitlements without any obligation or effort to improve your situation.\u201dDemocrats said the budget cuts and Medicaid rejection ended up heaping most of the pain on Wyoming\u2019s poor. A literacy program that helped people earn high school equivalency degrees was eliminated, as were programs that provided dental care and property-tax rebates to low-income old people.Mary Throne, the Democratic minority floor leader in the State House of Representatives, said the Medicaid expansion could have helped the families of laid-off miners.\u201cAs people lose benefits and they don\u2019t have access to health insurance, we\u2019re going to need a safety net,\u201d she said. \u201cWe made very bad choices. We panicked. And we really should have been thoughtful and deliberate.\u201dIf jobs are scarce around here, blame is not. Some conservative lawmakers and laid-off workers seethed at the Obama administration\u2019s carbon regulations and its halt on coal leasing on public lands. But others said that coal was struggling to compete against cheap, plentiful natural gas, and that oil and gas drilling would rebound once prices did.In Casper, Eric Kraft, 30, sat down at a computer terminal at a packed work force resource center and started filling out a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He said he had been a month shy of his 10th year at the Black Thunder mine when his supervisors gathered everyone in the break room and started handing out letters. Some had good news. Not his.\u201cMine said they appreciated your service, and there was a bus to haul me home,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. \u201cIt was more of a relief \u2014 the biggest part of it was the waiting, knowing it\u2019s coming.\u201dTowns like Wright are still bracing for the worst. It survived a bust in the mid-1980s just after it incorporated from an outpost of trailers into a real town. It survived a tornado that killed two people and destroyed 90 homes.The apartment complexes in town once had waiting lists, and one of the town\u2019s biggest headaches was coping with all of the tractor-trailers parked on the streets, said Brandi Harlow, the town\u2019s economic development coordinator. Now, Ms. Harlow said, she was working to bring in experts from the community college to counsel residents on how to refinance their mortgages, navigate a job search and apply for food stamps.The town of Wright\u2019s $3 million budget is already down about 30 percent. And as workers in the area brace for the possibility of more layoffs, they said they were still unsure where the bottom might lie.\u201cReminds me of going to a funeral,\u201d said the mayor, Ralph Kingan. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to my town.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the structures on the outskirts of Wright, Wyo.

{"Headline": "Immigrants, the Poor and Minorities Gain Sharply Under Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The first full year of the Affordable Care Act brought historic increases in coverage for low-wage workers and others who have long been left out of the health care system, a New York Times analysis has found. Immigrants of all backgrounds \u2014 including more than a million legal residents who are not citizens \u2014 had the sharpest rise in coverage rates.Hispanics, a coveted group of voters this election year, accounted for nearly a third of the increase in adults with insurance. That was the single largest share of any racial or ethnic group, far greater than their 17 percent share of the population. Low-wage workers, who did not have enough clout in the labor market to demand insurance, saw sharp increases. Coverage rates jumped for cooks, dishwashers, waiters, as well as for hairdressers and cashiers. Minorities, who disproportionately worked in low-wage jobs, had large gains.The health care law was one of the most bitterly contested pieces of legislation in the country\u2019s history. It remains controversial because of its costs to both taxpayers and insurance customers. The high premiums and high deductibles of many plans still make coverage a crushing financial burden for some families.And the law is not close to achieving the goal of universal coverage, in part because 19 states have declined to expand their Medicaid programs for the poor, an option the Supreme Court granted them in a landmark 2012 case. Nevertheless, the Times\u2019s analysis shows that by the end of that first full year, 2014, so many low-income people gained coverage that it halted the decades-long expansion of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in the American health insurance system, a striking change at a time when disparities between rich and poor are growing in many areas.\u201cThe law has clearly reduced broad measures of inequality,\u201d said David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, who served in the Clinton administration and advised the 2008 Obama campaign on health issues. \u201cThese are people who blend into the background of the economy. They are cleaning your hotel room, making your sandwich. The law has helped this population enormously.\u201dThe analysis shows how the law lifted some of the most vulnerable citizens. Part-time workers gained insurance at a higher rate than full-time workers, and people with high school degrees gained it at double the rate of college graduates. Adults living in households headed by relatives, such as siblings or cousins \u2014 often a marker of economic distress \u2014 gained insurance at double the rate of those in traditional households.The findings from the census data could inform the national dialogue, especially in this election year. Hispanics are a powerful voting force and the law is viewed favorably in Hispanic neighborhoods. But whether the sharp increase in coverage rates for Hispanics will translate into votes for Democrats who supported the law, or whether some Republicans might temper their vows to repeal it, is not clear. And the fact that so many who benefited under the law were not citizens (or voters) \u2014 1.2 million out of the total 8.7 million who got health insurance in 2014 \u2014 could set off a new round of debate in a year when immigration has become a deeply polarizing issue.About 60 percent of those noncitizens were Hispanic, mostly natives of Mexico and Central America who had been living in the United States for decades. Another third were Asian, mostly newer arrivals living in states like California, New York and Texas. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for insurance under the law, but legal immigrants can qualify for subsidies in the insurance exchanges and those who have been in the country for more than five years can qualify for Medicaid.The vast majority of the country\u2019s 11 million illegal immigrants, about 70 percent of whom are Hispanic, still lack coverage, said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center.Though the law has withstood two Supreme Court rulings that would have undermined its central elements, it continues to face challenges.But in low-income neighborhoods like this one in South Los Angeles, a historically poor patch of the city dotted with palm trees, small ranch houses and home to a growing Hispanic population, the law is having a big effect.\u201cFrom the vantage point of the poor and working poor, Obamacare has been profound,\u201d said Jim Mangia, president of the St. John\u2019s Well Child and Family Center, a federally funded health clinic in South Los Angeles that has enrolled 18,000 new patients under the law, nearly all of them Hispanic or black and the vast majority in Medicaid. The clinic reported a 44 percent increase in cervical cancer screenings, a 25 percent increase in tobacco cessation therapy, and a 22 percent increase in the share of patients with controlled hypertension since 2014, the result, he said, of more patients having insurance.One new patient, Angela Cruz, 60, is a typical example of a winner under the law. A legal immigrant who is not a citizen, she came to this country from El Salvador in 1990. She had never had health insurance in her 25 years of working in the United States, most recently as a nanny. She stitched together medical care through emergency rooms, free clinics and home remedies. When she needed to pay for medicine for a painful bout of kidney stones, she stopped buying meat.Then she got coverage under the health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in California.Now, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the stress of wondering \u2014 can I pay this \u2014 when sometimes I didn\u2019t have anything to pay it with.\u201dHispanics remain the least insured Americans, with only 67 percent having coverage in 2014, in part because so many illegal immigrants are uninsured.Gains for blacks were muted because they disproportionately live in states that chose not to expand Medicaid. About 60 percent of poor blacks live in states that did not expand Medicaid. While the share of poor blacks covered by Medicaid did rise by two percentage points in those states, the rate rose by six points in states that expanded the program.In all, minorities gained more than whites, making up two-thirds of the increase in insured adults across the country, and 70 percent of the increase in private insurance. Minority men who work as groundskeepers and janitors saw substantial gains, rising to 59 percent insured, up from 51 percent in 2013. Hispanic male construction workers rose to 43 percent insured, from 36 percent in 2013.One such worker, Sergio Ortega, 51, a legal immigrant from Mexico who had never been insured before getting covered by Medicaid in 2014, said making a doctor\u2019s appointment seemed unthinkable without insurance, so he often simply ignored his health problems.Several years ago, he started feeling tired, a condition that eventually drove him to quit his job demolishing buildings and start selling fruit from a street cart. By the time he sought treatment through his new coverage and discovered he had diabetes, his lower leg had to be amputated.\u201cI realized it was getting really bad because my foot started turning purple,\u201d said Mr. Ortega, who is a patient at St. John\u2019s.Perhaps the biggest unmet promise of the law is that many it was supposed to help still cannot afford insurance. Alberto Torres, 50, a driver for a garment company in Los Angeles who could not afford insurance before the law, had signed up for a plan in 2014 for $41 a month. But this year his monthly premium jumped to $106 \u2014 too much, he said, for his meager salary.\u201cI\u2019m feeling not so good,\u201d he said recently, waiting in line for help to look for a less expensive plan.Having insurance does not necessarily mean better health, but experts hope it could start to ease some of the worst disparities that have kept the United States close to the bottom of health rankings of rich countries.Mr. Ortega has been fitted for a prosthetic leg. He is still learning how to use it.\u201cNow I don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a security, a comfort that I feel.\u201dAn article on Monday about the Affordable Care Act referred imprecisely to the eligibility rules under the law for legal immigrants. While legal immigrants must typically wait for five years before they can qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, there is no waiting period for legal immigrants to qualify for subsidies in the health insurance exchanges, where policies are purchased.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shrunken Citigroup Illustrates a Trend in Big U.S. Banks", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byCitigroup became the nation\u2019s first megabank some two decades ago by expanding into new businesses while pushing to knock down barriers that limited its size.A much different Citigroup was evident on Friday as it reported its quarterly results. Business lines like subprime lending, which used to define the company, have all but disappeared.Over the last seven years, Citigroup has sold more than 60 businesses, shedding retail bank branches from Boston to Pakistan. In all, the bank\u2019s holdings have shrunk by $700 billion \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to Switzerland\u2019s economic output. The bank\u2019s chief executive said on Friday that since he took over in 2012, the company\u2019s work force had declined by 40,000 jobs, through layoffs or selling businesses.On the campaign trail, and in the Democratic debate Thursday, the conversation has often returned to an assumption that very little has changed in the nation\u2019s banking system since the 2008 financial crisis. But Citigroup\u2019s financial results were one of many reminders this week of just how much success the government has already had in pushing banks to become simpler and safer, if not always smaller.Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, in their own earnings announcements this week, emphasized how much more of a financial cushion they had built up to protect themselves in a crisis, and how many risky businesses they had jettisoned.The bank presentations this week also indicated that even if Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, does not win the White House \u2014 and is thwarted in his wish to break up the big banks \u2014 the companies will still face intense pressure from their regulators and their shareholders to shed more employees and business lines.On Thursday, Bank of America talked about the likelihood of further reductions, while Goldman Sachs is said to be embarking on its biggest cost-cutting campaign in years.All of these moves are a testament to the power of the tools that the regulators have already used, and appear intent to continue using, to change the profile of the biggest American banks.Rather than simply telling the banks to shrink, regulators have used a set of sometimes arcane instruments \u2014 like capital requirements \u2014 that have quietly but significantly penalized the banks for their size and complexity, and required them to find ways to shrink on their own.Just this week, the top bank regulators wielded a relatively new tool when they told five of the eight largest banks that they needed to develop better plans for winding themselves down in case of a crisis. If the banks do not do so, the regulators threatened to force the banks to shrink even more.Citigroup was the only one of the eight largest banks to have its plan, or so-called living will, approved by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in large part because of the steps the bank has already taken to slim down.Like the other big banks, it is not yet out of the woods, however. Because of the regulatory penalties for being large, some on Wall Street are questioning whether even in its diminished state, Citigroup is still too large.\u201cYou should be selling the silverware in the dining rooms or the paper clips from the desk or the desk chairs or the whole desk,\u201d the banking analyst Mike Mayo told Citigroup\u2019s top executives in a conference call Friday morning.Mr. Mayo\u2019s frustration is a response to the struggles of Citigroup and other banking giants to increase profits under the new regulatory burden they are facing. The results in the first quarter were among the weakest the big banks have reported since the financial crisis, as they struggled with a sluggish global economy and persistently low interest rates.The challenges have pushed bank stocks down this year to their lowest level since 2012. That in turn, has forced bank executives to cut salaries and bonuses, and thousands of jobs, across their business lines.Financial services nonetheless is still among the highest-paying sectors in the country. And more important, the big banks remain behemoths. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are bigger than they were before the financial crisis. At all the big banks, the risk-taking Wall Street operations still provide a major proportion of revenue and profit.But all of that is being squeezed by the \u201cvise that is the current regulatory environment,\u201d said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.Mr. Kleinhanzl has said that Citigroup will probably have to eventually break into smaller pieces if it wants to increase growth under current regulations.Until now, many of the assets that large banks like Citigroup have sold have included a hodgepodge of businesses \u2014 student loans, an insurance unit and retail operations in far-flung corners or the developing world.Mr. Kleinhanzl says the bank needs to take more drastic steps, making the case for Citigroup to split its consumer and corporate businesses into two separate companies or sell parts of its profitable Mexican unit.Still, the banks could get a reprieve from many of these pressures if a Republican wins the White House in November. All of the top Republican candidates have called for a reversal of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that has guided many of the recent regulatory actions.Citigroup and the other big banks continue to defend the economic importance of global banks with a wide array of business lines.\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time to start selling the furniture,\u201d Citigroup\u2019s chief financial officer, John C. Gerspach, said in response to Mr. Mayo.But at more than a few points, hints of resignation crept into the presentations of the top bank executives as they spoke of the need to submit to the tightening regulatory vise.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to meet all the regulations, all the rules and all the requirements,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said on Thursday, after announcing one of the bank\u2019s worst quarters in years.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that now for five or six years. It\u2019s six years since Dodd-Frank was passed; they have their job to do, and we have to conform to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Monetarism Failed", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "To repeat the key points of my argument:On the intellectual side, the \u201cneoclassical synthesis\u201d \u2014 of which Friedman-style monetarism was essentially part, despite his occasional efforts to make it seem completely different \u2014 was inherently an awkward construct. Economists were urged to build everything from \u201cmicro foundations\u201d \u2014 which was taken to mean perfect rationality and clearing markets, not realistic descriptions of individual behavior. But to get a macro picture that looked anything like the real world, and which justified monetary activism, you needed to assume that for some reason wages and prices were slow to adjust. Inevitably the drive for purism collided with the realistic accommodations, the ad hockery, needed to be useful; sure enough, half the macroeconomics profession basically said, \u201cwhat are you going to believe, our models or your lying eyes?\u201d and abandoned any good sense Friedman had originally brought to the subject.What about the reformicons, who pushed for neo-monetarism? We can sum up their fate in two words: Marco Rubio. There is no home for the kind of return to realism they were seeking.The point is that the monetarist idea no longer serves any useful purpose, intellectually or politically. Hicksian macro \u2014 IS-LM or something like it \u2014 remains an extremely useful tool of both analysis and policy formulation; that tool is not helped by trying to state it in terms of monetary velocity and all that. And if you want macro policy that isn\u2019t dictated by Ayn Rand logic, you have to turn to a Democrat; on the other side, there\u2019s nobody rational to talk to.

They had fallen a long way before the rally, the outlook for company earnings has improved slightly, and fears about the strength of the world economy have subsided a bit.It wouldn\u2019t be wise to also call it a Trump rally, though he is leading on the Republican side. During this period, as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s grasp on the nomination tightened considerably, the polls show her beating Mr. Trump in November.But here\u2019s some advice for anyone in the Clinton camp who might want to point to the market\u2019s jump as evidence that investors would be happy with her winning in November: Don\u2019t.Time and time again, political partisans have tried to recruit the stock market to their side. Most of the time it backfires.One of the most famous examples of this occurred in the months after Barack Obama was elected in 2008. The stock market, still roiled by the financial crisis and a horrible global economy, was plunging. Right wingers said investors were selling because they were fearful of the new president\u2019s policies, and called the rout \u201cthe Obama bear market.\u201dThe article contained plenty of caveats about not slavishly reading too much into the markets. But Mr. Summers also contended that markets \u201care like canaries in coal mines: very valuable in giving warning when conditions change.\u201d But the same markets are rising and appear to be signaling optimism. Were they right then but wrong now?In an email exchange, Mr. Summers said that the thesis of his column was that policy makers should have been more worried than they seemed to be at the time about the outlook for the global economy. Since then, Mr. Summers said, the Federal Reserve has significantly modulated expectations of monetary tightening.As a result, he contended, the upswing in the markets \u201cwas in significant part the result of policy doing what I urged \u2014 \u2018heeding market warnings.\u2019 \u201dMore broadly, he added, \u201cThink of markets as a mediocre but not hopeless weatherman making probabilistic forecasts.\u201d (His comments came after publication because I overlooked his initial response to my query.)The market does contain important signals that can tell a bigger story, but it\u2019s a job to separate them from the noise and pure speculation. Sometimes markets react to specific political events. If Mr. Trump were to start polling strongly against Mrs. Clinton shortly before the presidential election, while still pledging to introduce tough protectionist trade policies, the stock market would most likely sell off on fears of what those policies might do to the economy.But you could reach the same economic conclusions without ever looking at the stock market. Most of what the markets appear to be saying can already be guessed at by looking at other sources.Markets also misread what\u2019s going on in the wider world. They don\u2019t have a special clairvoyance. They also don\u2019t always say what we think they are saying. The recent rally may indeed be a sign that investors would be O.K. with Mrs. Clinton winning, and the rally may even signal that she will win.But would her chances be any lower if the markets plunged for purely economic reasons? They could be higher.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tiny Home by Choice in New York City", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosOn the emotional fulcrum of New York City apartment-hunting, size and setting are forever in sway. Does a park view trump a guest bedroom? Is a vast kitchen worth settling blocks from a trendy thoroughfare? Usually, a compromise is struck. Unless it isn\u2019t.These are not cash-strapped individuals who have been painted into a corner, nor are they young professional types starting out in the new micro-apartments.Many are simply realizing the fantasy of moving to a charmed setting, home size be damned. For others, safe and socially or culturally rich environs are far more alluring than square footage. And then there are those who prize geographic convenience, as well as the emotional liberation of (really) pared-down living.For some, the ultimate New York neighborhood may be Greenwich Village, defined by its winding streets, historic architecture, cozy but chic storefronts and diverse dining options. Roomy digs are less essential when a neighborhood serves as an extension of your living room, wherever in the five boroughs it may be.Vicki Behm and her husband, Glenn Coleman, are Chicago transplants who have lived in New York for 20 years. Their location-driven residential history is a handbook for urban downsizing, as they have managed to achieve, in four happy translocations, the equivalent of reducing a cow to a bouillon cube.The couple\u2019s real estate journey in New York began in 1996 when they rented a comfortable ground-level apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. Two years later they purchased a nearby four-story three-bedroom 1840s Federal-style townhouse, with three bedrooms and two working marble fireplaces. Four years later, for reasons personal and professional, they decided to move to Manhattan, even if it meant downscaling.Several years later, they contracted the highly contagious Village virus.\u201cWhen we were living in Midtown, we used to walk around this neighborhood and say, \u2018Gosh, wouldn\u2019t it be great to live here someday?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Behm recounts. \u201cI never got that out of my mind.\u201dThe setting was ideal.\u201cBut the apartment was in really rough shape,\u201d Ms. Behm said. \u201cEven the halls were bad, with that surface like icing on a cake that you can cut yourself on.\u201dA big plus was the shared roof garden with trees, plants and views of the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. They bought the 675-square-foot-place for $660,000.They executed a complete, historically minded overhaul, including redoing walls and ceilings, and installing period woodwork and period black doorknobs. One small bedroom was turned into a walk-in closet, study and TV room, while the other remained a sleeping space.\u201cOnce we got used to it, and it took a little time, we were happy with the move,\u201d Ms. Behm said.\u201cExcept those stairs,\u201d Mr. Coleman said.\u201cAnd I have always wanted to live in a cottage,\u201d Ms. Behm said, beaming.She soon learned that her infatuation with cottages was shared by a number of other New Yorkers. On the day of the open house, an estimated 250 prospective buyers queued up around the block. Being residents of the co-op, Ms. Behm and Mr. Coleman were on the inside track and purchased it for $825,000.Their current dwelling is not exactly a free-standing cottage, but it feels like one. The courtyard just outside, where they have put a small table and chairs, belongs to their co-op, Ms. Behm said, but is seldom used by others.After minor alterations, the couple moved in last September. They are more than content.Of course, the smaller you go, the more you heave overboard, Ms. Behm said. \u201cSo out goes the Herman Miller sofa and credenza; out go my big art books \u2014 that was hard. The big turkey platter had to go, also my nine cake pans \u2014 I\u2019ll buy that flourless chocolate cake.\u201d She also sold all but one of her large paintings.Their cheerful all-purpose room features a working fireplace (wood is stored at the bottom of built-in bookshelves), hardwood floors, tall windows facing the courtyard and an eight-foot ceiling. A napkin\u2019s toss away are a 100-square-foot bedroom with a built-in closet, a cleverly arranged galley kitchen and a small tiled bathroom. The entrance hallway serves as a coat closet.\u201cThe apartment doesn\u2019t feel as small as it is,\u201d Mr. Coleman says, \u201cbecause for seven to eight months of the year the courtyard is part of our living space.\u201dChristine Kudrav, 30, an executive at a philanthropic foundation in Manhattan, arrived in New York in 2008 from Virginia, landing a one-bedroom apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, of more than 1,000 square feet. A roommate came with the package, but considering her means, that was to be expected.\u201dIt was fine,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut back then there were few amenities there, like restaurants and bars, not like it is today.\u201dLike many neighborhood-driven downsizers, Ms. Kudrav rationalized her choice by noting that what she sacrificed on the inside was more than made up for outside. She says the block has become a wing of her home.\u201cI don\u2019t feel closed in,\u201d Ms. Kudrav said.Nor does she miss the clothing and kitchen items she jettisoned. Her well-kept building has a wide, handsome marble and oak foyer where one can envision the children of the original owner, a Union officer in the Civil War, sliding down the gleaming banister. Ms. Kudrav\u2019s dwelling features nine-foot-high ceilings, tall rounded windows and two built-in clothes closets. A small but functional cooking area is built into one wall \u2014 she cooked a dinner for eight friends days after moving in \u2014 with an island that doubles as a table.One eye-catching item is a large wooden wall panel that opens to reveal a queen-size Murphy bed. Ms. Kudrav provides a demonstration, lowering the technological marvel and proudly demonstrating how two large pillows can be employed as a headboard.Rather than surrender space to a television, she plans to buy a projector that can display programs on a screen or wall and can be stored in a drawer.\u201cAt the beginning, I have to say, I was a little nervous about whether I could make such a small place work,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut this is where I wanted to live, and I feel I made the right decision.\u201d\u201cLook over here,\u201d he called out to a visitor. \u201cThis is my tiny kitchen with my tiny refrigerator, my tiny stove and tiny sink.\u201dThe tiny kitchen was aseptically clean, unsullied by edible substances.\u201cI eat out all the time,\u201d he says.A native of Montana, Mr. Demos, whose trim, muscular physique speaks to his earlier career as a Broadway dancer, resided for eight years in Oklahoma City, where he was the artistic director of the Lyric Theater of Oklahoma.

{"Headline": "How to Save Nigeria\u2019s Economy and Stop Corruption", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 The collapsed price of oil is putting pressure on oil exporters around the world, from Canada to Kuwait. But perhaps no country is less prepared to survive prices at about $30 a barrel than Nigeria, which until a few years ago relied heavily on petroleum exports for its revenue. While countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia have saved past oil profits for rainy days, Nigeria has no such insulation. What\u2019s worse is that Nigeria is especially dependent on imports of basic goods.The cracks are starting to show: While the official rate doesn\u2019t reflect it, Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is the world\u2019s worst performing this year.The economic troubles could hardly have come at a worse time. Last year, Nigerians elected Muhammadu Buhari as president after he ran on a zealous anti-corruption platform. Unfortunately, Mr. Buhari\u2019s insistence on maintaining the peg at the current official exchange rate is not only crippling production, it is also encouraging corruption. He should abandon it as soon as possible and allow the naira to devalue.Nigeria has pegged the naira to the dollar for decades, adjusting the exchange rate according to international supply and demand. But even as Nigeria\u2019s economy has faltered, since last spring the peg has remained fixed at around 198.5 naira to the dollar. This rate is being maintained at the president\u2019s insistence, undermining any notion of central bank independence.To keep the rate fixed, the central bank has to preserve its foreign currency reserves, a difficult task as oil export revenue has fallen. How does it do that? By making it more difficult for Nigerians to obtain hard currency at the official rate. Primarily, the central bank has restricted access to foreign currency to importers who can demonstrate that the goods they\u2019re bringing into Nigeria are necessary.But Nigerians are innovative. A large parallel currency exchange has taken shape, in which importers trade naira for dollars at up to twice the official rate. The trade is too blatant to be called a black market. Last month, for example, I saw several currency exchange businesses at the Lagos airport that offered 380 naira to the dollar. Nigerian newspapers even include reports of the unofficial exchange rate.The Buhari government hopes that the fixed exchange rate will prevent inflation. Yet inflation has risen sharply to the highest rates in almost five years. The prices of many imported goods have almost doubled, suggesting that they reflect the black market exchange rate rather than the official rate.I recently saw this problem firsthand when I visited one of the country\u2019s largest manufacturers of cardboard box packaging. Its production lines were either slowed or shut down. Thousands of employees were seeing their hours, and wages, cut back. In some cases, the company had been unable to import materials like labels. In other cases, the company\u2019s customers had run out of items to box.This is how bad policy turns a currency crisis into a recession.What\u2019s more, rationing foreign currency creates the wrong type of competition. As imports become more expensive, Nigeria\u2019s companies should be looking for new ways to produce with fewer imports. They\u2019re not. Instead, businessmen are trying to use their political networks to compel the central bank to sell them dollars at the low official rate, to deny dollars to their competitors, or both. The Economist recently reported that bank officials levy a 30 percent charge for the favor. Not only are these schemes a bad use of entrepreneurial cunning, they also undermine hopes for the corruption-free Nigeria this president promised.Mr. Buhari says that devaluing the naira would hurt too much, that the imports on which Nigerians depend would become expensive, and rising prices would damage households across society. Usually, the pain of devaluation comes with a silver lining of promoting exports. But Nigeria hardly exports anything other than oil and gas. In fact, it often can\u2019t produce what it needs for itself, even goods it should be exporting, like cereals and gasoline. In other words, as Mr. Buhari notes, devaluing the naira would bring about the worst effects of a weak currency, inflation, and provide none of the best, like increased exports.Mr. Buhari must be frustrated. His predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, enjoyed oil prices over $100 for most of his presidency and oversaw some of the highest government revenues in Nigeria\u2019s history. He also issued three bonds on international markets in favorable global capital markets. Conditions at the time were excellent for building Nigeria\u2019s domestic production capacity.Mr. Buhari\u2019s administration has proposed a sensible budget, issued plans for incentives to invest in agriculture and mining, and is seeking investors to build more energy infrastructure. But none of these plans will be possible if the government maintains an artificial exchange rate. If Mr. Buhari really wants to build credible and transparent institutions, he should start by giving the central bank the independence to manage the currency and foreign reserves and get it out of the business of deciding what goods can and cannot be imported, or which firms can obtain foreign currency.Mr. Buhari has loudly proclaimed his commitment to fighting corruption. But his view that he can protect Nigeria\u2019s economy from global macroeconomic headwinds through an exchange rate peg borders on superstition. He has been told that his anti-corruption campaign is not an economic policy, but he may be more interested to hear that his economic policy is a petri dish for corruption.Walter Lamberson is a senior project manager at Dalberg Global Development Advisors and an adviser to emerging market businesses and governments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFor years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\u2019s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWe hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.China\u2019s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\u201cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \u201cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\u201dAfter the shutdown of Apple\u2019s services, President Xi Jinping of China, who has led a crackdown on Western ideology, conducted a meeting on Tuesday in Beijing on China\u2019s restrictive Internet policies. China\u2019s top tech leaders, including Jack Ma, chairman of the e-commerce company Alibaba, and Ren Zhengfei, head of Huawei, were present at the meeting.\u201cChina must improve management of cyberspace and work to ensure high-quality content with positive voices creating a healthy, positive culture that is a force for good,\u201d a report by the state-run news service Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.Since the Snowden leaks, China\u2019s state media identified eight American companies that it has labeled guardian warriors and that it has said were too deeply established in the country\u2019s core industries such as energy, communications, education and military.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time.There have been some signs of trouble ahead. Mr. Xi has presided over a deep freeze on the Internet, increasing censorship and taking aim at online tools used to circumvent China\u2019s system of online filters, known as the Great Firewall. He has also added new policy tools to keep tabs on electronic communications. Mr. Xi heads a committee of top leaders set up to streamline tech and Internet policy and turn the country into a \u201ccyberpower.\u201dIn addition, the Chinese government proposed an antiterrorism law two years ago that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys \u2014 the codes that enable otherwise-scrambled information to be viewed \u2014 for security reasons. Though the language was ultimately dropped, analysts said the government wants to have access to all communications within China.The two Apple services that Chinese regulators shut down, iTunes Movies and the iBooks Store, compete directly with Chinese Internet companies\u2019 products. Beijing has recently added initiatives to support a sputtering economy with new emphasis on industries that require higher skills and command better profit margins, like the Internet.That push may eventually trickle down to other Apple services. Apple Pay, for example, competes with mobile payments systems from some of China\u2019s largest Internet companies: Alibaba and Tencent.In the longer term, China\u2019s tough line on foreign tech companies like Apple could have heavy consequences for the Chinese economy, Mr. Rosen said.\u201cAs surely as the tremendous welfare gains for China and its people from deepening links to global tech production, disassembling those connections is likely to entail a heavy economic loss,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Argentina Settled a Billion-Dollar Debt Dispute With Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byThe Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan has long been a location for secret diplomacy, but few meetings there would have seemed as unlikely as the one that took place one day in early December.In a hotel conference room, a top Argentine politician drank coffee with two hedge fund executives \u2014 a meeting that was nothing short of remarkable after more than a decade of bitter legal skirmishes between Argentina and a group of disgruntled debt holders who at one point seized an Argentine Navy ship. The previous Buenos Aires government reviled the hedge funds as \u201cvultures.\u201dLast week, Argentina successfully sold $16.5 billion in bonds to international investors, a record amount for any developing country. And on Friday, Elliott and the other bondholders finally received their reward in the form of billions of dollars in repayment, representing returns worth multiple times their original investments.\u201cToday, we have put a definitive close to this chapter,\u201d Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentina\u2019s economic minister, told an Argentine radio station on Friday.The negotiations that led to the deal were set in motion by the election in November of President Mauricio Macri, who ran on a promise to reignite Argentina\u2019s flailing economy. Striking a deal with the country\u2019s aggrieved bondholders was central to getting that done.How Argentina and the hedge funds were able to break the long stalemate and reach a deal in a matter of weeks is a story of furious back-channeling and clashes that nearly derailed an agreement. Details of those negotiations have emerged from interviews with eight people who were involved in those meetings, as well as court filings and emails reviewed by The New York Times. Many of those people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.There were moments when the talks nearly fell apart. Three days before a deal was signed with Elliott, Mr. Caputo, exasperated by a back-and-forth with bondholders over whether they would return government assets they had seized, emailed the court-appointed mediator: \u201cTHIS IS A JOKE; NO DEAL.\u201dThat mediator, Daniel Pollack \u2014 who had not previously met Mr. Pollock at Elliott \u2014 was appointed by the court in June 2014 and played a central role in the final negotiations.Indeed, hours before his December assignation with the Elliott executives, Mr. Caputo had been just a few blocks down Park Avenue at the offices of the McCarter & English law firm. There, he introduced himself to Mr. Pollack, a prominent trial lawyer best known for arguing two landmark mutual fund cases before the United States Supreme Court in 1979 and 1983.Mediating in closed-door negotiations, Mr. Pollack cajoled both sides, at times resorting to theatrical moves like getting a court order to summon Mr. Singer, the founder of Elliott, to his office.Mr. Pollack\u2019s rule of no pens and paper during crucial negotiations frustrated some, with two hedge fund managers complaining privately that the mediator was an obstacle to the settlement process.Others spoke highly of Mr. Pollack\u2019s ability to get a deal in a matter of weeks.\u201cYou have to give Dan Pollack immense credit for creating an environment where, if they wanted to, they could get together and have a discussion,\u201d said Michael Straus, a principal at Montreux Partners and one of the first in the group originally led by NML Capital, a unit of Elliott, to sign a deal.Despite the groundwork that had been laid, formal negotiations got off to a rocky start.At a news conference in Davos, President Macri had insisted that Argentina\u2019s proposal would be made public.So on Feb. 1, when Argentine officials presented an informal agreement to a group of six hedge funds \u2014 Elliott\u2019s NML Capital unit, Aurelius Capital Management, EM Ltd., Montreux Partners, Bracebridge Capital and Davidson Kempner \u2014 several people in the room loudly protested the public approach.But two of the firms, Montreux Partners and EM, accepted Argentina\u2019s proposal. EM\u2019s deal, which was signed by its lawyer, Kenneth E. Johns, had been written out on a piece of notepad paper.Argentina struck another deal that same week to pay $1.35 billion to a group of Italian investors who were holding defaulted bonds. The other four main bondholders instead submitted a document outlining their terms and the conditions of any agreement.Undeterred, on Feb. 5, Argentina publicly announced an offer to pay $6.5 billion to the holdout bondholders.\u201cAfter a 15-year legal battle we\u2019re going to agree to a long-form napkin?\u201d Mr. Pollock said in an interview, referring to the deal with Montreux Partners and explaining the initial reluctance. He added that he had a duty to his investors to negotiate something more secure.The core group of bondholders, led by NML, remained obstinate.In a recent interview, Mr. Pollack, the mediator, said that the bondholders had wanted to turn negotiations into a complex debt restructuring, while he argued that a business transaction would be simpler. The holdouts were deeply cynical, he recalled.Argentina\u2019s recent history was still fresh on their minds. The populist administration of Mr. Macri\u2019s predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, had an economy minister with Marxist leanings who lectured bondholders that they would never get more than 30 cents for every dollar of their bonds.\u201cIf you are at war long enough, it\u2019s very difficult to shift to a mode of peace,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.Concerned that they would not be able to get a deal with the conditions they wanted, one Elliott executive met with Mr. Mindlin on Feb. 17 in New York and expressed his concerns over dinner. The following day, Mr. Mindlin spoke with Mario Quintana, the secretary of the government\u2019s economic cabinet. Argentina representatives met with bondholders later that day.On Feb. 19, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who presided over the dispute in the courts, dealt a blow to the remaining holdouts by agreeing to lift an injunction that prevented Argentina from making any bond payments or raising new money.Two days earlier, Mr. Pollack, the mediator, requested that Judge Griesa sign an order summoning Mr. Pollock and Mr. Singer of Elliott to his offices.On Friday, Argentina paid all of the holdout creditors who had agreed to deals \u2014 a total of $9.3 billion, the economy ministry said. Elliott received $2.4 billion, a 392 percent return on the original value of the bonds, according to the ministry.Writing to Elliott employees hours later, Mr. Singer thanked them for \u201cpersisting through this lengthy, complicated and contentious process.\u201dAn article on Monday about the settlement between Argentina and a group of disgruntled debt holders referred incorrectly to the returns received by hedge funds holding defaulted bonds. They were in the hundreds of percentage points, not hundreds of times, their original investments.Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}

A new study finds that it works.Supported byDave Fleischer \u2014 a short, bald, gay, Jewish 61-year-old with bulging biceps and a distaste for prejudice \u2014 knocked on the front door of a modest home in a middle-class neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles. It was an enthusiastic knuckle-thump, the kind that arouses suspicion from dogs in yards halfway down the block but, crucially, can also be heard by humans watching cable news at high volume.If he had his way, Fleischer would knock on doors with a golf ball. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Mormons use,\u201d he said on this sunny, bird-chirping Saturday in February. Fleischer\u2019s staff at the Los Angeles-based Leadership Lab \u2014 which goes door to door to reduce bias against L.G.B.T. people, with a current focus on transgender discrimination \u2014 didn\u2019t take to the golf-ball suggestion, but Fleischer wanted me to know that he is \u201cnot opposed to stealing a good idea from the Mormons.\u201dA gray-haired Hispanic woman named Nancy cracked open the front door, though not enough to let her little dog eat our ankles. \u201cWe\u2019re out talking to voters about an important issue \u2014 \u201d Fleischer began, only to have Nancy excuse herself and walk away. I wasn\u2019t sure she would return; the last two voters he\u2019d met pleaded busyness. But after shooing the dog into another room, Nancy appeared in her doorway again. She smiled shyly and asked Fleischer, the Leadership Lab\u2019s director, how she could help him. Had he been completely honest, he might have said, \u201cI\u2019m here to make you less prejudiced. It could take awhile.\u201d But instead he began with a simple question: If she were to vote on whether to \u201cinclude gay and transgender people in nondiscrimination laws,\u201d would she be in favor or opposed?\u201cIn favor,\u201d she assured him. Fleischer asked her to rate that support on a scale from zero to 10. \u201cA 10,\u201d she said. \u201cI have friends who are gay.\u201dA typical canvassing conversation might have ended there. Nancy, it seemed, was a supporter \u2014 no need to worry about her. But Fleischer is wary of what he calls the \u201canti-discrimination declaration.\u201d At the Leadership Lab\u2019s two-hour pre-canvass training that morning, volunteers were warned about \u201cfake 10s,\u201d people who think of themselves as against discrimination \u2014 many of them Democrats \u2014 but who can nonetheless be swayed by emotion-based appeals that provoke prejudice and fear.At the door, Fleischer asked Nancy if she knew any transgender people. She didn\u2019t. He then did something few political consultants would advise: He introduced her to the opposition\u2019s favorite argument. He handed her a small video player, on which she watched a Baptist minister in Houston make the case about bathrooms. Fleischer then returned to his scale, asking Nancy what number felt right for her now. \u201cI know I\u2019m in favor of gays, because I\u2019ve worked with them and socialized with them,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re wonderful. But for transgenders? Give me a five.\u201dNancy wasn\u2019t the only person to significantly decrease her support after watching the video. Across the street, a man in his late 30s who said he was liberal and pro-L.G.B.T.-rights moved to a five from an eight, explaining that he was deeply worried about \u201cthe bathroom issue.\u201d The man\u2019s concern seemed informed by his experience in a New York City nightclub; he hinted at his discomfort standing at a urinal next to a drag queen. Nancy had no such seemingly relevant personal experiences, nor did she appear particularly concerned about bathroom safety. For her, the video seemed to clarify that Fleischer was specifically asking her about transgender people, a group she had no experience with and seemed to have little inherent empathy for. To get Nancy to a true 10 capable of withstanding opposition messaging, Fleischer needed to help her \u201ctap into her own empathy and connect emotionally to transgender people.\u201dBetsy Levy Paluck, an associate professor at Princeton who studies bias, believes the study will have broad implications for those in her field. \u201cWhat do social scientists know about reducing prejudice in the world? In short, very little,\u201d she writes in the same issue of Science, adding that the new study\u2019s results \u201cstand alone as a rigorous test of this type of prejudice-reduction intervention.\u201dFleischer is planning more interventions. Though he has devoted much of his political and community-organizing career to L.G.B.T. issues, he believes this kind of canvassing could change people\u2019s thinking on everything from abortion and gun rights to race-based prejudice. He also hopes it will usher in a new era of political persuasion. \u201cModern political campaigns have focused mostly on communicating with people who already agree with them and turning them out to vote,\u201d Fleischer says. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve learned by having real, in-depth conversations with people is that a broad swath of voters are actually open to changing their mind. And that\u2019s exciting, because it offers the possibility that we could get past the current paralysis on a wide variety of controversial issues.\u201dThe idea grew out of Fleischer\u2019s own experience as a \u201cJewish, liberal gay kid\u201d in Chillicothe, Ohio. He likes to say that he has been talking to people who disagree with him since he was 4. \u201cIf I would have only talked to people who agreed with me, I would have only talked to my mom and dad,\u201d he told me. \u201cInteracting with people different than me was a normal thing, and certainly not undesirable or scary. It\u2019s almost the opposite of growing up today in the age of Facebook and political polarization, where it\u2019s easy to always be among like-minded people, your self-isolation complete before you have your first beer.\u201dAt first, Fleischer and his team tried cerebral arguments and appeals to fairness in their doorway conversations with same-sex-marriage opponents who didn\u2019t express deep religious objections. \u201cThat failed miserably,\u201d he said. Eventually, the canvassers tried eliciting more emotional experiences. They urged voters to talk about anyone they knew who was gay or lesbian \u2014 and, more important, to speak about their own marriages. \u201cThat changed everything,\u201d Fleischer told me. \u201cMost people consider marriage the most important and meaningful thing they ever did. Talking about marriage brought up deep emotion. If marriage was the most valuable thing in their own life, wouldn\u2019t they also want their gay friends \u2014 or gay people \u2014 to experience it, too?\u201dThough Fleischer thought his new approach was working, he wanted to know whether the persuasion lasted. During a 2013 trip to New York City, he visited the Columbia Univer\u00adsity political-science professor Donald Green, whose experiments on voter behavior \u2014 including his findings that canvassing is a more effective mobilization tool than telephone calls or direct mail \u2014 partly inspired a focus on building a ground game, a strategy mastered by the Obama campaign.Green was skeptical that the canvassers were as persuasive as they thought they were. His previous research suggested that \u201cpeople don\u2019t change their mind very easily, and when they are persuaded to think differently, the effect is usually temporary,\u201d he told me. But he also knew that political persuasion had not been studied often. \u201cRemarkably, we don\u2019t know very much about what forms of campaign communications are most persuasive,\u201d he said. Green connected Fleischer with Michael LaCour, then a U.C.L.A. graduate student in political science and statistics, who said he could design a study to assess the long-term effectiveness of Leadership Lab canvassers at increasing support for same-sex marriage among voters in Los Angeles who had supported Prop 8. LaCour, joined late in the process by Green as a co-author, published the results in the December 2014 issue of Science. The study claimed to find that though both gay and straight canvassers were effective at the door, only voters contacted by gay canvassers remained persuaded nearly a year later.The study made international news and seemed to confirm what many gays and lesbians believed in their guts: that knowing a gay person is a powerful antidote to anti-gay bias. It also seemed to bolster the \u201ccontact hypothesis\u201d theory of prejudice reduction, which finds that personal contact decreases bias against a minority group. Previous research, though, including a study of teenagers in an Outward Bound program assigned to either mixed-race or all-white groups, suggested that lasting prejudice reduction happened after weeks of regular contact. LaCour appeared to be breaking new ground, showing that one brief but memorable interaction could reduce prejudice.Broockman and Kalla were intrigued by LaCour\u2019s findings and hoped to replicate it for an experiment measuring the Leadership Lab\u2019s transgender canvassing. But the more they analyzed LaCour\u2019s study design and results, the more problems they found. Yes, Leadership Lab volunteers had spoken to voters in Los Angeles about gay marriage. But when pressed, LaCour couldn\u2019t produce any evidence that he had conducted the follow-up surveys of voters that would have been essential to measuring canvassing\u2019s long-term influence. He also admitted to lying about having received funds for his study from several organizations, including the Ford Foundation.A shocked and embarrassed Green requested that Science retract the study; soon after, Princeton rescinded a teaching offer to LaCour. News of the retraction stunned Fleischer, who worried that the Leadership Lab\u2019s marriage canvassing would be tainted by association. He vowed to keep at it, but soon there was no need. When the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015, Fleischer and his team could turn their focus to the next L.G.B.T. battlefield: transgender rights.To test whether transphobia could be overcome during a face-to-face encounter, Broockman and Kalla measured a 2015 canvassing effort in Miami by volunteers from the Leadership Lab and SAVE, a local L.G.B.T. organization. The groups feared a backlash against a recent ordinance that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. The experiment divided voters into a \u201ctreatment\u201d group engaged in a conversation intended to reduce transgender prejudice and a \u201cplacebo\u201d group targeted with a conversation about recycling. Before the canvass conversations, both groups completed what they believed to be an unrelated online survey with dozens of social and political questions, including some designed to measure transgender prejudice. After the canvass, the groups filled out four follow-up surveys, up to three months later.Broockman and Kalla found that the treatment group was \u201cconsiderably more accepting of transgender people\u201d and that a single, approximately 10-minute conversation with a stranger \u201ccan markedly reduce prejudice for at least three months.\u201d Unlike LaCour\u2019s invented finding that the messenger matters more than the message, Broockman and Kalla found that both transgender and nontransgender canvassers were effective. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that the takeaway was that only gay people could persuade people about gay marriage,\u201d Broockman says about LaCour\u2019s retracted study. \u201cEveryone basically ignored the canvassing aspect, and that the message and the quality of the conversation at the door is what seems to matter.\u201dBroockman and Kalla point to Leadership Lab canvassers\u2019 ability to engage voters in two prejudice-reduction behaviors at the door: \u201cperspective taking\u201d (the ability to empathize with another\u2019s experience) and \u201cactive processing\u201d (deep or effortful thinking). Both were on display during many of the canvass conversations I observed, including the one with Nancy, the woman who moved to a five from a 10 after watching the opposition video.\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve thought about transgender people?\u201d Fleischer asked her soon after she backtracked.\u201cYeah, I would say so,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it exists, and I hear stories, and I see them on TV. But I don\u2019t have any friends like I do my gay friends.\u201dFleischer nodded and removed a picture of his friend Jackson from his wallet. \u201cFor me, I never had a transgender friend I was really close to until I was 56,\u201d he said, handing Nancy the picture. \u201cJackson grew up as a girl, but he knew even when he was 5 or 6 that he was really a boy. It was only in his 20s that he started to tell his folks the truth, and he started making the transition to living as a man. He\u2019s married to a woman now, and he\u2019s so much happier. And he can grow a better beard than I can!\u201dNancy laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing \u2014 they\u2019re happier when they come out, whenever everybody knows,\u201d she said. She seemed to be connecting Jackson\u2019s experience to that of her gay friends.\u201cRight, because otherwise you have the biggest secret in the world, and everyone thinks something about you that\u2019s not true,\u201d Fleischer said, before pivoting to a story about Jackson\u2019s being demeaned by a waiter in a restaurant. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing people mistreat Jackson. To me, protecting transgender people with these laws is just affirming that they\u2019re human.\u201d Fleischer then steered the conversation to Nancy\u2019s experiences with discrimination. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably had a time when people have judged you unfairly?\u201d he asked.\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Nancy said. Over the next few minutes, she recounted several instances of racism after moving to Los Angeles from Central America with her husband. Still, she didn\u2019t appear emotional in retelling the experiences. Fleischer wasn\u2019t surprised; people rarely feel safe enough at first to express deep hurt. It usually isn\u2019t until Fleischer opens up about his own experience \u2014 including feeling different in his small, conservative Ohio town \u2014 that voters feel safe to \u201cget vulnerable, too,\u201d he says. Nancy had mostly dismissed Fleischer\u2019s \u201chow did that make you feel?\u201d questions, but his personal story prompted a shift. As Fleischer returned to the discrimination she had faced, Nancy paused and said, \u201cIt felt terrible.\u201d A few minutes later, when he asked her if she saw a connection between \u201cyour experience and how you want to treat transgender people,\u201d she said she did. \u201cI see transgender people as the same as I see myself,\u201d Nancy told him. She ended a solid 10, a rating he was confident could survive opposition messaging.Knocking on a stranger\u2019s door is scary, and a lot of that morning\u2019s training session was spent boosting the confidence of first-time canvassers. The leaders worked to keep the mood relaxed and optimistic. Fleischer does improv in his spare time, and the training sometimes felt like a well-oiled comedy routine. When the subject turned to potentially awkward initial encounters with voters, the Leadership Lab staff member Laura Gardiner and the longtime volunteer Nancy Williams (who is transgender) did some front-door role-playing.\u201cHi, my name is Laura, and I\u2019m with the Leadership Lab,\u201d Gardiner told Williams, channeling a shy first-time canvasser. \u201cDo you have a few minutes today to talk about transgender people?\u201dWilliams played a busy voter. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to teach my hamster to speak Finnish today.\u201dGardiner turned to the volunteers. \u201cWe want to avoid asking for permission,\u201d she told them. \u201cJust dive in. Treat it like the most normal thing in the world. Like, of course we\u2019re on your doorstep on a Saturday talking about transgender issues!\u201dMoments later, Williams reminded the volunteers to be open and nonjudgmental. \u201cWe\u2019re asking voters not to discriminate, to be less prejudiced, and we need to walk that walk,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means not making assumptions based on the voter\u2019s age, race or their religion. Some folks may have a crucifix on the door. That doesn\u2019t tell you about the person inside.\u201dOn this particular day, volunteers would be canvassing in a predominantly black neighborhood, so Gardiner reminded them to be sensitive to experiences of race-based discrimination. \u201cWhat an African-American person has faced because of their race is not the same as the discrimination that I\u2019ve faced for being bisexual, or that my friend has faced for being transgender,\u201d she told the group. \u201cBut there is a similarity, because at the root there\u2019s the feeling of being judged, of having someone make assumptions about you, and that does not feel good.\u201dBut sometimes the gulf between the volunteer and the voter can seem insurmountable. After the first canvass I attended, the Leadership Lab project manager Ella Barrett seemed uncharacteristically sullen. When I asked how her day went, she shook her head and recounted a series of disheartening conversations with voters she couldn\u2019t persuade. In one, a social worker (\u201ca social worker!\u201d Barrett marveled) announced that being transgender is a mental illness; in another, a man matter-of-factly said he hoped to develop a \u201cstraight pill\u201d to change gay people.Though not all voters would engage emotionally, I was surprised by how many did. Canvassers often had to politely extricate themselves after 20 minutes \u2014 voters were sad to see them go. \u201cIf only I could have 10 minutes with Ted Cruz,\u201d Fleischer said once. He was only half joking. Fleischer has an unwavering confidence in his ability to persuade most people to be \u201cmore empathetic and less prejudiced,\u201d and his optimism is shared by progressive groups who train with him. The day before one canvass, representatives from an animal rights group told me they hoped to better understand how to help people connect emotionally to animal welfare.Fleischer is especially interested in learning whether deep canvassing can affect people\u2019s thinking on two issues \u2014 racial prejudice and abortion rights. Beginning in 2014, the Leadership Lab teamed up with Planned Parenthood to canvass in support of pro-choice policies. Though the abortion debate is less obviously rooted in prejudice than transgender discrimination, Fleischer and his canvassers noticed that many voters reacted negatively to a short video of a middle-aged woman recounting having an abortion when she was 22. People would often be \u201cvery judgmental\u201d of the woman on the video or any woman who had had an abortion, Fleischer said. To combat that, canvassers tried to get voters to reflect about challenging decisions they had made in their own sex lives or relationships \u2014 or times they were judged harshly. Volunteers also encouraged people to talk about anyone they were close to who had an abortion.Eager to know if his abortion canvassing was persuasive, Fleischer asked Broockman and Kalla to measure it. But the researchers found that the persuasion attempts had \u201czero effect,\u201d Broockman said. Still, Fleischer isn\u2019t ready to give up. \u201cBecause abortion is such a politically polarized issue,\u201d he said, \u201cit could just be that we have to get better at making voters trust us and open up.\u201d But it could also be that the Leadership Lab\u2019s transgender canvassing success is an anomaly. While a discussion of transgender rights can trigger deeply ingrained feelings about sex and gender roles, the issue is also a fairly recent political consideration for many people. Melissa Michelson, a political-science professor at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif., who studies voter mobilization and public attitudes on L.G.B.T. issues, told me that changing people\u2019s minds about transgender rights might simply come down to \u201cwhich side gets to a voter\u2019s door first to do the persuading.\u201dJeremy Bird, a Hillary Clinton adviser who was the national field director for Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election effort, told me that his team conducted a number of experiments to try to have a greater impact when canvassing. \u201cWe studied everything, from the kinds of conversations we should be having to the characteristics that made a voter persuadable,\u201d he says. \u201cWe trained our volunteers to connect with voters at the door on a personal and values level, not to talk at them with scripted talking points. I think people don\u2019t talk enough about the focus on persuasion we had, because the story line became, \u2018Oh, they won because turnout was so high.\u2019\u2009\u201dBecky Bond, a Bernie Sanders campaign adviser and an admirer of the Leadership Lab\u2019s work, says that the Sanders campaign has focused on marshaling the enthusiasm of volunteers to persuade people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a campaign that\u2019s put more volunteers on the ground in a primary season to have quality, face-to-face conversations with voters,\u201d she told me.Still, the Leadership Lab is unusual in its focus on quality over quantity. A typical state or national campaign, even one with a ground-game focus, doesn\u2019t want its volunteers spending 10 or 15 minutes at a door. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about having real, quality conversations with voters, you can\u2019t bring that to scale without a really large number of people,\u201d says Tim Saler, a Republican strategist at Grassroots Targeting, which works to mobilize and persuade voters. \u201cTechnology has helped a bit with the scale challenge, but there\u2019s always the question: Do you knock on as many doors as possible, or do you knock on fewer doors and have potentially more fruitful interactions?\u201dThere\u2019s also a lot that can go wrong when fresh-faced canvassers descend on unfamiliar neighborhoods. In 2004, for example, some 3,500 orange-hat-wearing Howard Dean supporters (many bused in from around the country) managed to annoy Iowa voters days before the state\u2019s Democratic caucus. \u201cThe curse of the orange hats,\u201d read a headline in Salon. There are other potential problems. \u201cCanvassers can get mugged, they can get lost, they can get attacked by wild geese,\u201d Michelson told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if they\u2019re at McDonald\u2019s on their iPhone, and you can\u2019t always be sure what they\u2019re saying to voters. That lack of control scares campaigns. It\u2019s much easier to put all your volunteers in a cozy phone bank where everyone gets to hang out and eat pizza.\u201dThough Fleischer prefers talking to voters face to face, he isn\u2019t opposed to sequestering volunteers in a phone bank to help L.G.B.T. activists in another state. In 2014, Fleischer and his team modified their canvassing work to persuade and mobilize voters by phone. Leadership Lab volunteers spoke with 3,330 residents in Pocatello, Idaho, a small, heavily Mormon city facing a ballot referendum that would have reversed a local nondiscrimination ordinance protecting gay and transgender people. The effort helped defeat the anti-L.G.B.T. ballot measure by a mere 80 votes.Several of Riley\u2019s conversations proved poignant. She told voters about her own transgender child, Jie, now an adult. She recounted that when Jie was 3, the toddler responded to a question about possible Christmas presents by asking: \u201cCould Santa turn a girl into a boy?\u201dRiley\u2019s devotion to Jie had a visible impact on several voters, including the mother of a 7-year-old girl. The woman eventually told Riley that she had voted against gay marriage in California, but that she now regretted that choice. \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d she said. On the issue of transgender rights, the woman seemed mostly supportive but stopped at a nine. She said she was trying to evolve on the issue, though. As Riley prepared to leave for the next house on the block, the woman called out. \u201cGive me a few years, and I know I\u2019ll be a 10!\u201dBenoit Denizet-Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine and an assistant professor at Emerson College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Stanches Flow of Money Out of the Country, Data Suggests", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byDoubts remain about Beijing\u2019s ability to rev up slowing growth and patch up its frayed financial system. But new data suggests China has stanched, at least for now, the flow of money that had been pouring out of the country.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.The growth signals a reversal from the winter, when worries about China\u2019s growth and investor bets that the Chinese currency would weaken spurred outflows of money, contributing to sell-offs in markets around the world.The shift now stems mainly from weakness in the dollar, but also from China\u2019s increasingly aggressive efforts to keep its people from sending money out of the country. Stability in the reserves and even a slight increase in the value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, against the dollar also indicate a shift in strategy, economists and bankers say, as Chinese officials have more forcefully spoken out about shoring up their country\u2019s currency and have taken efforts to help economic growth.What remains unclear is whether China will again start hemorrhaging money to the rest of the world if global financial markets deteriorate once more or if skepticism over the Chinese economy intensifies.As expectations of a short-term decline in the renminbi faded, Chinese investors mostly stopped rushing to move money out of the country. The People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, said on Thursday that the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves had climbed $10.3 billion during March.The reserves had declined $28.6 billion in February, $99.5 billion in January and $107.9 billion in December, an outflow that was fed by a gradual devaluation of the renminbi from mid-December through early January. Investors were moving their money out of China then for fear that it would otherwise have less buying power in dollars.\u201cThe capital outflow is very much linked to renminbi depreciation expectations,\u201d Shen Jianguang, a China economist at Mizuho Securities, said.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China\u2019s central bank, and other Chinese policy makers helped stabilize the country\u2019s reserves by making a series of public statements at the end of February saying that they saw no need for a further fall in the renminbi. They also hinted that China could do more to support flagging economic growth, although at the expense of adding to the country\u2019s huge overhang of corporate debt.As net outflows of money slowed in March, the total value of the reserves in dollars rose slightly, to $3.21 trillion. That appeared to be because part of the reserves are held in euro-denominated and yen-denominated bonds, and the euro and yen strengthened against the dollar last month.Without currency valuation effects, the reserves would have fallen $20 billion to $30 billion \u2014 still less than in previous months without the valuation effect, economists estimated.Many economists and traders say they believe that China will try to prevent a broad fall in the renminbi through early autumn. A weaker renminbi risks making China\u2019s currency an election-year issue in the United States. The renminbi is also set on Oct. 1 to join a basket of currencies determined by the International Monetary Fund, a move Beijing is unlikely to imperil.President Obama and other world leaders are scheduled to gather in early September in Hangzhou, China, for the annual Group of 20 summit meeting.\u201cVery few people think there will be a significant devaluation before the G-20,\u201d said Michael Levi, a China specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThey\u2019ve staked a lot of prestige on the G-20, and I don\u2019t think they want it to be a fight over currency.\u201dOne way China has stabilized the currency in the past couple of months has been to place large bets in currency markets that the renminbi will stay close to its current exchange rate. Those bets have largely offset big bets by hedge funds that China will allow the renminbi to decline further.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.After months of pressure from the International Monetary Fund, China\u2019s central bank disclosed that the traded value of its contracts betting on the continued strength of the renminbi was $28.9 billion. By contrast, China had only $2.44 billion worth of contracts effectively betting on renminbi weakness.The twin questions still facing China involve whether anything could happen before the United States presidential elections in early November to destabilize the renminbi, and whether the overall Chinese economy will be strong enough by then for Chinese households and companies to want to keep their money at home.If the dollar stops weakening in global currency markets before November and starts strengthening again, that would once more make the dollar more attractive to hold than the renminbi. And if China\u2019s banking system encounters a sharp rise in defaults on its huge loans to troubled state-owned enterprises, that would also hurt the renminbi.Advertisement"}

The company will anchor Univision\u2019s new Fusion Media Group, to be distributed on a mix of digital and traditional media. The group includes Univision\u2019s stake in the El Rey cable network as well as the digital properties The Root, The Onion, A.V.

Starting immediately, Univision will take over distribution, advertising sales and editorial control of Fusion.\u201cFully integrating Fusion into our portfolio closely aligns with our desire to engage with our growing audience wherever they are, whenever they want and in their language of preference,\u201d said Randy Falco, chief executive of Univision Communications. \u201cF.M.G. is extremely well positioned to reach this young, diverse audience at scale and with passion, irreverence and authenticity.\u201dUnivision was expected to conduct an initial public offering late last summer, and that is still paused. Since then, the share prices for major media companies have been hit hard because of broader concerns about the future of the television business, making it a tough time to take a company public.Since its start almost three years ago, Fusion has struggled to define its identity and deliver large audiences. The cable channel started while television networks are battling sharp ratings declines, especially among younger viewers.The distribution for Fusion\u2019s cable networks was nearly 40 million households, according to a note to staff sent in October by Isaac Lee, Fusion\u2019s chief news and digital officer. In December news organizations reported that Disney was in talks to sell its stake to Univision.The website, meanwhile, was originally aimed at young Latinos who spoke English, but over time it shifted to target young viewers of all ethnicities.

{"Headline": "Saudi Threat to Sell U.S. Assets Could Hurt, but Mostly the Saudis", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If Saudi Arabia follows through on its recent threat to sell off its investments in the United States, the financial maneuver could be painful \u2014 mostly for Saudi Arabia.The kingdom has pumped some of its oil profits into the United States, acquiring billions of dollars in Treasury securities and investments that include a giant oil refinery in Port Arthur, Tex., and a $10 million stake in an Arkansas company that makes industrial lubricants.Such a fire sale might roil financial markets or cause problems for companies that lost funding, but experts say it is hard to imagine a significant or lasting impact on the American economy. Global investors continue to shovel money into the United States; if the Saudis go, the experts say, others will take their place.\u201cThe world is desperate to lend money to anybody that\u2019s credible at very low rates, so I don\u2019t see this as an issue at all,\u201d said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University who says that foreign divestment \u2014 by China or other nations \u2014 poses little threat to the American economy.However, a sell-off could be self-defeating for Saudi Arabia.

Last month, Aramco announced a deal to take full ownership of the refinery, along with a network of 26 distribution terminals and the rights to sell fuel under the Shell brand name across a large swath of the United States, including Texas.The Saudis might be able to sell the refinery, but they would lose a strategic investment.There is no comprehensive public accounting of the Saudi government\u2019s investments in the United States, although American officials say $750 billion is a plausible figure.And the single largest chunk of that money is probably invested in Treasury securities.The Treasury Department says a group of 15 \u201coil-exporting\u201d nations including Saudi Arabia held a total of $281 billion in Treasuries in February, deposited either in the United States or in one of the 15 countries. That number may actually understate the Saudi government\u2019s holdings, however, because it does not include Treasury debt the kingdom may have deposited in other countries like Switzerland.Regardless, it is clear that Saudi Arabia\u2019s holdings are only a small share of the roughly $14 trillion in Treasury securities not held by the federal government. There\u2019s little doubt the Saudis could sell all of it, gradually, without causing a ripple in the market, experts say.\u201cI would guess that any reserve manager would be able to find a way to sell this amount in under a year without much of a ripple,\u201d said Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor of international economics at Brandeis University.The Saudis could roil markets by offering discounts and selling quickly. But again, they would suffer most from such a sale.Their departure from the Treasury market would tend to put upward pressure on interest rates. Fewer buyers for the same pool of assets makes sellers try harder, and rates on Treasuries serve as a benchmark for a wide range of other borrowing costs. But the Federal Reserve could calibrate its management of interest rates to take account of those effects, essentially insulating the domestic economy.Louis Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, described the likely consequences as \u201clots of short-term technical impacts, depending on how fast they did it, rather than fundamental problems.\u201d He noted that large movements in foreign Treasury holdings had become a fact of life for the Treasury market.The share of Treasuries held by foreign investors has climbed sharply over the last few decades, leading some experts to caution that any flagging of foreign appetites could increase borrowing costs both for the federal government and for American consumers and businesses.There is little danger from Treasury sales by a specific country, so long as foreign demand in aggregate remains strong. A broader sell-off could be more dangerous, but those worries have ebbed. The demand for Treasuries has seemed insatiable in recent years.Still, Francis E. Warnock, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on international economics, said there was a still a long-term risk.\u201cIf the Saudis do it, others might do it as well,\u201d Mr. Warnock said. \u201cTo me that\u2019s the bigger issue. If we\u2019re in a world where foreign governments think more carefully about holding U.S. assets, then we\u2019re in a very different world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britons Will Be Poorer if They Leave E.U., Government Asserts", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byThe release of the publication by the Treasury, complete with complex algebraic calculations, is an important moment before a referendum, to take place June 23, on whether Britain should end more than four decades of integration and quit the 28-nation bloc.On Monday, the government put a number on that claim, asserting that, under one midrange situation, annual economic output would be 4,300 pounds, around $6,100, lower per household if Britain left than if it stayed in the bloc.In any event, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said at a speech in Bristol, England, that the country \u201cwould be permanently poorer if it left the European Union\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019d trade less, do less business and receive less investment.\u201dMr. Osborne, who with Prime Minister David Cameron is campaigning for Britons to vote to remain, added: \u201cThe price would be paid by British families. Wages would be lower, and prices would be higher.\u201dThe release of the document highlights the quickening tempo of the referendum campaign, which officially began last week.And it precedes a visit to Britain this week by President Obama, who is expected, if asked, to endorse continued British membership in the bloc but to note that it is a decision for British voters.Advocates of remaining in the bloc say they believe the economic warnings will prove decisive. The Treasury document outlines the impact on Britain under three main situations, depending on the terms of trade Britain would negotiate after leaving the European common market.In the first of those, Britain would participate in the European Economic Area, like Norway, which is not a member of the European Union but which pays for access to Europe\u2019s single market and accepts the free movement of labor and capital. Under this situation, average annual output per household would be \u00a32,600 lower after 15 years, the report says.Under a bilateral trade agreement \u2014 like the ones the European Union has with Canada, Switzerland and Turkey \u2014 the reduction would be \u00a34,300, the Treasury found.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dIn the worst case, if Britain relied solely on the trading rules laid down by the World Trade Organization, as Russia or Brazil do, the amount would be \u00a35,200, according to the report.\u201cIt\u2019s a complete fantasy to claim we could negotiate some other deal, where we have access to the E.U.\u2019s single market but don\u2019t have to accept the costs and obligations of E.U. membership,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in his speech. \u201cOther member states have made it very clear in recent weeks that\u2019s not on offer \u2014 and how could it be? How could other European countries give us a better deal than they have given themselves?\u201dMs. Leadsom told the BBC that the Treasury analysis ignored the benefits of increased trade with non-European nations, which, she argued, would be possible outside the European Union. She also added that it had failed to take into account the economic advantages of being free of burdensome regulations from Brussels.The publication follows warnings that, were Britain to leave the bloc, its negotiations with continental partners may not be smooth.Speaking on Sunday, the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said if Britain voted to leave, the European Union would have to take a tough stance in the negotiations that followed, to set an example.\u201cWe have to be very clear that Brexit will have consequences; otherwise, that is the beginning of the dismantling,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cEverybody who disagrees on one or two points will decide to do the same.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The unruly Republican brawl flatters Mr. Obama\u2019s temperate demeanor by comparison, while increasing the odds that his party can hold on to the White House in November and safeguard his legacy.One by one, mainstream Republican candidates reflecting the party establishment\u2019s modern pro-trade consensus have fallen. Donald J. Trump, who calls the accord a \u201cterrible deal,\u201d vanquished them in part by rallying blue-collar Republicans behind his message that international trade was to blame for economic problems.Mr. Trump\u2019s top challenger, Ted Cruz, reversed course to oppose the \u201ctrade promotion authority\u201d that let the Obama administration complete negotiations.The only remaining Republican who backs the deal, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, has been mathematically eliminated from a first-ballot nomination at the Republican convention.The blows have also come from fellow Democrats, cheered on by union allies.As Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Hillary Clinton praised the trade agreement as \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for lowering tariffs and other trade barriers while protecting workers and the environment.After leaving that job, she watched former colleagues \u2014 many of them allies from her husband\u2019s administration \u2014 complete the negotiations.But trade advocates always struggle to reassure voters that overall economic benefits, in the form of lower consumer prices and increased exports, outweigh lost jobs, shuttered factories and businesses buffeted by imports. Anxieties inflamed by the campaign have made that even harder.The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, remains committed to trade expansion. \u201cAmerica should be at the table, writing the rules of the global economy instead of China,\u201d he said in a recent interview, echoing Mr. Obama\u2019s defense of the trade deal.Advocates, who include the United States Conference of Mayors as well as financially powerful business lobbies, still see a window for victory.John Engler, the president of the Business Roundtable, which represents executives at some of America\u2019s largest companies, points toward May \u2014 after the big Rust Belt primaries have concluded but before the summer political conventions \u2014 as the point when legislative preparations for the trade deal\u2019s approval can accelerate.Final approval could occur in a postelection session of Congress, before the new president takes office.

{"Headline": "Rodrigo Duterte and Other Candidates Seeking to Lead Philippines Tap Into Aquino Fatigue", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byMANILA \u2014 Rodrigo Duterte had the crowd with him. The Philippine presidential candidate was telling a recent rally about a prison riot in 1989 in the southern city where he is mayor, and was mayor at the time.Speaking with the cadences of a stand-up comic, he recalled how a 36-year-old Australian missionary was taken hostage, raped and murdered, and how he reacted when he saw her body.\u201cShe looks like a beautiful American actress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a waste. They lined up and raped her. I was angry because she was raped. That\u2019s one thing. But she was so beautiful. The mayor should have been first.\u201dThe crowd erupted with laughter.It was the candidate in characteristic mode: speaking bluntly and breaking the rules of politics and polite society. But many others are not laughing.Mr. Duterte, who has advocated vigilante killings of suspected criminals, boasted about his sexual conquests and insulted Pope Francis, is the front-runner in opinion polls among dozens of candidates to succeed President Benigno S. Aquino III.Mr. Duterte, who apologized on Tuesday for his comment about rape, is emphasizing his law-and-order views and positioning himself as a political outsider who is going to shake up the establishment.Mr. Aquino has overseen nearly six years of strong economic growth and a good-governance agenda that ratings agencies and international organizations say has made the Philippines less corrupt than in decades.But the leading candidates before the voting on May 9 have put the fate of Mr. Aquino\u2019s legacy in question. Analysts note that many voters have grown tired of what they perceive as an indecisive and ineffective administration on matters that directly affect people\u2019s lives.The climate of voter dissatisfaction has buoyed candidates like Mr. Duterte and Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., the leading candidate for vice president. (In the Philippines, the vice president is elected separately from the president, and often the two are political opponents.)Mr. Marcos\u2019s father, the country\u2019s former dictator, was accused of plundering billions from its coffers. The son speaks nostalgically on the campaign trail of his father\u2019s era, when he says the Philippines was more successful and orderly. Both he and Mr. Duterte promise strong, decisive leadership that some say sounds like a return to dictatorship, according to Richard Heydarian, a political-science professor at De La Salle University in Manila.\u201cWhat is at stake here,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said, \u201cisn\u2019t Aquino\u2019s legacy only, but the whole democratic system that supplanted the Marcos dictatorship.\u201dCritics of Mr. Aquino note that ordinary people do not feel the benefit of a ratings upgrade or a steady growth in gross domestic product. Despite six years of relative prosperity, thousands of Filipinos still leave the country every month to work in often dangerous and degrading jobs in the Middle East because they cannot find jobs at home. Workers who do have jobs at home often find themselves commuting four or five hours a day because of the crippling traffic in Manila and other large cities.Mr. Aquino has received accolades from the World Bank and others for increasing tax collections, but critics of his administration say the greater revenue has not translated into improved infrastructure.The country\u2019s main commuter train in Manila often breaks down, forcing people to exit on dangerous, elevated tracks, and it has been known to catch fire while moving or have its doors fly open. The country\u2019s main airport, where sections of the roof have fallen on passengers and which has been rated one of the world\u2019s worst, recently endured a nearly six-hour power outage that left travelers sweltering in the dark because officials had failed to maintain backup generators.Running a close second to Mr. Duterte is Grace Poe, a senator, and the daughter of one of the country\u2019s most popular movie stars, who had to renounce her United States citizenship in order to seek office. She has cast herself as a populist but also as a young, fresh face in politics not tainted by scandal.Jejomar Binay, the current vice president, is another contender. For more than a decade he was mayor of Makati, where many of the country\u2019s major corporations are based, and he is credited with bringing prosperity to the city. But he has also been the subject of multiple corruption allegations that he says were fabricated by the Aquino government, which his pro-business campaign habitually denigrates.Mr. Aquino\u2019s handpicked successor, the former interior secretary Mar Roxas, is running on a platform of replicating the current administration\u2019s policies, and he is trailing in the polls. Mr. Roxas is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and worked as an investment banker in New York before returning to the Philippines in 1993. He has served as trade secretary, senator and congressman. He is the grandson of the first president of the independent Philippines, Manuel Roxas, but he is seen by some voters as disconnected from the country\u2019s poor.Among supporters of Mr. Aquino\u2019s comparatively soft-spoken approach to governance, Mr. Duterte\u2019s divisive statements have created the most alarm. But one analyst noted that his comments are unreliable as indicators of what his policies as president would be.\u201cWhat you hear during the campaign shouldn\u2019t be take that seriously,\u201d said Ramon C. Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, based in Manila. \u201cThese comments are designed to get votes.\u201dMr. Casiple said that although Mr. Duterte\u2019s comments could be outrageous, many of the policies he put in place in Davao City, where he is mayor, had made it easier to do business there and had improved people\u2019s lives. The candidate has also engaged expert advisers and could be expected to do the same as president, Mr. Casiple said.All four of the leading candidates recognize the importance of the economic resurgence of the Philippines, and none of them have put forward proposals to dismantle the policies of the Aquino administration that relate to governance and economy policy, he said. The candidates are also promising to do a better job of spreading economic benefits to the poor, he said.\u201cI am confident, no matter who is elected, the basic economic policies will not be touched, particularly those that have led to steady economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to those policies, I don\u2019t think anyone wants to rock the boat.\u201dYet there remains widespread outrage over Mr. Duterte\u2019s rape remark. Although it is not clear if his supporters will abandon him on Election Day, many say the comment proved he was unfit for office.\u201cMayor Duterte, it is not O.K. to disrespect women,\u201d said Aurora Javate de Dios, executive director of the Women and Gender Institute at Miriam College in Quezon City. \u201cEven if they disagree with you, it is not O.K. to violate a woman\u2019s dignity, whatever their situation in life is. It is not O.K. to make jokes about rape victims. You victimize them over and over with every joke you make about their tragedy.\u201dAn article on April 20 about Rodrigo Duterte, the front-runner in the Philippine presidential election, misstated, in some editions, the political status of another candidate, Grace Poe. She is a senator, not a former senator. (Mr. Duterte won the election on May 9.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma Must Go", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCAPE TOWN \u2014 On Thursday, the 11 judges of South Africa\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that President Jacob G. Zuma had broken his oath of office. Mr. Zuma, the court found, had used his position to enrich himself and his family improperly, and had refused to abide by an earlier finding against him from the constitutionally mandated public protector. He had thus, said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, \u201cfailed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.\u201dThe matter had been brought to the court by the two major opposition parties, the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters and the right-of-center Democratic Alliance. They sought to compel the president to repay the state for nonessential spending on his private residence at Nkandla.In an address to the nation, Mr. Zuma responded that he respected the Constitution and the judgment; that he had acted \u201cin good faith\u201d in his faulty interpretation of the public protector\u2019s powers; and that he had been poorly advised regarding the overspending on his house. He pledged to repay the money, and apologized for the \u201cconfusion and frustration\u201d he had caused \u2014 though not for his unconstitutional actions.Yet it was not the self-enrichment (the precise extent of which is yet to be determined) that outraged South Africans so much as the lengths to which Mr. Zuma went to avoid accounting for it, and thus tried to sidestep checks on the abuse of executive power.Since he came to power in 2008, Mr. Zuma has combined a Putinesque mastery of the darker arts of statecraft with insouciance toward anything beside his own enrichment and impunity. In December, Mr. Zuma fired his respected finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, for opposing questionable deals that would enrich Zuma cronies further. In the resulting market instability, the country\u2019s economy lost billions of dollars.Then, several respected members of his party, the African National Congress, came forward with allegations that an influential business family, the Guptas, had offered them cabinet posts on behalf of the president, in return for favors. At that point, Mr. Zuma\u2019s critics in the party began to assert themselves. Now the highest court in the land has wounded him further, and also censured the A.N.C.-dominated Parliament for failing to check the leader\u2019s abuses.South Africans can take heart from the judiciary\u2019s resolve against corruption and autocracy, but it is also a devastating indictment of post-apartheid governance. The judgment resets South African democracy to the precepts established by the 1996 Constitution during the presidency of Nelson Mandela.That Constitution called for a public protector, a watchdog with real teeth, to investigate complaints about the abuse of state power. In 2009, Mr. Zuma appointed to the position Thuli Madonsela, a lawyer and A.N.C. member who turned out to be a fearless crusader against corruption.When she found against Mr. Zuma over the Nkandla affair, however, the president simply ignored her, and set up his own inquiries to \u201csecond-guess\u201d her, as the court put it. Such was the ruling party\u2019s contempt for taxpayers that the police minister declared a chicken run to be a vital security feature of the president\u2019s home, and his swimming pool a fire precaution.Chief Justice Mogoeng is an evangelical lay preacher, and he reached for the Bible to explain in his ruling the public protector\u2019s role. Ms. Madonsela was, he said, the embodiment of impoverished ordinary people who do not have access to justice, \u201ca biblical David\u201d who represented the public against \u201cthe most powerful and very well-resourced Goliath\u201d of official corruption.Such language draws South Africans back to the struggle against apartheid. \u201cThe unchecked abuse of state power,\u201d the chief justice reminded us, \u201cwas virtually institutionalized during the apartheid era.\u201dMr. Zuma himself went to jail and into exile during that fight; now, he has been found guilty of institutionalizing similar abuse. It is hard to see how he can stay in office.The opposition parties have begun impeachment proceedings against him, but that strategy will fail: The A.N.C. has an outright majority in Parliament and tends to settle issues behind closed doors. The party could fire Mr. Zuma (as it did his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, in 2008), but after the Constitutional Court judgment, officials insisted that the party would do no such thing, to avoid tearing itself apart.Keeping him in power, though, could have the same effect. Mr. Zuma secured control of the A.N.C. through intricate networks of patronage, but with local government elections due later in the year, a critical mass of his colleagues are finally viewing him as a liability. While Mr. Zuma remains popular in rural areas, especially his Zulu heartland, he is widely loathed in the cities. A powerful group of A.N.C. veterans, too, has called on him to go.With Mr. Zuma seemingly determined to hold onto power, the Economic Freedom Fighters\u2019 leader, Julius Malema, has threatened mass protests, violent if need be, to force him to quit. Despite such populist militancy, however, Mr. Malema has also now found success with a different kind of activism \u2014 initiating the Constitutional Court case. After the ruling, he waved a pocket-size copy of the Constitution at reporters, calling it \u201cour bible.\u201d He exclaimed, \u201cWe must all live by this book!\u201dIt remains to be seen how Mr. Malema \u2014 the leading beneficiary, politically, of last week\u2019s judgment \u2014 will reconcile his insurrectionary instincts with constitutionalism. For now, we South Africans who are committed to nonviolence and the democratic aspirations of the Mandela era have little choice but to join Mr. Malema in the streets. We will, at least, be asserting the agency that the Constitution vested in us, and that the court affirmed last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Media Is Tested When Social Platforms Come to Town", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBitsFacebook now hosts articles created by outside publishers, as well as videos and live broadcasts. Snapchat, with its Discover product, has created a sort of online media in miniature, with TV, newspaper and magazine companies angling to have a channel on the platform. And, of course, media companies publish constantly to Instagram and Twitter, amassing giant audiences.Mr. Hagiu spoke at length with The New York Times about what changes when a platform comes to town, and what it might mean for online media. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity.Would you define a publication as a multisided marketplace?Yes \u2014 we can say it\u2019s a two-sided platform, if we count the two sides as being the readers on one side and the advertisers on the other. Now, there\u2019s a separate question \u2014 we can talk about the \u201cthird side,\u201d which would be the writers.Something like a Tumblr or Medium \u2014 a place where people can just post? Yes, where there\u2019s clearly a direct interaction, and there\u2019s a lot more control by the two sides \u2014 it\u2019s truly on the platform, not a lot of control exerted by the publication as an aggregator.How would you then describe, in similar terms, what a company like Facebook is \u2014 or a company like Snapchat?Facebook, I always say it\u2019s at least a four-sided platform. They have users, they have advertisers, they have third-party application developers, and then finally they have websites that use the Facebook Connect system \u2014 which is to say that you can log in with your Facebook credentials.Where does a company that is producing professional video or journalism for Facebook \u2014 publishing those directly on Facebook and getting some kind of revenue \u2014 fit in?So, basically they\u2019re adding one extra side, which we can call \u201cpremium content publishers,\u201d broadly. It makes sense, and it\u2019s very similar to the transformation that YouTube has gone through. They went from having pretty much one side \u2014 when they started off, for the first few years, everyone was a user. As a user you could watch videos or post videos. But everyone was the same. Sometimes I watch, sometimes I post; some people just watch, some people just post. But they are all the same users. Now they\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated, with advertising and revenue sharing, and with professional video producers.If a publication-style business becomes a participant in a marketplace like Facebook, what has changed for it?This has been an ongoing concern. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an established company, and now there\u2019s a multisided platform in your business, what happens? And say you have to play on that multisided platform, because they\u2019re big and everyone else is playing, so you need to get on top of it. The concern is always commoditization. I think partly it\u2019s true \u2014 what a platform does, to some degree, is introduce a lowest common denominator. In particular, they make the substitution, or the switching cost, between the different players a lot lower. I think that\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s much easier to switch between, say, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as a user, and as an advertiser by the way, if those are on top of Facebook.When Amazon emerged as the pre-eminent e-commerce platform, a lot of big companies said, we need to find a way to play with them \u2014 it seems like there\u2019s a lot of e-commerce going on there, and we can\u2019t ignore it, so we need to do something. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us struck a deal that turned out later to be not very advantageous. Initially, it was a good deal for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and it gave them access to Amazon\u2019s customers. But afterward what happened was Amazon found ways to take advantage of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, using the relationship, and its presence on their platform, to start a toy category on Amazon, to figure out how to sell toys on Amazon, and then to invite a lot of competing companies on the same platform to compete with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which made it a lot less attractive for them to be there.Essentially, they overlooked the possibility that Amazon would just use them as a way to start a category of toys \u2014 they somehow assumed it would be exclusive, without putting it in the contract. And, obviously, if I\u2019m a platform, of course I don\u2019t want to be exclusive with anyone, right? I mean, that\u2019s the point of a platform. I want to have as much competition between whatever participants as possible.So if we grant some sort of comparison between a publishing partner\u2019s relationship with a large distribution platform and a retailer\u2019s relationship with Amazon, that might sound alarming? How do pre-existing companies typically make the transition from being an independent participant in a particular category to being, basically, a platform constituent? That\u2019s a broad question, but \u2014 is there an industry that might have useful parallels to the media industry with something like a major social platform?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that transitioning from independence to life on a platform necessarily has to make things worse. One thing that I think a lot about \u2014 in conversations with venture capitalists and others \u2014 is the notion that platforms or marketplaces inherently commoditize. I think more likely what\u2019s happening is the following: I think platforms, or marketplaces, make it a lot easier for, say, the content providers or app developers that are very, very good to rise to the top, and pretty much commoditize everyone else. So if you\u2019re average, it\u2019s definitely going to be very bad. Life is going to be worse on a platform, because you\u2019re exposed to more competition. If you\u2019re very good, life on a platform is a lot better.It\u2019s a little bit like, if you ask drivers how they rate their driving ability, you know, 80 percent say they\u2019re above average. The important qualifier to what I said earlier, about how the best rise to the top, is that, inherently, the platforms force a lot more specialization than before. Previously, in the independent world, players were able to afford to be a little bit broader. I think the problem is, now, you really have to think very deeply, a lot more carefully \u2014 what, exactly, are the one or two things we\u2019re really good at, and focus on those. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of forced specialization, because on a platform, competition will be vertical by vertical.In a case like Facebook, the content was largely there before \u2014 in the form of links.It makes perfect sense, right, to bring more of that content inside, because they can increase engagement.Things load faster, it\u2019s a better experience, and posts and videos are created with Facebook in mind, which means they might feel better inside the platform.Yes, and they want to do as much as possible \u2014 ideally, for them, they want to get as much content as they can to increase readership. There\u2019s probably a function between the well-being of the platform and the quality of the content that they have.This is harder \u2014 for video games, right now, the large game developers are nonexclusive. They used to be more exclusive, and I think this has decreased over time \u2014 it\u2019s become very hard to convince, say, Electronic Arts to give up the Xbox One market to work with the PlayStation. So that has definitely played against the platforms. Game platforms always try to buy or produce their own games for differentiation, but it\u2019s very hard.A different example, the other way, is online video \u2014 Netflix and Amazon. The problem there is very similar. Everyone has, basically, the same movies by now. So this has pushed Netflix and Amazon to start producing their own content. If I\u2019m one of the original providers \u2014 studios, I guess \u2014 then I\u2019m not happy, because now you have this high-quality production from Netflix and Amazon, who are stealing viewers from you.You take this down to the level of articles and shorter videos, and you have different considerations, no? Especially around exclusivity. I\u2019m trying to imagine any sort of leverage.Well, let\u2019s say the content in question requires a lot less investment. First of all, there\u2019s going to be a lot more competition. It\u2019s very hard to compete with the video game Call of Duty. It\u2019s a lot easier to come up with close substitutes for something that requires a lot less investment. The substitution concern on a platform is a lot higher.The most profound piece of this \u2014 the trend that I find fascinating \u2014 is that every year, people look at this and say, these are the products and services that are right now being transacted on these multisided platforms, but there\u2019s a limit. There\u2019s always higher-level, higher-value products and services that are extremely out of reach. Now we\u2019re saying, oh, there are all these on-demand economy platforms like Taskrabbit, but, surely, this is limited to low-skill labor or things that very easily contractable. The reality is, there will be platforms for pretty much everything \u2014 pretty much any product or service that we can imagine. It\u2019s going to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The West Is Enabling Graft in Ukraine", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Here in Ukraine, one revelation from the Panama Papers has attracted more attention than any other: In August 2014, when Ukrainian soldiers were trapped under artillery bombardments during the battle of Ilovaisk, President Petro Poroshenko, a candy magnate, was setting up a corporate vehicle in the British Virgin Islands. While young men were dying to defend Ukraine, their commander-in-chief was looking for ways to deny Ukraine taxes from his own business empire.But the Mossack Fonseca files have an even bigger story to tell: Generations of Ukrainian politicians, dating back to the earliest days of independence, have kept assets offshore. In 1998 \u2014 around the time some of the soldiers killed in Ilovaisk were probably starting school \u2014 the company was already suspected of arranging the affairs of Ukrainian politicians.In 2006, a court in California sentenced Pavlo Lazarenko, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister in 1996-97, to nine years in prison for misusing his post to extort tens of millions of dollars from Ukrainians. By the time he was released in 2012, hundreds of millions of dollars more had been stolen from Ukraine.It\u2019s difficult to chart the precise dimensions of this corruption. It is a submerged leviathan, and small bits of it are only occasionally exposed by brave Ukrainian investigators or forensic probes from abroad.The Anticorruption Action Center, Ukraine\u2019s most prominent anti-graft NGO, has found that prices for H.I.V. drugs were inflated by more than 27 percent in 2013 because of middlemen scamming the health ministry. In an investigation of the food-processing company Archer Daniels Midland, the U.S. Department of Justice discovered that the firm sometimes couldn\u2019t secure VAT repayments in Ukraine unless it paid up to 20 percent of the total in kickbacks to officials.Corruption on such a scale, economy-wide, would cripple any state, let alone one as fragile as this one. In 1991, Ukraine\u2019s G.D.P. was about two-thirds of Poland\u2019s G.D.P.; now, it is less than one-quarter. Corruption has ruined this country, dooming a generation of Ukrainians to poor education, unsafe streets and blighted careers.If health care had been adequately funded, perhaps Ukraine wouldn\u2019t have one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing H.I.V. epidemics. If Ukrainian leaders had not been so dire, perhaps there wouldn\u2019t have been a revolution, let alone two. If the country had not been so asset-stripped, perhaps its troops could have defended Crimea from Russian annexation.The blame doesn\u2019t lie with unscrupulous Ukrainians alone: There wouldn\u2019t be this much corruption without offshore centers like Panama. If you steal money, you need somewhere to launder it; otherwise it\u2019s useless.Since the 2014 uprising that drove out President Viktor F. Yanukovych \u2014 in what Ukrainians call the \u201cRevolution of Dignity\u201d \u2014 Western politicians have lined up to offer Kiev moral and technical advice on battling both corruption and Russia. They have frozen the assets of Mr. Yanukovych and his intimates. They have imposed sanctions on Kremlin insiders, including close advisers of Vladimir V. Putin.When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. addressed the Ukrainian Parliament in December, he came close to lecturing his audience: \u201cYou cannot name me a single democracy in the world where the cancer of corruption is prevalent.\u201d Yet every time a Western politician makes that kind of speech, one wonders: Where exactly do they think the dirty money goes?The cash isn\u2019t in Ukraine. It\u2019s not in those tax havens either. If Panama kept what gets routed there, it would be one of the richest places on earth. If even a fraction of the money stolen from Ukrainians stayed on the Isle of Man, the place would not be the dour, grey lump of rock that it is.Offshore jurisdictions are only pipelines, conduits, entrep\u00f4ts. Money pours through them, but it does not stay, except for the fraction that pays the lawyers and the accountants who handle the deals \u2014 the plumbers who keep the system running.If you\u2019ve gone to the trouble of stealing millions of dollars, you want to keep them somewhere more secure than Panama. You want the money in Manhattan, Zurich or London. You want it somewhere with excellent hospitals, top-ranking schools, A-list celebrities and world-class events. You want it somewhere you can enjoy yourself.Ukraine is trying to battle this system. In late 2014 it passed a law requiring Ukrainian companies to declare who really owns or controls them. No more anonymous holding shells registered offshore. \u201cThis is a crucial tool for revealing the real links between politics and business,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of the Anticorruption Action Center.Other countries are following suit: Britain, Norway and Denmark plan to require companies to disclose ultimate ownership, so-called beneficial ownership. As of June, the people who have significant control of companies in Britain will have to be named on a public register. Prime Minister David Cameron is pushing for Britain\u2019s overseas territories to require the same. The U.S. Treasury Department is considering similar regulations, after a pilot project to identify secret buyers of luxury real estate in Manhattan and Miami.These laws cannot be put in place fast enough, because the main enabler of corruption in Ukraine isn\u2019t Mossack Fonseca, or even Panama; it\u2019s the West. As long as the world\u2019s kleptocrats are allowed to use anonymous corporate vehicles to buy yachts, penthouses and mansions, lawyers will continue to set up those vehicles in tax havens from Delaware to the Seychelles.If Western countries start requiring transparency about corporate ownership, crooks will stop stashing their money in the West, because they will no longer be able to hide their true identities. This will let daylight into Western economies, and send those who prefer the dark scurrying elsewhere.Oliver Bullough is a writer specializing in corruption, tax havens and the former Soviet Union, and the author of \u201cLet Our Fame Be Great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Impeachment Debate Hinges on a Thorny Legal Question", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 As she fights for her political life, President Dilma Rousseff has been tirelessly describing the drive to remove her from office as nothing less than a coup.In a country with bitter memories of military dictatorship \u2014 the most recent one having given way to civilian rule in 1985 \u2014 the word is especially fraught, and it has become a rallying cry that has energized supporters who are battling to stave off an impeachment trial in the Senate that could begin as early as next month.\u201cI am the victim of a process that is rooted in injustice, and legal and political fraud,\u201d she said during a news conference on Tuesday, two days after the lower house of Congress voted by a wide margin to approve an impeachment measure.The debate about removing her from office, which is convulsing a polarized nation, centers on a crucial question: Did she commit an impeachable offense?There is broad agreement that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration employed budgetary tricks to conceal a looming deficit and enhance her prospects during a bitterly fought re-election campaign in 2014.Experts say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration effectively borrowed some $11 billion from state banks, an amount equal to almost 1 percent of the economy, to fund popular social programs that have been a hallmark of the Workers Party\u2019s 13 years in power. These programs included payments to Brazil\u2019s poorest residents, credits to small farmers and the financing of homeownership for low-income families.But legal experts and constitutional scholars are divided over whether that action rises to the level of an offense that merits removal from office.\u201cThe government lied about the messy state of their house by putting up a pretty window,\u201d said Carlos Pereira, a political scientist at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a leading Brazilian university. \u201cThe government betrayed the people, and for this they must be punished.\u201dBut the president\u2019s defenders say such fiscal irregularities do not qualify as a crime, the constitutional requirement that would allow the Senate to remove her from office if she is convicted after trial by a two-thirds majority.Pedro Serrano, a constitutional law scholar at Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de S\u00e3o Paulo, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s enemies were using an overly broad interpretation of the law, a move that will harm the nation\u2019s young democracy.\u201cIn any civilized country in the world that has legal democratic institutions, such a punishment must be very narrowly interpreted,\u201d he said, referring to removal from office.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.Oscar Vilhena Vieira, a professor of constitutional law at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, said the law required that Congress approve changes to the annual budget, and prohibited the president from borrowing money from state-owned banks.\u201cThe nature of these crimes are administrative crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not penal crimes, so you cannot be put in prison because of them, but you can lose your mandate.\u201dHe added: \u201cIs it politically desirable for her to be impeached for that? It is up to Congress to decide. It is a political decision.\u201dThe practice used by Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration, known as \u201cpedaladas fiscais,\u201d or pedaling fiscal obligations into the future, is illegal under a 16-year-old law that was designed to end the budgetary practices that had led to devastating bouts of hyperinflation in the 1980s.In the years since, the tactic of using money from state-owned banks to temporarily fund the government has been used by numerous elected officials, though no president has faced punishment for it until now.Andr\u00e9 Rehbein Sathler, an economist who works for the lower house, said Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration broke the law by failing to reimburse the banks for these expenditures, a move he likened to printing money with abandon. The government did reimburse the banks after the election.\u201cDilma claims that other presidents did the same thing, but just because other people commit a crime doesn\u2019t justify your own crimes,\u201d he said.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s defenders say her opponents in Congress are cynically using the law to depose an unpopular president. Brazil is suffering through the worst recession since the 1930s, and an unfolding corruption scandal involving the national oil company, Petrobras, has infuriated the public with revelations that billions of dollars in kickbacks were funneled into the campaign coffers of powerful political parties.The scandal has implicated numerous political figures, including leading members of her own party, but so far Ms. Rousseff has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case, although she was the chairwoman of Petrobras at the time the kickbacks were said to have taken place.On Tuesday, Ms. Rousseff sought to plead her case to an international audience, summoning members of the foreign news media to the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, the building that houses her offices. For more than an hour, she defended her fiscal policies and denied that she had broken the law. \u201cI\u2019m not a person who gets desperate, and will fight for my convictions,\u201d she said. \u201cI have fought for them my whole life.\u201dJos\u00e9 Murilo de Carvalho, a prominent historian, expressed sympathy for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predicament, but said it was inaccurate to refer to the impeachment initiative as a coup. Until now, he said, the process has followed the law and has been subject to oversight by the nation\u2019s highest court.\u201cImpeachment is a very poor instrument for getting rid of a president because it\u2019s political,\u201d the professor said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have control of Congress, you can be impeached, even if the arguments are not so strong.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia.Advertisement"}

The first African-American on the court, Justice Page is well known in Minnesota legal circles for his carefully crafted opinions (occasionally livened with quotes from Dr. Seuss), his concern for civil rights and, more lightheartedly, for his colorful bow ties.\u201cI witnessed him focusing on getting the law right,\u201d said his former Supreme Court colleague, Justice Paul Anderson (also retired). \u201cHe was very focused on equity and the elimination of discrimination.\u201dJustice Page doesn\u2019t ring a bell? You might know him better from his previous career as a professional football player for 15 years, mostly with the Minnesota Vikings and, toward the end, with the Chicago Bears. A graduate of Notre Dame, Mr. Page was a remarkably quick defensive tackle, the most feared of the Vikings\u2019 legendary front four, the Purple People Eaters.He made six All-N.F.L. selections, and nine straight Pro Bowls. He retired from football in 1981. Seven years later he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.In person, Mr. Page is considerate and thoughtful, reflecting carefully before answering a question. At age 70 he still moves with the grace of an athlete.But having reached pinnacles of success in two very different careers, surely it must be time to kick back, maybe hit the golf course and the nostalgia circuit? Hardly.\u201cOnce I left the court, that experience was behind me and I am trying to figure out the new thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI have the sense that I want to do something with educating young children.\u201d (Later, he added that golf is a \u201cgood walk spoiled,\u201d and rather than look back, he prefers \u201clooking forward.\u201d)Mr. Page has visited a lot of classrooms, observing that in the early years of elementary school all children are curious, eyes bright and lively. Yet for some the lights have dimmed by the time they reach the fifth, sixth and seventh grades, especially among young people from deprived backgrounds.\u201cMy thinking is if you can get these young people thinking critically early on \u2014 first, second, third grade \u2014 things will change dramatically in terms of educational achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I am na\u00efve, but I don\u2019t think it is mission impossible.\u201dMr. Page is unusually accomplished, but he is far from alone in searching for another meaningful act at his stage of life. The word \u201cretirement\u201d still suggests that it\u2019s time to stop working and embrace leisure full time. That\u2019s not the case for growing numbers of aging Americans. They want to stay engaged in the broader society and economy, continuing to be useful by tapping into their accumulated skills and experience.\u201cHe has always been committed since he was quite young to really make a difference in society and to create and leave a legacy,\u201d said Mr. Page\u2019s wife, Diane. She also \u201cretired\u201d after a career of four-plus decades as a marketing research consultant. Retired isn\u2019t the right word for her, either.The power of education to make a positive difference is one of Mr. Page\u2019s core beliefs. Even in his 1988 talk at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he focused on the transformative value of education, highlighting in particular the need for investing in black teenagers, \u201cthe most unemployed and undervalued people in our society.\u201dLooking ahead to new challenges and not back on old glories, Mr. Page asked the audience: \u201cWhat contribution can I still make that would be truly worthy of the outpouring of warmth and good feelings I have received today? And the answer, for me, is clear: to help give other children the chance to achieve their dreams.\u201dSoon after, Mr. Page, with his wife and some friends, created the Page Foundation to provide scholarships to students of color in Minnesota to attend postsecondary education institutions in the state. The foundation has been run for 28 years by Ms. Page, its volunteer executive director. In other words, not really retired.The Page program also requires scholarship winners to mentor young people in the community, inspiring future generations to value an education.\u201cThe component of service is what makes the program successful,\u201d said Abdul Omari, owner of AMO Enterprise and a former Page Scholar. \u201cThe money is important, but mentoring matters.\u201dThe foundation has raised more than $12 million and granted scholarships to more than 6,000 students. The proceeds from the sales of Mr. Page\u2019s sports memorabilia collection support the foundation. So does the money from the two children\u2019s books \u2014 soon to be three \u2014 that he has written with his daughter, Kamie Page, a schoolteacher.Mr. Page also plans to pursue fund-raising himself, something the conflict-of-interest rules on the Minnesota Supreme Court kept him from doing.Listening to Mr. Page, it is hard to shake the impression that football was a detour from the pursuit of the law and belief in the power of education. As a child, he said, he loved the television show \u201cPerry Mason.\u201d And the law, he thought, offered a better life than the steel mills in Canton, Ohio, where he grew up. (Coincidentally, it is also the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.)Mr. Page also said he remembers reading, at age 8, about the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education ruling that having separate public schools for black and white students was unconstitutional.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the law,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was clear that there was power in the law.\u201dWhile Mr. Page thinks through how best to reach young minority students, he and Ms. Page live a full schedule. The alarm goes off at 5:19 in the morning, same as always. They take a run around Lake of the Isles near their Minneapolis home. Dogs eagerly greet him along the lakeside path because he has carried dog biscuits for them for three decades.He and Ms. Page spend time with their four grandchildren. They\u2019re slowly working their way through 75 pounds of sausage they made at a two-day workshop last year. The couple spent most of March at the family cabin in northern Minnesota, harvesting maple syrup from 80 trees.\u201cWe\u2019re a team and we have so much fun together,\u201d Ms. Page said. \u201cThis is a great life phase, a very freeing phase of life.\u201dBut having \u201cretired\u201d twice, Mr. Page plans on keeping busy pursuing his passions.The Pages have assembled a remarkable collection of African-American artifacts documenting both the good and the bad. Among other items, they have a slave-made brick used in constructing the original White House, a sign from a Birmingham, Ala., bus station that says COLORED, and Ku Klux Klan dolls.Mr. Page\u2019s favorite is an Abraham Lincoln funeral banner. One side reads: \u201cUncle Abe we shall not forget you.\u201d The other says: \u201cOur country shall be one country.\u201d\u201cThat is a very powerful reminder,\u201d Mr. Page said, \u201cof where we\u2019ve been and where we still have to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Plans to Step Up Military Campaign Against ISIS", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The Obama administration is preparing to broaden its military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria by increasing the number of Special Operations forces who advise Syrian rebels, and it is also considering the addition of Army attack helicopters to the fight against militants in Iraq.The goal would be to accelerate what United States officials said on Saturday was momentum behind Iraqi security forces and American-backed rebels in Syria fighting the terrorist organization.The administration\u2019s plans for Iraq are more complicated.Pentagon officials would like to increase efforts to advise and train Iraqi security forces for the anticipated assault on Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city and the Islamic State\u2019s main stronghold in the country. The plan calls for shifting trainers who are already in the country to positions closer to Mosul, the officials said. They would also like to deploy Apache helicopter gunships \u2014 which are already in Iraq, but used only to protect American personnel \u2014 and order them to participate in the battle for Mosul.But the government of Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has been battling internal political turmoil. His challenges include political opponents, rampant corruption and an economy weakened by low oil prices.The military options under consideration \u2014 which could be announced in the next several days \u2014 were described by five Defense Department and military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because final decisions are pending in Washington and Baghdad. Administration officials said on Saturday that announcing or even proposing increased American assistance is a delicate diplomatic task that could further imperil Mr. Abadi\u2019s position.\u201cYou should expect us, to see us, doing more,\u201d he said at a news conference at the Al Dhafra air base as he opened travels in the Middle East. \u201cIt will be consistent with the same approach, but it\u2019ll be across all the domains, right up to cyber.\u201dMr. Carter described the administration\u2019s approach as one that will use members of the American armed services to help accelerate the military campaign against the Islamic State, but will not replace Iraqi security forces or Syrian rebels.There are roughly 5,000 American service members in Iraq, according to current Pentagon estimates, but the number often varies, sometimes daily, by hundreds.Mr. Carter\u2019s comments come at a time when Iraqi militias and military forces have been making notable progress on the battlefield against the Islamic State, including seizing parts of Hit, a city in Anbar Province, this month.Last Wednesday, Col. Steven H. Warren, the military spokesman in Iraq, said that the initial phase of the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, with the intent of degrading or weakening the fighters, was complete, and that allied forces were in the second phase of the operation.\u201cDuring this phase, we will enable our partners to dismantle the enemy, fragment his forces, isolate his centers of gravity and liberate the terrain he holds,\u201d he said.On Saturday, Mr. Carter met with American service members, including pilots, who are stationed at the Al Dhafra air base and are part of the air campaign over Iraq and Syria. He said that in the coming days he would be meeting with American commanders leading the efforts to defeat the Islamic State.\u201cWe continue to look for, and identify ways of accelerating that, and as we find those we will do them,\u201d Mr. Carter said, adding that the administration would seek the approval of Iraqi government there.Mr. Carter said that gaining the support of President Obama to do more in Iraq has not been an obstacle.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten approval from the White House every time the chairman and I have gone to ask for something that we\u2019ve needed to accelerate going way back to last year,\u201d Mr. Carter said, referring to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., who will also be traveling in the region in the coming days. \u201cSo that isn\u2019t really the issue for us, the issue for us is yet identifying more ways to accelerate the campaign.\u201dMichael S.

{"Headline": "A Hole in North Korean Sanctions Big Enough for Coal, Oil and Used Pianos", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported by\u201cThey always want the wires to the car radio cut so the North Koreans can\u2019t listen to the Chinese programs,\u201d he said.Then, as he does on many mornings, he drives the car over a single-lane iron bridge across the border, where there is steady demand for secondhand taxis.If recent trade here is any indication, that cooperation has been spotty at best.Cross-border trade, legal and illegal, flows pretty much as usual, and seems to be largely unhindered by the new rules, traders and local officials said.One of the toughest components, a requirement that countries inspect all cargo entering or leaving North Korea for banned goods, is not enforced here.On many days, Mr. Qin\u2019s secondhand taxis cross the bridge in a convoy of more than 100 vehicles, including trucks loaded with containers draped in shabby tarpaulins and secondhand minibuses for North Korea\u2019s rickety transportation system. Few are ever inspected by the Chinese authorities.China accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade. Half of that business is estimated to flow through Dandong, a boom-and-bust city whose fortunes are tied to trade with North Korea.Virtually everything that keeps the North Korean economy afloat passes through here: Coal and iron ore come in, violating the sanctions, and crude oil flows out, exempted from them.The United Nations rules put the onus on customs inspectors here to judge which goods may help the nuclear program or the military, which are banned, and which are intended for civilians, which are allowed.On a recent day, the customs checkpoint, a large outdoor parking area adjacent to the bridge, held a collection of China\u2019s castoffs: cheap four-wheel-drive Haval passenger vehicles, discount medicines for hepatitis and tuberculosis, old solar panels to brighten dark houses.But the customs office here lacks the staff to open all the containers, a local government official said. Like most people interviewed for this article, he spoke on condition of anonymity since there are risks to speaking candidly to foreign media about trade with North Korea. At peak times, up to 200 trucks a day cross the Yalu River to Sinuiju, North Korea. Before departing, only about 5 percent of the containers they carry are inspected, the official said.China and the United States worked closely on the new sanctions, and both countries said ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons was a shared concern. When President Obama and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, meet in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Obama is likely to press China to enforce the new measures.But if China is exasperated with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, it is even more worried about political instability, and the possibility that economic deprivation could send millions of North Koreans fleeing into China.So China insisted on an exemption stipulating that the \u201clivelihood\u201d of ordinary North Koreans must not suffer, a loophole that sanctions experts say is big enough to drive an 18-wheeler through.That exemption left the oil pipeline from Dandong to North Korea open, but seems to have been applied to a wide variety of merchandise.One salesroom here boasted a brisk business in secondhand Japanese pianos, selling for $1,500 to $8,000 for fastidious, well-off North Koreans who sneer at the sound of Chinese instruments. North Koreans like Yamaha pianos, a salesman said.Smuggling along the nearly 900-mile border, perfected through methods ranging from tucking wads of cash into truck drivers\u2019 seats to operating small boats in the dead of night, is winked at for the same reason.\u201cWe don\u2019t want the North Korean regime to collapse,\u201d explained Mr. Wang, a government official.Demand has fallen for some items, traders said, but that was more a function of North Korea\u2019s increasingly feeble economy and a lack of cash, than the sanctions.There is, however, evidence of some enforcement in one important area: North Korea\u2019s sale of coal and iron ore, two of its most important exports.But that ban has been circumvented by smuggling ships and by the transfer of 12 North Korean ships to Chinese ownership, allowing them to dock at Chinese and other ports, a longtime trader, Mr. Yu, said.A few traders interviewed here said the new rules had crimped their business.Mr. Zhang, a trader who does tens of millions of dollars a year in business with North Korea, said customs officials had just impounded a big secondhand excavator he had bought from a coal mine in Shanxi Province and sold to a North Korean coal mine for more than $60,000.Customs inspectors asked how he knew the equipment would not be transferred to the North Korean military. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to answer,\u201d he said.But traders and officials expect that after some initial minor squeezing, whatever enforcement there is will be relaxed. Liaoning Province, where Dandong is a prominent city, ranked at the bottom of China\u2019s 31 provinces for economic growth last year, and there was political pressure not to weaken the economy further.\u201cWhenever there are provocations, the traders say that the higher-ups call for enforcement, and then a few months later there is no systematic implementation,\u201d said Andrea Berger, a proliferation expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London.For many of the Chinese businessmen here, deals with North Korea still offer a chance to make good money, both quickly and quietly. Their offices are tucked away in a grubby complex of two-story buildings near the waterfront.On the street, North Korean men are ubiquitous, walking in pairs or in groups \u2014 never alone \u2014 and wearing severe black jackets and pants, the signature uniform of government officials. They are North Korean trade officials who were sent to Dandong as purchasing agents, and whose jobs were largely untouched by the new United Nations restrictions.Their presence has created tensions with the Chinese, many of whom regard their needy neighbors with contempt.Just as the new sanctions were imposed, a new North Korean trader came to work at Mr. Zhang\u2019s company, where he would earn kickbacks on each purchase and then pay some of that money to his government, Mr. Zhang said.The trader expected to be treated to a plush apartment for him and his family, schooling for his son, an imported car, and a loan of more than $50,000, Mr. Zhang complained. \u201cHow they spend money is way too extravagant,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But unlike the United States company, Onefinestay oversees each rental, providing toiletries, bedding and other amenities to serve the high-end house rental market.By acquiring Onefinestay, which had raised just over $80 million in venture capital, including some from hotel groups like Hyatt Hotels, AccorHotels has secured one of Europe\u2019s leading sharing economy start-ups.Just as in Silicon Valley, where a lack of venture capital funding and concerns about overheated valuations have started to raise concerns, European founders and venture capitalists are starting to question if their region\u2019s tech sector has hard times ahead.In recent months, for instance, a number of European start-ups have been sold to outside investors at lower valuations than many of their investors had initially expected. Among them is the artificial intelligence company SwiftKey, purchased by Microsoft for a reported $250 million in a deal announced in February.Greg Marsh, Onefinestay\u2019s co-founder, though, dismissed such fears, saying that his company had several potential funding options before choosing to sell to AccorHotels. The start-up is expected to continue operating as a separate entity.\u201cIt\u2019s the start of a new chapter,\u201d said Mr. Marsh, who will continue running the business. \u201cWe could have continued expanding ourselves.

{"Headline": "Penalize Companies That Export Jobs", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBefore that video, I had long regarded United Technologies as a company that cared about its employees\u2019 welfare. During the 1960s, my mother was a stenotypist at its Hamilton Standard division, which sponsored scholarships that allowed my brother and me to attend M.I.T. and graduate with degrees that opened doors to high-tech employment. Summer jobs that accompanied those scholarships bolstered our practical understanding of science and engineering, and our appreciation of the company and its culture.The corporation also fostered the continuing education of its employees \u2014 for example, by helping pay their tuition as they pursued advanced degrees. It recognized the considerable company benefits that accrued from having a loyal, well-educated work force.In return, members of my family \u2014 beginning with my mother\u2019s parents \u2014 became steadfast United stockholders. This stock is the bedrock of our portfolios, having paid dividends for decades and multiplied in value. It is helping us achieve a secure retirement.So I was surprised by Carrier\u2019s move to Mexico. Perhaps it reflects the recent ascendance of more financially minded executives over the previous leadership, or their concerns about a faltering bottom line and dropping stock prices attributable partly to a slackening demand from China for the company\u2019s products.More likely it\u2019s a response to economic imperatives stimulated, at least in part, by the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Carrier executive in the video told employees that many of the company\u2019s suppliers had already moved to the Monterrey area, so it made sense for the company to shift its Indianapolis manufacturing operations to be nearby. Left unspoken was that the labor is much cheaper there, too, by a factor of almost 10.The transfers of domestic manufacturing jobs to Mexico and Asia have benefited Americans by bringing cheaper consumer goods to our shores and stores. But when the victims of these moves can find only lower-wage jobs at Target or Walmart, and residents of these blighted cities have much less money to spend, is that a fair distribution of the savings and costs?Recognizing this complex phenomenon, I can begin to understand the great upwelling of working-class support for Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump \u2014 especially for the latter in regions of postindustrial America left behind by these jarring economic dislocations.And as a United Technologies shareholder, I have to admit to a gnawing sense of guilt in unwittingly helping to foster this job exodus. In pursuing returns, are shareholders putting pressure on executives to slash costs by exporting good-paying jobs to developing nations?The core problem is that shareholder returns \u2014 and executive rewards \u2014 became the paramount goals of corporations beginning in the 1980s, as Hedrick Smith reported in his 2012 book, \u201cWho Stole the American Dream?\u201d Instead of rolling some of the profits back into building their industries and educating workers, executives began cutting costs and jobs to improve their bottom lines, often using the proceeds to raise dividends or buy back stock, which United Technologies began doing extensively last year.And an easy way to boost profits is to transfer jobs to other countries.What\u2019s the solution? To build a tariff wall against Mexico? That violates Nafta, and I doubt it would work, for it would bring unintended negative consequences and perhaps even start a trade war.Rather, we should begin to consider serious penalties for corporations that export well-paid jobs, particularly those that have been major beneficiaries of hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development spending by the federal government, which helped create many high-tech products and industries and the jobs that came with them. And United Technologies is a top federal contractor, earning over $5 billion annually.Taxpayers make these long-term investments in part to create these kinds of high-paying jobs, so we have a vested interest in keeping them here at home. To make an about-face and export these jobs abroad is irresponsible, to put it mildly.We have to make such unpatriotic corporate behavior painful for the perpetrators.Michael Riordan, a physicist and historian, is a co-author of \u201cTunnel Visions: The Rise and Fall of the Superconducting Super Collider.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snoopy the Destroyer", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byHas Snoopy just doomed us to another severe financial crisis? Unfortunately, that\u2019s a real possibility, thanks to a bad judicial ruling that threatens a key part of financial reform.The episode showed that traditional financial regulation, which focuses on deposit-taking banks, is inadequate in the modern world. It\u2019s not just that anyone who borrows short term to finance risky investments \u2014 which is what Lehman did \u2014 creates the same kind of danger as a conventional bank. There\u2019s also a high degree of interconnectedness: A.I.G. wasn\u2019t a bank, but it was selling guarantees on financial assets, and fears that it might fail to honor those guarantees threatened to topple dominoes across the economy.Oh, and yes, the episode also showed that making the breakup of big banks the be-all and end-all of reform misses the point.What we need is regulation that limits the risks from nonbank institutions \u2014 and the 2010 financial reform tries to do just that. The way it does this is by allowing regulators to designate some firms \u201csystemically important,\u201d meaning that, like A.I.G., their failure or the prospect thereof could threaten financial stability. Once an institution is so designated, it is subject to extra oversight and regulation.What determines whether a firm is systemically important? There aren\u2019t any cut-and-dried rules \u2014 there can\u2019t be, because if there were, corporate lawyers would find ways to evade them. Instead, it\u2019s a judgment call. But financial giants that don\u2019t like being regulated are trying to use litigation to question those judgments.Which brings us to Snoopy, who has, for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, long been the emblem of the insurance giant MetLife.It was a peculiar ruling. Judge Collyer repeatedly complained that the regulators had failed to do a cost-benefit analysis, which the law doesn\u2019t say they should do, and for good reason. Financial crises are, after all, rare but drastic events; it\u2019s unreasonable to expect regulators to game out in advance just how likely the next crisis is, or how it might play out, before imposing prudential standards. To demand that officials quantify the unquantifiable would, in effect, establish a strong presumption against any kind of protective measures.The federal government will appeal the MetLife ruling, but even if it wins the ruling may open the floodgates to a wave of challenges to financial reform. And that\u2019s the sense in which Snoopy may be setting us up for future disaster.It doesn\u2019t have to happen. As with so much else, this year\u2019s election is crucial. A Democrat in the White House would enforce the spirit as well as the letter of reform \u2014 and would also appoint judges sympathetic to that endeavor. A Republican, any Republican, would make every effort to undermine reform, even if he didn\u2019t manage an explicit repeal.Just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that the 2010 financial reform was enough. The next crisis might come even if it remains intact. But the odds of crisis will be a lot higher if it falls apart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs and Wages Notch Gains as the Economy Tries to Heal", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byAfter years of economic desperation, American workers are finally regaining some of the ground they lost in the last decade\u2019s recession and the pallid recovery that followed.Companies have been hiring in recent months at a pace not seen before in this century. Wages are rising faster than inflation. Joblessness is hovering near the low levels last reached in 2007 before the economy\u2019s downturn.And perhaps most significantly, the army of unemployed people who gave up and dropped out of the job market is not only looking for work, but actually finding it.\u201cIt\u2019s really a best-case scenario,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cI was particularly encouraged by the pickup in labor force participation.\u201dThe underlying strength apparent in the report for March reinforces growing evidence that the economy, despite a host of remaining ills, is now consistently moving in the right direction.\u201cThis is close to a Goldilocks scenario,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. He noted that hiring and wage gains were healthy in March, but not so robust as to ignite inflation fears and tempt the Federal Reserve to move more quickly to raise rates and temper growth.To be sure, the damage from the financial crisis and the severe recession it spawned is still not fully healed. Even with improvement of the past six months, the proportion of Americans in the labor force remains significantly below where it was when the recession began at the end of 2007.\u201cThe labor force in the last few months has seen significant gains,\u201d said Claire McKenna, senior policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for lower-wage workers. \u201cThings are moving in the right direction, but very slowly.\u201dAt the same time, while some of the highest-paid employees on Wall Street and at many leading companies have enjoyed big jumps in compensation, most workers have experienced only very modest wage gains, heightening worries about income inequality.The American economy still faces fundamental headwinds that are not likely to abate soon \u2014 like a persistent trade gap, low productivity and the long-term erosion of factory jobs that provide an economic lifeline to workers without a college degree.In fact, the manufacturing sector was one of the few weak spots in the economy last month, losing 29,000 jobs.But companies in the business of providing health care, leisure and hospitality and retailing each gained more than 40,000 jobs in March. And two very different sectors that pay well \u2014 construction as well as professional and business services \u2014 both added more than 30,000 jobs.The overall unemployment rate rose to 5 percent last month, compared with 4.9 percent in February. But even that was a positive indication, analysts said, since it was the uptick in new entrants to the labor force that mostly accounted for the rise rather than job losses.If anything, Friday\u2019s report portrays an economy gradually returning to a more normal trajectory, while so far avoiding the bubblelike excesses that prevailed in the late 1990s and just before the Great Recession in December 2007.\u201cThe last two years have been the best since 1998 and 1999, and that\u2019s saying a lot,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm. \u201cThose were boom years that we look back on very fondly, so to have that level of job growth again is pretty remarkable.\u201dAs a result, the economic backdrop of the presidential campaign is also starting to shift. Democrats note that unemployment has fallen sharply since President Obama took office; the jobless rate stood at 7.8 percent in January 2009.Cities like Denver; San Jose, Calif.; and Austin, Tex., are now among those with the best-performing labor markets, while places like Las Vegas, Chicago and Detroit remain laggards.Republicans have been citing stagnant wage growth, as well as the exit of many workers from the labor force in recent years. On the campaign trail, they also contend that Mr. Obama\u2019s stewardship of the economy has hobbled businesses in a web of excessive regulations.But the steady expansion of the work force and the signs that a tightening labor market is finally translating into wage gains could ease some of the economic anxiety that has marked the primary season for Republican and Democratic candidates alike.While some big companies have announced layoffs in recent months facing worries on Wall Street about profit margins, smaller firms are picking up the slack, especially in the technology sector.\u201cIf you\u2019re a start-up, you\u2019re either growing or dying and we\u2019ve been growing,\u201d said Adam M. Ochstein, the founder of the Chicago-based StratEx, which provides software that enables companies to automate human resources departments and cut down on paperwork.StratEx hired two workers in March and plans to hire eight this month, bringing its overall work force to just over 80.To lure software developers with three to five years under their belt, Mr. Ochstein has to pay about $100,000 a year. New hires for StratEx\u2019s help desk, who have been working for the same amount of time, command less than half that annually.\u201cWages and participation are where the rubber meets the road,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cWe will take our cue about the overall strength of the economy based on that.\u201dMr. Gapen, like many on Wall Street, urged the Fed to let the good times roll.\u201cMs. Yellen is likely to see the March report as evidence that the Fed\u2019s policies are working and that their accommodative policies are helping to heal the labor market,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why push rates higher and potentially choke off that process?\u201dAdvertisement"}

And on Monday, he will deliver another administration policy manifesto \u2014 \u201cAmerica and the Global Economy: The Case for U.S. Leadership\u201d \u2014 at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, and in a 5,000-word essay in Foreign Affairs magazine.Those events, culminating with this week\u2019s surprisingly muscular tax clampdown and his own public relations efforts, have raised Mr. Lew\u2019s profile higher than any time since he became secretary three years ago. That has brought praise from Democrats, and harsh criticism from Republicans and some business groups, which say the Treasury is overreaching its authority and damaging the economy.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist, called the tax regulations \u201cadministrative attacks that raise the cost of capital\u201d at a time \u201cof chronic slow growth and poor productivity.\u201dMr. Lew succeeded Timothy F. Geithner, another self-effacing career public servant, but one who assumed national and international prominence in overseeing the Treasury during the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.Yet Mr. Lew, in an interview, bristled at the implication that until now his stewardship had been low-key.\u201cIf you look at any of the periods of the last three-plus years that I\u2019ve been secretary, there have been issues that have been high-profile issues at every point. There is a coincidence that there are a number of things happening at the same time now,\u201d he said.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you why some things get people\u2019s attention more than others, but there hasn\u2019t been a slow period in the time I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Mr. Lew added. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s been surprising to me how intense it is and how nonstop the inbox is.\u201dHis outbox has included two previous rounds of anti-inversion regulations to stem corporate tax avoidance, in each of the last two years. Also: showdowns with congressional Republicans over the periodic need to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit; negotiating, unsuccessfully, with Republicans to overhaul the corporate tax code to close loopholes and lower tax rates; and enforcing economic sanctions \u2014 against countries, terrorist groups, individuals and companies \u2014 that have become a major tool of foreign policy in recent years.Even so, the widespread image of Mr. Lew has been that of a low-profile steward for a low-profile time, at least relative to the eventful first years of the Obama administration during a global recession and with the nation\u2019s financial, housing and auto sectors near collapse.Both of Mr. Obama\u2019s choices to head the Treasury \u2014 Mr. Lew, known as Jack, and Mr. Geithner \u2014 had r\u00e9sum\u00e9s long on jobs in government, not in finance, industry or elective office like many past secretaries. Both could chafe at the demands of political celebrity and a secretary\u2019s role as the public face of economic policy for the world\u2019s richest power.\u201cIt certainly is nothing I ever asked for,\u201d Mr. Lew said of his job, and broke into laughter. But Mr. Obama, who favors a tight inner circle, promoted him, Mr. Lew said, \u201cfor reasons that had to do with my own personal record and his relationship with me.\u201d\u201cTim and Jack are both old-school staffers at heart: They\u2019re willing to accept credit when it\u2019s given, but they won\u2019t seek it out,\u201d said Mark Patterson, who was chief of staff at the Treasury for Mr. Geithner and then briefly for Mr. Lew.Within the administration and among those who deal with the Treasury, Mr. Lew is seen as a cautious technocrat, with a grasp of issues and which levers to pull that reflects his experience over decades \u2014 as top adviser in the Reagan era to the House speaker, Thomas P. O\u2019Neill; budget director to both President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama; deputy to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and Mr. Obama\u2019s White House chief of staff.That grasp of policy facts and Mr. Lew\u2019s intensity of argument have at times annoyed members of Congress in both parties. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, is not one of them \u2014 although, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had some spirited discussions about the budget sometimes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how the president feels very comfortable with Secretary Lew,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cHe\u2019s very knowledgeable on the substance, but he\u2019s been around politics enough so that he gets the intersection of politics and policy.\u201dThe secretary and the senator, who have known each other since Mr. Wyden served in the House and Mr. Lew advised Speaker O\u2019Neill, talk weekly about pending matters. So Mr. Wyden was among the few in Washington or corporate America who were not surprised by the regulations introduced this week against \u201cserial inverters\u201d like Allergan and foreign parent companies\u2019 \u201cearnings stripping\u201d their new American subsidiaries to reduce their American taxes. \u201cI like the approach,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Tony Fratto, who was an adviser to all three Treasury secretaries of President George W. Bush, does not. He called the new regulations \u201ca horrible precedent\u201d stretching the Treasury\u2019s authority \u201cto the breaking point.\u201d But he had praise generally for Mr. Lew\u2019s tenure as Treasury secretary.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the two or three biggest jobs in the cabinet \u2014 you are going to be in the limelight. He is not a guy who seeks the limelight,\u201d Mr. Fratto said. What Mr. Lew does well, he added, is the quiet, behind-the-scenes work of reaching out to hear from all sides on issues: \u201cHaving worked for three Treasury secretaries, and knowing Geithner a little, I think Jack is probably the best of them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cambodia, the Ghosts Prefer Dollars", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 One recent morning, Suon Sokhum, a colonel in the Cambodian Army, was shopping for gifts for his ancestors.Qingming, the annual festival to honor the dead, was coming up, and throughout the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, people burn offerings to provide for their ancestors in the spirit world.At a stall on the southern fringe of one of the city\u2019s oldest markets, he browsed votive wares ranging from traditional red candles to glossy Lexus sport utility vehicles made of cardboard, finally settling on several sets of paper clothing and four neat stacks of replica $100 bills.Col. Suon Sokhum paid for the presents in local currency, the riel, but said he would never consider offering riel to his ancestors. They, like ghosts and spirits throughout Cambodia, prefer dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s too small,\u201d he said of the riel, which trades around 4,000 to a dollar. \u201cI want a bigger note. If we give the big note, the ancestors can get a lot of money. If we give them small money, they will need so many notes that they\u2019ll go crazy carrying them around.\u201dSo on the holiday this week, along with cardboard cars, cellphones and other supplies their ancestors might need, Cambodians burned millions of fake United States dollars, much to the chagrin of the government.The government has been trying to wean the economy off dollars, which are used here in tandem with the riel. Riel are usually used for small purchases, and dollars for most other things.The national bank has provided incentives for making deposits in riel and has waged a yearslong public relations campaign to promote its wider adoption.Still, many people prefer to keep dollars, wary of the volatility of local currency from years of war and political instability.And the biggest holdout may be the spirit world, where the dollar is king.\u201cIt\u2019s an indication that no one, even the dead, apparently, thinks the riel is regarded in high esteem,\u201d said Sophal Ear, an associate professor of diplomacy and world affairs at Occidental College, in Los Angeles, who has studied dollarization in Cambodia.He said he had vivid memories of burning spirit money with his family as a child. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of wire transfer to the afterworld,\u201d he said.At the Kambol graveyard on the outskirts of Phnom Penh last weekend, the air smelled of smoke and roasted pigs, and charred bits of dollars and the occasional euro littered the grass.\u201cThe dollar is valuable, so that\u2019s why we pay in U.S. currency,\u201d said Heng Panhawat, a clerk for a law firm, as he and his children tossed stacks of American currency, a fake jade bracelet and a paper iPhone 5 into the flames.\u201cWhen I was young, we just paid respect to ancestors with gold paper and did not burn paper money, but now society has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen something is valuable on the market, we buy it and burn it for the ancestors.\u201dAs economic development has taken hold here and Cambodians have more disposable income than ever before, the tastes of ancestor spirits have taken a turn for the luxurious.While in the past they drank traditional rice wine, they now crave imported beer and Hennessy Cognac. As bigger and bigger S.U.V.s have choked the streets of Phnom Penh, the spirits have developed a penchant for black Range Rovers driven by chauffeurs.The cars may appear to be cheap cardboard facsimiles, but that does not diminish their utility in the spirit world, which is believed to be a reflection of this one. In exchange for burning the goods, the descendants believe, they will be enriched in kind.Khao Sophy, who sells votive goods at the market, said preferences among the spirits clearly mirrored the tastes of her human customers. Over the past few years, for example, credit cards have been introduced, and houses have become bigger. As she spoke, a prospective buyer was fussing over the square footage of the paper mansions on display.\u201cI\u2019m going to shop around,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI need some garden space.\u201dAs recently as the early 1990s, ancestor spirits were happy to receive gold bars, crepe paper painted gold, to pay for their otherworldly purchases.But as dollars flooded the country during the United Nations protectorate from 1992 to 1993, ancestor spirits began to evince a preference for American currency, especially $100 bills.Those who died before the fall of the Khmer Rouge government in 1979 still like gold bars, while younger spirits want dollars.\u201cThis generation knows U.S. dollars, so now we give them the dollars,\u201d said Kong Heang, 76, a retired gravedigger, who was sitting by a grave with his family, tucking into a feast of roast pig, cockles and beer, food that had been offered to his ancestors earlier that morning.And Cambodian riel?\u201cNo, never!\u201d he exclaimed with a guffaw.A similar process of spirit-world dollarization has been documented in neighboring Vietnam, which also saw an influx of dollars in the 1990s, although the government there has been much more successful in eliminating them.The anthropologist Heonik Kwon has shown how a more luxurious spirit economy, complete with a two-tiered monetary system in which some deities accepted Vietnamese dong and others preferred American \u201cdo la,\u201d sprang up alongside the market liberalization measures of the late 1980s. Those who died in the Vietnam War or ghosts from the former South Vietnam were particularly partial to receiving do la, he found.Ty Song, a government agronomist, was sitting on a tarp in front of his mother-in-law\u2019s grave as his family prepared a host of offerings: the ubiquitous roast baby pig, a platter of jasmine buds, cans of beer and condensed milk, plump grapes and longan fruits, homemade noodles, pork and eggs stewed in palm sugar, a cage of live birds, and a three-story paper mansion with an Audi parked out front and a grinning butler popping out of the door.Although the paper goods are burned, the food is usually left out and later consumed by the family, while the birds are set free to create luck.To accompany this were stacks of fake $100 bills and a fake Cambodian passport, stamped with visas allowing the bearer to travel to Australia, France, Japan and the Netherlands. A realistic boarding pass for a flight from Taipei to Sapporo was tucked inside.Mr. Ty Song noted that, unlike riel, dollars are widely accepted around the world and can be easily converted to other currencies at money-changing stalls, making it easier for ancestor spirits to travel abroad, a luxury that many Cambodians are beginning to enjoy.\u201cFor dollars, it\u2019s easy to spend them and easy to save them,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf we give them riel, it will be hard for them to convert it into dollars and spend it anywhere they go, but if we give them dollars they can spend it anywhere.\u201dWhat would they do with their American cash? Mr. Ty Song said he did not want to be too presumptuous in speculating about his forebears\u2019 desires.\u201cThe idea is just for them to have it to spend,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the money in the pocket, and whatever they spend it on is fine.\u201dNeou Vannarin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Housing Market Shakes Off a Slump", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s slowdown, which has cast a shadow over the global economy and worried investors around the world, stems in part from a deep slump in its crucial property market.Now that slump appears to be easing, as construction cranes return in some cities and real estate offices in some of the best neighborhoods fill up again with buying customers.Prices for new homes in the country\u2019s biggest cities are rising sharply, led by the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, where prices jumped a staggering 62 percent in March, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to official data released on Monday.The real estate resurgence comes as growth across the rest of the economy is slowing, providing a welcome and significant boost. Some economists estimate property accounts for as much as a quarter of China\u2019s gross domestic product.But the figures also provide more evidence that China is increasingly a two-track economy, something Premier Li Keqiang himself has nodded to, as the gap between winning and losing industries and regions has become increasingly pronounced.That raises the risk that the rebound is too narrow to be sustainable \u2014 it is concentrated in China\u2019s biggest and richest cities \u2014 and that it will not outgrow the huge oversupply of unsold homes that haunts China\u2019s smaller and farther-flung metropolises.The sharp price increases make it difficult for policy makers to justify further economic stimulus. They also raise the risk that the government could face complaints from urbanites getting priced out of the housing market.\u201cPeople living in major cities increasingly find property prices unaffordable,\u201d said Raymond Yeung, China economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\u201cAlthough the pickup of the property sector helps stabilize economic growth, it will also restrain the central bank\u2019s appetite for further monetary policy easing,\u201d Mr. Yeung added.Analysts noted that the current uptick in prices had been helped by illegal financing, in which sales agents or other third parties provide loans to cover down payments. That practice recently prompted a crackdown by the authorities.The rebound has meant brisk business for people like Wu Chao, a manager at a branch office of Maitian, a popular Beijing real estate agency.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In an interview on Monday at his sales office Shuangjing, an affluent area in central Beijing with a nice view of the main business district and a short walk to an international school, Mr. Wu explained some of the main reasons for the property price rally.Nearly all of the factors cited by Mr. Wu involved changes in or market reactions to government policy. Those included restrictions on home purchases in Beijing by nonresidents, the annual meeting last month of the national legislature, the official end of the one-child policy and recent central bank actions.Most wealthy Chinese prefer not to borrow for home purchases, settling the deals in cash instead. But Mr. Wu said a round of interest rate cuts had made mortgages increasingly attractive.\u201cEven very rich people sometimes would not pay the full amount,\u201d he said of this trend. \u201cThey will take advantage of loans to buy homes.\u201dStill, some economists doubt the recent rally can be sustained for much longer.Zhao Yang, the chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, pointed to the huge supply of homes either still under construction or completed but unsold. He calculates that floor space under construction is enough to supply more than six years\u2019 worth of sales.\u201cThe sector still faces long-term destocking pressures,\u201d Mr. Zhao wrote on Monday in an email.A turnaround in the government\u2019s policy stance is also a factor, as it seeks to limit the risk that the market could deflate in a messy fashion.\u201cDuring this round of price surge, there are signs of bubble factors,\u201d Mr. Zhao wrote. \u201cThe government has started to roll out policies to rein in the increase of housing prices.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Re-Enters International Bond Markets", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina returned to global bond markets on Monday after a 15-year hiatus, unveiling the biggest sovereign issuance by an emerging-market nation in two decades as the government ends a prolonged feud with hedge funds in New York.The country was receiving offers from investors for its sale of $10 billion to $15 billion of bonds. Most of the cash raised will go toward paying off a small number creditors, including the hedge fund billionaire Paul E. Singer, who had rejected restructuring offers and took Argentina to court seeking full payment after it defaulted in 2001.Although some investors remain cautious, the bonds are expected to attract broad interest. \u201cIt won\u2019t be very problematic for the government to get the $15 billion,\u201d Miguel Kiguel, an economist and former deputy finance secretary, wrote in El Cronista, a local business newspaper.Creditors accepted 70 to 75 percent of their claims in agreements earlier this year. The bond sale was expected to close on Tuesday, with the creditors receiving their money by Friday.Payment to the creditors is expected to total about $10.5 billion, ending a decade of mudslinging after the new government of President Mauricio Macri sought to reignite a sluggish economy with policies intended to lure foreign investors.\u201cThe issuance of external debt is likely to have a significant impact on the economy over the medium term,\u201d Edward Glossop, an economist who tracks Argentina for Capital Economics, an economic analysis firm in London, said in a research note.Argentina has included clauses in the new bonds intended to protect it from similar lawsuits in the future in the case of another default. If a majority of creditors agree to a restructuring, in theory everybody must conform.Even though investors look favorably on Mr. Macri\u2019s administration, Argentina is still viewed as risky. It therefore needs to pay higher rates on the bonds \u2014 about 7 to 9 percent \u2014 than some of its neighbors in Latin America have done in recent years.An article last Tuesday about Argentina\u2019s return to the bond market misstated the currencies in which bond sales were made in emerging markets. The bonds were sold in several currencies, not just the dollar. The article also misstated the amount of Mexico\u2019s bond sale in 1996. Mexico sold $18.1 billion of bonds, not $16 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Companies Poised to Take Leap in Developing a Driverless Car", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byGansha Wu was a veteran engineering manager at Intel Corporation and director of Intel Labs China when two events upended his world last year.First, he listened to the veteran technology writer Michael Malone tell an audience of Intel employees that if they were too cautious they would fail. Then he attended a leadership training session for Intel executives. The trainer told them that \u201cto be a leader is to design a future that is unpredictable and which nobody bets on.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t sleep at night, thinking about his well-ordered, 16-year career at Intel. So he decided to take a risk. With four colleagues, he made the decision to take the uncertain path, which today is becoming more common in China than even in Silicon Valley: He quit his job to begin a start-up that specializes in autonomous, or self-driving, cars.In the process, Mr. Wu hit upon a rare moment when a tech sector in China is developing in lock step with a similar but separate market in the United States.In fact, some argue that conditions in China are actually more favorable for quick adoption of driverless cars, in part because of more aggressive support from the national and local governments. And, unlike in the United States, China never fully developed a romance with the open road and car ownership.Car ownership has spiked in China, of course. And in recent years, it has become a middle-class status symbol to own a car. For the ultrawealthy, there are clubs dedicated to Ferraris and Maseratis.But enormous traffic jams in China\u2019s largest cities can make driving a less-than-romantic experience. Why not let a machine built with artificial intelligence inside do the work for you?Research done by the Boston Consulting Group suggests that within 15 years China will be the largest market for autonomous vehicles, said Xavier Mosquet, a managing director at the firm. Automated taxis will most likely lead the trend.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people are more willing to use the cars in Beijing or Shanghai, it\u2019s that the economic value is much higher in China than in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Mosquet said, adding that air pollution could be as much a catalyst as bad traffic.Even as American companies like Google and Tesla work on autonomous vehicles, a number of Chinese companies are working on driverless car technology. The Internet company Leshi Internet Information & Technology (better known as Letv) has a driverless car tech unit, and the Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors has opened a research center in Silicon Valley. The assumed leader in the field in China is the search engine company Baidu, which has been at work on autonomous vehicles since 2013.Among the torrent of start-ups, however, Mr. Wu and his colleagues are unusual because of their experience.Mr. Wu\u2019s company, Uisee Technology, has yet to announce its financial backers, but it has significant ambitions. The team plans to have a technology demonstration ready in less than a year at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas in 2017.\u201cHis team is an unusual collection of supertalent,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google in China. \u201cThey combine a mechanical expert from a university, a top computer vision expert and machine learning from Google as well as Gansha and his team of semiconductor experts. Gansha is an excellent leader that binds these people together.\u201dThe founders of Uisee, which is an acronym for Utilization, Indiscriminate, Safety, Efficiency and Environment, say they believe the company will find a profitable niche between the poles of the driverless car debate that is raging in Silicon Valley.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, has predicted that completely self-driving cars may be on the road in the United States in two to four years. Chris Urmson, the director of Google\u2019s self-driving-car program, has said his goal is to bring a self-driving car to market by 2019.Others are more cautious, and say they believe it may take a decade or longer for self-driving cars to hit the market. And among the biggest automakers like Toyota, the interest is less in cars that drive themselves than in cars that have artificial intelligence capabilities to assist drivers, like emergency braking.\u201cWe see a few stages toward fully autonomous driving,\u201d said Mr. Wu, adding that safety technologies are coming quickly. He said driver assistance systems will be followed by completely driverless cars in restricted circumstances, such as on private roads, fixed routes at low speed and in controlled environments. Uisee will begin by developing technologies that assist rather than replace drivers.Baidu has teamed up with BMW and recently said it was testing its technology in the United States. Baidu has said it is preparing to introduce automated public transportation services in China within the next two years.Unlike Google, which has had difficulty convincing regulators in its home state, California, that self-driving cars are ready for the road, Baidu already has the regulatory and infrastructure support of a number of local Chinese governments, which it will use to introduce small autonomous buses that will run set routes.The Chinese government is playing a major role in the overall driverless market. Along with empowering Baidu to run public transportation, in other cases central and local governments have been investing in research and development for driverless car projects.Mr. Wu also embodies a growing entrepreneurial movement in China. The Chinese government reported that 4.8 million new companies were registered from March 2014 to May 2015, a rate of 10,600 new businesses per day, or seven every minute. Even though venture investment has begun to dry up in China recently, the nation has clearly been infected with a Silicon Valley attitude.Although in some quarters it is still known as the land of copycat technology, China has long since moved on to copying the start-up ethos of the Valley, with more and more entrepreneurs creating their own companies.The Chinese government is encouraging the boom as a way to solve a number of economic problems, including unemployment and the transition of the economy from one centered on manufacturing to one based on services.\u201cThis year more than seven million people are entering the job market in China,\u201d said Haiyang Li, a professor at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University in Houston. \u201cWhat are they going to do with these students? The government does not have any better way to solve the employment issue.\u201dEven as analysts and investors worry the government is over-investing in start-ups, the state support, along with China\u2019s engineering talent and the business need for self-driving cars, could help the nascent business in China.But there are obstacles. In China, roads often have poorly marked lanes and little signage. People, animals, three-wheel rickshaws and trucks are liable to veer in front of a car at any time. That makes for a more challenging engineering problem in China, said Junyi Zhang, a partner with the consulting firm Roland Berger.\u201cIt is harder in China, where many roads have pedestrians, bicycles, low-speed vehicles and high-speed vehicles all mixed together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very complicated environment, and many don\u2019t ride or drive to the same standard.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Probably Cheaper on the Web, Adobe\u2019s Online Price Index Shows", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byIs the Internet making everything cheaper?Well, not everything, but a lot of things, according to Adobe, which has come up with a new index to track the price of goods. The company gets its results by crunching data on millions of online transactions it tracks through its online marketing service.The same held true for the price of household appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers. Online, appliance prices dropped 5.7 percent in the year to February, compared with a 2.7 percent decline in the government\u2019s price index equivalent.Furniture and bedding prices showed less of a fall online and in physical stores, but the spread between the two was still wide: a 2.5 percent decline, according to Adobe, compared with a 0.5 decline in the Consumer Price Index.The new price index from Adobe is meant to be a complement to the price index released by the Labor Department, which tracks fewer goods online, offering economists new data points. The numbers released on Thursday were the second monthly numbers from the company.The lower prices suggested by the digital index are good news if you\u2019re in the market for a new television or refrigerator. The index also has implications for our understanding of the wider economy.Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, who has been helping Adobe develop its index, said the Adobe figures suggest that the government\u2019s index could be underestimating deflation, or the overall fall in prices, in the economy.\u201cLarge parts of the economy, a fast-growing part, is now e-commerce-oriented,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. \u201cAnd Amazon\u2019s prices are much cheaper, and if everybody\u2019s doing their shopping on Amazon, then that should properly be taken into account in the inflation rate in a way it isn\u2019t now.\u201dHe said it could help explain why inflation remained low, for example, despite a booming jobs market.Researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics periodically conduct surveys with shoppers to figure out what products they buy and where, and based on those surveys, build a basket of goods. Then each month, inspectors go out to stores to check the prices of those goods \u2014 about 94,000 individual items.To try to keep the basket of goods current, the bureau updates about an eighth of the basket every six months. If consumers report buying items online, those items have a chance of being picked for the basket.But the bureau\u2019s own economists are the first to acknowledge there are several drawbacks to the process. Because these surveys take time, the composition of the basket of goods probably reflects consumer behavior from a few years ago, said Steve Reed, an economist with the bureau\u2019s consumer price program.So the index could lag in reflecting the shift in shopping to the web \u2014 and the lower prices that follow.\u201cIt\u2019s always been the case that we\u2019ve trailed actual consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Reed said.In comparison, the Adobe index tracks about 1.7 million consumer goods, all online, in real time. It can incorporate new goods quickly, and pick up price trends over days, not just months. For example, data from Black Friday last year showed that TV prices really did fall over all during that holiday weekend. So Black Friday may really be the best time to buy a new TV.And not all online prices were lower. Groceries bought online logged a cumulative inflation of 0.75 percent in the 12 months to February. Over the same period, the Consumer Price Index for that category fell 0.31 percent.That could be because shoppers who do their grocery shopping online tend to skew richer, Ms. Gaffney said, and are less likely to shop around on different sites to find the best prices. Shoppers may also be less likely to invest effort into finding a good deal for a carton of milk online as opposed to, say, a tablet.Over all, though, brick-and-mortar stores are facing pressure to match the low prices of their online rivals. Shoppers regularly use smartphones to compare prices right in the store\u2019s aisles.The importance of online prices will continue to grow as shopping shifts online, Ms. Gaffney. Since the Adobe index was introduced last month, Adobe has begun tracking appliances, toys and furniture, and will continue to add more categories, she said.\u201cA lot of things you\u2019d think aren\u2019t online are starting to move online, like restaurant orders. So it\u2019s always possible that something you think of as purely offline could become more trackable via digital big data,\u201d she said.Still, the government index tracks products we don\u2019t buy online and most likely won\u2019t for a long time, like gas or hospital services. That makes the index a good measure of prices in the wider economy.\u201cPeople will always pay attention to the C.P.I. as a measure of inflation,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. \u201cBut I\u2019d think everybody who cares about the cost of living \u2014 like the Fed making monetary decisions, the government making forecasts and people evaluating how incomes have changed in real terms \u2014 have to at least wonder in their minds whether they\u2019re measuring things correctly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY Since we can\u2019t tell the future, we make a best guess. But what information do we trust, which past experiences do we draw from and what instincts do we follow? And that\u2019s to say nothing of the influences of which we may not even be aware. Starting in the 1970s, the field of behavioral economics began examining how humans make decisions based on actual behavior, rather than pure logic. Behavioral economists, psychologists, neuroscientists and others are researching the question of how we make decisions. Their studies show that we as humans \u2014 and investors \u2014 make decisions in many different ways. Very often these choices are not purely rational. Instead, they\u2019re driven by intuition and biology. In an age where we\u2019re learning more about our physiology through technology, we\u2019re also learning how to make better decisions.Two Israeli psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, began studying an approach to decision-making based on human behavior in the 1970s. First termed heuristics-and-biases, it would become the foundation of the field we know today as behavioral economics. In short, heuristics examine the rules of thumb we use to make decisions when information, time, or both, is scarce. These can often reveal cognitive flaws in human judgment, however. Behavioral economics was built on a method of decision making called decision analysis. This approach requires that each potential choice be thought through to its logical end. In other words, a pros and cons list. Take how we choose which apartment to rent, for example. It can be effective if the information is reliable, but it\u2019s often time consuming. Worse, if the information is flawed \u2014 it turns out the lack of water pressure is the reason the rent is so cheap \u2014 the outcomes can be disastrous.The person doesn\u2019t know why they have this feeling. Yet, this is strong enough to make an individual act on it.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, humans don\u2019t always think completely rationally. Often we make decisions based on past experiences, analogies or basic instincts. Take the heuristic known as \u201cthe gambler\u2019s fallacy,\u201d that compels us to choose heads in a coin toss just because the last flip showed tails.click & drag the brain to view moreTouch & drag the brain to view moreHow the Brain Influences DecisionsWhen confronted with decisions, different regions of the brain become more active based on a mix of emotion, instinct and reasoning.Striatum and amygdalaThe limbic structures of the striatum and the almond-shaped pair of amygdala at its base are responsible for our most base and instinctual perceptions of reward and fear.InsulaIn the limbic region and one of the earliest evolutionary components of the brain, the insula helps control decisions based on instinct and emotion.Ventromedial prefrontal cortexThis region of the brain is vital in decision making as it helps process risk and fear by inhibiting emotion.Dorsolateral prefrontal cortexOne of the most recently evolved areas of the brain, it controls deliberative decisions based on reasoning.Yet another approach is commonly known as gut feeling. This form of decision making relies on a mix of rules of thumb, past experiences and, well, guts. Billionaire investor George Soros once famously credited his back pain for helping him realize flaws in his portfolio. As Gerd Gigerenzer, a social psychologist who champions the approach put it to The New York Times: \u201cThe person doesn\u2019t know why they have this feeling. Yet, this is strong enough to make an individual act on it.\u201dThe latest work being done on decision making, however, has to do with our biology. Neuroeconomics, a field that\u2019s more or less grown up from behavioral economics, is assessing how regions of the brain impact decisions. By using the scanning technology of MRI machines, scientists such as Colin Camerer, California Institute of Technology neuroeconomist and 2013 MacArthur Fellow, have discovered that two complementary regions of the brain influence most decisions humans make. Our capability to make rational and logical decisions is controlled by the prefrontal cortex. However, when our decisions are based more on emotion, the limbic areas of the brain take over.Each region has its pros and cons and may explain some of the cognitive flaws seen in heuristics and gut feelings. For example, humans tend to be disproportionately loss averse. If given the same odds of winning $150 versus losing $100, most people won\u2019t take the gamble. However, such aversion to risk \u2014 driven by emotion \u2014 has powerful evolutionary significance and may better allow humans to work together effectively within social groups.An analytical approach based on examining the pros and cons of each potential course of action.Data-driven and thorough.Time consuming.

If it\u2019s the right choice, testosterone rises, compelling the decision maker to take more aggressive stances. If not, cortisol becomes the dominant hormone, prompting less risky choices or the compulsion to no action at all. \u201cIt turns out that what's really driving our performance is taking place below the level of consciousness,\u201d says Coates, pointing out that these responses are part of \u201ca single functioning unit.\u201dThe reaction may in part explain gut feelings, according to Camerer: \u201cThere are clearly biological processes. The gut is just part of a body/brain system that\u2019s encoding emotion and cognition and trying to figure out what to do.\u201dThat uncertainty is where things can get tricky. According to Coates\u2019 research, appetite for risk has a tipping point. With more success, testosterone levels often rise and can impair judgment. It\u2019s often manifested physically, according to Coates.\u201cYou can see it in posture changes, the way speech changes,\u201d he says, referring to the increased confidence that testosterone often inspires. \u201cIt\u2019s this incredible body- and brain-wide transformation that takes place.\u201dWhen testosterone increases, we become more reckless in our decision making, making choices with too much risk and too little reward. Should things go poorly, the pendulum swings the other direction and cortisol levels spike. This shift can happen to anyone, investor or otherwise.\u201cIt\u2019s all the same biology,\u201d says Coates.On a macroeconomic level, however, the downswing can have more dire consequences than the upswing. Once \u201cMasters of the Universe,\u201d investors, for example, might be become cagey at precisely the most inopportune time.We react to circumstances and make decisions based on influences from a number of aspects of our physiology, including our brains, our hormones and our physical organs.It\u2019s our brains that often interpret signals they create and receive from biological processes, such as hormone release or stress indicators.Confronted with a stressful decision, biometric technology can pick up on an increase in breathing rate, a natural stress response.As adrenaline increases and our heart works to supply oxygen to muscles throughout the body, our pulse quickens, another indicator of stress.As a non-necessary function during times of stress, our stomach will contract and reduce blood flow, a feeling commonly called \u201cthe butterflies.\u201dPart of the wider endocrine system that produces hormones and regulates a number of bodily functions, these glands are the main production centers of cortisol and adrenaline, two chemicals central to stress response and decision making.When we\u2019re faced with challenging decisions, the primary sweat glands in our palms and under our arms become more active.We react to circumstances and make decisions based on influences from a number of aspects of our physiology, including our brains, our hormones and our physical organs.\u201cEqually important is when the risk aversion on the down side turns into inadvertent pessimism,\u201d says Coates. Just when opportunities for investment are at their most lucrative, investors shrink in fear. It\u2019s especially problematic during a recession, when investment is needed to get the market back on its feet. \u201cIn a sense, [pessimism] is more dangerous.\u201dThe consequences of this pessimism can be dire for investors on both a personal and market level. Indeed, a separate study by psychologist Sonia Bishop of the University of California has shown that anxiety often leads to poor decision making. On a market level, anxiety can ripple through an entire economy, suffocating investment. For example, it took seven years for the New York Stock Exchange to fully recover from the 1987 crash.But what if we could identify how our biological responses are affecting our decision making? Many of the signs that signal overconfidence are present in biological responses: heart rates increase, speech becomes quicker, palms sweatier, breathing more rapid. Today, biological signals such as these are easily detected using biometrics.The implications could be tremendous for investors who now have an additional source of data that reveals not only how the market is behaving, but their own bodies as well.It\u2019s so difficult for humans to be objective about our own behavior.\u201dHumanyze, a company that\u2019s developed biosensing work badges equipped with microphones and positioning technology, has discovered that something as simple as a person\u2019s speech patterns can reveal a lot about their stress levels and how they might make decisions. Having this additional information could mean better choices, especially when it\u2019s time to be optimistic instead of pessimistic. New technological advances in biosensing and biometrics are revealing new insights into decision making and how to make better choices. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult for humans to be objective about our own behavior,\u201d says Humanyze CEO Ben Waber. But biometrics provides us with what he calls \u201can objective mirror: here is where you are, this is what you\u2019re like.\u201dAs technology gives us the capacity for more information, it is also giving us the tools to make wiser decisions, and better investments.Photography by Martin KlimasThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "How Hedge Funds Held Argentina for Ransom", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsPERHAPS the most complex trial in history between a sovereign nation, Argentina, and its bondholders \u2014 including a group of United States-based hedge funds \u2014 officially came to an end yesterday when the Argentine Senate ratified a settlement.The resolution was excellent news for a small group of well-connected investors, and terrible news for the rest of the world, especially countries that face their own debt crises in the future.In late 2001, Argentina defaulted on $132 billion in loans during its disastrous depression. Gross domestic product dropped by 28 percent, 57.5 percent of Argentines were living in poverty, and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to above 20 percent, leading to riots and clashes that resulted in 39 deaths.Unable to pay its creditors, Argentina restructured its debt in two rounds of negotiations. The package discounted the bonds by two-thirds but provided a mechanism for more payments when the country\u2019s economy recovered, which it did. A vast majority of the bondholders \u2014 93 percent \u2014 accepted the deal.Among the small minority who refused the deal were investors who had bought many of their bonds at a huge discount, well after the country defaulted and even after the first round of restructuring. These kinds of investors have earned the name vulture funds by buying up distressed debt, then, often aided by lawyers and lobbyists, trying to force a settlement.The companies involved included some of the best-known vulture funds, including NML Capital, a subsidiary of Elliott Management, a hedge fund co-led by Paul Singer, a major contributor to the Republican Party, as well as Aurelius Capital and Dart Management. NML, which had the largest claim in the Argentina case, was the lead litigant of a group of bondholders in New York federal courts.For a long time, Argentina refused to pay the holdouts. The funds tried all sorts of ways to change the country\u2019s position, including, at one point, having an iconic Argentine ship seized in Ghana.Then a 2012 ruling by Judge Thomas Griesa of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York threw the game in the vulture funds\u2019 favor, ruling that Argentina had to pay them back at full value, a cost to Argentina of $4.65 billion. NML, for example, would get a total return of 1,500 percent on its initial investment, according to our calculations, because of the cheap prices it paid for the debt and because of a \u201ccompensatory\u201d interest rate of 9 percent under New York law.The judge gave the vultures the weapon they needed: Argentina had to either pay them off or renege on the default they had negotiated, ruining the country\u2019s credit in the future and threatening its recovery.On Thursday, Argentina finally settled for something close to the terms that Judge Griesa set. NML Capital will receive about half of the total agreement \u2014 $2.28 billion for its investment of about $177 million, a total return of 1,180 percent. (Argentina also paid the legal fees for the vultures.)This resolution will carry a high price for the international financial system, encouraging other funds to hold out and making debt restructuring virtually impossible. Why would bondholders accept a haircut if they could wait and get exorbitant returns for a small investment?In some ways, Argentina was an outlier. It fought aggressively for the best terms from the initial set of bondholders, setting the stage for a spectacular recovery: From 2003 to 2008, until the global financial crisis intruded, the country grew 8 percent per year on average, and unemployment declined to 7.8 percent from more than 20 percent. In the end, the creditors who had accepted the initial restructuring got the principal value in full and even 40 percent more.Most countries are intimidated by the creditors and accept what is demanded, with often devastating consequences. According to our figures, 52 percent of sovereign restructurings with private creditors since 1980 have been followed by another restructuring or default within five years. Greece, the most recent example, restructured its debt in 2012, and only a few years later it is in desperate need of more relief.It\u2019s common to hear the phrase \u201cmoral hazard\u201d when looking at countries that face crushing debt, like Greece or Argentina. Moral hazard refers to the idea that allowing countries (or companies or people) to renegotiate and lower their debts only reinforces the profligate behavior that put them in debt in the first place. Better that the debtor faces disapproval and harsh consequences. But the Argentina deal reversed the moral hazard by rewarding investors for making small bets and reaping huge rewards.Britain and Belgium have made particular kinds of vulture suits illegal. Similar legislation, with bipartisan support, stalled in Congress in 2009. Last September, the United Nations overwhelmingly approved nine principles that should guide sovereign debt restructuring. During the debate, one ambassador apologized to actual vultures \u2014 the birds \u2014 for using the term. (One of us, Martin Guzman, made presentations to both the United Nations and to the Argentine Senate, but was not paid in either case.)Only six countries voted against, but as those are the major jurisdictions for sovereign lending (including the United States), these principles will not be very effective.Many countries have bankruptcy laws. But there is no equivalent framework for sovereign bankruptcies, not even something remotely close to that. The United Nations has taken the lead to fill this vacuum, and as Argentina\u2019s case proves, the initiative is more important than ever.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Again Looks Upstate for Win in New York", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton\u2019s political ascent can be traced to the time in 1999 when she expressed her support for dairy farmers in the upstate New York village of Endicott. And the summer that year when she shunned Martha\u2019s Vineyard to vacation in Skaneateles, and promised voters in the depleted industrial city of Schenectady that as a New York senator she would revive the upstate economy.Now, 16 years later, Mrs. Clinton is again promising to bring jobs back to the region as she courts the people who helped secure her first election victory. But this time her message is colliding with a surprisingly potent threat from the left and doubts about her ability to deliver.Her current effort, which advisers say is critical not just to winning the New York primary on April 19 but to swaying voters nationwide to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s style of pragmatic problem solving, comes as she looks to rebound after losing six of the last seven primary elections to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Of all the battles this primary season, this will be the most personal.As Mrs. Clinton contemplated a Senate run, upstate represented her test as to whether a polarizing first lady not from New York could win over skeptics in traditionally Republican areas.In 2016, the region once again represents a test of whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s message can resonate, this time among voters who have gravitated to Mr. Sanders\u2019s brand of economic populism. \u201cHer work as senator in upstate New York can serve as a blueprint for how she would seek to create the good-paying jobs of the future as president,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior policy director, Jake Sullivan.Spanning vast territory north of New York City and its suburbs, the region has long suffered from the decline in American manufacturing, with jobs disappearing and residents deciding to leave.At a rally on Monday in Cohoes, north of Albany, Mrs. Clinton recalled working to obtain funding to invest in the nanotechnology industry in the area. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do across upstate \u2014 indeed, across America,\u201d she said, vowing to be the \u201cpresident who brings manufacturing back to upstate New York and America.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton will continue to campaign in New York City, to solidify her strength among minority voters, recent polls show that the fight to win New York could be waged in places like the Rochester area and Buffalo, where she plans to campaign on Friday.A victory in the area is psychologically important for her as well. Mrs. Clinton harbors an emotional attachment to upstate, even making sure that her State Department office always had a fresh shipment of New York apples and putting wine ice cream from the Finger Lakes on the dessert menu at official dinners. Campaigning in Depew on Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton said her years in the Senate working to help New Yorkers were \u201cthe happiest she ever was.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s critics say that she failed to deliver on the centerpiece of her 2000 push \u2014 a promise to bring 200,000 jobs to New York \u2014 and many cities upstate have higher unemployment than when she became a senator. The number of private-sector jobs in upstate New York remained virtually stagnant in the eight years Mrs. Clinton served in the Senate, according to state Department of Labor statistics.Her 2000 Republican Senate opponent, Rick A. Lazio, called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s jobs promise \u201ca cynical play to attract voters in the hard-hit areas\u201d and likened it to the unrealistic vows made by Mr. Trump in his presidential campaign. \u201cThe people were desperate for hope, and some voters embraced the false promise,\u201d Mr. Lazio said.To combat Mr. Sanders\u2019s message, Mrs. Clinton and a lineup of influential New York surrogates, including Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, plan to take voters down a memory lane of proposals, from the quirky to the conventional, that she advanced to spur the upstate economy.Representative Louise M. Slaughter told a crowd in Rochester on Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton \u201cbrought Japanese businessmen here by the planeload to help us rebuild our economy.\u201dIn Depew, near Buffalo, on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton provided an extemporaneous laundry list of her efforts upstate, including a partnership with eBay that trained craft makers in mill towns on the Erie Canal to sell their goods online, and efforts to transform a vacant car dealership in Buffalo into an artist\u2019s work space, funnel federal funding to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and protect the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station.An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.\u201cShe worked so hard to get you all that money \u2014 for things that may seem small,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, \u201cbut if you did it in every city in America, it would make a huge difference.\u201dDefending her economic record, Mrs. Clinton has said the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Great Recession and a Republican administration prevented her, as a freshman senator, from fulfilling her jobs promise. \u201cWe had a very difficult situation with the Bush administration,\u201d she said Monday in an interview on \u201cCapital Tonight,\u201d an upstate cable news program.Robert Hockett, a professor of law at Cornell who specializes in financial regulation and is supporting Mr. Sanders, said his anti-trade message would resonate as it has in other economically ravaged areas.\u201cUpstate New York is the classic Rust Belt on the one hand and the classic working-poor rural population on the other hand,\u201d Mr. Hockett said. \u201cThe things Bernie wants to do are things this population generally agrees with.\u201dChristopher Ryan, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1123, which represents Verizon and American Red Cross workers in Syracuse, said that he backed Mrs. Clinton in 2000 but that the area had been eviscerated by jobs moving overseas. He plans to vote for Mr. Sanders, whom the union has endorsed.\u201cYou see the weeds growing through the parking lots at factories,\u201d he said.Arlene Maynard, 73, a retired school bus driver from Greece, near Rochester, said Mr. Sanders was too far to the left. She plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton, but thought she would be hurt by the frustration some voters are feeling. \u201cAlthough they say everything\u2019s good, a lot of people don\u2019t think it\u2019s that good,\u201d she said.Unlike voters in other primary states, many people in upstate New York have met Mrs. Clinton.Joan Shearin, 65, a retired respiratory therapist from Batavia, like many local Democrats, spoke fondly of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s time in the Senate. \u201cWhen something needed to be done, she was doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cShe never hid herself.\u201d\u201cWe have a friend that was a dairy farmer, and they were having all kinds of troubles with different regulations,\u201d she said, adding that Mrs. Clinton showed up and \u201cwent through the barn.\u201cShe took a tour of everything,\u201d Ms. Shearin said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything beneath her.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sekou Davis, 41, a street vendor selling umbrellas and roses, said he voted for her because of her gender.\u201cI have two daughters, a sister and a mother, and I believe that the heart of our nation is really through the woman,\u201d he said.\u201cOne of the senators said, \u2018Joe, you have a reputation for independence, we\u2019re going to have to work on that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sestak said.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been forgiven\u201d for running against Mr. Specter, he added.Mr. Sestak, 64, had far greater name recognition and began the race with a big lead. But Ms. McGinty, 52, narrowed the gap in its waning days.But Erik Pihlgren, 43, who is black, voted for Mr. Van Hollen. He said Ms. Edwards\u2019s argument that the Senate needed a black woman\u2019s voice did not resonate with him. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a qualifier,\u201d he said.Democrats nearly always prevail in Maryland, especially in presidential years. (In 2014, Maryland picked a Republican, Larry Hogan, for governor.) Ms. Mikulski\u2019s planned retirement also created hard-fought Democratic primaries to succeed Mr. Van Hollen and Ms. Edwards.In Baltimore, a majority black city, the legacy of Freddie Gray\u2019s death hovered over Tuesday\u2019s voting.Some of the hundreds of poll workers who showed up for training on how to distribute pamphlets for Ms. Pugh arrived late \u2014 or had not previously signed up \u2014 and were told they would not be paid the $100 they expected. They grew unruly, smashing a window and slashing tires on two Pugh campaign vehicles.Ms. Pugh stepped in to quell the violence, said her spokesman, Anthony McCarthy, and insisted that all workers be paid. \u201cIt was a very trying morning,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Kwame Rose, 21, a self-described \u201ccollege dropout\u201d who was moved to activism by Mr. Gray\u2019s death, voted for the first time on Tuesday. Mr. Rose, who had been organizing protests this past year, was escorted to the polls by Ms. Pugh, whom he endorsed.\u201cIt was phenomenal,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cIt was far easier, but a far greater power as an individual than I ever could imagine.\u201dJon Hurdle contributed reporting from Philadelphia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen and Fed Predecessors Find Common Ground Onstage", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Thursday that she did not regret the decision to start raising interest rates in December.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t regard it as a mistake,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cI said at the time and continue to feel that the economy had made very substantial progress.\u201dThe Fed has put off further increases, but Ms. Yellen said it remained on a \u201creasonable path\u201d toward higher rates as economic growth continues.She spoke at a joint appearance with her three living predecessors that was billed as a discussion of leadership but inevitably became just another opportunity to ask present and past Fed officials about their economic outlook.The people in the audience at International House in Morningside Heights, many of whom paid $1,000 for their tickets, got to hear Ms. Yellen reprise the upbeat economic assessment she has offered in other recent remarks.\u201cThis is an economy on a solid course, not a bubble economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe U.S. economy has been doing well and domestic strength has been propelling us forward despite the fact that we have been suffering a drag from the global economy.\u201dShe added that labor market conditions were \u201cvastly improved.\u201dShe was joined onstage by Paul A. Volcker, the Fed\u2019s chairman from 1979 to 1987, and Ben S. Bernanke, who served as chairman from 2006 to 2014. Alan Greenspan, who served in between, appeared by video link from Washington, D.C.All three agreed that the economy seemed to be in decent shape. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a bubble economy,\u201d Mr. Volcker said.The economy has grown slowly but steadily for almost seven years, and some commentators have taken to fretting that a recession looms. Mr. Bernanke, however, said there was no evidence that expansions end merely because of old age.\u201cThe risk of a recession is more or less constant in every year,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to think a recession is any more likely in 2016 than in 2015 or 2014.\u201dThe event was an atypical forum for Ms. Yellen and her predecessors, who last appeared together in public at the Fed\u2019s 100th anniversary celebration in 2013. Mr. Volcker is also a former chairman of International House, a residence for young scholars, and the event inaugurated a new speaker series in his honor.As audience members entered the hall, they were serenaded by a tenor with a guitar, Gonzalo Llanes Mena, who sang \u201cO Sole Mio\u201d and other Italian classics.There were moments of levity. As Ms. Yellen was explaining that the economy was in good shape, Mr. Greenspan sneezed loudly into his microphone.Asked how he would reduce the Fed\u2019s vast bond holdings, Mr. Bernanke, no longer the Fed\u2019s chairman, responded, \u201cFortunately, I don\u2019t have to.\u201dThe moderator, Fareed Zakaria of CNN, asked about having so much power.Mr. Bernanke responded that he saw it as mostly a matter of having a lot of responsibility. Mr. Greenspan joked that he liked the public\u2019s adulation. \u201cI very much appreciated that,\u201d he said. \u201cI got past the embarrassment very easily.\u201dMr. Volcker, by contrast, was the subject of widespread public anger for his efforts to bring inflation under control, which pushed the economy into recession. Mr. Zakaria asked if he worried at the time that he might be doing the wrong thing.\u201cDid I worry?\u201d repeated Mr. Volcker. \u201cI worried all the time.\u201d He said he wore a path into the rug in his office at the Fed.The four leaders did not emphasize their differences.Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, who worked closely together in shaping the Fed\u2019s response to the financial crisis, presented a united front Thursday, defending the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign and its ability to return to a more normal footing.The rate increase in December, Ms. Yellen said, demonstrated the Fed had the ability to tighten monetary policy \u201cas we think will be appropriate for the economy.\u201d\u201cThere were a lot of fears around this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people didn\u2019t really understand the economics of this properly. Nothing terrible happened.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s job has famously been described as being responsible for taking away the punch bowl before the party gets out of control. Mr. Volcker in other contexts has suggested the Fed is losing its sense of responsibility. But asked whether the Fed had taken to adding more vodka instead, he demurred.\u201cI watch all of my successors with great awe,\u201d he said.There was also consensus that fiscal policy needs to play a larger role in promoting economic growth.\u201cMonetary policy should not have the whole load of getting us out of this phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Greenspan said. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally a fiscal problem.\u201dMr. Volcker and Mr. Greenspan saw obscurity and confusion as useful tools during their tenures; Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, by contrast, saw greater value in clarity.On Thursday, they agreed that it\u2019s hard to speak clearly.\u201cI think the real problem is that monetary policy is very largely economic forecasting and our ability to forecast is significantly limited,\u201d Mr. Greenspan said.That, however, has not diminished the public\u2019s appetite to hear them try.Advertisement"}

By way of proof, consider the scorching production of \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d running at the indoor Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe through April 22.This account of the play opened quietly in the wake of a far splashier \u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d on the West End, starring and co-directed by Kenneth Branagh. That production also boasted the box office catnip of the sublime Judi Dench as Paulina, the play\u2019s voice of moral reason and authority.But, in portraying a ferocity that eventually yields to high spirits and hard-won forgiveness, the director Michael Longhurst\u2019s reckoning with this tricky late-Shakespeare play beats Mr. Branagh\u2019s hands down. From the jealous Leontes\u2019s assertion near the start that \u201cmy wife is slippery,\u201d Mr. Longhurst never loses his grip on the tonal shifts of a work that couples fury and recrimination with a post-intermission ribaldry that can be tough sledding in many a \u201cWinter\u2019s Tale\u201d but manages to be cheekily engaging here.Scarcely have we been informed of the \u201ctwin lambs\u201d that the two kings, Leontes of Sicilia and Polixenes of Bohemia, were in their youth before Leontes (John Light) turns wrathfully against his confrere Polixenes (Simon Armstrong). The putative cause of this royal rage is none other than Leontes\u2019s own wife, Hermione (Rachael Stirling), whom he is soon deriding as \u201ca bedswerver\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a ripe aspersion for you! \u2014 as his turmoil leads to at least one death on the way to as rending a finish as Shakespeare ever wrote.The trap with Leontes is to make a meal of the character\u2019s wayward psyche, but the excellent Mr. Light forsakes grandstanding in favor of a direct attack on the part that is here so unsparing that it is difficult to behold; you are left unsure what further spasms of violence might erupt or the form they could take.It is no surprise, then, that the wronged Hermione seems both physically and emotionally incapacitated by her husband\u2019s ill judgment. A throaty Ms. Stirling all but appears to give up on life before \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 partaking of a climactic scene of regeneration and renewal characteristic of the four late Shakespeare plays with which this play is running in repertory at the Globe.The second half of \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d hurtles forward in time and shifts from the grim landscape of Leontes\u2019s grievous court to the sheep-shearing frolics of Bohemia, which is to say to those antic passages in Shakespeare that often look as if they are probably more fun to perform than they are to watch; Sir Toby Belch and his rambunctious colleagues in \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d come to mind.Happily, Mr. Longhurst allows the close confines of this newer bijou theater \u2014 the Sam Wanamaker opened in January 2014 \u2014 to amplify the Bohemian anarchy. The company seizes every opportunity for improvisation and extra-textual wordplay, as is the wont at this address: \u201cWait, I\u2019ve got short legs,\u201d the Sicilian lord Camillo (Fergal McElherron) says as he clambers into the center-stage drollery presided over by the roguish Autolycus (an irrepressible James Garnon). Nor can I recall Shakespeare referencing either sexual stimulants or a recipe for risotto, both of which get folded into the language here.But the frivolity sets up the glorious final passages, which return us to Sicilia and a newly chastened Leontes who watches as the wise but firm Paulina (an elegantly impassioned Niamh Cusack) acts as the play\u2019s resident shaman, doing what she can to put all to rights in a production that doesn\u2019t put a foot wrong.There is tyranny aplenty, not to mention the potential for tomfoolery, in \u201cPericles,\u201d another in the quartet of offerings at the Globe. (\u201cCymbeline\u201d and \u201cThe Tempest\u201d complete the lineup, the first of those announcing a star-to-be in the radiant Emily Barber as its guileless heroine.) For a comparatively obscure title, \u201cPericles\u201d is having a moment on both sides of the Atlantic; the veteran English director Trevor Nunn is responsible for a commendably robust production now in its final week at Theater for a New Audience in Brooklyn.Alas \u2014 at least as encountered relatively late in its run \u2014 the acting in the Globe \u201cPericles\u201d is as hammy as it is unadorned in \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale.\u201d One feels as if all concerned were taking their cue from the cutesy Gower proffered by an impish Sheila Reid. Cast as a choral figure who acts as an M.C., Ms. Reid widens her eyes on lines like \u201cOoh, what shall be next?\u201d the audience treated like schoolchildren being invited out to play.\u201cPericles\u201d is the penultimate production at this address of the laudable artistic director Dominic Dromgoole, who is passing the reins to Emma Rice. Here, the play comes credited to Shakespeare and his contemporary, George Wilkins. The joint authorship may account for the scattershot qualities of a sprawling text that is far more structurally diffuse than \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d and sorely needs a more-authoritative Gower to keep events on track.Several of \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d cast also appear in \u201cPericles,\u201d starting with James Garnon, whose Pericles would benefit from the economy of effect that Mr. Light brings to Leontes. (Mr. Garnon\u2019s vocal swoops seem especially self-conscious.) Conversely, Jessica Baglow is often unintelligible in the defining role of Pericles\u2019s daughter Marina \u2014 an especially notable problem in such an enclosed space.Yet there is an undeniable benefit from experiencing all four of these productions and allowing their shared themes to ricochet off one another.Some have knottier plots than others, and only \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d is quite so emphatic on the topic of \u201cwonder,\u201d but taken together, these so-called romances offer a rare opportunity to play Shakespearean compare and contrast. Mr. Branagh\u2019s \u201cWinter\u2019s Tale,\u201d meanwhile, made history last Sunday night at the 40th annual Laurence Olivier Awards \u2014 London\u2019s equivalent of the Tonys \u2014 when it brought Ms. Dench her eighth trophy, for her casually fierce Paulina. Her first such prize came in 1977 for playing Lady Macbeth.The bard got many a shout-out elsewhere during the ceremony, with the host Michael Ball interrupting wearisomely smutty patter to remark that Shakespeare had won more Oliviers than any other writer \u2014 66 in all for the various artists who have presented his works over time.\u201cI\u2019d love to know who his agent is,\u201d Mr. Ball quipped. (The statuette itself depicts Olivier in his signature role as Henry V.)The wealth was spread among titles both familiar and new, veteran actors (Kenneth Cranham, an immensely deserving best actor recipient for \u201cThe Father\u201d) and younger shooting stars (Denise Gough, of the Duncan Macmillian play \u201cPeople, Places and Things\u201d). And even when Shakespeare\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the label, so to speak, he lingered in the air by association. Imelda Staunton, who won best actress in a musical for her role in \u201cGypsy,\u201d did her bit by describing that show\u2019s lyricist, Stephen Sondheim, as the American Shakespeare. This April 23 may signal the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death, but more than ever, it seems, he walks among us in life.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the last name of the actor in \u201cPericles.\u201d He is James Garnon, not Garmon.Advertisement"}

In essence, it is a referendum on the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, which has been in power since 2003. Ms. Rousseff, who was re-elected in 2014 for a four-year term, is being blamed for the country\u2019s economic crisis and the overlapping corruption investigations that have ensnarled much of Brazil\u2019s political establishment.The motion to impeach now moves to the Senate, which can approve or reject it with a simple majority. If the Senate votes to impeach Ms. Rousseff next month, she will be forced to step down temporarily while senators consider the allegations against her. If she is found guilty, Vice President Michel Temer, a former ally of Ms. Rousseff, who has turned against her, will take power.The president faces two main choices. She can call for early elections, appeasing those who believe that the country\u2019s political crisis is unlikely to be solved until a new leader is elected. Or she can fight the impeachment and hope to somehow regain the public\u2019s trust.In a defiant address to the nation on Monday afternoon, Ms. Rousseff called the impeachment proceedings a \u201ccoup,\u201d and she vowed to stay in office until the end of her mandate in 2018 for the sake of democracy. \u201cThis is just the beginning of the fight, which will be long and democratic,\u201d she said.If she is to survive politically, Ms. Rousseff will have to present a clear vision to mend Brazil\u2019s economy and to root out the type of corruption that has become business as usual in Bras\u00edlia. Accomplishing that will require stronger leadership and clearer ideas than she\u2019s been able to muster so far.An editorial on Tuesday misstated in some copies the length of the term Dilma Rousseff of Brazil won in 2014 and when it is set to end.

{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Growth Slows, Banks Feel the Strain of Bad Debt", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 For Chinese banks, the decision to lend to companies like Bohai Steel was for years a no-brainer. Lenders took heart from its state backing, which appeared as solid as the millions of tons of steel pipes that rolled off its production lines each year.That ironclad image is now tarnished. Plunging demand and a worsening glut in production capacity have left Bohai Steel struggling to repay as much as $30 billion in debt. Worried creditors \u2014 more than 100 of them \u2014 are locked in negotiations with the company and local officials.The stakes are high for banks and for the Communist Party, which ultimately controls wide swaths of China\u2019s economy.China\u2019s total local currency loans have more than tripled since the start of 2009, to 98.6 trillion renminbi, or about $15 trillion, at the end of March, according to official Chinese figures from CEIC, a data provider. That is equal to 144 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product in the 12 months to the end of March \u2014 relatively high for China\u2019s level of development, and still rising. In January, Goldman Sachs said other countries that experienced similar debt run-ups faced either financial crises or prolonged slowdowns.Defaults tend not to pose a risk to individual Chinese banks because the government is perceived as standing behind them. But a chain of defaults could lead to a pullback in lending that could crimp China\u2019s economic output, said Anne Stevenson-Yang, a co-founder of J Capital Research.\u201cCompanies that default are not individually all that important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you allow them to default categorically, then you are sending a message that this-and-that type of debt can default, and people stop lending.\u201dProfit growth at China\u2019s biggest state-owned banks stalled in the first three months of the years as bad loans mounted. Bad loans as a share of their total portfolio remains low, at less than 2.5 percent, but economists believe the figure understates the problem because banks often extend the payment dates for problem debt.Bohai Steel has not disclosed details of its debt, and it is unclear which banks might be affected. But it regularly did business with China\u2019s biggest state-run banks, as well as local and regional banking groups also tied to the state.Since the beginning of this year, company executives have lobbied for more support from banks, as slowing growth and a property slump have reduced China\u2019s demand for steel. In January it met with officials from China Bohai Bank, a lender that like Bohai Steel counts the city of Tianjin as a major shareholder. At the meeting, according to a statement from Bohai Steel, Yan Zesheng, general manager of Bohai Steel Group, said he hoped the bank would \u201ccontinue to offer robust financial support\u201d to the company.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Over the years, the company stressed its ties to lenders including the Bank of China, Industrial Bank and Citic Bank, among others, according to statements on its website. In 2013, the company said, it received a roughly $4.6 billion line of credit from Bank of China. A recent article in Caixin, a respected Chinese financial news outlet, said Bohai Steel\u2019s 105 creditors included at least three local banks in Tianjin and Beijing that were each owed more than 10 billion renminbi.One of those lenders identified by Caixin, the Bank of Tianjin, raised nearly $1 billion in a Hong Kong public offering last month. The bank\u2019s listing document did not mention Bohai Steel but said that nonperforming corporate loans \u2014 or loans that had gone sour \u2014 rose 46 percent between the end of 2014 and September of 2015, the most recent data available. It cited the Chinese economy and problems in the steel industry.Neither Bohai Steel nor the banks responded to requests for comment.Xu Zhongbo, a professor of metallurgy at the University of Science and Technology in Beijing, described the situation at Bohai Steel as one where \u201cthe banks are now hijacked by the company, and it will take magic to bring the company back.\u201d\u201cEconomically, it\u2019s really hard to get the company back to life, but politically the government needs to support it,\u201d Mr. Xu added.Other recent examples of corporate defaults in China offer, perhaps, less room for confidence.Dongbei Special Steel Group, based in the northeastern port city of Dalian, has defaulted on its bonds multiple times since its chairman, Yang Hua, was found hanged in his home last month.China Railway Materials, a supplier of construction materials to the railroad industry, became one of the first companies that is directly owned by the central government to run into debt trouble. The company suspended trading this month on more than $2 billion worth of bonds and said it would seek to restructure its debt.For China\u2019s banking system, the coming months are almost certain to bring more defaults, bankruptcies and other debt problems, according to economists. \u201cThe low default rates that we have seen in recent years are perhaps too good to be true,\u201d said Tao Wang, the co-head of Asia Economics at UBS. \u201cThe rise is natural considering the economic circumstances,\u201d Ms. Wang said.The Bohai Steel case also demonstrates how China\u2019s mountains of corporate debt extend beyond just traditional bank loans.One of the company\u2019s main subsidiaries, Tianjin Steel, also sought to raise money from ordinary investors.Tianjin Steel sought to raise as much as $100 million in investments known in China as trust products, according to a review of the marketing materials for those investments. Trust products, which are often used by industries that have a hard time getting funding, are lightly regulated and difficult to track.National Trust, a trust company that issued some of these investment products on behalf of the steel maker, has said that some of the products have run into problems.Owen Guo in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudis Moving to Reduce Dependence on Oil Money", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 A top Saudi prince has announced new elements of a plan to reduce the kingdom\u2019s heavy dependence on oil, amid a drop in world prices that has sent shock waves through the Saudi economy.The fund could become the world\u2019s largest, he said, with more than $2 trillion in assets.\u201cUndoubtedly, it will be the largest fund on earth,\u201d said Prince Mohammed, who is second in line to the Saudi throne and has emerged as the country\u2019s most powerful and dynamic official. \u201cThis will happen as soon as Aramco goes public.\u201dAlthough less than 5 percent of Saudi Aramco would be sold, the prince said the national oil company would be transferred to a government fund, now relatively small, called the Public Investment Fund, giving it instant heft and potential financial firepower.The announcements came as Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, struggles to reformat its economy.Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in New York, estimates that Saudi Arabia is burning up its financial reserves at the rate of $10 billion to $15 billion per month. She estimates that the kingdom has about $600 billion left.There are longer-term worries as well. A recent study by the consultants McKinsey warned that with more than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s population under 25, a surge of young people was likely to enter the work force in the coming years. This will require the creation of almost three times as many jobs for Saudis as the kingdom created during the 2003-13 oil boom.Prince Mohammed, a son of the monarch, King Salman, is leading the effort to find solutions as the head of council that oversees economic policy. Although only about 30 years old and relatively unknown before his father became king last year, he is also the country\u2019s defense minister, at a time of great regional instability and with Saudi forces at war in neighboring Yemen.The prince\u2019s intention, analysts say, appears to be to create a vehicle that would make direct investments in companies outside of Saudi Arabia as well as inside. The idea would be to use these holdings to generate income at a time when oil prices are low and to develop business relationships that would lead to investments in Saudi Arabia.In initiating the changes, Saudi Arabia trails behind some other countries. The Public Investment Fund, for instance, has about $5 billion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research organization.The full plan to restructure the Saudi economy has yet to be released, but the announcements touched on central aspects of it.Shares of the parent company of Saudi Aramco, widely believed to be the world\u2019s most valuable company, as well as shares of its subsidiaries, could be sold to the public on the Saudi stock exchange as early as next year, Prince Mohammed said. But the shares would be for \u201cless than 5 percent\u201d of the company, he said.Assets raised from the stock sales would be routed into the Public Investment Fund, which could grow to hold more than $2 trillion, the prince said. The fund currently has $5 billion in assets and includes shares in a large Saudi chemical manufacturer and the kingdom\u2019s largest lender.The fund is considering foreign opportunities and will seek a variety of investments to move the kingdom away from its dependence on oil. \u201cSo within 20 years, we will be an economy or state that doesn\u2019t depend mainly on oil,\u201d the prince said.Western diplomats and analysts say it is hard to gauge the Saudi plans because much about the kingdom\u2019s economy remains opaque and the deadlines for implementation remain unclear.\u201cThe strategy makes sense,\u201d Ms. Ziemba said, \u201cbut it is not a silver bullet.\u201dShe said it would have been easier to try such reforms when oil prices were higher and Saudi Arabia\u2019s assets were worth far more than they are now.Some have questioned how many private investors will want to put their money in a company like Saudi Aramco that releases very little financial information and is seen by many as the piggy bank of the Saudi royal family.Jean-Francois Seznec, a senior fellow in the Global Energy Institute at the Atlantic Council, said an initial public offering of less than 5 percent made sense because the amount of cash involved in a larger offering could flood the market.The bigger challenge, he said, will be bringing transparency to a company that has long avoided it. \u201cAll of a sudden, everyone could see how much money is being taken off the top by the royal family, and everyone wants to avoid that,\u201d he said.Still, the prince receives some credit at home for trying. \u201cA lot of young people at home are feeling excited that there is a clear direction and leadership,\u201d said Sadad Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. \u201cIt makes you wonder why no one else did it before.\u201dBen Hubbard reported from Riyadh, and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}

But he also has fervent support from people who remember the era of well-paying union jobs at manufacturing plants \u2014 and who are very aware of how far we are from that time.\u201cI just like Bernie because he\u2019s old like me,\u201d joked Mack Richards, 70, another retired steelworker at the Reading event.This time around, the fight for these voters has focused significantly on a somewhat unlikely contender for juiciest campaign issue: international trade deals and their repercussions.Any presidential candidate on the stump knows how to work a good metaphor into a speech, and Mr. Sanders knew to use the very ZIP code he was rallying in.He went on to list corporations, including the Dana Corporation, that had shut down plants in Reading and moved overseas.Kevin Wright, a high school physics teacher in line to see Mr. Sanders, saw parallels between the populism on the left and similar sentiments on the right.\u201cWe\u2019re the response to the Tea Party,\u201d he said.His sister, standing next to him, laughed nervously. \u201cCareful!\u201d she warned.\u201cThe Tea Party has taken over the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Wright continued. \u201cI think our movement\u2019s stronger, and has more numbers, and is more rational and grounded in reality. And you can see that just based on the people here.\u201dThe crowd in Reading skewed a bit older than a typical Sanders rally \u2014 possibly because it took place on a weekday afternoon. Fritz Von Hummel, 55, a self-employed appliance technician who was laid off from his previous job in November, canceled a couple of appointments to come to the event. He said he had not had health insurance for the past seven years because he could not afford it, and he was eager to talk about the shortcomings of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\u201cI\u2019m just furious with the situation the way it is,\u201d he added.There was more fury elsewhere in Pennsylvania. Driving directly from a Bernie Sanders rally to a Donald Trump rally is an easy way to get political whiplash. The two candidates couldn\u2019t be further apart on the political spectrum. Mr. Sanders was introduced by a young undocumented student who tearfully spoke about wanting to come \u201cout of the shadows.\u201d Mr. Trump opened his rally at an expo center in Harrisburg with his familiar \u201cbuild that wall\u201d refrain.At both rallies, four similar grievances emerged among their supporters, over health care, Social Security, campaign finance and trade.At his rally in Harrisburg, Mr. Trump asserted that Harrisburg had lost nearly 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001, and pledged to bring back jobs from countries like Mexico, China, Japan, Vietnam and India.\u201cPennsylvania has taken harder hits on trade than just about anywhere else in the United States. Not good! The state of Pennsylvania has lost more than 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001. Not good,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico has been taking your companies like it\u2019s candy from a baby.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Harrisburg let out, supporters clashed with protesters separated by a line of police officers. The two groups flung chants back and forth. From the pro-Trump side: \u201cBaby killers!\u201d \u201cBernie sucks!\u201d \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d And from the anti-Trump side: \u201cBlack lives matter!\u201d \u201cGo to college!\u201d \u201cGet more chants!\u201dJennifer Poole, a self-employed Trump supporter from Port Royal, Pa., couldn\u2019t get into the rally, so she watched him outside on her phone instead.\u201cI don\u2019t know what has made these people feel that Trump is racist and he\u2019s not, he\u2019s clearly not,\u201d Ms. Poole said. \u201cI was never a registered voter until now. I really believe that he can do great things and turn the world around. I really do.\u201dIn conversations with both Sanders and Trump supporters, the same questions kept coming up: What do you do if you\u2019re a middle-aged factory worker who has made a decent living for most of your life, only to see not only your job, but your entire industry, go up in smoke? Do you go to college? Take on a lower-paying job? Retire early? Or just hope that something better comes along, someday?Neither party seems to have a monopoly on the answers. Mr. Mandich, the Sanders supporter, said if it came down to a Trump-Clinton election in November, he would not vote for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI probably would go for Donald Trump,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

I mumbled something about not being the right person for this, and got out of his office as fast as I could. I chose not to report him because I couldn\u2019t be 100 percent sure I hadn\u2019t misunderstood, but the encounter stayed with me.Mr. Nilekani is no neo-Gandhian folk hero. Tall and impeccably dressed, with a graying Rhett Butler mustache, he is a regular at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.One of those it helped is Ram, a farmer in central India (it\u2019s common for rural Indians to go by only one name). He works for the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which guarantees the poor a minimum of 100 days a year of paid work building roads or upgrading irrigation systems. To get his meager wages of 800 rupees (about $12) a week, Mr. Ram had to take a day off work, ride the roof of a creaking bus to a nearby town and line up in the dusty heat for three hours to see a local bureaucrat who would likely deduct a fee from Mr. Ram\u2019s wages. The whole rigmarole reduced his actual pay by about a third.Mr. Ram is proud of his Aadhaar ID card. To get his wages, he now simply stops at his corner grocery store. The owner scans Mr. Ram\u2019s fingerprints on a phone app and then pays him, keeping only a legal 10 rupee (16 cent) commission.The Aadhaar program and Mr. Modi\u2019s emphasis on more open government contracting are an excellent start, but other possible fixes include setting up an independent commission to try the worst offenders \u2014 along the lines of what Mr. Hazare is proposing. India requires public officials to disclose their assets, but this is not always enforced. Pay increases for state officials would also be a useful carrot to encourage compliance.

{"Headline": "Ford Doubles Profits for the Best Quarter in Its History", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byThe combination of low gasoline prices and record auto sales in the United States is making for good times in the auto industry, and nowhere is that more evident than at Ford Motor.Ford, the No. 2 American carmaker, on Thursday reported a record $2.5 billion in net income for the first three months of the year, an increase of 113 percent and more profit than in any other quarter in its 112-year history.In North America, Ford\u2019s operating profit doubled to $3.1 billion. It produced fewer vehicles on the continent than General Motors, but made about $800 million more in profit than its crosstown rival.\u201cThe first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, said in a conference call.Leading the way for Ford was the recently redesigned, aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup, which had strong sales, like those of other trucks and sport utility vehicles, as gas sold for less than $2 a gallon in many parts of the country.A year ago, Ford was just starting production of the aluminum model, working out hitches in the new manufacturing process. But now its F-150 lines are humming.\u201cThey can\u2019t make enough of them,\u201d said David Kudla, chief executive of the investment firm Mainstay Capital Management.Also helping Ford is a turnaround in Europe, where it made more money in the first three months of 2016 than it did in all of last year.In recent weeks, the auto business\u2019s six-year expansion streak has shown signs of losing momentum since hitting a high of 17.4 million cars and light trucks sold in 2015. To keep growth going, automakers have offered more incentives, pushed leasing to record levels and sold more cars into rental fleets.Ford said it sold 1.7 million vehicles in the first quarter, an increase of about 10 percent.And Mr. Fields said Ford was in a good position even if the market is at its peak and sales plateau or tail off slightly.Besides the F-150, Ford has recently released updated versions of its Explorer and Edge S.U.V.s, and is working on four more new models, as people increasingly favor light trucks over sedans and compacts.\u201cWe have reached an inflection point,\u201d Mr. Fields said of the shift. In the first three months of this year, trucks and S.U.V.s made up 70 percent of Ford\u2019s sales in the United States, up from 64 percent in the same period four years ago.Because they tend to be higher-priced than cars, trucks and S.U.V.s usually generate more revenue and profit.\u201cThe bottom line is we expect 2016 to be another strong year,\u201d Mr. Fields said, forecasting \u201ccontinued strength into 2017.\u201dLike Ford, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler are also gaining from rising truck sales. G.M. and Fiat Chrysler each recently reported strong earnings increases for the first quarter.But not all automakers are benefiting as much. Luxury carmakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz typically sell more cars than S.U.V.s, so the shift away from cars is not helping them. In the United States, they have maintained sales but have had to offer more incentives.Trucks are not the only bright spot for Ford. The company also benefited from an improving economy and the increased sales of more expensive models.It did not hurt that Volkswagen, a major competitor, has been hobbled by its emissions-cheating scandal. In the first quarter, European profits leapt to $434 million. In the same period a year ago, Ford lost $42 million.China, despite concerns about its economy, is also generating significant returns. Ford was once a laggard there but it has built a series of plants and is now building up market share. Its share of profits from its Chinese joint ventures in the first quarter was $443 million \u2014 $83 million more than a year agoOver all, Ford reported first-quarter revenue of $37.7 billion, $3.8 billion more than in the same period in 2015.Shares of Ford closed up more than 3 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Regulators Mess With Bankers\u2019 Minds, and Why That\u2019s Good", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byRules, RulesBank regulators on Wednesday sent a message that big banks are still too big and too complex. They rejected special plans, called living wills, that the banks have to submit to show they can go through an orderly bankruptcy.The thinking behind the regulators\u2019 call for living wills is that if a large bank crash is orderly, there will be no need to save it and no need for taxpayer bailouts.Pretty straightforward, right? Not for the banks. The regulators deliberately did not communicate the exact things the banks needed to do for their plans to pass muster. In this way, they kept them on their toes \u2014 and treating powerful banks this way may end up playing a surprisingly important role in keeping the financial regulation effective over time.Mr. Minsky pithily observed that stability gives rise to instability. As the economy grows steadily, banks and companies start to overreach. Banks lend too much, and companies and consumers overborrow, which ultimately makes the system fragile. And while financial regulation was necessary to limit excessive behavior during those stable times, Mr. Minsky observed that bankers eventually found ways around the rules.But Dodd-Frank might have built-in self-protections. It seems to take into account Mr. Minsky\u2019s warnings, with provisions that allow the law to be refreshed and changed as the financial system evolves. Regulators have already used those features to seize the initiative over bankers.They have done so with so-called living wills. The regulators get to determine what needs to be in the living wills. One senior agency official told me on Wednesday that they try not to make the exercise so clear that the banks treat it just like any other compliance exercise.Perhaps even more important are the annual regulatory stress tests that assess how large banks would bear up under theoretical crashes in the markets and global economy. Undertaken by the Federal Reserve, these tests have caused significant headaches for the banks, and some banks have failed them, mostly because their plans for handling the hypothetical stress were judged inadequate. This has caused unease among the banks\u2019 senior managers. If the banks flunk the stress tests, they don\u2019t get to distribute money to shareholders or buy back shares. The banks are kept on their toes because conditions assumed in the tests, and the things regulators look for, can change.Dodd-Frank also set up something called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a special regulatory body that sits above other regulators. One of its main jobs is to scour the financial system looking for new risks. If it can resist the influence of bank lawyers and lobbyists, the council could use this power to limit the growth of new financial products that are devised to avoid regulation.The council also seeks to identify which large financial firms that are not banks \u2014 think, big insurance companies \u2014 should be subject to stricter regulation. It\u2019s a duty that was devised in response to the huge buildup of risks at the American International Group, which received one of the biggest bailouts.True, the financial industry has already won a substantial victory to limit regulation. A Federal District Court recently ruled that the council could not subject MetLife, a large insurance company, to stricter regulation. Still, many lawyers believe that the court\u2019s ruling is shaky and will be overturned on appeal.But for now at least, banking regulators seem willing to use their freedom to mess with the banks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What, Reserve a Table? Cubans Confront a New Dining Culture", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 Cubans sometimes joke that of all the lessons living under three generations of communism has taught them, by far the most important is learning how to wait.So it\u2019s a little surprising that as capitalism creeps in \u2014 the introduction of private ownership has created a thriving restaurant scene \u2014 people here are discovering, to their dismay, that they need to book reservations to get into their favorite places for dinner.It\u2019s just one of many dislocations that restaurateurs and diners are facing as two economic worlds collide in the new, more American-friendly Cuba.\u201cUntil six months ago, I was able to show up with two people and eat somewhere that\u2019s considered one of the fancier restaurants in Havana with no problem,\u201d said Imogene Tondre, 34, an American-born cultural coordinator who has lived in the city for six years and is married to a Cuban. \u201cNow the ones that take the big tour groups are always booked. And even the restaurants that are geared more toward the Cuban population are often very full.\u201dMany Cubans are shocked. \u201cThey arrive and say: \u2018What? I need a reservation from a day before? That\u2019s ridiculous!\u2019\u201d said Amy Torralbas, 31, the owner of Otramanera, a gated ultramodern restaurant that serves a blend of Cuban and Mediterranean cooking.At first glance, the problem wouldn\u2019t seem to be a shortage of places to eat. Antonio Diaz, a University of Havana economics professor, estimated that several hundred viable restaurants have sprouted since 2011, when the government loosened crippling restrictions on privately owned restaurants, or paladares. With that has come a much wider variety of cuisines, from Spanish-style seafood to Japanese sushi, reflecting the desires of a public with an increasingly cosmopolitan palate.The island\u2019s economy runs on dual currencies: the Cuban convertible peso, or CUC, meant primarily for tourists, and the local peso, or CUP, which Cubans use for most day-to-day transactions. Restaurants must run on a mix of both, accepting payment mostly in CUCs but using CUPs for supplies and wages.A restaurateur wishing to expand to a second location runs smack into restrictions on property ownership that limit an individual to one site in Havana and another elsewhere in Cuba. (Entrepreneurs with dreams of food empires get around those laws by exploiting loopholes and shuffling deeds among siblings, parents and children.)Then there\u2019s the constant struggle of running a food business in a country that lacks capitalist institutions as basic as a wholesale market, and where staples are often in short supply.\u201cIf I want to buy a kilo of coffee, I need to go to two, three, six stores all around Cuba sometimes,\u201d said Renan Cesar Alvarez, 74, an owner of La Cocina de Esteban, a brightly lit restaurant serving Italian, Spanish and Cuban cuisine a few blocks from the University of Havana. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with sugar, rice, the drinks, everything.\u201dAt the same time, restaurateurs strive to meet Western-level expectations. State-run cafeterias are still notorious for plodding service that consists mostly of glassy-eyed waiters informing diners what isn\u2019t available on the menu. Modern paladares typically employ enthusiastic young servers, often college students or recent graduates attracted by the possibility of making a relative fortune in tips. (The average Cuban\u2019s monthly earnings total about $25.)\u201cI prefer people with no experience,\u201d said Niuris Ysabel Higueras Mart\u00ednez, 41, an owner of Atelier, which sprawls through several art-filled rooms and the rooftop of a mansion in the Vedado neighborhood. \u201cI prefer teaching my own service.\u201dAt Otramanera, servers are educated about the menu, wines and the startling fact that some foreigners abstain from meat.\u201cIn Cuba, there wasn\u2019t a culinary culture, and so now we are learning about the first dish, the main course, about the wine that comes with the food,\u201d Ms. Torralbas said. \u201cFor example, in Cuba, there weren\u2019t many vegetarian people; we didn\u2019t know anything about that. So now we\u2019re learning how to be prepared for these types of people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complete shift in consumer culture,\u201d Ms. Tondre said. \u201cSome of these restaurants have been around for 25 years, and there\u2019s never been a way to rate them before. And people are starting to recognize the power they have.\u201dFor average Cubans, the notion of rating or even reserving tables remains hypothetical, as the new CUC-based restaurants are simply unaffordable for nearly everyone. For them, eating out means a visit to a CUP-based state cafeteria or a tiny takeout place \u2014 often someone\u2019s kitchen window \u2014 where croquette sandwiches or doughy pizzas cost about 12 local pesos, or 48 cents.And even those Cubans who can afford a restaurant meal are quickly learning that there\u2019s no guarantee they can book a table days or even weeks in advance in several of the most popular restaurants.\u201cWe\u2019re a spontaneous country, but the people will just have to get used to it,\u201d said Delia Coto, 48, a Havana theater director having lunch at Otramanera. \u201cPeople will have to learn to plan ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Happened to Worcester?", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "The Money IssueA central Massachusetts city enabled the author\u2019s ancestors to move into the good life of the middle class. That move is more complicated now.Supported byOn Zillow these days, its value is estimated at just over $200,000, which happens to be almost exactly the median price for an existing house in the United States. This seems fitting. For my father\u2019s family, the dreams fulfilled by this house had meant a climb from bare subsistence to the middle. This house was the middle; Worcester, where the house still stands, was the middle. The life that Bumpa and Narny built here was the middle. And that, to them and to their children and grandchildren, was a triumph, the goal of a good life.Having studied the American economy for years, I\u2019ve often reflected on how much my father\u2019s family perfectly models the middle-class story \u2014 how closely the details of their lives illustrate the bigger economic forces around them. The way I read economic history, the middle class was a driving force in the American economy for about a century, starting in the second half of the 1800s. Its growth created a virtuous circle: The more people moved into the middle, the more money they made and spent, and the richer the country became, which made more room for more people to move into the middle too.But in learning about my family\u2019s economic history, I\u2019ve also come to understand how deeply their story is embedded in the history of a place, of one particular city created by and for the middle class. When I mention Worcester to people from New England, they often give a knowing nod or laugh \u2014 this unlovely, down-on-its-luck city of dead industry and collapsing buildings. But Worcester was an engine for betterment until the middle of the 20th century, a magical place that transformed lost and impoverished lives.A few weeks ago, I called my dad to relate what I had learned about his grandparents, George and Mildred Bestick. He told me he knew almost nothing about them before they got to Worcester, where they had settled by 1917. Bumpa and Narny existed as if they had no history. As a child, all my dad knew was that the Bestick name was Irish and that Narny, born Mildred Bailey, came from an old, proud New England family with Mayflower ancestry. They were respectable, clearly. Just look at the massive house and Bumpa\u2019s three-piece suits and Narny\u2019s quiet devotion to her Baptist church.Only recently, I learned that this respectability was actually self-reinvention, built on top of origins in poverty and chaos. My great-grandparents\u2019 economic journey was one that\u2019s harder to make today, in part because there are fewer \u201cmiddle\u201d cities now. Even during the middle-class heyday of the 20th century, they couldn\u2019t have done it without Worcester.For nearly as far back as we have economic records, we can see evidence of a third, sometimes very small group. These middlemen were crucial: They filled an essential intermediary role, turning raw materials into finished goods. Some were craftspeople, making pottery, textiles, processed foods or other luxuries. Others were traders, transporting raw materials and finished goods over long distances. The middle classes varied by country and era, but they shared certain characteristics. Perhaps the most profound was a unique sort of control over their destinies. In premodern life, the middle people weren\u2019t so poor as to be stuck permanently in misery, but neither were they bound by the social codes and strictures of nobility that tended to accompany wealth. They were often more exposed to market forces; their livelihoods, to a great degree, depended on an ability to spot opportunity and sell the right things to the right people at the right price.We often attribute the Industrial Revolution to a handful of brilliant inventors who created the steam engine, the power loom and other transformative technologies. But many economic historians point out that these developments required a broader middle class, characterized by education, a feeling of opportunity and a lack of deep commitment to the existing socioeconomic order. The Industrial Revolution could just as easily be called the middle-class revolution. Those intermediaries, who converted raw materials into usable consumer goods, took over the economy. We know that story: mass production, global trade, faster innovation ensues. It\u2019s possible to have an endless chicken-and-egg debate over whether the middle classes created or were created by the Industrial Revolution. But the answer, plainly, is both, and for well over a century we lived in a world defined by the middle class.By the early 1900s \u2014 as the people who would become my family were establishing themselves in Worcester \u2014 the virtuous circle had begun to take hold nationwide. Factories were growing quickly, offering long-term, decent-paying jobs to former farmers, day laborers and immigrants. As workers earned more money, they bought more goods, which meant the factories got more orders and needed to hire more people. As factories became more sophisticated, they needed a better-educated work force and, indeed, the public-school revolution began, ensuring that the children of the new factory workers would be better educated and better able to make even more money. By the 1930s, the middle class was not just an aspirational destination; it had become a bedrock of the country.Solomon struggled in Worcester. The 1910 census identifies him as a fruit vendor, a notch \u2014 but hardly a leap \u2014 up the socioeconomic scale, because fruit requires at least some meager capital to invest. By 1923, he was selling tonics, or sketchy medicines, on the street. Yet the family was somehow able to buy one of Worcester\u2019s three-decker buildings, which must have felt like a miraculous accomplishment for folks who arrived with nothing a few years earlier. And soon enough, his children were thriving. My great-aunt Ethel once described how she and my great-grandfather, Jacob, would pretend to go to sleep and then sneak out the window to go to the dance halls. Solomon\u2019s children began working in late adolescence, but not as street peddlers; his daughters became stenographers and bookkeepers; a son worked in a shoe store. Jacob opened his own tannery. The next generations, the ones that came of age after the 1930s, produced the familiar complement of Jewish immigrant children successes \u2014 among them lawyers and accountants and C.E.O.s and a high-level executive at CBS.Jacob\u2019s eventual wife and my great-grandmother, Annabelle Lewis, was another sort of Worcester immigrant. She grew up in a remote corner of Maine, descended from Yankee sailors. Her father was a saloonkeeper; the census says he couldn\u2019t read or write. What stories I remember about him are brutal: He was a violent drunk, a horrible father. According to family accounts, she fled early and ended up in Worcester, with little education, no money, no prospects. She worked in a dance hall, dancing with men for money. In December 1916, she and Jacob made a hurried trip to Vermont to be married by a justice of the peace. Three months later, my grandfather Stanley was born. One of Jacob\u2019s sisters told me that their father, upon hearing his son married a non-Jew, ripped his clothes and proclaimed him dead to the family. Jacob and Annabelle moved to Rhode Island for a time but returned to Worcester a few years later to open the tannery. They were beginning to repair relationships with the family when Jacob became sick with tuberculosis. He died in 1924, when my grandfather Stanley was 7. A few years later, Stanley met a young girl at school, Helen Bestick. She wrote in her diary, \u201cI met a Jew today.\u201dHelen\u2019s family had its own story of Worcester\u2019s redemptive powers. Her father, George (the man my dad called Bumpa as a toddler), grew up poor in Braintree, another small industrial city in Massachusetts. Eventually he became an office manager in a razor factory, which, given his background, would have counted as an impressively skilled, sit-down job. At 33, he seemed to be stuck: at home, caring for aging parents; his two siblings had long ago found spouses and moved away. Then he married a 30-year-old widow, Mildred, who had survived a tough life as well. She was born in Plymouth, Mass., where her ancestors, passengers on the Mayflower, had settled centuries before. But by early adulthood, she was with her parents in Braintree, with a failing marriage, a baby and a job as a stitcher in a shoe factory. Before long, her husband and baby both died. Whenever it was she met Bumpa, she would have been considered a spinster with a questionable past, whatever the distinction conferred by her heritage.Their history makes me love Worcester. These two trapped, poor, broken people somehow met and managed to put all that pain behind and create a new life in what still felt like the fresh, quickly growing frontier of central Massachusetts. Bumpa, following a tip from a minister who had moved to Worcester, seems to have arrived in the city with an office job in hand, at the Heald Machine Company, where he worked until his retirement decades later. A combination of historical luck, a fast-growing economy and his own hard work enabled him to carve out a good life that must have seemed unattainable when he was younger.My grandparents, Stanley and Helen, had their own hurried wedding in 1936, followed too soon by the birth of a son, my father, Jack. Before long, they had three more children. By then their families were able to help out. Bumpa George got Stanley a job at Heald. It was a great job for a young man with a new family in the midst of the Depression. He did well there and rose to factory foreman. By the time he retired after 54 years at the company, Stanley owned three homes and vacationed in Europe in the summer. Needless to say, few people dealing with pregnancy in high school today could expect to attain such a good life.The forces that would eventually afflict the American middle class came early to Worcester. The development of the Interstate highway system, beginning in the 1950s, and containerized shipping a few years later, meant that factories much farther away could afford to ship to East Coast ports. Manufacturing became more consolidated \u2014 Heald Machine, for example, was bought by Cincinnati Milacron, which brought some of its workers (including my grandfather Stanley) to Ohio. There are still factories in Worcester \u2014 for example, Norton, one of Worcester\u2019s biggest and oldest plants (which was bought by the French conglomerate Saint-Gobain in 1990). But long gone are the days when Worcester\u2019s plants offered a decent job to just about anybody willing to put in a hard day\u2019s work. New employees looking to join the middle class must have not just a high-school diploma but an associate degree, if not a bachelor\u2019s degree.For all its decline in the second half of the 20th century, Worcester did enjoy one bit of good fortune: In the 1960s, the University of Massachusetts placed its medical school in the city. The school, which continued to grow, brought several generations\u2019 worth of high-paying medical jobs and a fair number of lower-paying support positions. Similarly, Worcester\u2019s position close to the center of New England has been good for the transportation business. Many of my relatives who stayed in town have worked either in the medical center as nurses or in the transportation field as truck drivers, dispatchers, rail-yard inspectors. These are solid, stable jobs, but they don\u2019t enable the kind of jump-up in socioeconomic status that my family experienced many decades ago.If you drive around Worcester now, it\u2019s easy to imagine there is no rising middle class, no aspiration at all. In reality, it\u2019s just much harder to tell Worcester\u2019s story simply. A century ago, you could have picked any three-decker and immediately grasped the basic life story of all its tenants: where in the world they came from, which factory they worked in, what their hopes and fears were for their children. Today things are not so clear. Deborah Martin, a professor of geography at Clark University in Worcester, has spent years leading students through the city and researching its social dynamics. She knows a fair bit: where the Ghanaians live, how the Latino immigrants are differentiated by country of origin. But she often finds herself noticing newly renovated three-deckers and wondering, who is that? What are they doing?Worcester reflects what\u2019s going on throughout the United States. There are a healthy number of higher-paying jobs. The Worcester area has a disproportionately large community of well-paid medical professionals, from nurses and midwives to physicians and microbiologists; it has a huge number of educators for its population, a result of having nearly a dozen colleges in one medium-size city. But it also has more than the average number of lower-skilled jobs at or near the minimum wage \u2014 food-service workers, personal-care aides and a host of other medical-care assistants.John C. Brown is a professor of economics at Clark and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. He told me that Worcester is right in the middle when it comes to the current circumstances of once-flourishing manufacturing centers in New England. Brown says one quick way to assess a city\u2019s fortunes over time is to look at its population. Many urban areas in Massachusetts experienced a population collapse in the 1970s and 1980s. But Worcester and some others have had slow and steady growth over the past few decades. Worcester, he notes, can\u2019t credit its success to any one industry. It doesn\u2019t have, say, Boston\u2019s robotics or the tourism of Salem and Lowell. Worcester instead benefits from a whole bunch of things: hospitals, universities and a bit of manufacturing still. Nothing screams at recent immigrants or people struggling in other parts of New England to rush to Worcester to fulfill their dreams. The city\u2019s economy is a more complicated tale.One day recently, I went to see the shuttered Heald Machine factory on the northeast side of town. As I drove past the factory gates, the first shop I noticed, right across the street, had some Arabic writing in the window. I stopped the car and entered a tiny tailor\u2019s shop. I met the proprietor, Ahmed Yusef. He grew up in Mosul, Iraq, where he worked with his father, also a tailor. His father had specialized in custom-made men\u2019s suits. But after the American invasion, Mosul became a front line in the battle between American and Iraqi forces and Al Qaeda. Nobody wanted men\u2019s suits, so Ahmed\u2019s father took a contract making uniforms for the Iraqi Army. This landed him on a hit list, and in 2005 the family fled, first to Syria, then to Egypt, worrying all the while that their temporary visa would not be renewed and that they would be sent back to Iraq. In 2012, the family received word that its refugee application to the United States had been approved, and they were offered a chance to resettle in Arizona. Ahmed, thrilled, called the one person he knew in America, an old client who lived in Worcester. Don\u2019t go to Arizona, he was told. It\u2019s too hot there, and there are no jobs. Move to Worcester, where housing is cheap, and opportunities are plenty.Ahmed soon found work as a tailor \u2014 he\u2019s been at Brooks Brothers for three years now. One day, walking with his parents in Worcester\u2019s Green Hill Park, his mother pointed out a young Iraqi woman. Now they\u2019re married, and they have a newborn daughter and plans for more kids. Ahmed opened his own business, though he still works several shifts a week at Brooks Brothers. He envisions that, one day, he\u2019ll have many children, that some of them will even work with him in the tailor shop.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Win Easily in New York Primary", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump wrested back control of the Republican presidential race on Tuesday with a commanding victory in the New York primary, while Hillary Clinton dealt a severe blow to Senator Bernie Sanders with an unexpectedly strong win that led her to declare that the Democratic nomination was \u201cin sight.\u201dThe Queens-born, Manhattan-made Mr. Trump was poised to take most of the 95 Republican delegates at stake, substantially adding to his current lead over Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and significantly improving his chances of winning the Republican nomination. Mr. Cruz came away with no delegates, a major setback, while Gov. John Kasich of Ohio had a shot at picking up some in Manhattan and the capital region.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s decisive victory ended a string of wins by Mr. Sanders and gave her more delegates than her advisers expected. Her base of support was Long Island, the five boroughs, and upstate cities, with female and black and Hispanic voters turning out for her in especially strong numbers.The two hometown winners beamed throughout their victory speeches, but it was Mr. Trump who particularly seemed like a different candidate. As he spoke in the lobby of Trump Tower, there were no freewheeling presentations of steaks and bottled water, as in the past. There was no reference to \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d or \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d; he called his opponent \u201cSenator Cruz\u201d instead, and made no mention of Mrs. Clinton. He also took no questions from the news media.And his speech sounded more presidential than any other he has given on an election night \u2014 a focused, tightened message about trade and the economy as he prepares to campaign in states hit hard by manufacturing industry losses. The speech reflected the growing influence of Paul Manafort, whom Mr. Trump empowered to help him win the nomination and who has taken on a greater purview, including messaging.\u201cOur jobs are being sucked out of our states,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cOne of the big problems is economy and jobs, and that is my wheelhouse.\u201d He said, twice, that he was going to get up and go back to work for the nomination on Wednesday morning, a clear message about the intensity he is bringing to the fight.In the Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton was set to win roughly 30 more delegates than Mr. Sanders, out of 247 at stake. She already had a lead of more than 200 delegates in the race.Smiling broadly throughout her victory speech, Mrs. Clinton drew cheers as she thanked her adopted home state and then boomed, \u201cToday, you proved once again, there\u2019s no place like home.\u201d\u201cThe race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sight,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added, reflecting the overwhelming mathematical advantage she has in delegates.Sanders advisers had said that beating Mrs. Clinton in her adopted home state represented one of their campaign\u2019s best opportunities to damage her candidacy and sow doubts about her strength as a general-election nominee. On Tuesday, however, Mrs. Clinton drew deep support among women and blacks \u2014 two groups that have been essential for her in many states \u2014 while Mr. Sanders was outpacing her among white men and people under 45, according to exit polls.12 Photos\u201cBernie Sanders got very negative attacking Hillary Clinton and dividing the party in New York, and I think he now has to ask himself if he wants to keep going down that path,\u201d said Jay Jacobs, a Clinton supporter who is the Democratic chairman in Nassau County on Long Island. \u201cAfter New York, we\u2019re moving into a phase of the campaign where we have to start uniting the party.\u201dMr. Sanders and his team spent Tuesday looking past New York. Mr. Sanders held a rally at Pennsylvania State University in State College on Tuesday night, then flew home to Burlington, Vt., and spoke to reporters just after the race was called.\u201cThere are five primaries next week and we think we are going to do well and we think we have a path toward victory,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.He also expressed concern about the closed primary system in New York and said he hoped it would change in the future. \u201cSome three million New Yorkers were unable to vote today because they were registered as independents,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat makes no sense to me.\u201dThe Sanders campaign spent roughly $2 million more than the Clinton campaign on television ads in New York. The magnitude of the loss \u2014 both in the popular vote and in delegates \u2014 was steep for Mr. Sanders, who said he intended to get \u201crecharged and take a day off.\u201dThe senator\u2019s advisers were optimistic that he would perform strongly in next Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Pennsylvania as well as in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The other two states voting next week, Delaware and Maryland, are widely seen as Clinton strongholds. The Sanders campaign is already running television ads in those five states and Indiana, which votes May 3.\u201cBernie is in good shape going forward no matter who wins New York,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser on the Sanders campaign. \u201cWe could win enough delegates in Pennsylvania and Indiana to catch up further to her, and we have good opportunities all the way through California,\u201d which votes June 7. Still, Mr. Devine acknowledged, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to have some big wins at the end\u201d of the primary and caucus season.Mrs. Clinton, a former senator from New York, received support from roughly six in 10 Democrats on Long Island, and she overwhelmed Mr. Sanders in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. Mr. Sanders won many upstate rural counties, where few votes were cast, and he also did well in the Hudson Valley, given the enclaves of liberals and college students.On a major issue in their campaign, nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters said that Wall Street does more to hurt the American economy than to help it, and a majority of those voters backed Mr. Sanders. But Mrs. Clinton received even stronger support from those who said Wall Street helps the economy.By a slim margin, Republican primary voters also said that Wall Street does more to hurt the economy than help it.Surveys of Republican voters exiting voting locations throughout New York on Tuesday.Within the Trump campaign on Tuesday night, euphoria mixed with eagerness to move onto a number of states that are likely to be friendly to Mr. Trump. There have been other pivotal points in the Trump campaign, moments when he was described as becoming newly serious. It never stuck with the famously shoot-from-the-lip candidate. But Mr. Manafort is someone whom Mr. Trump views as something of a peer.No matter the margin of victory, New York Republicans gave Mr. Trump a restorative psychic boost after weeks when Mr. Cruz scored a big victory in the Wisconsin primary and outmaneuvered the Trump campaign in Colorado, Wyoming and elsewhere in winning and electing delegates backing his candidacy.Mr. Trump now has clear momentum heading into the next week\u2019s primaries \u2014 so much so that he evinced fresh optimism on Tuesday about ultimately getting to the 1,237 delegates needed to capture the nomination.\u201cI think I\u2019ll get there,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview before the polls closed.New York has not been home to leading presidential candidates in both parties since the 1944 campaigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Thomas E. Dewey, so the voting by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump merited unusual news media coverage on Tuesday morning. As a light mist fell, Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton cast their votes at an elementary school in their adopted town of Chappaqua.As news photographers and cameramen kept encroaching on her while she tried to vote, Mrs. Clinton finally shooed them away. \u201cGuys, it\u2019s a private ballot,\u201d she said.Surveys of Democratic voters exiting voting locations throughout New York on Tuesday.The Democratic vote was marred by major irregularities at polling places across Brooklyn. The city comptroller\u2019s office announced that the Board of Elections had confirmed that more than 125,000 Democratic voters in Brooklyn were dropped between November and this month, while about 63,000 were added \u2014 a net loss that was not explained.Mayor Bill de Blasio described \u201cthe purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters,\u201d while the comptroller, Scott Stringer, said his office would audit the Board of Elections.Mr. Trump voted for himself midmorning in New York City, which he called \u201ca great honor\u201d as he entered his apartment building. In the interview later, Mr. Trump described the experience of seeing his name on the ballot, saying he was moved by the enormity of what it means. \u201cIt does sort of hit you,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump won majorities in all regions except for rural upstate areas. Some Republicans questioned why Mr. Cruz spent so little time in upstate New York, where Mr. Trump\u2019s support two weeks ago was softer than it appeared. Instead, Mr. Cruz devoted his time mostly to the city and to fundraising.The primary was a seminal moment for Mr. Trump, both tactically in terms of delegates needed to clinch the nomination, and mentally, as he tries to right the ship after a rough couple of weeks that prompted him to reshuffle his small team of advisers, adding the seasoned campaign hand, Mr. Manafort.The coming weeks will test whether Mr. Trump can temper his message and his style for a new phase of the race, one where running a traditional campaign matters more than his ability to rally crowds. Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s tone throughout the day was focused on what he repeatedly called, in interviews, a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201crigged\u201d nominating process.Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato, the former United States senator and a backer of Mr. Kasich, said the New York results would be critical for Mr. Trump to rebound in his fight with Mr. Cruz.\u201cThis will give him momentum that he needs after his setbacks,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amato said.Yamiche Alcindor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Insider\u2019s Account of How Graft Fed Brazil\u2019s Political Crisis", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The silver-haired senator from Brazil\u2019s western frontier was still in his pajamas when federal police agents banged on the door of his suite at the Royal Tulip, the futuristic luxury hotel that serves as a bastion for much of Brazil\u2019s political elite. It was 6 a.m.The agents were armed with a secret recording that sounded like the plot for a Hollywood thriller. The senator, Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, had been caught detailing an elaborate plan for an oilman ensnared in Brazil\u2019s spiraling graft scandal to flee the country on a private plane.Mr. Amaral, 61, was until his arrest in Bras\u00edlia that morning in late November the governing party\u2019s most powerful leader in the Senate. He quickly sought a plea agreement, but prosecutors let him fester in prison for weeks, making a deal only after the disgraced senator provided one stunning disclosure after another that betrayed his former comrades and brought the government of President Dilma Rousseff ever closer to collapse.\u201cI felt like I had just crashed into a wall after a high-speed chase,\u201d recalled Mr. Amaral, who was freed in February. \u201cI messed things up, so I figured I needed a chance to make them right again. You need to be pragmatic.\u201dThe senator\u2019s accounts of colossal bribes, back-room oil deals and desperate cover-ups \u2014 pieced together from interviews, leaked intercepts of telephone conversations and court filings \u2014 offer a rare glimpse into how a leftist party that rose to power vowing to stamp out the corruption of a privileged political elite ended up embracing its predecessors\u2019 practices. His testimony has accelerated Brazil\u2019s political crisis, in which fearful rulers are masterminding power grabs, secretly recording each other and preparing for the day that they, too, might find themselves on the wrong side of an early-morning police raid.Even the judge who at first was heralded for fearlessly pursuing the powerful now stands accused of breaking the law for releasing evidence from the investigation.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.The upheaval began two years ago when prosecutors discovered a scheme inside the national oil company, Petrobras: Contractors had paid nearly $3 billion in bribes to executives who in turn channeled money into the campaigns of parties in Brazil\u2019s governing coalition. Nearly 40 politicians, business moguls and black-market money dealers have been jailed since, and the list is expected to grow, with prosecutors investigating suspects including the leaders of both chambers of Congress.Scholars say the corruption scandal ranks among the most far-reaching in the developing world, likening it to an earthquake hitting the nation\u2019s privileged elite. It has unspooled alongside crushing economic challenges, as falling commodities prices have sent unemployment soaring to 9.5 percent from 6.8 percent a year ago. In 2015 alone, Brazil lost 1.5 million jobs, a stunning turnabout from the nation\u2019s 7.6 percent economic growth in 2010.The double whammy of political and economic meltdown has devastated the global ambitions of Latin America\u2019s largest nation at the worst possible time: Brazil is simultaneously grappling with an epidemic of birth defects linked to the mosquito-borne Zika virus and preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer.That the heart of the scandal is Petrobras, founded in 1953 and surrounded by a mythical nationalist aura, has only multiplied its ripple effect. The company is the centerpiece of a web of state-controlled energy companies and banks that form the cornerstone of Brazil\u2019s economy, projecting power across the nation and abroad. It also financed an array of arts programs including a symphony orchestra, modern dance troupes and painting exhibitions, activities the company has slashed along with its own jobs.Brazilians often joke about corruption\u2019s deep roots here, tracing it back to when the Portuguese navigator Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral arrived in 1500, bearing gifts as a strategy to lay claim to lands inhabited by indigenous peoples. It was only a quarter-century ago that another president, Fernando Collor, was forced to resign over an influence-peddling scandal, lapses that seem bush league in light of what is happening today.It was when Senator Amaral began wrecking the government he once loyally supported that many Brazilians began to grasp how pervasive the skulduggery had become.He testified that Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president and founder of the Workers\u2019 Party, had arranged to purchase the silence of a businessman convicted of running a vote-buying scheme.He contended that Vice President Michel Temer, who is maneuvering to impeach President Rousseff, was involved in an illegal ethanol-purchasing operation. He also targeted A\u00e9cio Neves, the opposition leader who narrowly lost the 2014 election, revealing that his family had a secret bank account in Liechtenstein. (Mr. Neves said his mother had opened the account to pay for the education of her grandchildren.)Before Mr. Amaral\u2019s revelations, Ms. Rousseff had largely managed to stay above the fray, in part by boasting of bolstering judicial independence by allowing prosecutors to pursue graft in her own party. Then the senator claimed that the president had instructed him to sabotage the investigation into Petrobras by persuading a high-ranking judge to seek the release of construction tycoons charged with corruption.Both Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva say Mr. Amaral is lying. More broadly, Ms. Rousseff said in a recent interview that she had not known about the corruption at Petrobras, despite serving as its chairwoman from 2003 until 2010, when she was elected president, a period when graft was thriving. She also insists that her campaigns got no illegal financing.Mr. Amaral, assailed by leaders across the spectrum as a fabulist, smiled through interviews like a Cheshire cat. A gifted orator, he intersperses his accounts with sayings from the Pantanal, the vast wetlands where his family owns cattle ranches. Reaching for ways to explain the political maelstrom, he at one point recited a verse from an old Brazilian song.\u201cI\u2019m just doing my part to help the republic,\u201d the senator said.In hindsight, Mr. Amaral said, he recognizes that he never should have trusted Bernardo Cerver\u00f3, a struggling young actor from Rio de Janeiro.The senator, who had been director of gas and energy at Petrobras in 2000 and 2001, said he had agreed to meet with Mr. Cerver\u00f3, 34, in November because of his friendship with the actor\u2019s father, Nestor, who was sentenced to prison on corruption charges stemming from his own tenure at the oil company. The younger Mr. Cerver\u00f3, an actor in an experimental theater troupe, surreptitiously recorded on his phone their conversation at the Royal Tulip, the horseshoe-shaped hotel where the senator lives in Bras\u00edlia, a short drive from the presidential palace.Mr. Amaral first assured Mr. Cerver\u00f3 that he would persuade justices on Brazil\u2019s highest court to release his old friend on house arrest. Then he explained how he would arrange to pay the Cerver\u00f3 family $1 million plus a stipend of about $13,000 a month, which prosecutors suspect was to ensure the family did not inform on his own dealings at Petrobras.And Mr. Amaral laid out how he would help the elder Mr. Cerver\u00f3 flee to Spain, including details like deactivating his electronic monitoring device. The actor suggested an escape by boat, but the senator said a private plane was preferable, adding: \u201cThe best way for him to leave is through Paraguay.\u201dThat was enough for obstruction charges against both Mr. Amaral and Andr\u00e9 Esteves, the billionaire banker the senator said would finance the journey.Before his arrest, Mr. Amaral was known in Bras\u00edlia as a skilled behind-the-scenes negotiator, drawing from his long experience in the oil business.Schooled by Jesuits and trained as an engineer, he worked in the Netherlands for the energy giant Royal Dutch Shell in the early 1990s. Back home, he climbed the bureaucracy of Brazil\u2019s government-controlled energy industry.It was while serving in the Energy Ministry in 1993 that he got to know Ms. Rousseff, an obscure functionary in charge of energy policy in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.\u201cI met Dilma during a fight,\u201d he said, recalling his first meetings with Ms. Rousseff when she was seeking to renegotiate the debt of a public electric utility with the federal authorities. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely aggressive. Always has been.\u201dMr. Amaral joined the Workers\u2019 Party in 2001 and won a Senate seat the next year, when Mr. da Silva ran successfully for president.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest political crisis in decades, with its president facing impeachment proceedings and many in Congress facing criminal or corruption charges.As Brazil grew richer with the discovery of deep-sea oil fields, so did Mr. Amaral.Some colleagues in the Workers\u2019 Party still recoil at the quincea\u00f1era that Mr. Amaral and his wife hosted in 2011 for their daughter\u2019s 15th birthday. Comparing the event, in the western city of Campo Grande, to the balls organized by European nobility, society columnists fawned over every lavish stroke: 240 bottles of Veuve Clicquot Champagne, and a gown made from Givenchy crystals for the birthday girl.In December, while the senator languished in prison, his old friend from Petrobras, Nestor Cerver\u00f3, told investigators that Mr. Amaral had pocketed a $10 million bribe back in 2001, during a deal to buy turbines from Alstom, the French power company.Mr. Amaral denied that and all accusations that he had illegally enriched himself, declaring: \u201cI am not a corrupt man.\u201dMr. Amaral was the first sitting senator to be arrested since Brazil re-established democracy in the 1980s, and his jailing spawned panic and outrage in the Workers\u2019 Party, which Mr. da Silva and other union leaders founded in 1980 in resistance to Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship.The senator\u2019s readiness to double-cross his colleagues made one thing certain: More secret recordings were about to enrich the saga of Brazil\u2019s political impasse.Shortly after the arrest at the Royal Tulip, Education Minister Aloizio Mercadante, one of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s top aides, contacted Eduardo Marzag\u00e3o, a confidant of Mr. Amaral\u2019s, offering to help defray his family\u2019s legal expenses.\u201cHell, Marzag\u00e3o, you tell me how I can help,\u201d Mr. Mercadante said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, to help.\u201dHe was unaware, of course, that Mr. Marzag\u00e3o was recording the call; prosecutors now have Mr. Mercadante on their target list, too.The education minister maintains that he was acting on his own. But other powerful people in the Workers\u2019 Party were also scrambling.Jaques Wagner, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s former chief of staff, was recorded discussing the situation with Mr. da Silva. He expressed alarm at Mr. Amaral\u2019s testimony that Ms. Rousseff was aware of graft involved in the 2006 acquisition of a Houston oil refinery by Petrobras.For more than a year, Sergio Moro, a crusading judge in southern Brazil, had overseen the Petrobras inquiry. He seized on new anticorruption legislation allowing defendants to reduce their jail sentences in exchange for information, helping prosecutors jail one powerful figure after another.The labyrinthine inquiry eventually led to Mr. da Silva, universally known as Lula. It was clear that the former president had profited from connections to magnates at the helm of construction companies, which paid him millions of dollars for speeches.Then prosecutors found that such companies had paid to renovate a country estate near S\u00e3o Paulo and a beachfront apartment in the city of Guaruj\u00e1, two properties they contend he controls. (Mr. da Silva denies owning either one.)At the country house, police agents found a mug with the logo of Corinthians, Mr. da Silva\u2019s favorite S\u00e3o Paulo soccer club, engraved with the words \u201cto the illustrious President Lula.\u201d The wine cellar had bottles dedicated to the former president. Docked at a wharf in the lake, pedal boats were inscribed with the names of his grandchildren, Pedro and Arthur.As the investigators encircled him, Mr. da Silva grew increasingly alarmed, according to intercepts of his phone calls obtained in the inquiry. He disparaged the Supreme Federal Tribunal, used vulgar epithets to describe the heads of both houses of Congress and called on his comrades in the Workers\u2019 Party to ratchet up pressure on prosecutors.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we intimidate them?\u201d the former president asked one congressman. Instructing him on how to irritate an investigator, Mr. da Silva said: \u201cHe needs to go to sleep knowing that the following day he\u2019ll have 10 legislators irritating him at his house, irritating him at his office, facing a case at the Supreme Federal Tribunal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only person who could set this country on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to do what Nero did, you know?\u201dAs the pressure mounted, Mr. Amaral\u2019s 255-page plea deal was leaked into the news media in early March, provoking a round of angry denials and desperate moves. Ms. Rousseff nominated Mr. da Silva, her predecessor and patron, to be her chief of staff, which would give him broad legal protections.For a few hours on March 16, the audacious plan seemed to work.That same day, Judge Moro released recordings of Mr. da Silva\u2019s phone calls with Ms. Rousseff and an array of other politicians. The calls depicted a former president seeking to salvage his heroic narrative alongside a sitting leader trying to stave off impeachment proceedings she has likened to a slow-motion coup.Justices on the Supreme Federal Tribunal suspended Mr. da Silva\u2019s nomination. But the soft-spoken judge also faced recriminations, for revealing conversations of the nation\u2019s leader without the authorization of its highest court, leading to accusations that his once-admired inquiry had become a partisan witch hunt.As the legal case grinds on, more allies are abandoning Ms. Rousseff with an eye on seizing power for themselves. They say she should be impeached for violating fiscal laws by using funds from state banks to cover budget gaps.In Congress, lawmakers accused of immense personal corruption are speeding up the impeachment process of the president, who has not been tainted with claims of illicit personal enrichment.Mr. Amaral, whom the Senate ethics committee is trying to expel from his seat, has not watched this spectacle from the sidelines. On March 13, he revved up a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and joined hundreds of thousands of antigovernment protesters in S\u00e3o Paulo. But he did not remove his helmet, wary of how the angry crowd might react.Days later, during an interview in the comfortable villa in S\u00e3o Paulo where he is now under house arrest, Mr. Amaral turned to song to try to capture the political upheaval that he helped create.Specifically, he invoked the 1978 song \u201cFortune Teller,\u201d by Ivan Lins, about the targeting of dissidents by Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Only instead of dissidents tumbling from the perch, today it is leaders of nearly every ideological stripe.Gazing out the window, Mr. Amaral voiced the lyrics:The King of Diamonds is falling,The King of Spades is falling,The King of Clubs is falling, They\u2019re all falling, Nothing remains.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the senator said. \u201cEveryone is falling together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its government is straining under a mountain of debt, the economy is deteriorating and the Zika virus is spreading. Only Congress has the power to help, but it is not moving fast enough.It has been clear for months that the federal government needs to give Puerto Rico a way to restructure its $72 billion debt and impose a financial control board to oversee decisions by local lawmakers. But the effort to pass legislation is facing stiff opposition from some House Republicans, who have bought into false arguments made by hedge funds and other investors that this would amount to a federal bailout or that it could open the door to bankruptcy filings by state governments.Puerto Rico, which has already defaulted on some of its debt, does not have the money to make big bond payments that are coming due in May and July. The island\u2019s government is so short of cash that it has delayed more than $2 billion in payments to vendors and delayed tax refunds to individuals. Public hospitals have closed floors and are rationing medicine at a time when health experts fear a surge in Zika infections that can cause birth defects.Done right, legislation that would help Puerto Rico through its financial crisis would not cost the federal government any money. And allowing the island to restructure its debt would not mean that Congress would have to give states like Illinois that also owe a lot of money to investors the ability to do the same.If Congress does not act now, Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis could drag on for years. The island\u2019s government would have to cut more public services, and more of the island\u2019s 3.5 million people would seek a better life on the mainland, which would further reduce tax revenue.

{"Headline": "In Victory for Unions, Law on Dues Is Struck Down in Wisconsin", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byA Wisconsin law barring unions from requiring workers in the private sector to pay the equivalent of union dues was struck down late Friday after a judge deemed it a violation of the state\u2019s Constitution.Democrats and union leaders in the industrial Midwest, a region where organized labor has been weakened by a series of new laws in recent years, cheered the ruling, but its fate almost immediately seemed uncertain. Republican leaders in Wisconsin, where a conservative bloc holds a majority on a sharply divided State Supreme Court, pledged to appeal the lower court\u2019s ruling and said they felt confident that the law would ultimately stand.In his ruling, Judge C. William Foust of Dane County Circuit Court agreed with three unions that had contested the measure, saying that the law amounted to a taking of their property without just compensation. The unions \u2014 local chapters of the International Association of Machinists, United Steelworkers and the A.F.L-C.I.O. \u2014 contended that the law added up to a seizure of their property since they were now required to provide union benefits like collective bargaining to workers who opted not to pay the equivalent of dues.\u201cLabor is a commodity that can be bought and sold,\u201d the judge wrote in his ruling. \u201cA doctor, a telephone company, a mechanic \u2014 all would be shocked to find they do not own the services they perform,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cUnions are no different; they have legally protectable property interest in the services they perform for their members and nonmembers.\u201dSoon after taking office, Mr. Walker pushed for a bill that cut collective bargaining for most public sector workers and removed requirements that they pay fees if they chose not to join unions that represented them. The law from 2015, found unconstitutional in Friday\u2019s ruling, applied to the private sector.Democrats, who had vehemently objected to the right-to-work law, hailed the ruling. Representative Peter Barca, the Democratic minority leader in the Assembly, said in a statement that Wisconsin\u2019s economy has suffered since the right-to-work law was signed.\u201cMiddle class Wisconsin workers are in crisis and so-called \u2018right to work\u2019 laws have been shown to drive down wages and economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe extreme right-wing Republican agenda has been incredibly harmful to working people and businesses in Wisconsin.\u201dPhil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin State A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he viewed the decision as a \u201cneeded check on Scott Walker\u2019s attacks on working families.\u201d He added: \u201cRight to work has always been unjust, now it\u2019s proven unconstitutional.\u201dBut Republicans, including the state attorney general, Brad Schimel, seemed confident that the ruling will not hold.\u201cOnce again a liberal Dane County judge is trying to legislate from the bench,\u201d Robin Vos, the state House Speaker, a Republican, said. \u201cNo one should be forced to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment.\u201dGovernor Walker said: \u201cWe are confident Wisconsin\u2019s freedom-to-work law is constitutional and will ultimately be upheld.\u201dEven some Democrats seemed to agree that the ruling might only be temporary.Carolyn Fiddler, the national communications director for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said that while she considered the ruling a \u201cpositive move for working families in Wisconsin,\u201d the conservative state Supreme Court was likely to uphold the law.\u201cIt seems extraordinarily unlikely that this ruling will stand in the long term,\u201d she said. \u201cHigher courts will probably negate this in some fashion.

Islanders needed to be \u201calert, more than ever,\u201d he said.The comments, in a wide-ranging speech, amounted to a pushback against President Obama, who made a groundbreaking visit to Cuba less than a month ago.\u201cWe are not naive,\u201d Mr. Castro said, adding that \u201cpowerful external forces\u201d hoped to \u201ccreate agents of change to end the revolution.\u201dIn a speech that veered between chiding those who resisted change and warning of the perils of moving too quickly, President Castro admitted that the government had completed only a fifth of the economic changes approved at the last congress in 2011, and that Cubans still struggled to get by on their paltry state salaries.The country was being held back by \u201cthe weight of an obsolete mentality,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cworst that a revolutionary can do, whether they are a communist or not, is to cross their arms in the face of problems.\u201dHalf a million Cubans now work outside the government sector, but the country\u2019s economy is growing at less than 3 percent a year. Entrepreneurs have limited access to goods and are prohibited from exporting them.The congress, the first since the United States and Cuba restored diplomatic relations last year after more than 50 years of hostility, will take stock of the economic reform program and elect the party\u2019s leadership for what will be the final years of President Castro\u2019s tenure.Arturo L\u00f3pez Levy, a lecturer at the University of Texas who for years worked for Cuban intelligence, said the slow rate of economic liberalization signaled a victory by the party\u2019s powerful conservatives over its reformers.\u201cThey are organizing the reforms at their own pace,\u201d he said.Younger Cubans, including members of the party, have expressed frustration in recent weeks about the lack of information about the congress\u2019s agenda and the party\u2019s overwhelmingly elderly hierarchy.\u201cNow is the moment for a generational change,\u201d said Harold C\u00e1rdenas Lema, a Cuban blogger.

But research to be unveiled this week by four leading academic economists suggests that the damage to manufacturing jobs from a sharp acceleration in globalization since the turn of the century has contributed heavily to the nation\u2019s bitter political divide.Ms. Hughes avoids discussing the election with her mother, but their neighbor Benjamin Green, 83, knows just what Washington needs. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a junkyard dog to straighten this country out,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not about incumbents changing their positions,\u201d said David Autor, an influential scholar of labor economics and trade at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the paper\u2019s authors. \u201cIt\u2019s about the replacement of moderates with more ideological successors.\u201dMr. Autor added: \u201cIn retrospect, whether it\u2019s Trump or Sanders, we should have seen in it coming. The China shock isn\u2019t the sole factor, but it is something of a missing link.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Autor, the research was conducted by David Dorn of the University of Zurich; Gordon Hanson, a professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Kaveh Majlesi of Lund University in Sweden.\u201cExposure to import competition is bad for centrists,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that political polarization and income inequality track each other, but that pattern is simply a correlation. We\u2019ve now found a mechanism for how economic changes create further political divisions.\u201dParker Griffith experienced the move away from the political middle firsthand.A so-called Blue Dog Democrat who represented Courtland and the rest of Alabama\u2019s Fifth Congressional District, he switched to the Republicans in 2009 and metamorphosed into a moderate Republican. But that wasn\u2019t enough to save his seat.Dr. Griffith was beaten in the Republican primary in 2010 by Morris J. Brooks Jr., who has emerged as one of the most right-wing members of Congress.\u201cIf you\u2019re under economic stress and you can\u2019t provide for your family, the easiest answer is to find someone to blame,\u201d said Dr. Griffith. \u201cMexicans, illegal immigrants, Obama.\u201dRepresentative Brooks has said that he would consider \u201canything short of shooting\u201d illegal immigrants to get them out of the country and that he favored imposing heavy tariffs on China to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d and punish Beijing for what he sees as currency manipulation.In the case of the Fifth District, which includes Huntsville and its space- and defense-related industries, as well as more industrial Florence along the Tennessee River, the move has been to the right.But Mr. Autor and his colleagues found that in districts with heavy minority representation, similar shocks can push more Democratic districts in the opposite direction. While whites hit hard by trade tend to move right, nonwhite voters move left, eroding support for moderates in both parties, the study concluded.As the South industrialized in the second half of the 20th century, poor Alabamians who once toiled on farms were able to secure a toehold in the middle class. In the shadow of Tennessee Valley Authority dams that supplied cheap power, thousands of workers sewed jeans and T-shirts, and could earn upward of $20 an hour in heavily unionized factories.But the collapse of the apparel industry here in the first decade of the 21st century, following China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, reversed that process.Nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared. At 7.4 percent, the regional unemployment rate is well below its peak of 12.8 percent in 2010, but remains far above the national average of 5 percent.The new paper underscores a broader rethinking among economists of the costs and benefits of policies aimed at encouraging industrial competition across borders.\u201cThere\u2019s a deeper appreciation for the magnitude of the impact on workers who lose their jobs,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cBut the nature of globalization changed after the end of the Cold War and it took a while for academics to catch up.\u201dUntil the Nafta agreement with Canada and Mexico in 1994, and especially the entry of China into the W.T.O., trade deals were mostly multilateral and the rise in manufacturing imports to the United States came primarily from other advanced industrial nations like Germany and Japan.\u201cChina and the W.T.O. represented a shock that was way larger,\u201d Mr. Autor said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen shocks like this because we were trading with rich countries, not highly productive developing countries with enormous labor reserves.\u201dTo understand the connection between imports from China and political polarization, the researchers focused on the fact that manufacturers tend to localize in a specific region.\u201cThere are these concentrated pockets of hurt,\u201d Mr. Autor said, \u201cand we\u2019re seeing the political consequences of that.\u201dMr. Autor and Mr. Hanson emphasize that trade is only one factor among many that have contributed to a polarizing Congress (income inequality is another, as are attitudes toward immigrants). But it has been an important one, particularly over the last decade, when Chinese imports ramped up.This trade-induced polarization has had a significant effect on the overall ideological makeup of Congress.The authors found that voters in congressional districts hardest hit by Chinese imports tended to choose more ideologically extreme lawmakers.Between 2002 and 2010, districts in the top 5th percentile of trade exposure, on average, experienced a 19 percent greater drop in manufacturing employment relative to districts at the other end of the spectrum. Those hard-hit districts became, on average, far more conservative: the ideological equivalent of moving from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz.Some very conservative members of Congress have been sympathetic to free trade arguments in the past, but Representative Brooks, who has welcomed support from the Tea Party, doesn\u2019t mince words about where he stands.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do whatever is necessary to ensure that a foreign country isn\u2019t able to successfully attack and destroy significant parts of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in China two weeks ago and they are going to clean our plow if we don\u2019t act.\u201dMr. Autor, like most economists, is still persuaded of the long-established benefits that global trade confers on the economy as a whole. But he recognizes that angry voters have valid reasons to be frustrated.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of diffuse benefits and concentrated costs, but our political system hasn\u2019t addressed those costs,\u201d he said.Some staunch defenders of globalization, like Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, also acknowledge that the federal government has failed to adequately address the needs of workers dislocated by lowered import barriers.But the benefit of free trade is \u201c10 times the size of the losses,\u201d he said. \u201cFree trade really helps working-class people in terms of lower prices for products. The benefits are skewed toward people with lower income because they spend a much larger fraction of their income on merchandise.\u201dPerhaps, but that\u2019s cold comfort to people in northern Alabama, where wages are stagnant and manufacturing jobs are still disappearing.In nearby Decatur, the big Nucor steel plant is hanging on, but it is under intense pressure from Asian imports, said the company\u2019s chief executive, John J. Ferriola. Nucor has a no-layoff policy, but pay and bonuses have been cut at the company\u2019s five Alabama facilities.Does the steel industry in Alabama have a future? \u201cTell me what\u2019s going to happen with imports,\u201d Mr. Ferriola said.And in 2014, the giant International Paper mill in Courtland closed abruptly, costing over 1,000 people their jobs.\u201cThirty years ago, it was booming,\u201d Ms. Hughes said, pointing out where Courtland\u2019s hardware store, the pharmacy and the five-and-dime used to be. \u201cBut those days are never coming back.\u201dNelson D. Schwartz reported from Courtland, Ala., and Quoctrung Bui from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kerry Makes Sudden Trip to Iraq, Affirming U.S. Aid in ISIS Fight", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry made an unannounced visit to Baghdad on Friday, promising continuing American military and humanitarian aid in the fight against the Islamic State, and showing support for the country\u2019s embattled prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.The visit came as Iraqi militias and military forces have been making notable progress on the battlefield against the Islamic State, including seizing parts of Hit, a city in Anbar Province, this week. But politically, Mr. Abadi\u2019s government has been in crisis, undermined by fellow Shiite politicians, struggling to curb corruption and weakened by an economy gutted by low oil prices.Mr. Kerry, visiting Iraq for the first time in two years, made a point of praising Mr. Abadi, saying the prime minister had showed \u201ccritical leadership\u201d despite grave difficulties. And Mr. Kerry called for sectarian and political unity behind the government, saying it was critical to rolling back the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.\u201cIt is important to have a unified and functioning government as soon as possible, so that these operations are not affected,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a news conference. \u201cWe call on the Iraqi political blocs to work together for the sake of their country and to keep Iraq\u2019s interests a priority over other personal and sectarian interests.\u201dHe said it was vital to continue putting pressure on the Islamic State, saying that airstrikes and assistance from American trainers and Special Operations forces in Iraq, now numbering around 4,000, had been effective and would be critical to the main goal ahead: retaking the city of Mosul, in northern Nineveh Province. But that direct assault has long been delayed, and for the time being, he said, Iraqi officials had not requested additional troops from the United States.Mr. Kerry promised $155 million in additional humanitarian assistance, particularly to help in rebuilding cities destroyed in the fighting, like the Anbar provincial capital, Ramadi, and to help displaced families resettle.Meeting privately with Mr. Abadi, he also discussed maintaining close relations between the United States and Iraq, according to a statement from Mr. Abadi\u2019s office. Despite the mutual expressions of support, that relationship has been tested in recent months. Iran, a close ally of Iraq\u2019s Shiite political leadership, has resisted increased American military assistance, and Russia, as it has become more involved in the sectarian war next door in Syria, has also sought to strengthen its influence in Iraq, as a counter to American interests in the region.Mr. Kerry met later with the Iraqi foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and with Sunni and Kurdish political leaders.He arrived in Baghdad after attending a Gulf Cooperation Council conference in Bahrain, where he pressed other governments in the region to help shore up the Iraqi government and seek a solution to the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behind Mitsubishi\u2019s Faked Data, Fierce Competition", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 In most of the world, few consumers even know microcars exist. But in Japan, the tiny vehicles, whose fuel consumption is as small as their price tags, are a crucial battleground for domestic automakers.And for years, Mitsubishi Motors has been losing to its heavyweight competitors.Rivals like Suzuki and Daihatsu, an affiliate of Toyota, produce vehicles with significantly better mileage, a crucial selling point for cars designed to appeal to the most budget-conscious buyers. That, specialists said, may have tempted Mitsubishi to cheat. Although the company said it was retesting the affected vehicles to determine their true fuel economy, Mitsubishi\u2019s president, Tetsuro Aikawa, estimated on Wednesday that \u201cimproper\u201d tests had inflated their ratings 5 percent to 10 percent.\u201cThe competition in keis is all about fuel consumption. It\u2019s extremely fierce,\u201d said Koichi Hatamura, a former Mazda engineer who now runs an independent technology firm, Hatamura Engine Research Office. \u201cMitsubishi has no technology for improving fuel efficiency but has no money to spend, either. Its development people were given an impossible task, to cut costs and improve mileage.\u201dOn Thursday, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism removed documents from a Mitsubishi technical center in central Japan. The ministry said it had begun searching for evidence at Mitsubishi facilities on Wednesday.The company\u2019s share price plunged about 20 percent on Thursday \u2014 the daily limit in yen terms \u2014 compounding a 15 percent drop a day earlier.Mitsubishi is one of the smaller players in the crowded Japanese car industry, selling one vehicle for every eight shipped globally by Toyota, the world\u2019s largest producer. In the race to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles, Mitsubishi has focused its scarce resources on new technology: The company was one of the first to produce an all-electric vehicle, the iMiev.But perhaps as a result, experts said, it has fallen behind in the crucial task of making its traditional gasoline-powered engines more efficient.Even with an exaggerated mileage rating, the most fuel-efficient version of Mitsubishi\u2019s microcar, the eK, ranked 10th among kei models sold in Japan, according to Car Sensor, a website that tracks automobile data.The now discredited rating of 30.4 kilometers per liter, or about 71.5 miles per gallon, compared with a rating of 37 kilometers per liter for the top-ranked Suzuki Alto. Not coincidentally, Mitsubishi also lagged in sales.\u201cCompetition has increased among kei producers, but it\u2019s really been a fight between Suzuki, Daihatsu and Honda,\u201d said Koji Endo, an automotive analyst at Advanced Research Japan. \u201cMitsubishi has been left out.\u201dJapan\u2019s government increased new-vehicle taxes on keis last year, a policy shift intended to narrow the price gap between them and full-size cars. That has added pressure on kei manufacturers, whose profit margins were already narrow.Mitsubishi started supplying versions of the eK to Nissan several years ago under a joint venture agreement, a deal that may have further increased the temptation to exaggerate the car\u2019s performance. The first Nissan-branded eKs \u2014 sold by Nissan as the Dayz \u2014 went on sale in 2013, the same year Mitsubishi says its cheating began.\u201cNissan let Mitsubishi take the lead in developing minicars, but Mitsubishi\u2019s own level of tech was not that high,\u201d Mr. Endo said. \u201cThey had a lot of incentives\u201d to cheat.Nissan engineers were the ones who spotted the mileage-rating discrepancy, Mitsubishi said.There are fears that other models besides the eK may be caught up in the scandal. Mr. Aikawa, Mitsubishi\u2019s president, said the company had used unapproved testing methods on an unspecified number of other lines over the years, and was currently reviewing their mileage ratings.Mitsubishi had spent years trying to rebuild its reputation after another scandal. In 2000, the company admitted that it had been hiding reports on vehicle defects for more than two decades. Sales plunged, top executives were arrested and the carmaker came close to collapse; it was saved only by an injection of capital from other companies in the loosely allied Mitsubishi group of companies.Mitsubishi\u2019s latest admission is the latest in a series of cheating revelations to hit the automobile industry. Carmakers\u2019 reporting of fuel economy and pollution ratings is under especially close scrutiny after Volkswagen admitted last year that it had installed software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. The Japanese Transportation Ministry said it had sent a letter on Wednesday to other carmakers, asking them to check their fuel economy test data. But it did not specify how the companies could prove they had not cheated like Mitsubishi, which has until April 27 to report back on the affair; the other carmakers have until May 18.\u201cThis is an extremely serious matter,\u201d Yoshihide Suga, the government\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, said at a daily news briefing. \u201cI hope all the details of this improper conduct will be revealed as soon as possible, and stringent measures to ensure vehicle safety.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Revelations of the Panama Papers", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:The newspapers from many countries working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists set aside their usual competitive nature by printing their stories on the same day. This is journalism at its finest.JAGJIT SINGHLos Altos, Calif.To the Editor:Publication of the Panama Papers has understandably generated a blizzard of articles and commentary. Most has concentrated on the use of offshore companies and trusts as vehicles for hiding ill-gotten gains and/or the evasion of taxes. There are, however, other very good reasons that people use these structures.The first reason arises from the unequal treatment of foreign people under United States estate and gift tax laws. If an American dies with property worth $5 million, the heirs pay no federal estate tax. If a foreigner dies with $5 million in American property, the heirs will pay a federal estate tax of 40 percent, or $2 million.This creates a great incentive for foreigners to organize their American estates in a manner that reduces or eliminates this tax burden. The easiest way is to have one\u2019s American assets held in the name of a foreign holding company.The second reason is confidentiality. There are millions of people around the world who live in constant fear of political instability and rampant crime. If, through hard work, creativity or just good fortune, a person accumulates significant property, he or she can easily become a target for the unscrupulous.Because the United States is a stable country of laws, these people want to invest here. Foreign investment by individuals is an important source of capital for American businesses. If, as has recently happened with the Panama Papers, the identities of these people are stolen, both their property and security may be seriously compromised.While rooting out crime and corruption is an admirable goal, beware the law of unintended consequences. The misappropriation and publication of this confidential information may create problems.D.

Broke, depressed, newly divorced and desperate to regain his financial footing, he is acutely aware that his entire future depends on the successful completion of a deal involving the sale of a miraculous invention that suggests the modern equivalent of Aladdin\u2019s magic lamp. Later in the movie, we see a brief, underwhelming demonstration of its wonders.From the moment Alan lands, he encounters humiliating obstacles. The king, he is told, is away but is expected back very soon. But the days drag on, and the lives of Alan and the three-person I.T. support team that preceded him become a Beckettian waiting game.Instead of a modern hotel, Alan finds his assistants languishing in a sweltering tent without air-conditioning or Wi-Fi in the King\u2019s Metropolis of Economy and Trade, a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City. This metropolis, still under construction, consists of mostly empty skyscrapers. The scenes in which he wanders through this desolate ghost city, which seems in a state of suspension, are among the film\u2019s strongest.Jet-lagged and sleep-deprived, Alan tries in vain to find his bearings, while obsessing about a strange lump on his back that he unsuccessfully tries to remove. His tentative surgery on himself leads him to consult Zahra Hakem (Sarita Choudhury, from \u201cHomeland\u201d), a Saudi doctor with whom he develops an unlikely romantic connection.Alan becomes infuriated but never enraged. Confronting disaster, he grits his teeth and puts on an optimistic face. Mr. Hanks, in his best clownish mode, scrunches his features into all manner of amusing grimaces. But even when Alan is on the brink of nervous exhaustion, you trust him to find the answers. The movie\u2019s weaker scenes try to fill in his background and family history with flashbacks, in which we meet his ex-wife and daughter, whose college tuition he can\u2019t afford.

As a former executive for the Schwinn Bicycle Company, Alan, we learn, once shipped jobs abroad.Alan\u2019s guide on this faraway planet is Yousef (Alexander Black), a goofy, oddly paranoid taxi driver who is obsessed with loud American rock music.

{"Headline": "Alaska Air\u2019s Premium Deal for Virgin America", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAlaska Air is paying through the nose cone for Virgin America. The airline secures some coveted airport slots with its $2.6 billion deal for Richard Branson\u2019s American carrier. Cost cuts fall way short of the deal\u2019s premium to Virgin\u2019s share price, however. It\u2019s a risky bet that the airline industry has changed its destructive ways.There may be some validity to the thesis from Alaska Air, a company with an investment-grade rating and net cash on its balance sheet. Domestic airlines have benefited from a decent economy in recent years and a series of mergers \u2014 most of them struck when one or both partners were struggling \u2014 that slashed costs. The precipitous fall in the price of oil also saved $18 billion in fuel expenses for the sector last year, two-fifths of which landed right on the bottom line, according to Barclays.Pretax margins are 20 percent or higher for the best among them: Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and Alaska. Laggards like United Continental and American Airlines generate about 12 percent. A few years ago, such results would have been just a pipe dream.Bradley Tilden, Alaska Air\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is only going a short way with this acquisition. Virgin America accounted for 1.7 percent of air traffic in the United States last year. That won\u2019t make up much ground against the big four, which control more than four-fifths of the market. Adding West Coast hubs and bulking up in New York and Dallas could, however, lay the groundwork for later expansion.The two airlines, though, have little overlap in either routes or planes. Alaska Air flies mostly Boeing, and Virgin flies predominantly Airbus. Expected cost cuts are $50 million after tax. They\u2019re worth $150 million to shareholders, once capitalized and adjusted for the $350 million of merger costs.To help cover the rest of the nearly $1.2 billion premium, Mr. Tilden is relying on a top-line turbo boost from changing which aircraft fly which routes, persuading more passengers to fly Alaska Air and generating more income from the company-branded credit card.These sorts of revenue benefits tend to be harder to realize. There also may be other headwinds. Oil prices are back on the rise. Margins are expected to slide again by 2019, according to analyst forecasts culled by Thomson Reuters. That means Alaska Air\u2019s journey could be a bumpy one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Conservatism: The Pendulum Swings Consistently Right", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byOn perhaps the defining issue of the 2016 Republican primary, Senator Ted Cruz falls well to the right of Ronald Reagan, who supported granting legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants.He opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest, and has called for a federal amendment that would allow states to avoid performing or recognizing same-sex marriages.He wants to return to the gold standard, abolish the Internal Revenue Service and create a tax structure simple enough for Americans to file on postcards.Throughout his Senate career, Republican opponents have cast Mr. Cruz as a master of the ill-considered \u2014 a \u201cwacko bird,\u201d as Senator John McCain of Arizona once called him \u2014 whose seemingly reckless pursuits were thought to place him well outside the mainstream.Yet a close reading of Mr. Cruz\u2019s policy prescriptions, influences and writings over two decades, combined with interviews with conservative intellectual leaders and Cruz allies, suggest two powerful truths about the man who might yet assume the mantle of modern conservatism.He would be the most conservative presidential nominee in at least a half-century, perhaps to the right of Barry Goldwater, testing the electoral limits of a personal ideology he has forged meticulously since adolescence.And he has, more effectively than almost any politician of his generation, anticipated the rightward tilt of the Republican Party of today, grasping its conservatism even as colleagues dismissed him as a fringe figure.Now, even Mr. Cruz\u2019s staunchest Republican enemies tend to criticize him most forcefully on tactics \u2014 lamenting his leading role in the 2013 government shutdown, for instance \u2014 but not on substance, where they have generally arrived at equivalent positions.There have at times been perceptible shifts from Mr. Cruz during the campaign, in both tone and substance, coaxed by the resonance of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist anger and hard-line positions on trade and immigration.But at its core, Mr. Cruz\u2019s brand of conservatism is the product of decades of careful study and manifest intellectual firepower, fusing a host of historical strands into what he has called \u201copportunity conservatism.\u201dThe epigraph for his senior thesis at Princeton, which focused on states\u2019 rights and the Ninth and 10th Amendments, quoted James Madison: \u201cYou must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\u201dHe is fond of invoking Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War dictum (\u201cWe win, they lose\u201d), Margaret Thatcher\u2019s dismissal of socialism (\u201cThe problem with socialism is, eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money\u201d), and even, at times, President John F. Kennedy.\u201cI intend to have in the office of president what J.F.K. used to refer to as \u2018vigaaaahhh\u2019 in defending the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Cruz, now 45, told voters in Iowa in January.Some citations are more familiar to conservative audiences than others.References to Mr. Rawls have dwindled since Mr. Cruz began his presidential candidacy last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think Rawls focus-groups in Iowa,\u201d Mr. Ponnuru joked.It is clear that Mr. Cruz, whose campaign did not make him available for an interview, is most animated by constitutional fights over what he views as overreach by the federal government, particularly on matters of religion. He speaks often of his triumphs as solicitor general of Texas, which included the successful defense of the state\u2019s right to display a Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol.He is a creature of the Supreme Court, counting Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist as a former boss and Justice Antonin Scalia as a friend whose strict constructionist views helped shape his own.And arguing last year against a federal ban on marijuana \u2014 despite his personal opposition to marijuana legalization at the state level \u2014 Mr. Cruz recited Justice Louis D. Brandeis\u2019s belief in the states\u2019 role as \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201dIndeed, conservative thinkers have sensed in Mr. Cruz an array of less likely forebears: the faith-focused morality of Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush; President Obama\u2019s disdain for Beltway think-tank consensus; the fictional exploits of Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart.Mr. Cruz seems to take uncommon pride in communicating uncomfortable policy positions to potentially hostile audiences. Mr. Ponnuru likened Mr. Cruz\u2019s opposition to ethanol subsidies in Iowa \u2014 once considered heretical in a presidential primary \u2014 to Mr. Goldwater\u2019s unpopular suggestion in 1964, while campaigning in Tennessee, that the Tennessee Valley Authority should be sold.On matters of foreign policy, Mr. Cruz is viewed much more warily by mainstream Republicans. His pre-Senate career dealt little with international affairs, many say, and his first term has contained some notable shifts.Mr. Cruz entered the Senate in 2013 as part of the Tea Party wave, brandishing a libertarian streak that became more pronounced after revelations of government surveillance tactics, courtesy of Edward J. Snowden.But in the years since, as the national dialogue has grown more consumed by security threats like the Islamic State, Mr. Cruz has recalibrated considerably, leaving an impression among some conservative thinkers that he is merely groping for the median position of the base.Most notable during the campaign has been his pledge to \u201ccarpet-bomb ISIS into oblivion,\u201d which has earned a rebuke from military leaders who define the term specifically as the blanket bombing of even civilian areas. Mr. Cruz has argued his iteration can be more targeted.\u201cThe latest incarnation for him is a sort of realist school of overwhelming military force, but he\u2019s constantly criticizing nation-building,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cI have a feeling he\u2019s more of an amateur in that area.\u201d\u201cBeing critical of Frank is a cottage industry,\u201d said Ms. Coates, whose own r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 she is better known as an art historian \u2014 has been questioned. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, he has been one of the few fearless voices speaking out against the problems of radical Islam.\u201dOther concerns are more semantic. Mr. Cruz has been criticized for appearing to use \u201cneo-con\u201d as a pejorative, and for characterizing his foreign policy views as falling \u201csomewhere in between\u201d two polar extremes: the libertarianism of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and the hawkishness of Mr. McCain or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.He speaks often of Reagan-style \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d reminding crowds that the largest country Mr. Reagan invaded was Grenada.But some conservative foreign policy experts see a crucial difference, implicit in a February speech outlining his military plans in South Carolina.Mr. Wehner worried generally that Mr. Cruz had displayed an \u201cintellectual rigidity\u201d that afforded him little latitude to adapt.Mr. Cruz has long trumpeted his \u201cconsistent conservative\u201d credentials as a strength, proudly recalling his teenage days as part of a team of students who toured event spaces in Texas and wrote out the Constitution on easels.Mr. George\u2019s most memorable lesson was in humility. In his book, Mr. Cruz writes of receiving a graded paper from Mr. George, seeing a \u201cC+\u201d on a folded corner of the first page and panicking. \u201cWith white knuckles, I folded the corner over,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand on the front was written, \u2018Just kidding! A.\u2019\u201dMr. George\u2019s goal was simple. \u201cI thought he should at least have a few moments\u2019 experience,\u201d he said, \u201cof not being the smartest guy in the class.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ride-Hailing Start-Ups Compete in \u2018Uber for Children\u2019 Niche", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe juggle of work, school and myriad extracurricular activities is all too familiar to parents like Kelly Aluise of Los Angeles.Her 12-year-old daughter, Emma, had enrolled in August for after-school surfing and swimming. Ms. Aluise and her ex-husband, who work full time, didn\u2019t know how they would get her to the activities. Complicating matters, Ms. Aluise\u2019s schedule as a real estate agent with Keller Williams is unpredictable.She now schedules three rides a week for her daughter, which costs about $45 to $50 a week. While ride-hailing services have been popular in the start-up economy, new entrepreneurs are going after a specific niche: providing rides for children.These start-ups are nibbling at the industry\u2019s fringes, where Uber and Lyft \u2014 at least officially \u2014 don\u2019t go. (Per policy at Uber and Lyft, drivers are not supposed to give rides to unaccompanied minors.)Although they are still testing the waters in a small number of markets, the sector is already becoming competitive. It\u2019s part of a bigger trend of ride-hailing, with services finding ways to capture a very specific market segment, said Harry Campbell, who writes about the industry at his blog TheRideShareGuy.com and is a driver for Uber and Lyft.Almost all the drivers for these services are women \u2014 often teachers, nannies, day care workers and mothers. Most companies carry insurance that exceeds state requirements and covers liability related to driver (or babysitter) conduct.To a certain extent, many of these start-ups still compete against Uber or Lyft because many drivers for those companies don\u2019t know about the unaccompanied-minor policy or choose to look the other way once they have picked up an underage passenger. \u201cI would say between 10 and 20 percent of rides are minors and it\u2019s increasing,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who corresponds with hundreds of drivers a day because of his blog.As parents try these services, they are becoming more comfortable with the idea of allowing a stranger to drive their children. Ms. Aluise, for instance, receives a photo of the car and driver ahead of time, which she places inside her daughter\u2019s lunchbox. The driver wears a HopSkipDrive shirt and uses a password that confirms her identity to Emma.Ms. Aluise receives a text message when her daughter gets in the car and when she arrives at her destination, and during that time Emma is never unsupervised. Last year Ms. Aluise spent $150 a week for her babysitter to pick Emma up twice a week from school. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about her car either, so that was a little terrifying,\u201d she said.Word-of-mouth marketing and referrals are crucial. \u201cMom networks are very important for us,\u201d said Joanna McFarland, a co-founder and the chief executive of HopSkipDrive. \u201cWe have found that when you solve one parent\u2019s problem and make their life easier, they will tell other parents.\u201dZum just completed a seed round of funding for a little more than $1 million. During its early phase, revenue and customers were growing 65 percent month over month. Today, the company provides 150 to 200 rides a day.Like other start-ups, Zum allows parents to schedule rides ahead of time (even for the entire year) or call for an on-demand ride. All of Zum\u2019s drivers work either a morning or afternoon shift for five to six hours a day, so they rarely drive for other services, said Ritu Narayan, a co-founder of the company while she was a group product manager at eBay.Many of these companies have modest expansion plans, in large part because of the need to hire well-vetted drivers.\u201cIt takes a lot of work to keep supply and demand in balance, to keep the driver pool matched to the customer pool and remain 100 percent reliable, so we\u2019ve taken very pragmatic views on growth,\u201d said Doug Aley, chief executive of Shuddle. \u201cThe demand is there, but it\u2019s not the same as in other industries. If you don\u2019t get your groceries delivered it\u2019s not the end of the world, but we\u2019re talking about someone\u2019s child.\u201dThe extra safety and security measures as well as other features translate to rides that are, on average, more expensive than a ride with Lyft or Uber. For example, HopSkipDrive\u2019s rides are about 10 to 15 percent higher and Kango\u2019s roughly 15 to 20 percent higher.Still, higher fares are not seen as a deterrent because this business is driven, in part, by a force more powerful than economics.\u201cOne factor in this market people don\u2019t talk about is the guilt,\u201d said Ms. McFarland of HopSkipDrive. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of that.\u201dA picture caption on Thursday with an article about ride-hailing services aimed at children whose parents cannot chauffeur them misstated part of the name of a service in Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "How a Great City Could Survive Even Rob Ford", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWHEN Rob Ford\u2019s time as mayor of Toronto became a reality show that lurched from one cringe-inducing revelation to another, one question loomed: How did he come to lead Canada\u2019s largest city? His rumpled suits, fondness for profanity, racist and homophobic remarks, public drunkenness, admitted drug use and general boorishness made Mr. Ford seem like an outlier in a city that had carefully cultivated a reputation for multiculturalism, tolerance and sophistication.But Mr. Ford, who died on March 22 while being treated for a rare form of cancer, wasn\u2019t a sign that something was wrong with the city, but evidence of the smart planning and foresight that helped Toronto avoid many of the problems that plague American cities. In short, Toronto works because its suburbs never separated themselves economically or politically from the city core. Mr. Ford, a suburban populist, may have been an embarrassment to some, but his election shows that the system works.In 1953, the city itself was doing just fine, but the 12 smaller municipalities surrounding it were struggling to keep up with their postwar sprawl. So the province of Ontario imposed a metropolitan government over the entire region to handle big, costly projects: policing, water and sewer systems and major roads. Each of the cities, still run by their local councils, paid into the kitty according to their tax base assessments. Toronto, which had 57 percent of the population, paid 62 percent of the metropolis\u2019s bills.The system certainly had its problems, but it made common cause between the suburbs and the city center. But the rapid rise of suburbia swiftly reversed that cash flow. Just nine years later, Toronto made up just 38 percent of the metropolitan area\u2019s population and it contributed 44 percent of its budget.The system was tweaked over time, and the number of municipalities consolidated to six. Then in 1998, the provincial Progressive Conservative government (including Doug Ford, Rob\u2019s father), forced the amalgamation of all six cities into a single large unit.That set off a political tug of war between the suburbs and the city. Mel Lastman, the longtime mayor of suburban North York, became the first mayor of the new city, and he was, in many ways, the spiritual father of Rob Ford. The owner of the Bad Boy appliance store chain who frequently appeared in the store\u2019s television commercials (the catchphrase was, \u201cWho beats Bad Boy? Nobody!\u201d), Mr. Lastman became something of a national punch line when he called in the army to clean up after a series of heavy snowfalls. And while his personal transgressions pale in comparison with Mr. Ford\u2019s, it emerged in 2000 that Mr. Lastman had secretly fathered two children with a mistress.After Mr. Lastman, the old Toronto reasserted itself and David Miller, a Harvard-educated lawyer and center-leftist, became mayor. But while the original city was prospering again, the suburbs were struggling with a loss of manufacturing jobs.When Mr. Ford campaigned in 2010, he virtually ignored the old city and catered to suburbia\u2019s complaints while condemning what he called downtown\u2019s isolated and unresponsive elites. Once in power, he pushed some fiscal and a lot of symbolic support toward the suburbs but was largely kept in check by the City Council. While not enough time has passed to definitively declare a pattern, Mr. Ford\u2019s successor is John Tory, a centrist and certified member of the old Toronto establishment.The tension between the old Toronto and its suburbs is unlikely to vanish, nor are shifts in fortune between the two sides. But throughout all the battles, Toronto\u2019s unified tax base has supported both and mitigated any political consequences.Compare Toronto\u2019s good fortune with that of one of its closest American neighbors: Detroit. As David Maraniss\u2019s new book, \u201cOnce in a Great City,\u201d explains, Detroit had for years hoped to tie its tax base to that of the surrounding suburbs. Mr. Maraniss unearthed a population study from 1963 that presciently forecast how the movement to the suburbs would accelerate, and warned that the city was being \u201cabandoned by all except those who suffer from relatively great housing, educational and general economic deprivations.\u201dComplicated by questions of race, efforts to create metropolitan government for Detroit never gained momentum and the city, a fraction of its former size, hit bottom in bankruptcy: an abandoned center surrounded by wealthy suburbs that simply look the other way. While other cities in the United States eventually formed metro governments, only Portland, Ore., has followed Toronto\u2019s model and elected a regional council.Toronto, like all big cities, has its problems. But it also has a healthy economy, well-funded public transit, beautiful neighborhoods, a vibrant street life, exceptional cultural institutions and an enviable ethnic and racial mix (despite his occasional comments, Rob Ford drew a lot of support from the suburb\u2019s large immigrant communities). Toronto the Good, so named for the purse-lipped Methodists who once dominated the city, has become Toronto the Great. A couple of Rob Ford jokes on the Jimmy Kimmel show seem a small price to pay.Ian Austen is a correspondent for The New York Times based in Canada.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the $15 Minimum Wage Went From Laughable to Viable", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBACK in November 2012, when Alterique Hall, an $8-an-hour McDonald\u2019s cashier in New York, joined 200 fast-food workers in the first one-day strike for the Fight for $15 campaign, many scoffed at their demand for $15 an hour as pie in the sky. Frustrated with his meager pay, Mr. Hall said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change.\u201d\u201cOnce California and New York go, it is likely that more states will follow,\u201d said Paul K. Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers.In New Jersey, Democratic lawmakers have warned Gov. Chris Christie that if he vetoes a $15 statewide minimum, they will ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment that sets a $15 floor. And in Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has announced plans to push the City Council to embrace the idea. The Legislatures in Connecticut and Massachusetts are also weighing $15.All this momentum might seem startling at a time when the traditional union movement is on its heels, with the percentage of private-sector workers in unions sliding to 6.7 percent. Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin have all enacted anti-union, right-to-work laws since 2011. At least the Supreme Court\u2019s 4-4 decision last week saved the nation\u2019s public-sector unions from a crushing defeat that would have hobbled their finances.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of pro-labor, pro-worker sentiment,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University who has written about populism and popular movements. \u201cInequality is a big issue nowadays. The Fight for $15 has become the way that civil rights was in the early \u201960s \u2014 it\u2019s an issue you can\u2019t avoid. For politicians \u2014 or at least Democratic politicians \u2014 you want to be on the right side.\u201dThe movement for a $15 floor has been partly fueled by the same frustration over wage stagnation and income inequality that has spurred the campaigns of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders. More than 50 million workers earn less than $15 an hour, and many Americans are upset about the loss of millions of factory jobs and the explosion of low-paying service-sector jobs. Mr. Sanders has championed a $15 minimum, but Mr. Trump has attacked the idea, at one point saying that wages are too high. Hillary Clinton has called for a $12 minimum, leaving states and cities to go to $15 if they like.The issue has motivated thousands of protesters to join the Fight for $15\u2019s periodic strikes: What started in one city ultimately swelled to protests in 150 American cities. By many measures, it has become the biggest labor protest in decades, with a wide spectrum of supporters, from college students and inner-city workers to janitors and nursing-home aides. The movement helped to get voters in the Seattle suburb of SeaTac to approve a $15 minimum wage, and not long after in Seattle itself and San Francisco, followed by Los Angeles and Pasadena.\u201cThese victories made people believe this wasn\u2019t some crazy demand,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which has spent millions of dollars underwriting the Fight for $15. \u201cThese incremental victories began to add up, and $15 moved from a demand to a standard. Now the fight is, how fast can you get it.\u201d She added that private employers, including Nationwide Insurance, Facebook and U.P.M.C., Pittsburgh\u2019s largest hospital chain, have increasingly embraced a $15 minimum.In California, two union groups were pushing for referendums to create a $15 minimum by 2021. Worried about a divisive, expensive fight, Mr. Brown embraced compromise: phase in $15 by 2022, giving businesses time to adjust. Employers with fewer than 26 workers would be granted a one-year delay, and the governor could suspend increases if California\u2019s economy stumbled.Business groups and some economists warn that a $15 minimum will foster such stumbles. \u201cFifteen is going to be extremely difficult for retailers to work into their business model,\u201d said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. He said Internet competitors were already hurting many retailers, and \u201cnow you have the Legislature putting an additional burden on brick-and-mortar stores.\u201dDavid Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, estimated that raising the state\u2019s minimum to $15 would reduce employment among the least skilled by 5 percent to 10 percent. Critics of minimum-wage increases predict that workers will be replaced by automation and that businesses will need to raise prices, hurting sales and causing more layoffs. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that a minimum-wage increase will help more people than it hurts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it takes a lot of people getting a $300 raise to offset someone losing their job.\u201dBut Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said an increase to $15 would have little effect on jobs. He acknowledged that it could lead to more automation and higher prices and less sales volume at some businesses, but, he said, those effects \u201cwould be more than offset by increases in consumer purchasing power. That all results in a very small effect on the economy.\u201dHolly Dias, a $10-an-hour Burger King cashier in Sacramento, hailed the plan for a $15 minimum. \u201cThere are days where I have to choose between buying formula or diapers, paying rent or buying monthly bus passes \u2014 these are choices mothers shouldn\u2019t have to make,\u201d said Ms. Dias, who receives food stamps and Medicaid to help her and her 5-month-old son. \u201cMaybe this will mean I won\u2019t have to be on public assistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "J.F.K. at Dawn\u2019s Early Light of Reality TV", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byOn DVDRonald Reagan was a movie star who became a politician; John F. Kennedy was a politician who took on the glamour of a movie star.The process began before Senator Kennedy\u2019s election to the presidency in 1960, when he gave Robert Drew, a producer of news films for Time Inc., permission to document his campaign during the Wisconsin primary. Kennedy\u2019s opponent, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, had no choice but to follow that lead.Of the four, \u201cPrimary\u201d has the most historical value \u2014 not just as a record of Kennedy in campaign mode but also as a pioneering example of American cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9. In 1961, Film Culture magazine awarded \u201cPrimary\u201d its third independent film award, for heralding an era \u201cwhen a filmmaker can shoot his film, with sound, alone and by himself and unobtrusively, almost the same way as a poet observing a scene.\u201dCertainly, \u201cPrimary\u201d helped change the nature of documentary filmmaking. Empowered by hand-held cameras and portable sound equipment, three members of Mr. Drew\u2019s team \u2014 Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles and D. A. Pennebaker \u2014 would soon be recognized as leading practitioners of the form.Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 supported the sense, prevalent in the 1960s (and again current with reality TV) that life itself was a sort of movie. Anything captured on film was part of the spectacle; anyone was potentially worth watching. Thus \u201cPrimary\u201d is mainly a study in personality types. Humphrey, whose first conversation with a supporter includes an enthusiastic \u201cYou betcha!,\u201d seems like a character out of \u201cFargo,\u201d while Kennedy, a magnet for crowds, already has the aura of a celebrity. Each campaign has its own theme song, both adopted from soundtracks: Humphrey\u2019s reworked \u201cThe Ballad of Davy Crockett,\u201d from a Disney television mini-series, while Kennedy\u2019s peppier anthem drew on \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d from the 1959 Frank Sinatra film \u201cA Hole in the Head.\u201dKennedy, not surprisingly, was pleased and, once president, facilitated a second Drew documentary. Broadcast early in his administration, \u201cAdventures on the New Frontier\u201d is basically a puff piece; its most revealing scoop is the self-portrait Kennedy has up in the Oval Office. \u201cCrisis,\u201d produced two and a half years later, is more performative \u2014 although here Kennedy is upstaged by Alabama\u2019s new governor, George C. Wallace.An inflammatory segregationist, Wallace flew the Confederate flag over his statehouse and promised to defy federal law by personally turning away any black student who tried to integrate the University of Alabama. As with \u201cPrimary,\u201d Mr. Drew secured permission to document both sides of the conflict.Wallace postures and invokes the Civil War, while Kennedy; his brother Robert, at the time the attorney general; and Nicholas Katzenbach, the deputy attorney general, map their legal strategy. The promised physical confrontation never occurs. Instead, the movie ends with the president, in a televised address to the nation, taking a personal stand against segregation. (Hours later, the N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi, a political murder that the movie does not mention.)Shown at the first New York Film Festival on a program with Robert Bresson\u2019s \u201cThe Trial of Joan of Arc,\u201d and subsequently broadcast by ABC, \u201cCrisis\u201d was not well received. The New York Times television critic Jack Gould called it \u201ca prime example of governmental surrender to the ceaseless and often thoughtless demands of the entertainment world.\u201d If, in some ways, \u201cCrisis\u201d remains current, Mr. Gould\u2019s criticism is even more so.\u201cPanic in Year Zero!,\u201d a quintessential Kennedy-era movie, was released to drive-ins by American-International in the summer of 1962 (on a double bill with Roger Corman\u2019s \u201cTales of Terror\u201d). Now on disc from Kino Lorber, it anxiously ponders both the threat of nuclear war and the survival of the nuclear family.Mr. Milland, who also directed the film, plays the paterfamilias with a dyspeptic bossiness appropriate to his dual capacity. Thanks to his unrelenting grouchiness, \u201cPanic\u201d is an occasionally risible nightmare version of \u201cFather Knows Best,\u201d but the temper of the times may be gauged by the tone of Variety\u2019s reviewer: \u201cThe aftermath of a nuclear attack is the subject pursued by this serious, sobering and engrossing film.\u201d Like a documentary waiting to happen.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

He was 68.The cause was cancer, his wife, Karen Warner Kurtzman, said.While working for the United Nations, Mr. Kurtzman was among the first economists to flag the Latin American debt crisis in the 1990s. He was so habitually wary about business being buffeted by outside forces that he was credited with coining the term \u201ceconomic headwinds.\u201dMr. Kurtzman, a former managing senior fellow at the nonpartisan Milken Institute, an economic research firm, wrote, co-wrote or edited more than 20 books, including \u201cThe Death of Money,\u201d which forecast the fragility of the digital network that replaced paper currency. Others, like \u201cThe Decline and Crash of the American Economy,\u201d were predicated on equally bleak outcomes.Those four transformational forces make America unique, Mr. Kurtzman asserted. The notion that American manufacturing had fizzled was a fallacy, he said, considering what companies based in the United States produce abroad and what foreign companies make in America.\u201cGerman, Canadian and French students may throw rocks at the police during anti-globalization demonstrations, but they do it with American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll or rap on their iPhones and iPods, listening to their music using Beats headphones made by Dr. Dre,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey wear Levi\u2019s jeans and Nike running shoes (the perfect shoes to wear when you\u2019re protesting against America) while digesting Big Macs and fries or Crunchwraps from Taco Bell.\u201cWhen they get home,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey do their homework on Dell or Apple computers and take American medicines to make sure their police-inflicted bruises do not get infected. They do this while the police, who try to stop the demonstrations, talk on Motorola emergency radios, fly American-made helicopters, and \u2014 if need be \u2014 spray American-made pepper and tear gas to clear the gatherings.\u201dJoel Allen Kurtzman was born in Los Angeles on June 25, 1947, the son of Samuel Kurtzman, an immigrant from Russia who became a dentist, and the former Roselle Rosencranz.He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1970 and received a master\u2019s in economic forecasting from the University of Houston-Clear Lake.In addition to his wife, the former Karen Warner Smith, he is survived by a son, Eli; a stepdaughter, Katherine Warner Molek; and a sister, Kaaren Kurtzman.Mr. Kurtzman had the title global lead partner for thought leadership and innovation at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he developed an \u201copacity index,\u201d which measured the risks of doing business abroad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Tariff on Chinese Imports Would Ripple Through American Life", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhat\u2019s more likely, though, is that the new tariffs would set off a cascade of global economic consequences, mostly negative.But if there were a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, at least part of that would probably be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices. Americans would end up buying fewer Chinese things, and fewer things from anywhere else.Shrinking sales of Chinese products would generally hurt American businesses and workers. A product labeled \u201cMade in China\u201d is not necessarily 100 percent Chinese, since many goods are assembled in China with parts from the United States and elsewhere. Sluggish purchases of these so-called Chinese products would reduce the sales of their American components, too.In fact, making Chinese-made goods more expensive would ripple through American shopping malls. An extra $20 for, say, children\u2019s clothing from China is $20 not spent on a new baseball glove for a child, or a birthday gift for a grandmother. A tariff on China would dent the sales of all kinds of products, even those made in the United States.A big tariff would also harm China. Depressing its exports to the United States would deal another blow to an economy already enduring its worst slowdown in 25 years. In the longer term, increasing the cost of doing business in China would probably prompt manufacturers of basic consumer items to consider moving out of China.Though higher costs in China might prompt some companies to move production back to the United States, a more plausible destination would be other emerging economies with lower costs. A factory worker earns, on average, $230 a month in India, $185 in Vietnam and $100 in Bangladesh, according to the Japanese survey.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff proposal addresses a real and legitimate concern about the effect of competition from low-wage countries on American workers. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to solve the problem \u2014 and it could create even more.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Debate, Hillary Clinton Leaves Questions About Approach to Banks", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe banking discussion started with a question about the news that sent a chill through the large banks this week. Federal regulators rejected special plans that large banks now have to draw up to show how they would go through bankruptcy in an orderly fashion. Early in the debate, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash noted that, if the five banks don\u2019t fix the plans, the regulators could, as a last resort, require them to break up.Ms. Bash asked Mrs. Clinton: \u201cSo, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks, something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.But what followed was not absolutely clear.Mrs. Clinton described two powers she would have under the Dodd-Frank Act, the law Congress passed to overhaul the financial system. She said how these powers might be used to break up the banks. But she might have left viewers confused over when she could use them.Under one interpretation, Mrs. Clinton appeared to be saying that she would quickly use the powers to pressure the banks to get smaller \u2014 an aggressive stance that might win admiration from Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters.But it is also plausible that Mrs. Clinton was saying that, while her administration would emphasize a tough line on the banks, it would not actually use the Dodd-Frank powers until a serious debacle started to occur in the banking sector. This would be a more reactive approach, and, if no banking disasters happened on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s watch, it could leave the banks at more or less the size they are today.Here is what Mrs. Clinton said to Ms. Bash: \u201cI will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the tests under Dodd-Frank. There are two sections there, and if they fail either one, that they\u2019re a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you\u2019re referring to, are inadequate.\u201dMrs. Clinton added: \u201cI have been standing up and saying continuously, \u2018We have the law; we\u2019ve got to execute under it.\u2019 So you\u2019re right: I will move immediately to break up any financial institution.\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton said \u201cliving wills,\u201d she was referring to the special bankruptcy plans that five big banks drew up, but that failed to pass muster with regulators. If after two years, the banks have not fixed the deficiencies that the regulators identified, the regulators can require the banks to take steps that would make them smaller.But the five banks, which include JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, are now going to do everything they can to get their living wills in order. The last thing they want to do is give the regulators the right to demand that they downsize. So as things stand today, it is unlikely that Mrs. Clinton will get the chance to use the living wills to carry out a sweeping breakup of the biggest banks.Nor is the other test going to give the next president an easy-to-use tool to dismantle large banks.This is the Kanjorski amendment, an obscure provision in Dodd-Frank that is named for Paul Kanjorski, a former Democratic representative who helped design this part of the legislation. In her answer, Mrs. Clinton said the government would have the power to act with force when banks become \u201ca grave risk to our economy.\u201dThe Kanjorski amendment does just that. It gives a council of regulators the ability to determine that a large bank or financial firm poses a \u201cgrave threat to the financial stability of the United States.\u201d After a vote, the council can demand the bank take certain steps to reduce its riskiness, but if those are deemed inadequate, the council can tell the bank to sell assets.But if Mrs. Clinton were to use this power simply to break up the banks, and not because the system was in imminent danger, it would be viewed as a radical, even destabilizing, step. The chances of the Kanjorski amendment\u2019s being used outside of an emergency to achieve broader policy goals are close to zero.Mrs. Clinton most likely knows this. And it may be why she favors legislation to do things that Dodd-Frank cannot do. This is from her website:\u201cAs president, Clinton would pursue legislation that enhances regulators\u2019 authorities under Dodd-Frank to ensure that no financial institution is too large and too risky to manage.\u201d It adds: \u201cIf firms can\u2019t be managed effectively, regulators would have the explicit statutory authorization to require that they reorganize, downsize or break apart.\u201dGetting Congress to pass a new law to break up the banks would be hard. But, as we have seen from looking closely at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s assertions, the existing law does not make it easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will You Sprint, Stroll or Stumble Into a Career?", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byAt the age of 18, G. Stanley Hall left his home in the tiny village of Ashfield, Mass., for Williams College, just 35 miles away, with a goal to \u201cdo something and be something in the world.\u201d His mother wanted him to become a minister, but the young Stanley wasn\u2019t sure about that plan. He saw a four-year degree as a chance to explore.Though Hall excelled at Williams, his parents, who were farmers, considered his undergraduate years a bit erratic. He didn\u2019t think he had the requirements for a pastor, but nonetheless enrolled in Union Theological Seminary in New York after graduation. The big city was intoxicating, and living there persuaded him to abandon his religious studies. After securing a loan, he set off for Germany to study philosophy, travel and visit the theaters, bars and dance halls of Berlin.\u201cWhat exactly are you doing over there?\u201d his father sternly asked. Hall added physiology and physics to his academic pursuits and told his parents he was thinking about getting a Ph.D. in philosophy. \u201cJust what is a Doctor of Philosophy?\u201d his mother wanted to know.His parents wanted him to come home and get a real job, and even Hall, having \u201cscarcely tried my hand in the world to know where I can do anything,\u201d wondered what was next. He was out of money and in debt, so he returned home after his parents refused to support him financially. He was 27 years old.Hall\u2019s story is similar to that of many young Americans today. They go off to college, resist pressures to choose a job-connected major, then drift after graduation, often short of money and any real plan. But here\u2019s the difference: Stanley Hall grew up in a totally different America, the one of the mid-1800s.We think this kind of lengthy takeoff is relatively new, but even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the economy offered fewer career choices, there were college graduates who roamed through their third decade of life. Hall was an outlier, of course, as most of his generation launched into adulthood right after high school, if they even went. But his story might serve to lessen the anxiety of today\u2019s parents about their own children\u2019s long stumble toward independence: Stanley Hall went on to great success.He eventually earned an advanced degree in psychology, taught at Antioch College, Harvard and Johns Hopkins and became president of Clark University in Massachusetts, where he developed a fascination with the period in life between childhood and adulthood. He founded the American Psychological Association and in 1904 wrote an influential book about a new life stage he called \u201cadolescence.\u201dHall described this transitional period \u2014 between ages 14 and 24 \u2014 as full of \u201cstorm and stress.\u201d But in reality, the adolescent stage in the early 1900s was much shorter than Hall imagined. Teenagers were able to get a solid full-time job right after high school, followed quickly by marriage and parenthood. It wasn\u2019t until around the middle of the last century that the job market began requiring that a college degree be added to the equation, and with the G.I. Bill allowing returning World War II veterans to go for free, enrollments boomed.That postwar era cemented in our minds an idea that remains to this day: Teenagers graduate from high school, earn a college degree, secure a job, and move out of their childhood home \u2014 all by the age of 22 or so.But by the 1960s, as Americans started spending more time in college, the trend of a relatively quick launch to adulthood was ending. Census figures show that the number of 19- to 24-year-olds living with their parents started edging up, from 30 percent in 1960, to 35 percent in 1980, to 47 percent today.The difference between the \u201cboomerang generation\u201d of the 1960s and 1970s and now is that manufacturing was still the foundation of the economy, allowing more than one pathway to solid middle-class jobs. The 1970s marked the last full decade when a large slice of the population didn\u2019t need a college degree for financial success. The recession of the early 1980s effectively killed off manufacturing, and with the next decade\u2019s technology revolution, the wage premium for attending college started to speed up, turning into a runaway train. In 1983, the wage premium \u2014 how much more a typical bachelor\u2019s degree recipient earns compared to a high school graduate \u2014 was 42 percent. Today, it surpasses 80 percent.The huge run-up in the number of undergraduate and graduate students \u2014 eight million more than in 1980, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 has led to further delays in passing the milestones of adulthood, forever changing how we view the transition from education to the work force. In the 1980s, college graduates achieved financial independence, defined as reaching the median wage, by the time they turned 26, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. In 2014, they didn\u2019t hit that mark until their 30th birthday.In the 1990s, Jeffrey Jenson Arnett, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri, interviewed young people around the country and determined that his subjects felt both grown up and not quite so grown up at exactly the same time. This led Dr. Arnett to conclude that the period between 18 and 25 was a distinct stage separate from both adolescence and young adulthood. In 2000, he published a paper defining this slice of life as \u201cemerging adulthood,\u201d a phrase that immediately entered the cultural lexicon, especially for parents trying to figure out why their children were struggling to launch into adulthood.\u201cEmerging adulthood is a time of life when many different directions remain possible,\u201d Dr. Arnett wrote, \u201cwhen little about the future has been decided for certain, when the scope of independent exploration of life\u2019s possibilities is greater for most people than it will be at any other period of the life course.\u201dBy the time I caught up with Dr. Arnett, he had moved to Clark University. In the fall of 2014, 14 years after he had coined the term, I was curious whether the journey to adulthood was getting even longer.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes that are happening are permanent structural changes that have only sped up all over the world.\u201d The biggest change, he said, is the move to an information economy that requires even more education and job-hopping in one\u2019s 20s.In the journey to adulthood, they are either Sprinters, Wanderers or Stragglers.Sprinters start fast right out of the gate. They pick a major early on and stick with it, enabling a progression of internships that look more and more impressive with each year. Some have the perfect job lined up on graduation; others are laserlike in their focus, moving from job to job up the career ladder. They have little or no student-loan debt, freeing them to pick job opportunities without regard to pay.But speed alone doesn\u2019t define this group. Some are slow but methodical, assembling the building blocks for a successful career by investing in their own human capital, perhaps in graduate or professional school, before hitting the job market.Lily Cua is a classic Sprinter. Well before she got her degree in finance from Georgetown University, she secured a plum position as a consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The job came as so many do these days, from a summer internship. The recruiter, a Georgetown alumnus, was impressed with her Chinese minor and high grades \u2014 signals, he told her, that she was willing to take on demanding assignments. By the end of the summer Ms. Cua was offered a full-time job, 10 months before graduation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my dream to work there,\u201d she admitted. But she knew it would provide a launching pad. \u201cI wanted to get skills I didn\u2019t have coming out of college. I wanted to work with really smart people. I wanted to be mentored by someone looking out for me.\u201dSuch job hopping is typically seen as a lack of commitment or direction \u2014 and it could be \u2014 but it can also boost chances for more satisfying and higher paying work in the decades that follow.\u201cWe are living in an increasingly complex society with many more choices for occupations,\u201d Dr. Siu said \u2014 more than anyone can reasonably explore while in college. Trying out different occupations is another reason 20-somethings need a longer runway to life\u2019s milestones.The reality, however, is that a growing number of emerging adults lack the financial flexibility to change jobs or to take low-paying positions that might be great career starters. The problem? Student loans.Mr. Busteed wasn\u2019t surprised when I told him that nearly every young person I met at the 1776 incubator was free of student debt. According to Gallup\u2019s polling data, most entrepreneurs owe less than $10,000 in student loans \u2014 debt any greater has a negative impact on the decision to start a business.In the end, fewer emerging adults willing to take a chance on their business idea makes it harder for everyone else to get a job.When I met Valerie Lapointe for coffee, she was studying for the G.R.E. Her job search had stalled, and she had decided to do what many recent college graduates do when they get stuck: go back to school for yet another degree.The master\u2019s degree has become the new bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2013, the most recent year available, about 760,000 master\u2019s degrees were awarded, up 250 percent since 1980. Nearly 30 percent of college graduates are back in school within two years. Graduate school gives structure and direction.As we sipped our coffee, Ms. Lapointe, her smile as quick as her wit, quipped about the relevance of our setting. After all, coffee shops have become emblematic of those wandering through their 20s. The Starbucks barista with a bachelor\u2019s is the underemployed stereotype.\u201cI have applied for jobs from here to kingdom come,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are unemployed, you can apply for jobs all day.\u201d She likened her job search to dating. \u201cYou look great on paper, they interview you, but then they never call you back. You get used to the rejection.\u201dMs. Lapointe grew up in the affluent suburbs of Northern Virginia. She graduated from a top-notch high school with a 3.9 grade-point average in 2008, a year marked by a boom in the number of 18-year-olds across the country (so lots of competition to get into the college of her choice) as well as by one of the worst economic crashes in the nation\u2019s history (so lots of unemployed recent college graduates).\u201cI had no idea what I wanted to do with my life when I went to college,\u201d she said. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t taken a gap year to discover interests or explore majors at a local community college. \u201cThere was never a question in my parents\u2019 mind that I\u2019d go directly on to college, the question was just where,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had worked out for them, so why not me?\u201dI heard similar stories from many recent graduates with college-educated parents \u2014 that a four-year college was the only pathway right out of high school.Wait-listed at James Madison University, Ms. Lapointe landed at the University of Mary Washington, a public college in south-central Virginia. Unsure about a major, she filled her schedule with general-education courses her first two years. Then she took a journalism class, and she was hooked.But Mary Washington didn\u2019t have a journalism major. Ms. Lapointe found as many writing courses as she could and joined the student newspaper. She thought about transferring but was on track to finish her degree in just three years to save money.\u201cBy the time I figured it out, it was too late,\u201d she said.That described Ms. Lapointe. She took a job as a nanny while living at home. By the time she started seriously looking for a job in her field of interest a year and a half after graduation, she was already competing with the next crop of graduates. She paid to enroll in a summer program that matched her to a media internship, hoping it would lead to better employment prospects. It didn\u2019t. A video production company laid her off after three months. She then patched together a series of jobs through temp agencies.\u201cI knew it would be difficult but not this difficult,\u201d she said. Signing onto Facebook sometimes made her feel even farther behind, as friends posted the highlights of their daily lives. \u201cI honestly believed that I\u2019d have more of my life together.\u201dFinally, last fall, at 25, she began a master\u2019s program at Northwestern, with a scholarship covering half the tuition. \u201cSo now,\u201d she said, \u201clife is good, debt is mounting, and I\u2019m hoping my job prospects will be better once I finish. I do feel far more career-minded than I did as an undergrad, and therefore in a better position to take advantage of career services and internship opportunities, and to utilize the resources a university has to offer.\u201dMany young people are similarly derailed. They settle for any paying job, mostly outside their major, because of financial pressures. Some bypass meaningful internships or jobs because they find them menial or can\u2019t live on a paltry salary (or as with most internships, none at all). And some go back to school and deeper into debt. According to the University of Arizona study of the class of 2011, student debt more than tripled for those not working while in graduate school, from $22,000 to $76,000.Perhaps most critical for Wanderers is that the bulk of salary increases tend to come in the first decade of employment. Three-quarters of a man\u2019s wage growth happens in the first 10 years, according to Richard A. Settersten Jr., director of the Hallie E. Ford Center for Healthy Children and Families at Oregon State University.Lisa Kahn, an economist at Yale, found that students graduating from college in a weak economy have lower earnings even decades later. The graduating classes immediately following the 2008 recession, for instance, now earn a third less than those who left college just a few years earlier and had a better economic footing getting started. New graduates don\u2019t shop for jobs as much in a bad economy, Dr. Kahn explained, and job shopping is how they get bigger paychecks in those critical first years.The longer Wanderers drift through their 20s, the harder it becomes to catch up.On a crisp fall evening in 2014, I found myself in Portland, Ore., the city where \u201cyoung people go to retire,\u201d to steal the tag line from the satirical television show \u201cPortlandia.\u201d With its mountains, mild winters, outdoorsy reputation and streak of independence, Portland has become a magnet for Stragglers \u2014 those who spend much of their 20s looking for what they were meant to do.In the Eastside industrial district, I met up with Josh Mabry. He was about to turn 30, and sported a military buzz cut and forearms filled with tattoos. After a decade of dead-end jobs and false starts at a handful of colleges, he was finally settling into something he cared about: woodworking. Mr. Mabry always liked working with his hands. His father and grandfather were woodworkers. But he took his last woodshop class in seventh grade. Guidance counselors were pushing college.After high school, he followed a girlfriend two hours south to Eugene and enrolled in graphic design classes at Lane Community College. But he fell into the party scene and dropped out. \u201cI was drifting,\u201d he admitted.\u201cI knew that by the time I turned 30 I needed to figure something out for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI finally have some sort of path.\u201dThe longer life expectancy for children born today means that we can chart new routes to adulthood that space out opportunities in different ways. We no longer should think of college as one physical place we go to at one time in our lives \u2014 i.e., age 18. Yet educators continue to press on families a one-size-fits-all route. It\u2019s almost impossible in our hypercompetitive culture to think differently as a parent about when a college education should happen. The result: Finding a pathway to a fulfilling career and a meaningful life has become much more difficult than it ever should be.\u2022In Dr. Settersten\u2019s critical thinking class at Oregon State University, the classroom conversation on the day of my visit wandered to a discussion of what the students, mostly seniors, wanted to do next in life. Many said they planned to go on to graduate school.Dr. Settersten asked how many of them knew their professors well enough to request a letter of recommendation for the application. Only a smattering of hands went up. He wondered aloud: Why hadn\u2019t more of them visited him during office hours, an easy way to build a one-on-one relationship with a professor who teaches hundreds of students a semester?Dr. Settersten\u2019s research focuses on what it means to become an adult today. Unlike many parents and pundits, he doesn\u2019t worry as much about the longer runway to adulthood, arguing that the timetable is more gradual and varied than it was 50 years ago. The traditional markers such as marriage and parenting are now the culmination of adulthood rather than the start of it.I asked about the somewhat clueless students in his class; doesn\u2019t he worry about them? \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I think of adult life, one of the hallmarks of it is that it\u2019s not predictable.\u201dThe problem is that colleges have attempted to make the four-year experience more predictable by adding a bevy of advising services and amenities so that essentially everything is done for students to ensure they graduate on time and secure a job afterward. But they also prevent students from building the resilience they will need as adults to manage risk and succeed in unpredictable careers.In college, \u201cthere are things you\u2019re taught and then there are things you learn,\u201d Dr. Settersten said. \u201cA lot of what college comes down to is not what happens in the classroom. It\u2019s about navigating life and building relationships.\u201dGraduates who linger through their early career often didn\u2019t take college seriously. They put the social scene before academics, avoiding rigorous majors and courses, according to \u201cAcademically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,\u201d a 2011 book by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa that shows just how little students actually learn in college.What happens after they graduate? In their follow-up, \u201cAspiring Adults Adrift,\u201d published in 2014, what they reported was as distressing as the findings in their first book, but not much of a surprise. Poor academic performers were more likely than other recent graduates to be unemployed, stuck in unskilled jobs, or to have been fired or laid off. Where students went to college didn\u2019t matter two years out, the sociologists found, as much as what they did while on campus. \u201cThe most important choice students can make is whether they are on the party-social pathway through college,\u201d Dr. Arum said, \u201cor are investing sufficient attention and focus on academic pursuits.\u201dToo many students, he said, see college as a four-year vacation. Students in 1961 dedicated 24 hours a week to studying outside the classroom. By 2003, that fell to 14 hours. \u201cThere are exceptional students,\u201d Dr. Arum said. \u201cThere are just not enough of them.\u201dHe is concerned about what he calls college\u2019s vast middle. \u201cThe system is not working for large numbers of students and I very much worry about their ability to be successful in the long run.\u201dThis article is adapted from \u201cThere Is Life After College: What Parents and Students Should Know About Navigating School to Prepare for the Jobs of Tomorrow,\u201d by Jeffrey J.

{"Headline": "Obama and President Xi of China Vow to Sign Paris Climate Accord Promptly", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byOfficials cast the announcement as a statement of joint resolve by the world\u2019s two largest greenhouse gas polluters, even though there are doubts about whether the United States can meet its obligations under the agreement. In February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked an Obama administration regulation to curb greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, the centerpiece of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policy and the major way for the administration to meet its targets under the Paris accord.The two world leaders made the announcement on the sidelines of a nuclear security meeting in Washington.\u201cOur cooperation and our joint statements were critical in arriving at the Paris agreement, and our two countries have agreed that we will not only sign the agreement on the first day possible, but we\u2019re committing to formally join it as soon as possible this year,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, where he was meeting with Mr. Xi at the nuclear gathering.Mr. Obama, who spoke across a table from Mr. Xi, added, \u201cAnd we urge other countries to do the same.\u201dHighlights from the final draft text of a climate agreement submitted to the delegates in Paris.Mr. Xi, speaking through an interpreter, said, \u201cAs the two biggest economies, China and the U.S. have a responsibility to work together.\u201dThe announcement by Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi is intended to push other countries to sign on, particularly since diplomats say the Supreme Court order has caused some countries to question American climate policy and might cause them to refuse or hesitate to sign the accord.The Paris Agreement will enter into legal force only when enough countries have signed on: Together they have to be responsible for causing 55 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.Because of the Supreme Court stay, the regulation curbing greenhouse gas emissions will not be put in place until legal challenges by 29 states and several business organizations have been resolved, which is unlikely to happen before next year. The regulation would help the United States cut greenhouse gas emissions between 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.Chinese energy experts said China\u2019s pledge to sign the accord was independent of the status of American climate policy. Mr. Xi\u2019s administration has endorsed an aggressive expansion of renewable energy sources in China. The country\u2019s latest five-year economic plan calls for the country to generate 15 percent of its energy from nonfossil fuel sources by 2020.Combined, the United States and China account for about 40 percent of global emissions.Mr. Ban has invited world leaders to come to New York for the April signing ceremony, which he hopes will represent the largest single joint signing of a major global accord in history.\u201cThe most important thing is how many signatures we get on that day,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, France\u2019s chief climate change envoy to the United Nations and a key broker of the Paris deal. \u201cWe need to show momentum because we know for some countries it may be difficult to sign.\u201dTodd Stern, the Obama administration\u2019s chief climate change envoy, said that the day after the Supreme Court\u2019s order, many of his counterparts in other countries expressed anxiety.\u201cI heard, \u2018Does this mean you\u2019re pulling out of Paris?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled in a recent interview. \u201cI said: \u2018No, no, no, no \u2014 under any circumstances, we\u2019re going to stay the course. One way or another, we\u2019re not moving off our target.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Stern, who has led climate change negotiations for the Obama administration since 2009, will step down from his post on Friday.The United States is not the only major polluting country that may have trouble following through on its Paris commitments. President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil committed to an ambitious plan to reduce her country\u2019s emissions 43 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The climate plan has been a signature of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration, but she now faces possible impeachment, which could throw the Brazilian plan into question.In the United States, enactment of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change commitments under the Paris deal will ultimately fall to the next president. But that fact also worries some climate diplomats as they watch the 2016 presidential campaign from afar. Although the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, has pledged to enact and strengthen the Paris Agreement, on the Republican side both Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz have questioned or denied the science of human-caused climate change. Mr. Trump has forcefully denounced the Paris agreement.\u201cEveryone who is looking at the election campaign from abroad is puzzled,\u201d Ms. Tubiana said. \u201cDonald Trump is a different type of person. We\u2019re thinking \u2014 is this something that could really happen?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Settled a Real Estate Lawsuit, and a Criminal Case Was Closed", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byFor Donald J. Trump, it is a long-held legal strategy, if not a point of pride, to avoid knuckling under to plaintiffs in court.\u201cI don\u2019t settle lawsuits \u2014 very rare \u2014 because once you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you,\u201d he said recently.The backdrop to that unusual denouement was a gathering legal storm that threatened to cast a harsh light on how he did business. Besides the fraud accusations, a separate lawsuit claimed that Trump SoHo was developed with the undisclosed involvement of convicted felons and financing from questionable sources in Russia and Kazakhstan.And hovering over it all was a criminal investigation, previously unreported, by the Manhattan district attorney into whether the fraud alleged by the condo buyers broke any laws, according to documents and interviews with five people familiar with it. The buyers initially helped in the investigation, but as part of their lawsuit settlement, they had to notify prosecutors that they no longer wished to do so.The criminal case was eventually closed.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination rests on the notion, relentlessly promoted by the candidate himself, that his record of business deals has prepared him better than his rivals for running the country. An examination of Trump SoHo provides a window into his handling of one such deal and finds that decisions on important matters like whom to become partners with and how to market the project led him into a thicket of litigation and controversy.Trump SoHo is one of several instances in which Mr. Trump\u2019s boastfulness \u2014 a hallmark of his career and his campaign \u2014 has been accused of crossing the line into fraud. Other lawsuits have charged that he peddled worthless real estate sales courses and misled investors into thinking he had built hotels when in fact he had only licensed his name to them. He has won several cases at trial and is continuing to fight others.Alan Garten, the general counsel for the Trump Organization, said that the condo buyers\u2019 lawsuit was not focused on Mr. Trump himself \u201cin any material way\u201d and that there was little reason not to settle it, adding that it cost Mr. Trump nothing. \u201cIt was solely a function of returning deposits,\u201d Mr. Garten said.He described the case as \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d in which people who bought real estate at the wrong time turned to the courts to recoup their investment.Mr. Garten would not talk about the criminal investigation or whether it was a factor in the decision to settle.\u201cThe terms of the settlement are confidential, and thus I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss them,\u201d he said.The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment, saying it could not provide information on \u201ca criminal investigation which does not result in an arrest or prosecution.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump and his co-defendants made the decision to settle the condo buyers\u2019 lawsuit in 2011, it was a far cry from the heady days of 2006, when Mr. Trump closed an episode of his hit television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with a splashy plug for Trump SoHo. In typical Trump fashion, he piled on the plaudits for \u201cmy latest development.\u201d\u201cWhen it\u2019s completed in 2008,\u201d he said, \u201cthis brilliant $370 million work of art will be an awe-inspiring masterpiece.\u201dTo the artists and creative types inhabiting its trendy downtown Manhattan neighborhood, Trump SoHo was an oxymoron from the start. Many of them loudly opposed a huge glass tower at 246 Spring Street that would stab the sky high above its low-key surroundings.If the plans for it attracted controversy, so too would the company most responsible for its development: Bayrock Group.Mr. Trump was foggy on how he first came to do business with Bayrock, a small development company whose offices were in Trump Tower in Midtown. In a deposition a few years ago, he said it might have been a Bayrock associate, Felix H. Sater, who first approached him in the early 2000s.Mr. Sater, a Russian immigrant, had recently joined Bayrock at the behest of its founder, Tevfik Arif, a former Soviet-era commerce official originally from Kazakhstan. Bayrock, which was developing commercial properties in Brooklyn, proposed that Mr. Trump license his name to hotel projects in Florida, Arizona and New York, including Trump SoHo.The other development partner for Trump SoHo was the Sapir Organization, whose founder, Tamir Sapir, was from the former Soviet republic of Georgia. In addition to receiving a licensing agreement, Mr. Trump would manage the completed condo-hotel, and he was also given a minor equity interest in it.Emails and testimony in several lawsuits show that Mr. Sater and Mr. Arif worked closely with Mr. Trump and others in the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump was particularly taken with Mr. Arif\u2019s overseas connections. In a deposition, Mr. Trump said that the two had discussed \u201cnumerous deals all over the world\u201d and that Mr. Arif had brought potential Russian investors to Mr. Trump\u2019s office to meet him.\u201cBayrock knew the people, knew the investors, and in some cases I believe they were friends of Mr. Arif,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd this was going to be Trump International Hotel and Tower Moscow, Kiev, Istanbul, etc., Poland, Warsaw.\u201dWhat sort of due diligence Mr. Trump did before jumping in with his new partners is unclear. But he, as well as many others, apparently missed some dark spots on Mr. Sater\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Mr. Garten said the Trump Organization typically did a background check on potential business partners like Bayrock, but not on their individual employees, so nothing about Mr. Sater would have turned up.Mr. Sater was convicted and sent to prison in 1993 after a New York bar fight in which he stabbed a man in the face with a broken margarita glass. That was a matter of public record. However, what few people beyond insiders at Bayrock knew was that five years later, Mr. Sater was implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals \u2014 and that he became a confidential F.B.I. informant.Recently unsealed federal court records show that Mr. Sater helped the government disrupt an organized crime ring on Wall Street and deal with an unexplained national security matter involving his foreign connections. He was not the only F.B.I. informant in Bayrock\u2019s offices. Another was Salvatore Lauria, an associate of Mr. Sater, who sometimes showed up to work wearing a court-ordered ankle monitor.Mr. Lauria brokered a $50 million investment in Trump SoHo and three other Bayrock projects by an Icelandic firm preferred by wealthy Russians \u201cin favor with\u201d President Vladimir V. Putin, according to a lawsuit against Bayrock by one of its former executives. The Icelandic company, FL Group, was identified in a Bayrock investor presentation as a \u201cstrategic partner,\u201d along with Alexander Mashkevich, a billionaire once charged in a corruption case involving fees paid by a Belgian company seeking business in Kazakhstan; that case was settled with no admission of guilt.The official unveiling of Trump SoHo in September 2007 was quintessential Trump: a red-carpet announcement followed by a big bash, where flavored vodka flowed, dancers whirled and models wandered about. Amid the hoopla, Mr. Trump took the microphone to extol the greatness of the project. Standing beside him, beaming, were Mr. Arif and Mr. Sater.The timing of Trump SoHo\u2019s completion and marketing could hardly have been worse. The real estate bubble was bursting, and the global economy was on the brink of crisis as the developers began advertising luxury condo-hotel units costing as much as tens of millions of dollars.The economics of the investment were largely untested in New York real estate. To get around residential zoning restrictions, owners of Trump SoHo units were allowed to live in them only 120 days a year. The rest of the time, the units would be rented as hotel rooms, with the owners sharing in the revenue.The project was marketed aggressively to potential investors overseas, where exchange rates were favorable and the Trump brand carried a certain cachet. Many early buyers were from Europe, including a French former soccer star, Olivier Dacourt, who put down a deposit of $460,400 on a $2.3 million unit.According to data the Trump SoHo developers filed with state and federal agencies, only 15 to 30 percent of the units had been sold by the start of 2009. But those numbers did not come close to the grand-sounding sales figures promoted, publicly and in private, by people affiliated with Trump SoHo, according to a lawsuit filed in August 2010 by Mr. Dacourt and other people who had bought units.The lawsuit also suggested that Mr. Trump had contributed to the deception, citing a claim he made at the project\u2019s unveiling. Depending on the news account, he said 3,200 prospective purchasers either had signed up to see the units or had requested applications to buy them; the plaintiffs argued that this figure was exaggerated, given how few units had actually been sold at the time. The Trumps and the other defendants denied that there had been any deception.The inflated numbers were more than just harmless self-promotion and amounted to fraudulent enticement of investors, who believed they were buying into a project that was healthier than it actually was, said Adam Leitman Bailey, the lawyer representing the buyers.\u201cThey relied on these misrepresentations to their detriment,\u201d he said.The people familiar with the criminal investigation said that not long after Mr. Bailey\u2019s lawsuit was filed, the district attorney\u2019s office began looking into the allegations it had raised. These people insisted on anonymity for fear of legal repercussions from speaking about confidential agreements or sealed criminal matters.Documents reviewed by The Times, including a state grand jury subpoena, make clear that an area of focus for prosecutors was determining whether the accusations in Mr. Bailey\u2019s lawsuit rose to the level of a crime. The investigation was being handled by the Major Economic Crimes Bureau.Shortly before the condo buyers\u2019 lawsuit was filed, another suit appeared, this one by Jody Kriss, a former finance director of Bayrock. It claimed that by concealing Mr. Sater\u2019s criminal record, Bayrock had committed fraud on banks and investors with which it did business. Mr. Trump is not a defendant in that case, which is continuing.Mr. Kriss\u2019s lawsuit was filled with unflattering details of how Bayrock operated, including allegations that it had occasionally received unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in Kazakhstan and Russia. Bayrock and Trump SoHo drew more negative headlines in October 2010, when news spread from Turkey that Mr. Arif had been aboard a luxury yacht raided by the police, who were investigating a suspected prostitution ring that catered to wealthy businessmen. He was charged but later acquitted.The next year, when it was clear that Mr. Bailey\u2019s lawsuit would be allowed to proceed and with the district attorney\u2019s criminal investigation continuing, Mr. Trump and his co-defendants agreed to settle the condo buyers\u2019 suit. The financial terms were announced publicly, but another part of the settlement was kept secret.That part required the plaintiffs to notify any investigative agency with which they \u201cmay have previously cooperated\u201d that they did not want to \u201cparticipate in any investigation or criminal prosecution\u201d related to matters in the lawsuit, according to a confidentiality agreement signed by more than 20 people. The plaintiffs could respond to a subpoena or court order, but would also have to notify the defendants that they had received it, the agreement said. The criminal investigation was closed sometime afterward.As for Trump SoHo, the condo-hotel concept did not pan out. Only about a third of the units were ultimately sold, and one of the project\u2019s lenders foreclosed on the rest, although the property remained open and became a popular luxury hotel, still managed by Mr. Trump\u2019s company.Mr. Sater left Bayrock after the news of his criminal background was reported. But even after that, his association with Mr. Trump did not end. The Trump Organization later gave him a business card identifying him as a \u201csenior advisor\u201d to Mr. Trump, as well an office. Mr. Garten, the general counsel for the organization, said that Mr. Sater was never an employee, but that he had worked independently to steer potential deals to Mr. Trump. The arrangement lasted about six months, Mr. Garten said. Mr. Sater declined to comment on his dealings with Mr. Trump or with Bayrock.By the time Mr. Trump sat for a deposition in a lawsuit in November 2013, it was clear he no longer saw the benefit of knowing the Bayrock executives with whom he had once completed big deals. He said he barely knew Mr. Arif: \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve seen him a couple of times; I have met him.\u201dAs for Mr. Sater, \u201cif he were sitting in the room right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know what he looked like.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernienomics Might Not Be Feasible \u2014 But It\u2019s Useful", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byOn MoneySurprisingly, for such an odd and difficult man, Thorstein Veblen represented a high point in American optimism. Veblen was trained in economics but spent much of his career in the margins of the field, preferring instead to look at society more broadly, through the lens of anthropology and Darwinism. Social institutions, he argued, were like species; they evolved, following paths set down by previous generations. The economists of his day, like those of today, argued that wages and prices were determined by the corresponding desires of buyers and sellers to trade. Veblen largely rejected this idea, arguing instead that modern people still carried with them their barbarian past, in which violent warrior kings subjugated peasants. The warrior kings had become aristocrats and businesspeople, while the peasants were, of course, the workers.As articulated in his 1899 book, \u201cThe Theory of the Leisure Class,\u201d Veblen\u2019s is probably still the second-\u00admost-\u00adinfluential critique of capitalism, after Marx. But Veblen accompanied his diagnosis with a less violent vision of a cure \u2014 a hopeful way of thinking that is still surprisingly relevant today, as we see among the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders in his presidential bid. The prevailing neoclassical economics of Veblen\u2019s time held that growth and wages were limited by economic rules and that no manner of societal re-\u00adengineering would be able to fundamentally change those rules. But Veblen believed that once we recognized how trapped we were by these ancient institutions, we could be set free. The world could become a place of shared prosperity and general equality if only we changed our formal institutions and the often unspoken social norms that constrain us.For a few decades at the beginning of the 20th century, Veblen\u2019s ideas were prominent within the American economic debate, and his followers were major figures in economics. Known as the institutionalists, they believed that institutions, more than market forces, determined the distribution of goods in a society. As a group, they were more united by what they disliked in conventional economics than by what they agreed on. But they agreed that there was huge opportunity to improve the human condition by transforming the institutions that made up our society. They generally wanted stronger labor unions and weaker corporations. They wanted the government to play a continuously active role in regulating what they saw as the predatory practices of business.Most institutionalists remained outsiders, focusing attention on failings in the American economy rather than offering an alternate prescription. But some became the architects of government policy. Rexford Tugwell, part of the strong institutionalist presence at Columbia University at the time, was a crucial member of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s brain trust, helping to design the New Deal. Others played significant roles in government and academia into the 1950s. John Kenneth Galbraith was one of the most (and last) prominent members of the school.By then, economics had been entirely transformed by the work of John Maynard Keynes and his 1936 masterwork, \u201cThe General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.\u201d The book more or less invented the field of macroeconomics \u2014 the study of how an economy works in the aggregate. And in the decades since, most academic economics and nearly all of government economic policy has revolved around Keynes\u2019s insights.Economics is not a natural science like physics, where questions can be definitively settled. But the so-\u00adcalled mainstream of economic thought, based on Keynesian models, is supported by decades of data, peer review and argument. Many non\u00adeconomists think of the fundamental economic divide between Democrats and Republicans as being between government-\u00adloving Keynesian Democrats on the one hand and, on the other, Republicans who extol the free-\u00admarket principles of the University of Chicago and the Austrians (Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, et al.). But the Chicago and Austrian schools have for the most part played outsider roles, assessing policies of Democrats and Republicans without creating their own tools of government policy. Over the last 75 years, the actual people designing Republican economic policies \u2014 figures like Martin Feldstein, Gregory Mankiw, Glenn Hubbard \u2014 have nearly all relied on Keynesian principles and models of the economy. Even Milton Friedman, the most effective critic from the Chicago school, experimented with Keynesian ideas early in his career, and his proposals that actually affected government policy (the Federal Reserve\u2019s approach to inflation, the earned-\u00adincome tax credit, automatic tax deduction from payrolls) fit neatly into a Keynesian mode of thinking.There is plenty of scope for disagreement among those descendants of Keynes \u2014 more government or less, higher taxes or lower \u2014 but when they make their arguments, these economists are using similar models built around the same sets of empirical data. And one common assumption of those models is that government intervention in the market tends to come at some cost. Offering free health care and college to everybody will cost money that needs to be raised in other parts of the economy. Some might embrace those trade-\u00adoffs, others might reject them, but economists agree that there are trade-\u00adoffs, that the realistic possibilities of our economy have constraints.Many of Sanders\u2019s proposals are supported by the far-\u00adleft flank of the Keynesian consensus: raising the minimum wage, setting higher taxes on wealthy estates, supporting unions, strengthening Social Security, imposing a financial-\u00adtransactions tax. But on this most fundamental question \u2014 about the potential to transform the economy, to blow past trade-\u00adoffs and constraints \u2014 the economics profession can\u2019t follow him to the promised land. Gunnels told me to consult the work of Gerald Friedman, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a proud, self-\u00addescribed institutionalist. Friedman wrote a highly criticized paper that argued that Sanders\u2019s policies would lead to an unprecedented 5.3 percent growth rate in the American gross domestic product. Friedman himself acknowledges it is a fringe view that, he guesses, fewer than 4 percent of economists would share. And incidentally, Friedman says he\u2019s voting for Hillary Clinton.Of course, for many people who support Sanders, the fact that his ideas run counter to decades of established economics is exactly the point. Some economists, like Dean Baker and Robert Reich, told me they like Sanders not because of his take on any technical debate but because he has forced the profession \u2014 and everybody else \u2014 to take his issues seriously. No matter what happens in this election, Sanders\u2019s idealism has sent a clear message to traditional economists on the left: They are taking too long to develop answers to the problems of inequality and the corrosive effects of concentrated wealth. It\u2019s a message that institutionalists have been screaming for more than a century. Now, it seems, they are being heard.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript: Donald Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy Speech", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byThank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I\u2019d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.It\u2019s time to shake the rust off America\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.(APPLAUSE)History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\u2019s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\u2019s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.We\u2019re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.I\u2019m the only one \u2014 believe me, I know them all, I\u2019m the only one who knows how to fix it.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\u2019ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.(APPLAUSE)The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\u2019t depend on us. We\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\u2019s treatment of our ten captured sailors \u2014 so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.When the other side knows you\u2019re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \u2014 you just can\u2019t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You\u2019ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\u2019ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.We\u2019ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they\u2019re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they\u2019re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don\u2019t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don\u2019t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth \u2014 fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip \u2014 unprecedented \u2014 comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don\u2019t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We\u2019ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama\u2019s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we\u2019ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we\u2019re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we\u2019re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.We\u2019re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We\u2019ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.(APPLAUSE)We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\u2019re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.(APPLAUSE)Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton\u2019s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don\u2019t blockade, we don\u2019t bomb, we don\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s almost as if our country doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening, which could be a fact and could be true. This will all change when I become president.To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It\u2019s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It\u2019s going to be a friend again. We\u2019re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\u2019s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.This is how we won the Cold War and it\u2019s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.(APPLAUSE)First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\u2019s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.In this, we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.We should work \u2014 thank you.(APPLAUSE)We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\u2019s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\u2019re doing, they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done to them. We\u2019re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \u2014 one of the true great catastrophes.And then there\u2019s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\u2019t tell them where and I won\u2019t tell them how. We must...(APPLAUSE)... we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\u2019re sending troops. We tell them. We\u2019re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.But they\u2019re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I\u2019m elected president. And they\u2019ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\u2019s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we\u2019re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We\u2019re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans...(APPLAUSE)Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.(APPLAUSE)Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \u2014 and this was a horrible time for us \u2014 were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S. Cole.And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\u2019t do itAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America\u2019s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.(APPLAUSE)We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.Some say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can\u2019t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\u2019s great \u2014 not good, great \u2014 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019re going to find out.Fixing our relations with China is another important step \u2014 and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it.No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to happen.A guide to following the remaining Republican primary contests like a political pro.After I\u2019m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\u2019s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.(APPLAUSE)I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.(APPLAUSE)Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\u2019ve had the exact opposite \u2014 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.I will also be prepared to deploy America\u2019s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.(APPLAUSE)However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That\u2019s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.(APPLAUSE)We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.(APPLAUSE)These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that\u2019s what we want. We want them to be our allies.We want the world to be \u2014 we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans.(APPLAUSE)Americans must know that we\u2019re putting the American people first again on trade.(APPLAUSE)So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.(APPLAUSE)No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.(APPLAUSE)And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \u2014 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I\u2019ve just gotten to see it. I\u2019ve toured Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve toured New York. I\u2019ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.Never again, only the reverse \u2014 and I have to say this strongly \u2014 never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.(APPLAUSE)I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\u2019s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.(APPLAUSE)And always \u2014 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \u2014 we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that \u2014 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)Thank you.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Warns of Economic Fallout if Congress Passes 9/11 Bill", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Saudi Arabia has told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passes a bill that would allow the Saudi government to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bill\u2019s passage, according to administration officials and congressional aides from both parties, and the Saudi threats have been the subject of intense discussions in recent weeks between lawmakers and officials from the State Department and the Pentagon. The officials have warned senators of diplomatic and economic fallout from the legislation.Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, delivered the kingdom\u2019s message personally last month during a trip to Washington, telling lawmakers that Saudi Arabia would be forced to sell up to $750 billion in treasury securities and other assets in the United States before they could be in danger of being frozen by American courts.Several outside economists are skeptical that the Saudis will follow through, saying that such a sell-off would be difficult to execute and would end up crippling the kingdom\u2019s economy. But the threat is another sign of the escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States.The administration, which argues that the legislation would put Americans at legal risk overseas, has been lobbying so intently against the bill that some lawmakers and families of Sept. 11 victims are infuriated. In their view, the Obama administration has consistently sided with the kingdom and has thwarted their efforts to learn what they believe to be the truth about the role some Saudi officials played in the terrorist plot.\u201cIt\u2019s stunning to think that our government would back the Saudis over its own citizens,\u201d said Mindy Kleinberg, whose husband died in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and who is part of a group of victims\u2019 family members pushing for the legislation.President Obama will arrive in Riyadh on Wednesday for meetings with King Salman and other Saudi officials. It is unclear whether the dispute over the Sept. 11 legislation will be on the agenda for the talks.A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy did not respond to a message seeking comment.Saudi officials have long denied that the kingdom had any role in the Sept. 11 plot, and the 9/11 Commission found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.\u201d But critics have noted that the commission\u2019s narrow wording left open the possibility that less senior officials or parts of the Saudi government could have played a role. Suspicions have lingered, partly because of the conclusions of a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks that cited some evidence that Saudi officials living in the United States at the time had a hand in the plot.Those conclusions, contained in 28 pages of the report, still have not been released publicly.The dispute comes as bipartisan criticism is growing in Congress about Washington\u2019s alliance with Saudi Arabia, for decades a crucial American ally in the Middle East and half of a partnership that once received little scrutiny from lawmakers. Last week, two senators introduced a resolution that would put restrictions on American arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which have expanded during the Obama administration.Families of the Sept. 11 victims have used the courts to try to hold members of the Saudi royal family, Saudi banks and charities liable because of what the plaintiffs charged was Saudi financial support for terrorism. These efforts have largely been stymied, in part because of a 1976 law that gives foreign nations some immunity from lawsuits in American courts.The Senate bill is intended to make clear that the immunity given to foreign nations under the law should not apply in cases where nations are found culpable for terrorist attacks that kill Americans on United States soil. If the bill were to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president, it could clear a path for the role of the Saudi government to be examined in the Sept. 11 lawsuits.Brief background information on the most powerful figures in the kingdom, and how they stand in the sometimes complicated order of succession.Obama administration officials counter that weakening the sovereign immunity provisions would put the American government, along with its citizens and corporations, in legal risk abroad because other nations might retaliate with their own legislation. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel in February that the bill, in its current form, would \u201cexpose the United States of America to lawsuits and take away our sovereign immunity and create a terrible precedent.\u201dThe bill\u2019s sponsors have said that the legislation is purposely drawn very narrowly \u2014 involving only attacks on American soil \u2014 to reduce the prospect that other nations might try to fight back.In a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill on March 4, Anne W. Patterson, an assistant secretary of state, and Andrew Exum, a top Pentagon official on Middle East policy, told staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that American troops and civilians could be in legal jeopardy if other nations decide to retaliate and strip Americans of immunity abroad. They also discussed the Saudi threats specifically, laying out the impacts if Saudi Arabia made good on its economic threats.John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement that the administration stands by the victims of terrorism, \u201cespecially those who suffered and sacrificed so much on 9/11.\u201dEdwin M. Truman, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he thought the Saudis were most likely making an \u201cempty threat.\u201d Selling hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets would not only be technically difficult to pull off, he said, but would also very likely cause global market turmoil for which the Saudis would be blamed.Moreover, he said, it could destabilize the American dollar \u2014 the currency to which the Saudi riyal is pegged.\u201cThe only way they could punish us is by punishing themselves,\u201d Mr. Truman said.The bill is an anomaly in a Congress fractured by bitter partisanship, especially during an election year. It is sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. It has the support of an unlikely coalition of liberal and conservative senators, including Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, and Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. It passed through the Judiciary Committee in January without dissent.\u201cAs our nation confronts new and expanding terror networks that are targeting our citizens, stopping the funding source for terrorists becomes even more important,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said last month.The alliance with Saudi Arabia has frayed in recent years as the White House has tried to thaw ties with Iran \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitter enemy\u2014 in the midst of recriminations between American and Saudi officials about the role that both countries should play in the stability of the Middle East.But the administration has supported Saudi Arabia on other fronts, including providing the country with targeting intelligence and logistical support for its war in Yemen. The Saudi military is flying jets and dropping bombs it bought from the United States \u2014 part of the billions of dollars in arms deals that have been negotiated with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations during the Obama administration.The war has been a humanitarian disaster and fueled a resurgence of Al Qaeda in Yemen, leading to the resolution in Congress to put new restrictions on arms deals to the kingdom. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, one of the resolution\u2019s sponsors and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Congress has been \u201cfeckless\u201d in conducting oversight of arms sales, especially those destined for Saudi Arabia.\u201cMy first desire is for our relationship with Saudi Arabia to come with a greater degree of conditionality than it currently does,\u201d he said.Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Mining in National Forests", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byLetterTo the Editor:Longer fire seasons threaten lives, homes, our public forests and the Forest Service\u2019s budget. So you\u2019d think that agency would fight to prevent climate change, which is fueling more fires through warmer, drier winters. You\u2019d be wrong.As early as this month, the service intends to open 19,000 acres of pristine roadless national forests in Colorado to coal mining. The service projects that mining and burning the coal found there will cause 130 million tons of carbon pollution, about as much as running a large coal-fired power plant for 20 years.The service predicts that this pollution could cost the global economy billions of dollars through climate-change effects, ironically including more forest fires. These dire costs can be prevented.America\u2019s 190 million acres of national forests are a legacy worth protecting for future generations. The Forest Service can do that by not pouring gasoline on the fire of climate change. Halting coal mining in national forests is a good place to start.

{"Headline": "Bangladesh's Other Banking Scam", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Feb. 4, $101 million dollars of Bangladesh\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were stolen from its account at the Federal Reserve in New York. Only about $20 million have been recovered so far, and it still isn\u2019t known who took the money or where it ended up. The heist is being described as one of the biggest bank robberies in history.But it\u2019s hardly the first time tens of millions of dollars have vanished from Bangladesh\u2019s banks. The high-flying cyberscam at the Federal Reserve pales in comparison with the routine plunder of Bangladesh\u2019s financial system, including by some of its purported guardians.The country\u2019s six state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) control around one-quarter of all bank assets in the country but have on outsize influence on the economy thanks to their connections to the government. For example, SOCBs have \u201cextremely high\u201d rates of nonperforming loans, according to the I.M.F., and the average for the entire banking industry is \u201cvery high\u201d: about 11 percent, compared with about 4 percent in advanced economies.Part of the explanation for this is poor governance by the banks\u2019 boards, but the main culprit is the country\u2019s culture of patronage.One of the most notorious of Bangladesh\u2019s banking scandals involves the country\u2019s largest SOCB, Sonali Bank. Between 2010 and 2012, one branch of Sonali Bank alone illegally gave out $454 million in loans, including nearly $344 million to Hallmark Group, a textile business, according to the Dhaka Tribune. Tanvir Mahmud, Hallmark\u2019s managing director, connived with a branch manager to issue fraudulent letters of credit to fictitious companies.Even after the scam was uncovered, Sonali Bank continued to operate with an extremely high nonperforming loan ratio: reportedly more than 37 percent in the fall of 2014. And the bank, along with Bangladesh\u2019s other five SOCBs, are regularly recapitalized by the government \u2014 to the tune of about $640 million for fiscal year 2014 and, it is expected, more than $700 million for fiscal year 2015.These banks\u2019 irresponsible lending practices \u2014 and the state\u2019s irresponsible efforts to systematically bail them out \u2014 are partly the result of collusion between business and political elites.Fahmida Khatun, the research director at the Center for Policy Dialogue, in Dhaka, was a board member of the SOCB Janata Bank in 2008-11, after being appointed by the military caretaker government that ran the country in 2007-8. In an interview in Dhaka in 2014 she told me that since Bangladesh\u2019s return to civilian rule after the 2008 election, loan portfolios have typically been assessed not according to their business potential, but with an eye toward \u201cthe influence or the connections of the person\u201d asking for credit.Notably, Ms. Khatun added, the loans that are approved by bank directors with connections to the party that happens to be in power are \u201cthe ones that get defaulted, invariably.\u201dHere\u2019s an example: Salman F. Rahman, one of Bangladesh\u2019s wealthiest individuals and a co-founder of Beximco, a major business group that specializes in exports of pharmaceuticals and garments. A 2007 cable from the United States ambassador in Dhaka subsequently disclosed by WikiLeaks called Mr. Rahman \u201callegedly one of Bangladesh\u2019s biggest bank loan defaulters.\u201d He was imprisoned for fraud in 2007-8, under the caretaker government.In an interview in his Dhaka office early last year, Mr. Rahman told me he owed about $800 million to state-owned banks. He blamed the previous government, led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party \u2014 a staunch rival of the Awami League, which is in power today \u2014 for not servicing his debts. By the time we met, though, Mr. Rahman had become an adviser to Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh and the president of the Awami League. And the Bangladesh Bank was now \u201crestructuring\u201d his debts, he said.Mr. Rahman is no exception. Some $565 million in assets are said to have been looted from the state-owned BASIC Bank between 2009 and 2012, yet the scam\u2019s suspected mastermind, a former chairman of the bank, wasn\u2019t troubled by the anticorruption commission investigating the fraud, reportedly thanks to his political connections. Banking in Bangladesh is beholden to the politicians.This is largely because state institutions are underfunded and weak. Technocrats, auditors, courts \u2014 all those traditional safeguards don\u2019t have enough authority or muscle in Bangladesh to keep the politicians in check.This, in turn, is due to the fact that Bangladesh has one of the smallest tax-to-G.D.P. ratios in the world, at less than 10 percent. Lack of infrastructure prevents the collection of income taxes. There are myriad taxes on corporations, but it\u2019s easy enough to bribe one\u2019s way out of paying them. Partly as a result, imports are subject to exorbitant fees \u2014 which only gives importers an incentive to finagle a way to avoid them.Then there\u2019s capital flight. If you loot state resources in a country like Bangladesh, you don\u2019t want to risk losing it to someone else\u2019s scams or to seizure by the government. And so you take the money abroad, far from the prying eyes of local tax collectors, preferably to a low-tax, low-transparency jurisdiction.About $9.7 billion worth of illicit capital left Bangladesh in 2013 alone, up from $3.3 billion in 2004, according to the N.G.O. Global Financial Integrity. That\u2019s the equivalent of more than 6 percent of G.D.P. that year, and more than 3.5 times what Bangladesh received in foreign development aid.That money should have been taxed in Bangladesh. If it had been taxed, there would probably have been less bank fraud, and less illicit money to be stashed abroad.This is one reason offshore tax havens must be made to operate more transparently. Bangladesh, for its part, must stem the outflow of illicit capital and rethink its taxation system in order to collect more on income and earnings.Such changes would mean major reform, of course \u2014 of the tax authorities, of the legal system, of the Bangladesh Bank \u2014 and the elites who benefit from the current situation have little incentive to undertake it. But Bangladesh needs a proper state bureaucracy if it is to curb its venal politicians.Joseph Allchin is a freelance journalist formerly based in Dhaka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Park in Paterson, N.J., Ponders 2 Paths: Natural Wonder or Historical Site?", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byPATERSON, N.J. \u2014 The young national park in this once-booming industrial city is unusual for its twin features \u2014 one natural, the other historical.A mighty waterfall, one of the largest by volume east of the Mississippi River, tumbles nearly 80 feet over basalt cliffs, where the Passaic River flows through a narrow chasm. It is the river that spawned the country\u2019s first planned industrial city, founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1792 to end the reliance on Britain for manufactured goods.One option would pour more resources into the natural landscape, creating opportunities for recreation along the river and educational programs about the waterfall, the habitat and the city\u2019s past.The other would give visitors a more in-depth immersion in the city\u2019s industrial history.\u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of emphasis,\u201d said Darren Boch, the superintendent of the park, as he strode along the rim of the falls, where two billion gallons of water cascade each day.\u201cPart of our job is to maintain and preserve the beautiful view of the waterfall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also to let people understand the significance of the area around the falls. Why is Paterson\u2019s story integral to the history of the United States? There are resources in need of investment and we need to prioritize those resources.\u201dOver the next two years, the Park Service has committed to restoring some of the parkland along the river near the bottom of the falls \u2014 much of it now scraggly, forlorn and closed to the public.A two-and-a-half-acre stretch of shoreline, to be called the Great Lawn, will be constructed with $4.3 million in local and federal funds, while another $1.5 million will go toward an adjacent space called Overlook Park, where a stage and amphitheater will be built.\u201cThis is Paterson\u2019s shot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make this city a destination, just as it once was.\u201dPark officials say that the two options under consideration are not mutually exclusive. While their capital investments differ, there would be recreational amenities under both, as well as historical signage and programs. Mr. Pascrell said he believed the end result would likely represent a hybrid of the two plans.For the national park, the connection to Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury, is serendipitous. Hamilton is enjoying a resurgence of interest \u2014 largely thanks to the flattering depiction of the founding father in the stunningly popular Broadway show \u201cHamilton.\u201dOn July 10, 1778, a young Hamilton picnicked on cold ham, tongue and biscuits here with General George Washington and the French general the Marquis de Lafayette. It was then that Hamilton became acquainted with the setting of his future industrial city, one that would be powered by water and churn out everything from textiles and paper to locomotives and guns.Located 15 miles west of New York City, Paterson became Hamilton\u2019s incubator for an economy rooted in industry rather than agriculture. At the heart of his plan was a canal system, which was created not for transporting goods, but for powering the water wheels that turned the cam shafts that drove the industrial equipment inside scores of mills.While the mills produced sailcloth, jute, flax and hemp, silk was dominant. From the 1880s to the 1920s, Paterson became known as \u201cSilk City,\u201d with mills attracting workers from across Europe. The quality of the luxury fabric was such that President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s wife, Edith, donned a robin\u2019s egg blue gown made of Paterson silk for his second inauguration.Thousands of locomotives also were made here, including the \u201cGeneral,\u201d the engine celebrated for its role in the Civil War\u2019s Great Locomotive Chase. (The chase was a military raid in 1862, in which Union Army volunteers hijacked a passenger locomotive in Georgia in an effort to damage a rail line used by Confederates.) Colt, too, made its first repeating firearms, or revolvers, in a four-story brownstone at the base of the falls.\u201cPaterson had an outsize influence on American manufacturing for a very long period of time,\u201d Mr. Boch said. \u201cMost New Yorkers in the 1800s would have known where Paterson was and why it was important.\u201dUnder the proposal focusing on the city\u2019s industrial role, a mile-long \u201craceway,\u201d which channeled the powerful waters near the top of the falls to the mills, would once again flow with water. Some of the derelict, burned-out mills would be preserved.Both proposals would be expensive to execute, however. The draft management plan estimated the capital costs at $32 million for the natural landscape and recreation alternative and $46 million for the one focused on industrial history.The plan also seeks to dampen expectations about a quick or comprehensive turnaround, saying that the approval of either does not guarantee that \u201cfunding and staffing\u201d would be \u201cforthcoming.\u201dNonetheless, the people who had long pined for a national park in Paterson, a multiethnic city where a quarter of the residents live in poverty, say they are encouraged that the planning has come this far.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Prepare for the Next Recession", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe answer, of course, is that no one knows. Economists can predict recessions as effectively as they can read your palm. What policy makers can do, however, is get ready for the next recession, whenever it arrives. And we need to act now, because we\u2019re far from ready.Historically, we\u2019ve relied on the Federal Reserve Board to act as our principal recession fighter. And it has done a pretty good job. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be much help next time. Because interest rates are already so low, the Fed\u2019s principal ammunition \u2014 the ability to further lower rates \u2014 is unlikely to have much traction when the next downturn rolls around.But as they currently stand, these programs aren\u2019t enough. Consider SNAP. The 2009 Recovery Act temporarily increased the maximum monthly food benefit by about $63 a month for a family of three. In addition to raising consumer demand, this benefit expansion reduced hunger, and it kept nearly a million people out of poverty in 2010.That expansion took congressional action and was temporary. It won\u2019t happen again without similar action \u2014 which may not take effect in time. So before a recession hits, Congress should enhance SNAP to ensure that such an expansion kicks in automatically when certain economic indicators are breached. Its size should be tied to the severity of the downturn, and the increase would phase out once things improved.One of the biggest challenges during a recession is at the state level \u2014 many states have balanced-budget requirements, which mean that as tax revenues drop, spending has to as well, making the recession more painful. The federal government can help by temporarily increasing the money it gives states to cover Medicaid, which would free them to plug other budget shortfalls.Wouldn\u2019t such spending increase the deficit? Yes, but only temporarily. What drives the long-term deficit are not the automatic responders, which get into and out of the system relatively quickly. It\u2019s permanent tax cuts, or new spending that isn\u2019t paid for.Policy makers from both major political parties recognize the risks of inaction; Congress passed stimulus packages under the administrations of both George W. Bush and President Obama. In addition to increasing SNAP benefits, providing states with fiscal relief and enacting a Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program that served over one million people, the Obama stimulus funded about 260,000 subsidized jobs in 2009 and 2010.But it would be risky to depend on the same wisdom to come through in the next crisis. And we need to do more, too \u2014 for example, the government should create a permanent employment fund that would enable states to both build their own subsidized jobs programs and take advantage of fully funded national service jobs that the federal government would directly create.During normal times, this fund could target populations, like the long-term unemployed or people with criminal records, who typically struggle in the labor market. When a recession hit, the fund would offer the infrastructure necessary to meet rising job-creation needs.We could also improve our unemployment insurance system, which eight states, including big ones like Florida, Michigan and North Carolina, have undermined by restricting eligibility or cutting benefits, or both, in recent years. The federal government should require all states to offer at least 26 weeks of benefits in their basic programs and to expand coverage to a broader group of workers, including part-timers.It should also improve triggers, based on job market conditions, that turn additional weeks of benefits \u201con\u201d during downturns and \u201coff\u201d again during recoveries. Without such effective automatic switches, Congress has had to enact \u201cemergency\u201d unemployment insurance expansions during or after every recession since 1970.There\u2019s ultimately no way to know when the next recession will hit. But if we begin to prepare for it now, we\u2019ll be a lot more ready for it when it does.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Fears, Affordable Care Act Has Not Uprooted Employer Coverage", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byThe Affordable Care Act was aimed mainly at giving people better options for buying health insurance on their own. There were widespread predictions that employers would leap at the chance to drop coverage and send workers to fend for themselves.But those predictions were largely wrong. Most companies, and particularly large employers, that offered coverage before the law have stayed committed to providing health insurance.As it turns out, health care remains an important recruitment and retention tool as the labor market has tightened in recent years. Desirable employees still expect health benefits, and companies are responding, new analyses of federal data show.\u201cWe\u2019re more confident than ever that we\u2019ll offer benefits,\u201d said Robert Ihrie Jr., a senior vice president for Lowe\u2019s Companies, the home improvement retailer.Companies get a sizable federal tax break from providing the insurance. And if they dropped the coverage, many workers would expect the money in their paycheck to increase enough to pay for outside insurance \u2014 or would look for a new job.The reversal in thinking about employer benefits is so stark that even government budget officials are singing an optimistic tune. They lowered the number of people they think will lose coverage because of the health law and now predict employers will remain the source of coverage for a majority of working Americans for the next decade.The surprise turnaround adds to an emerging consensus about the contentious health law: It has not upturned the core of the country\u2019s health insurance system, even while insuring millions of low-income people.\u201cThe employer-based system is alive and well,\u201d said Jeff Alter, the chief executive of the commercial insurance business for UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurance companies. Even among critics of the law, including the Republican presidential candidates, there has been virtually no debate about employer coverage.The health plans employees get to choose from also look much the same as before the law went into effect. The industry remains dominated by familiar names, like nonprofit Blue Cross plans or for-profit companies like UnitedHealthcare and Anthem.\u201cEmployer coverage is much more stable than anyone anticipated,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior executive at Kaiser.Companies say they are responding to the realities of the labor market, but they also say the online marketplaces where individuals can more easily buy plans, a creation of the health care law, have not been an enticing alternative for workers.Employers may feel differently if the economy turns down and the labor market is less robust or if there is a sudden spike in health care costs. Because workers can no longer be denied an insurance policy because of poor health, companies may be willing to drop coverage under the right circumstances, knowing that insurance is more available to everyone.But there are no plans for a mass exodus.\u201cThe demise of employer-based coverage was definitely overstated,\u201d said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Business Coalition on Health, which represents employers and other buyers of insurance.But those companies now seem less likely to exit than just a few years ago. In 2013, as many as a fifth of employers with fewer than 500 workers said they were likely to drop coverage in the next five years, compared with 7 percent today, according to a survey from Mercer, the benefits consultant.Tracy Watts, a senior partner at Mercer, said the stabilization at small businesses was mostly a product of their health care costs staying the same or rising only modestly.\u201cThat will keep you in the game,\u201d Ms. Watts said.The early tumult in the insurance marketplaces, including the troubled introduction of HealthCare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, also made dropping coverage less tenable, analysts said.The law has resulted in more coverage for low-income people, as expected. But the unexpected exit by some of the start-up insurers has limited options on the marketplaces. And the plans on the exchanges remain less generous than those offered by many employers, with significantly higher deductibles and a significantly narrower choice of hospitals and networks.Lowe\u2019s, by comparison, said it has tried to keep employee costs low by contributing about 70 percent of the cost of the annual premiums. It offers plans with deductibles as low as $1,000, versus several thousand dollars for many of the exchange plans.\u201cThe exchanges have been less of a disrupter than I expected,\u201d said Thomas Buchmueller, a business professor at the University of Michigan.Employers say there is less financial advantage to dropping coverage than first thought. The law penalizes large employers, about $2,000 per worker, when they do not offer health insurance. That is far less than the average cost of family coverage, now $12,600 a year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.But those calculations do not figure in the sizable tax break that comes with providing coverage. In addition, if the employers do not provide insurance, they would almost certainly be pressured \u2014 especially in a strong labor market \u2014 to add enough money to workers\u2019 paychecks to cover the cost of buying insurance on the marketplace.Some employers, particularly the smallest businesses and those who employ low-income workers eligible for a subsidy, clearly favor moving employees to the exchanges. Other employers do not.\u201cThe math really worked in favor of providing coverage,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.While the C.B.O. predicts the employer market will be stable until 2026, 10 years is a long time and federal officials could be wrong .\u201cThey are taking their best guess, and I think it is a reasonable best guess,\u201d said Loren Adler, a health policy analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it as gospel.\u201dIf the cost of providing coverage spikes, as it did through much of the late 1990s and early 2000s, employers might start talking about dropping coverage again, Mr. Adler said. Congress could also take steps to diminish the tax preference for employer-provided insurance.But so far, employers like Mr. Ihrie of Lowe\u2019s say they do not feel compelled to change.\u201cPeople have concluded,\u201d he said, \u201cthat it\u2019s better to stay where we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Farewell, Fidel Castro Urges Party to Fulfill His Vision", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Fidel Castro bade farewell to Cuba\u2019s Communist Party on Tuesday, telling party members that he would soon die and urging them to fulfill his communist vision.\u201cOur turn comes to us all,\u201d added Mr. Castro, who made his longest public address in years clad in a blue track jacket, \u201cbut the ideas of Cuban communism will endure.\u201dWhile Mr. Castro seemed to take his leave on Tuesday, others in his cohort signaled their intentions to stay put. The Communist Party announced that Mr. Castro\u2019s brother, President Ra\u00fal Castro, 84, and the president\u2019s hard-line second-in-command, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, 85, would continue to lead the party for at least part of another five-year term.Their re-election indicates that despite a dramatic shift in relations with the United States and tentative economic changes, the leaders of the Castros\u2019 generation are in no hurry to make room for new blood. It is a blow to younger Cubans who are eager for a more pluralistic system led by people closer to their own ages and unencumbered by socialist orthodoxies.Cubans are leaving the island in record numbers, tired of waiting for change and worried that better relations with the United States, while creating new economic opportunities, will end the privileges that make it easier to migrate.Even among those who support the socialist system, there is a sense that younger leaders, like Miguel Mario D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, the country\u2019s first vice president, who turns 56 on Wednesday, are being passed over.President Castro has for years talked of the need to prepare younger people to take the helm. But Mr. C\u00e1rdenas, who spoke by Skype from Havana, said that young leaders already existed but just had no public profile.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of preparing people or creating them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of making them visible.\u201d\u201cThe transition is planned for 2018 when Ra\u00fal steps down,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, referring to President Castro\u2019s pledge to give up the presidency, although he is likely to remain in charge of the Communist Party, a position just as powerful.\u201cAnyone who thought there would be a change now was dreaming,\u201d he said.Fidel Castro\u2019s speech capped the party congress, during which the Communist leadership railed against the threat of introducing other political parties, acknowledged the need for nimbler economic management and accused the United States of using the private sector as a Trojan horse intended to undermine Cuba\u2019s government.In a speech on Saturday, Ra\u00fal Castro warned that a multiparty system \u201cwould be the beginning of the end,\u201d and blamed \u201cunscrupulous\u201d middlemen for the high prices of basic goods.But the Cuban president also noted, with approval, that the state sector employed 70 percent of the country\u2019s work force in 2015, down from 81 percent five years earlier, and the party agreed to expand pilot projects to further liberalize the economy.And while the party leadership remained the same, some prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel were appointed to senior Communist Party positions.The tone of the congress \u2014 with the party clinging to the political status quo but accepting more economic liberalization \u2014 was a sign that changes would continue but were unlikely to gather speed, said Arturo L\u00f3pez Levy, a lecturer at the University of Texas who worked for the Cuban Interior Ministry in the 1990s.\u201cThey are going to remain with one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Union to Consider Requiring Visas for U.S. Travelers", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union is stepping up pressure on the United States to add more European countries to the list of those whose citizens can travel across the Atlantic without a visa, holding out the threat of requiring Americans to get visas for trips to Europe if Washington does not agree.The European Commission is expected to consider on Tuesday whether to change the visa requirements for Americans if their government does not agree to include additional European Union member states \u2014 Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland and Romania \u2014 on the list of those entitled to visa-free travel.In the case of Canada, the dispute concerns two of those countries, Romania and Bulgaria.The escalating dispute comes at a time when Washington is especially concerned about security, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Europe and the presence of suspected terrorists in the flow of migrants to the Continent out of the Middle East. Should the commission decide to move toward imposing visa requirements, it could be a blow to trans-Atlantic relations just before a visit to Europe by President Obama and could complicate negotiations on other issues, including a proposed trade deal.Right now, Americans and Canadians generally can travel to Europe for business and vacations without a visa. But the European Union is insisting that the United States abide by a timetable previously agreed upon among European authorities for adding the five European countries that are not already on the list of those allowed visa-free travel to the United States. The deadline for that change is next week, but no agreement had been reached Thursday evening.It remains unclear whether Brussels will actually start the process of imposing visa requirements next week. If it did, the change would not go into effect immediately, and there would be a period of up to six months when a majority of Europe\u2019s national governments and the European Parliament could block the move.The European Commission is made up of 28 representatives from each European Union member state, so that gives representatives from the countries seeking to be added to the visa-free list, like the commissioner for industry, Elzbieta Bienkowska of Poland, a say in the matter.That may have made Washington even more reluctant to make travel to the United States easier for more Europeans.\u201cOver the past months, all sides have intensified their efforts in order to reach tangible and concrete progress,\u201d Mina Andreeva, a spokeswoman for the commission, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cOur goal is full reciprocal visa waiver with our strategic partners,\u201d she said.There are currently 38 countries whose citizens have visa waivers, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The program enables eligible citizens or nationals of designated countries to travel to the United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without first obtaining a visa.Some of the European Union countries excluded from the program, like Poland and Cyprus, joined the European Union in 2004, more than a decade ago. Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007. Croatia became a member in 2013.But citizens of other countries that joined the bloc in 2004, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Hungary, do have visa-free travel to the United States, and that has helped to generated frustration.In Bulgaria, the economy minister, Bojidar Loukarsky, told local news media in 2014 that his country would support a trade pact with the United States only if Washington waived visa requirements for his country\u2019s citizens. (A spokeswoman for the Bulgarian Permanent Representation to the European Union suggested on Thursday that the official position of the government in Sofia was more nuanced.)\u201cNo matter what happens with visas, this should not impact trade negotiations with the United States as immigration plays no formal part in those talks,\u201d Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, who is on the international trade committee, said in an interview on Thursday.A holdup in the trade talks now could be harmful to the prospects of a deal, which has already become bogged down in highly technical discussions, particularly because Mr. Obama\u2019s successor may not have the same willingness to reach a deal that opens American markets to more foreign competition. The two sides have been in formal negotiations to reach a partnership to increase growth and to further align their economies since 2013.Even so, there is pressure from the capitals of major European Union members, including Poland, where a succession of governments has pushed for its citizens to be treated like other nationals of other European Union member countries.\u201cPolish governments have been lobbying for a long time with the U.S. authorities, in Congress and in the administration, to eliminate this obstacle in traveling to the United States,\u201d said Artur Habant, the spokesman for the Permanent Representation of Poland to the European Union in Brussels.Poland should be considered \u201canother boring European country,\u201d he said.According to Mr. Habant, American authorities say they have often had to refuse applicants in Poland, making the granting of visa waivers for all Poles difficult. \u201cThis has however never been too convincing to the Polish government, as you can imagine, because they need to protect the interests of the Polish people,\u201d said Mr. Habant. He emphasized that there should be reciprocity because \u201cU.S. citizens have had visa-free travel to Poland for years now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Europeans", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "As refugees stream into Europe, and terror attacks spark security fears, one Bavarian village grapples with newcomers \u2014 and with the question of what it means to be German.Supported byRead in GermanIt was on a Friday in September 2014 that Thomas Kamm, the mayor of Siegsdorf Municipality, an affluent cluster of villages in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, learned that the world refugee crisis would be coming to his town. He was barbecuing for his wife\u2019s birthday when he received a call from the German Interior Ministry. Four hundred asylum seekers, who recently arrived in the European Union on the Italian island Lampedusa, were being transported to Germany, the ministry official informed him. A vacant bungalow resort located in one of the villages under the mayor\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 Eisen\u00e4rzt, population, 1,300 \u2014 had been determined a suitable place to house them temporarily. Kamm, a thin, middle-aged former mechanical engineer and a singer in a local a cappella group, managed to negotiate down the number of asylum seekers his town would host, to 200 from 400. The villagers, he told me, were wary of hosting a large number of foreigners from places like Syria and Afghanistan; 400 of them would be \u201cabsolutely a no go.\u201d The first migrants arrived on buses two days later. Kamm said he would never forget the looks on their faces. \u201cPure exhaustion, pure fear,\u201d he said, exhaling so deeply that his lips flapped together. Each of his parents lived through World War II, he told me, but they never said much about their experiences. \u201cI can understand why after seeing those refugees.\u201d That Sunday, Kamm went to local churches to inform the citizenry. \u201cNo one was happy,\u201d he said. Still, most people recognized the need to help: \u201cHumanity stood in the foreground.\u201dThis amalgam of alarm and empathy was once again evident last June, when Kamm returned to church to inform the villagers of Eisen\u00e4rzt that more asylum seekers were on the way. By then, the original 200 migrants had been resettled elsewhere, but many more asylum seekers from places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were arriving on Greece\u2019s Aegean Islands in perilously overcrowded boats, then forging a grueling path through the Balkans toward the security and prosperity of Northern Europe and, most often, Germany. Bavaria was the first German state they encountered along the way. Migrants were showing up in train stations or emerging from the backs of smugglers\u2019 trucks, and it often fell to local officials, people like Kamm, to find somewhere to house them. Asylum seekers ended up in school gymnasiums, shuttered big-box stores and crowded tent encampments.Many of the villagers were not pleased with this development. Some expressed concerns about the safety of local women and children, and others later grumbled about the cost to taxpayers. The mayor argued that the move prevented a more unpalatable outcome. It was clear that the Mallersdorfer Sisters\u2019 mostly vacant residence was an ideal shelter; technically, it was big enough to fit 350 asylum seekers. If the municipality did not buy the building, the district government or a private investor seeking to rent it to the government would, and those outside buyers would likely fill it to capacity. Ownership would provide the town with some ability to control its fate.The mayor\u2019s argument was widely accepted around town, but this did not seem to comfort him. In his office last fall, Kamm suggested that he had barely prevented a citizen uprising. Had 350 asylum seekers come to Eisen\u00e4rzt, the reaction would have been \u201criots,\u201d he told me. The situation, he believed, still remained volatile. I found it hard to imagine rioting in a bucolic Bavarian village and asked the mayor if he was being a bit dramatic. He said that he meant something like the anti-immigrant protests that were occurring weekly in Dresden and had spread to other parts of Germany, sometimes attracting tens of thousands. These were not just peaceful demonstrations, Kamm said; there was something menacing about them. Should the situation in his town \u201cescalate,\u201d he expected similar protests. He said that the majority of asylum seekers were men from Syria, many of whom would try to bring their families \u2014 \u201ctheir three kids and their two wives,\u201d as he put it. \u201cThe number of Syrian people will explode here.\u201dThe mayor told me that he had received anonymous letters that were \u201cclearly xenophobic.\u201d They did not represent the views of the vast majority of his constituents, he said, many of whom exhibited commendable charity. But the mass of people entering the country was so uncontrolled, he said, that even people with good intentions were upset.Kamm had a few policeman friends who had worked on the border; his doctor, too, had volunteered there. They shared with him disconcerting stories about the chaotic registration of migrants, many of whom arrived without documentation. One arriving migrant, he heard, needed a new kidney; others had ailments requiring expensive medicines. The German taxpayer was on the hook for their care.\u201cThey are not voters for far-right parties,\u201d he said of the people who told him these stories. \u201cThey are fulfilling their duties to humanity. But when they see what the reality looks like, they have doubts.\u201d Should the government not act to reduce the migrant influx, he feared an unseemly political backlash. He referred to a German expression to make his point: One should not paint the devil on the wall.By the end of August, the Mallersdorfer Sisters had departed. In September, the first of the Syrians arrived.Merkel, concluding that the only way to hold the European Union together was to curb migration closer to the source, pushed for a deal with Turkey. Turkey \u2014 in exchange for, among other incentives, the revival of stalled talks on its bid to join the European Union \u2014 agreed in March to take back Syrians and other migrants who used the country as a steppingstone to Europe. The deal, questionable in legal and ethical terms, did little to quell the concerns of many Germans about the migrants already among them. Terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have inflamed fears that ISIS is exploiting the refugee crisis to infiltrate Europe undetected; they have also heightened longstanding concerns about Islamist radicalization in disaffected migrant communities. In February, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service assessed the risk of a terrorist attack in Germany as \u201chigh.\u201d And the wave of sexual assaults and robberies attributed to a multitude of young North African and Middle Eastern men, among them asylum seekers, on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne drew comparisons to the mass sexual assaults on women in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution, sparking a debate about a clash with \u201cMuslim culture,\u201d as one conservative parliamentarian put it.In that sense, Bavarian towns like Siegsdorf Municipality sit at both the symbolic and the practical heart of the conundrum facing Germany. Whether the nation deals successfully with the migration challenge or succumbs to fear and nationalism will largely be determined by how communities like Siegsdorf \u2014 those directly charged with welcoming the migrants \u2014 confront the challenges ahead. Like much of Bavaria, the town clings steadfastly to a sense of tradition. The vital question the villagers and their asylum-seeking neighbors now face is whether together they will be able to define a new one.When Yasser arrived at the Mallersdorfer Sisters\u2019 former residence in September, he was shown to his single room on an upper floor and greeted by the caretaker of the residence, Beni Beilhack, a multiple-pierced 36-year-old with thinning hair and a persistent smile. In the following days, Yasser, bored, began to follow Beilhack around, hoping to help with work around the residence. Eventually, Beilhack delegated some tasks to Yasser: repairing a broken doorknob, blowing leaves off the hiking trails near the residence. By October, Beilhack had outfitted Yasser with work clothes and made him his unofficial assistant. The two communicated with a peculiar mix of English, German and Arabic. Under Yasser\u2019s tutelage, Beilhack\u2019s command of Arabic profanities expanded rapidly, and Beilhack dispensed this knowledge liberally throughout his workday, to the delight of many of the young Syrian men. Beilhack, who worked as a truck driver before the Syrians came to town, told me he did not miss his old job, and he seemed to relish his interaction with the Syrians. He started inviting Yasser to family dinners. After school, Beilhack\u2019s son, Luca, then 12, often came by the residence. The Syrians were generally \u201cwarmer\u201d than the local residents, Luca told me, adding, \u201cI\u2019d be happy if they lived here forever.\u201dBeilhack\u2019s 64-year-old mother, Evelyn, also works as a caretaker at the residence, where she lives on the ground floor with her husband. Evelyn held the position previously, when the sisters lived there. When Evelyn learned the Syrians would be moving in, she rejoiced. The nuns nitpicked about the smallest details, she told me, creating an oppressive work environment. She grew up in what she called a \u201cvery international\u201d town, a place called Geretsried, south of Munich, which was settled by Germans expelled from Eastern Europe after World War II. Later, Southern European guest workers arrived. Growing up there left her open to seeing what the asylum seekers would be like. \u201cYou hear from a lot of different places about what an abominable people they are \u2014 not Syrians, but altogether, this whole mass of asylum seekers that are streaming in here,\u201d she told me. People called them \u201cterrible and slobs and poorly raised and primitive.\u201d She wanted to find out for herself, she said. \u201cI thought: I\u2019ll take this on. I want to see this. I want to know this.\u201dThrough his conversations with the Beilhacks, Yasser began to understand something of life in Germany. Evelyn told him how much money was deducted from people\u2019s paychecks for taxes and health insurance, and the cost of living generally seemed far higher than in prewar Syria. Back at home, his wife did some work in a private office, but he would not allow her to work for a firm. Women in Syria were not supposed to hold down such jobs, he said. In Germany, however, he would have to reconsider. He and his wife probably wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a house and a car if she didn\u2019t work too. \u201cLife here is hard,\u201d he said. If the war in Syria ended, he told me, he would go back in a minute.Despite his growing friendship with Beni Beilhack, Yasser spent a considerable amount of time cocooned in his room, his mood dark. Yasser had worked since his teenage years. Out at sea, he was a boatswain, supervising deck crews. In Germany, he was living in what was effectively an isolated dormitory with little to do but smoke and sip tea. During his journey from Turkey, another migrant told him that Germany would allow him to bring his wife after six months. Yasser, however, was realizing that it would take a lot longer, if he would be able to bring her at all. \u201cI can\u2019t live without my wife,\u201d he told me. The process of \u201cfamily reunification\u201d \u2014 a legal method for recognized refugees to bring their families to join them \u2014 is often long. German politicians have meanwhile debated whether to seriously limit the practice. In November, the interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, announced that Syrians would, in the future, be granted a lesser form of protection instead of refugee status, and as a consequence, they would lose the right to bring their families. The announcement sparked uproar within the governing coalition, and the ministry backtracked.One day in October, Yasser\u2019s spirits sank still further. Across the street from the residence, next to the small Eisen\u00e4rzt train station, some Syrians found leaflets bearing the message \u201cNo Asylum.\u201d Yasser didn\u2019t leave the residence for several days. \u201cHow would you feel if you found out some people don\u2019t like you?\u201d he told me. Beni Beilhack noticed that the S on the leaflets was written to resemble those used in the angular logo of the Nazi SS. (On another occasion, I found similar fliers at the train station; in addition to the menacing S, the L was shaped like a hangman\u2019s gallows.)Like Yasser, Beilhack took the message personally. \u201cIf some right-wing extremist comes here, I\u2019ll be standing in front,\u201d he said. Last year, Germany had more than a sixfold increase in the number of violent crimes directed at residences for asylum seekers and refugees: 177 offenses, including 94 cases of arson or attempted arson, according to a provisional tally by the Federal Criminal Police Office. The growing violence drove the German president, Joachim Gauck, to speak last August of two Germanys in conflict with each other: \u201cBright Germany\u201d \u2014 the Germany of charity and compassion \u2014 against \u201cDark Germany\u201d \u2014 the Germany of hate and xenophobia.\u201cGood morning,\u201d Bech said to the all-male class in German. \u201cThese are my children.\u201dThe Syrian men responded in unison, as instructed: \u201cThose are your children.\u201dBech seemed to take genuine delight in the Syrians\u2019 progress. \u201cYou\u2019re all very good!\u201d Her children helped with the lesson, holding up colored pencils and announcing the hues. \u201cThis is orange,\u201d said Elena, who was 7. \u201cOrange,\u201d the men repeated. \u201cThis is what a teddy bear looks like,\u201d said Jakob, age 5.Most people I met, however, did not seem embroiled in a cosmic battle between bright and dark sides, as Gauck had outlined it; instead, many occupied a kind of gray Germany, where ambivalence reigned. Even some of those who reached out in fellowship to the asylum seekers were not free of apprehension about their arrival. When I met a local Catholic priest, Thomas Graf von Rechberg, in his office in Siegsdorf, he told me that Pope Francis\u2019 visit to Lampedusa in July 2013 \u2014 Francis\u2019 first trip outside Rome as pope \u2014 had moved him to reach out to asylum seekers arriving in his area in order to calm rising tensions and to \u201cdefuse the social explosive agent.\u201d When, the following year, 16 asylum seekers, many of them from Afghanistan, moved in to a guesthouse near a towering church where he preaches, Graf von Rechberg began making occasional visits. Last November, the day after the terrorist attacks in Paris, he planned to go again, but he was struck by what he described as a \u201cstrange feeling\u201d that made him hesitate. He nevertheless decided to visit the home to hand out pictures of Mary and some sweets.\u201cIt was for me, really, psychotherapy,\u201d he told me. It didn\u2019t matter that not everyone accepted the pictures of Mary. The experience healed him \u201cfrom the mistrust that forms.\u201dGraf von Rechberg is an interesting man. He invited asylum seekers into his home for dinner, but he held an almost apocalyptic view of their presence in Germany. Many of them, he predicted, would come to live in Muslim-majority ghettos like those in Paris, \u201cwhere they don\u2019t do anything, don\u2019t work and then watch some stupid Internet films, and then some will carry out terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. I can only accept it, and that will be our future.\u201dI asked him if this vision wasn\u2019t a bit fatalistic. He told me that he saw matters in a religious light. Germany\u2019s Christians had grown too complacent and materialistic, and the challenges ahead \u2014 ISIS attacks included \u2014 would force them to remember their Christian values. \u201cCozy postwar Germany\u201d was a thing of the past, he told me. And yet he saw this new unease as good for the soul. For him personally, the discomfort was a chance for self-improvement and an opportunity to double down on values of openness and benevolence in the face of anxiety. \u201cGermany is very much bound in this international migration of peoples,\u201d he said. \u201cI must realize this chance, because if I don\u2019t, then I\u2019ll get bitter.\u201dI sat at a table across from Rainer Klapfenberger, a 62-year-old retiree who serves on the town council. Klapfenberger, a Social Democrat in a part of the country where there are not many Social Democrats, told me it was proper that asylum seekers and refugees in Germany benefit from its expansive social safety net. For Klapfenberger, however, the problem was that the same safety net had proved inadequate for many Germans. \u201cHow many people in Traunstein\u201d \u2014 a small city nearby \u2014 \u201care picking through the garbage for bottles?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving preference to the refugees against our own poor people. Many people don\u2019t understand that.\u201d That sentiment is widespread: In February, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, called for an increase in public spending \u2014 \u201ca new solidarity package for our own population\u201d \u2014 in order to quell such discontent. Gabriel said he, too, often heard Germans say, \u201cFor them you do everything, for us you do nothing,\u201d and this required remedy. (Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats rejected Gabriel\u2019s idea.)\u201cPeople have justified worries about how things will turn out if other cultures take the upper hand,\u201d the elder Scheck said in the small firehouse meeting room, where we had moved to escape the loud music. He\u2019d seen one Syrian walking around town with a girl on his shoulders, presumably his daughter. \u201cWhere was the wife?\u201d he wondered. Scheck presumed this was a sign of gender inequality. \u201cWith us, men and women are equal,\u201d he said.At this point, Christian, who worked for a medical-supply distributor, chimed in. The refugees, he believed, would have a hard time entering the work force. He praised Germany\u2019s strong apprenticeship and vocational-training tradition, of which he had partaken, and was skeptical that asylum seekers\u2019 qualifications could compare. In September, Germany\u2019s labor minister, Andrea Nahles, warned that fewer than 10 percent of asylum seekers arrived with the qualifications needed to immediately begin a job or apprenticeship. Unemployment, she warned, would rise. Over the long run, many German economists said, the migration wave would benefit the economy, but everyone agrees that this will require significant upfront investment in education and job training.Christian and his father didn\u2019t think it would work out well. Many of the Syrians wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a small village like Eisen\u00e4rzt anyway, Christian said. They would want to go to Munich or Berlin. \u201cThat\u2019s the one advantage that we have.\u201d As an afterthought, he added that his son had enjoyed playing with some of refugee children who briefly stayed in town one year earlier. They met on a soccer field. \u201cThe children can get along with one another a lot more easily than the adults,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re free.\u201dQraluq was not in a good mood. Nobody in the room was. Whereas the Syrians up the road were virtually assured of receiving refugee status, Afghans, who last year were the second-largest group of migrants entering the country, won some form of protection less than half the time. And there were signs that Germany, which for years had considered it impossible to repatriate Afghans, might soon start sending some back. In October, de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister, declared it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that so many Afghans were coming, he said, as not all parts of Afghanistan were unsafe. A few months later, he visited Kabul and discouraged Afghans from trying to come to Germany, saying, \u201cYou will lose your money and gain no future.\u201d Qraluq later noted with grim resignation that the day of de Maizi\u00e8re\u2019s visit, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked a Kabul police complex, killing at least 20 people.Many of the Afghans I met in Siegsdorf told me that the Taliban would immediately kill them if they returned. On the night I met him, Qraluq told me not to believe everything I was told. \u201cLots of people who come here are lying,\u201d he said. Qraluq, however, said he had no reason to lie. He told me that he served as an interpreter for British and Danish troops operating in Helmand Province in 2011. The Taliban, he said, got word of his cooperation with foreign troops and threatened him and his family. When that happened, the family fled to Pakistan. From there, Qraluq continued on to Germany. If the German government tried to return him, he was certain he would be killed: \u201cI\u2019m on top of the list.\u201dQraluq went back to his small room, which he shared with an Eritrean asylum seeker with whom he did not get along \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve become allergic to the sound of the Eritrean language,\u201d he said \u2014 and came back with some evidence of his interpreter service, like letters of appreciation from two Danish captains.\u201cKhalil is very pleasant and never complains,\u201d read one of them. By his own account, though, Qraluq was no longer as pleasant as he once was. Two years of waiting on an asylum decision had left him embittered. He had trouble sleeping and felt constantly tense. He was tired of being an asylum seeker, he said, of getting dirty looks on the street. \u201cWhen they look, they hate me.\u201dQraluq\u2019s unhappiness hadn\u2019t made him idle. He attended vocational school and had learned to speak pretty good German. He also worked roughly 50 hours a month at a supermarket in Traunstein and was set to begin an apprenticeship there later in the year. The day after the drinking session, I met Qraluq at an auto-repair shop where he was interning as part of his vocational-school training. As he cleaned the grease off a hose with turpentine-soaked paper towels, he told me about the time in Helmand Province that he was sitting in a tank with Danish soldiers and a roadside bomb went off in front of them. \u201cThe gunner was bleeding from his eyes, nose and ears,\u201d Qraluq said. A few days later, I accompanied him to his job at the supermarket. We arrived a bit early, and he lit a cigarette outside, in front of a large advertisement that said, \u201cThe Best of the Best.\u201d Qraluq told me that he used to want to be a politician or a diplomat. Now he just wanted a simple life. If everything went according to plan, he would complete his supermarket apprenticeship in three years. A few moments later, the deputy store manager, Philipp Huber, 22, walked out and lit a cigarette. He praised Qraluq for being self-motivated. It wasn\u2019t easy for the supermarket to find good workers like him, he said.Qraluq started his shift in the drinks aisle, making sure the juice cartons were perfectly aligned. Later, he visited a break room and lit a cigarette. After a few drags, a voice echoed over the sound system. \u201cKhalil to the vegetable department.\u201d Qraluq quickly extinguished the cigarette and ran out to stock some persimmons.\u201cHow sweet!\u201d said Sieglinde Seidl, a smiley woman who had just taken a seat in the break room. \u201cVery nice guy.\u201d Seidl was a butcher and had worked in the meats department for 26 years. \u201cWhen I hear people complaining about refugees, I tell them, \u2018You don\u2019t know how good you have it,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. She then vaguely recalled having some colleagues long ago who were refugees \u2014 she couldn\u2019t quite remember from where \u2014 but they had to leave the country. \u201cMaybe they were from Bosnia?\u201d I suggested. In the early-to-mid-1990s, during the Bosnian War, Germany gave temporary protection to 345,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1996, the German government started an effort to send them back. Seidl thought Bosnia sounded right. It was a real shame when those former co-workers had to leave, she said. \u201cI hope these refugees get to stay.\u201dWhen I met Qraluq again in late winter, he was more anxious and had dropped out of vocational school because of absences. He was trying to get back into a better mood, he told me, but it was a struggle. He had seen Syrians receive refugee status even though they arrived in Germany long after him. He could not understand why the Europeans didn\u2019t want Afghans. \u201cWhat is the problem with us?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did we do in Europe? No Afghans attacked Paris.\u201dIt was not entirely surprising, then, that one of the most openly angry people I met in Eisen\u00e4rzt was an American woman from Ohio named Allison Kollmayer. I ran into Kollmayer at the village Christmas bazaar, a small sale to raise money for charity at the local church. The event mostly drew elderly residents, who dined on cake and coffee served to them by women in dirndls. When I arrived, I sat at a table and tried to make conversation about the 100 Syrians in the village. The guests reacted with remarkable silence. Then someone introduced me to Kollmayer, who was holding one of the items for sale \u2014 a pine cone topped with a miniature Santa hat. \u201cWe are against this huge onslaught!\u201d said Kollmayer, who married a local man and has lived in Eisen\u00e4rzt for three decades. \u201cI\u2019m really, really angry.\u201dAfter fuming for a while, she paused and laughed, as if amused by her own anger. She seemed a bit uninhibited for the gathering, and people in the room looked uncomfortable. \u201cYou should not discuss it,\u201d a woman in a dirndl whispered to Kollmayer. \u201cHe\u2019s writing it down.\u201d Kollmayer was not dissuaded. She told me she \u201cwas not prejudiced against anyone\u201d but was angry about the disorderly way the Syrians rode their bikes on the street (\u201cI\u2019ve almost been run over twice!\u201d). She was angry about the amount of cash asylum seekers were getting from the government (\u201cThey should get a little bit, but not what they have\u201d). She was angry that, according to her, the police were not allowed to talk about the crimes migrants committed (\u201cMy girlfriend\u2019s daughter is a police officer, and they\u2019re not allowed to report the truth\u201d).\u201cCan I have a beer?\u201d I said. A woman rose to serve me.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d said one of the customers. He was tall, and his bald crown nearly reached the portraits of King Ludwig II of Bavaria on the wall above him. When I told him I was from the United States, he smiled as if this was O.K. The man, who later introduced himself as Michael Scholz, a produce-truck driver, told me there were too many migrants coming over the border. \u201cThis is why the Germans will get nasty again,\u201d he said. He then put up his right arm in the manner of a Hitler salute so that there wasn\u2019t any doubt about his meaning.He also told me that asylum seekers had raped three women in Freilassing. (The mayor of that town told me there were no rapes.) Scholz\u2019s companion, sitting next to him, said the police couldn\u2019t speak about such matters because of a \u201cpledge of secrecy.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to give me her name and nearly burst into tears when Scholz did, worried about the consequences. \u201cYou can\u2019t say these things,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no freedom of opinion.\u201d Scholz told her that he didn\u2019t care. He was fed up. Then he turned to me. The municipality had to put in new kitchens for the Syrians, he said. \u201cWho pays for that? I do. And for that, I get massively nasty.\u201d Another couple entered the restaurant and joined the table, ordering sausage and French fries. They nodded approvingly as Scholz went on. \u201cNinety percent of those who come aren\u2019t refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come here because we have the cash.\u201d They wore Adidas shoes and had iPhones, he said. \u201cI can barely look at them because I get so angry.\u201dOthers wished to stay in Siegsdorf Municipality, the only German home they knew. This presented a set of entirely new challenges. The mayor was considering ways to provide low-income housing and how to ease access to the job market. At the same time, he still seemed worried about the local mood. He told me about one nearby municipality where residents got into an \u201copen confrontation\u201d with elected officials over opposition to a residence for asylum seekers. By contrast, things in his town were quiet, he told me, but this could change instantaneously if one of the migrants did \u201csomething bad.\u201d I asked the mayor what he meant. \u201cA rape,\u201d he said in a matter-of-fact manner.A few weeks later, after the attacks in Brussels, Graf von Rechberg noticed what he called \u201ca greater wariness\u201d among his congregants. On Holy Thursday, he gave a sermon on how Christians ought to confront the darkness and evil implicit in the Brussels attack. He advised congregants to pray for peace, to avoid the temptation to hide from outsiders, to accept refugees. During the service, Graf von Rechberg washed the feet of a Pakistani asylum seeker, as Jesus had washed his disciples\u2019 feet before the crucifixion. When I spoke to him later, Graf von Rechberg still seemed resigned to a darker future for Germany. The social problems and fanaticism that led to the attacks in Brussels, he told me, were perhaps unsolvable. Still, it was everyone\u2019s spiritual obligation to try. When I asked him if he visited asylum seekers to hand out gifts after the Brussels attack, as he did following the Paris attack. Graf von Rechberg suggested the violence had become grim routine. \u201cI can\u2019t go by after every attack,\u201d he said.At the Mallersdorfer Sisters\u2019 former residence in Eisen\u00e4rzt, Yasser continued to try to transition to a normal life in Germany. In December, Beni Beilhack accompanied Yasser to his asylum interview in Munich. The questioning lasted about an hour. Had Yasser witnessed an aerial bombardment? (No.) Had he ever fought for Bashar al-Assad? (No.) Had he fought for ISIS? (No.) A few weeks later, Yasser received notice: He had been granted refugee status. Yasser, who was still missing his wife and wondering how long it would take to bring her, was ambivalent about the news. Beilhack seemed to try his best to cheer him up. He helped Yasser file the application to bring her to Germany and found him a modest one-bedroom sublet in Eisen\u00e4rzt.The move took place on a sunny Saturday morning. Beilhack and Evelyn gathered the items they thought Yasser would need, down to small details. Evelyn packed cutting boards and an oven mitt taken from a storage room filled with goods donated by local residents. Beilhack procured plastic chairs and a table for the balcony. That morning, Yasser looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept much. The day before, he asked me if it would be proper, according to German custom, to knock on the neighbors\u2019 doors and introduce himself. I referred the question to Evelyn. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one,\u201d she said. Some of the neighbors, she added, had complained about a Syrian moving in. Yasser decided he would forgo the introductions.After he arrived in his new apartment, Yasser stood on his balcony and took in the view: the neighboring houses and the pine-tree-covered hill beyond them. It was very quiet. Yasser joked with Beni about disrupting the serenity. He would raise chickens on the balcony and invite all the Syrians over for a party. Yasser grabbed Beni\u2019s son, Luca, by the hand and mimicked a foot-stomping Syrian dance. \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d he whispered as if screaming. \u201cPolice coming in one minute,\u201d he added wryly.Yasser then stepped out onto the balcony for a cigarette and peered at the lawn below. One neighbor, an old man in his slippers, appeared on the path next to his house. Before turning the corner, the man glanced up at Yasser for a moment and then looked away, saying nothing.James Angelos is a writer based in Berlin and the author of \u201cThe Full Catastrophe: Travels Among the New Greek Ruins.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Joins Angela Merkel in Pushing Trade Deal to a Wary Germany", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byHANOVER, Germany \u2014 President Obama said on Sunday that he was confident the United States and the European Union would succeed in negotiating a new trans-Atlantic trade deal by the end of the year, saying the benefits of such an agreement were \u201cindisputable.\u201dMr. Obama said images of factories moving overseas and lost jobs created a narrative about trade agreements that \u201cdrives, understandably, a lot of suspicion\u201d in places like the United States and Germany. But, he added, well-designed trade deals can have greater benefits.\u201cIt is indisputable that it has made our economy stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made sure that our businesses are the most competitive in the world.\u201dIn the evening, Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel hosted a dinner for 29 chief executives of major American and German companies.The president\u2019s visit to Germany was intended to bolster negotiators seeking to wrap up a trade agreement between the United States and the European Union, an accord that Ms. Merkel supports but that is highly unpopular in her country.Ms. Merkel is among Mr. Obama\u2019s most trusted counterparts, and the president is eager to support her during difficult political times. Ms. Merkel has struggled in recent months to confront a surge of migrants and a weakening economy.On Sunday, she echoed Mr. Obama\u2019s enthusiasm for the trans-Atlantic trade deal, using bolder language than is her usual style.\u201cWe should get a move on,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cWe all know the reproaches, worries and fears, and what difficulties remain.\u201dBut if time is used wisely, she said, an agreement that will raise living standards can emerge. \u201cSo my request to those who are present,\u201d she added, looking around the audience of hundreds of business leaders and politicians, is: \u201cDo it, and then we can have a great success this year.\u201dThe chancellor greeted the president at the Schloss Herrenhausen, the former summer residence of the Royal House of Hanover. They stood in front of a line of German troops in gray overcoats and green berets as the national anthems of the two nations played before the two leaders returned inside for a private meeting.Mr. Obama said he hoped the trade negotiations could be completed before he left office.\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate that we will be able to complete ratification of a deal by the end of this year, but I do anticipate that we will have completed the agreement,\u201d he said. Once negotiations are finished, he said, \u201cpeople will be able to see exactly why this will be good for our two countries.\u201dYet even as he expressed confidence that a deal would be reached this year, Mr. Obama acknowledged that \u201ctime is not on our side,\u201d and he offered a thinly veiled warning that a deal could be doomed if politicians like Hillary Clinton, who opposes the accord, are elected this year.\u201cIf we don\u2019t complete negotiations this year, then upcoming political transitions in the United States and Europe could mean this agreement won\u2019t be finished for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Obama said, not mentioning Mrs. Clinton, his former secretary of state, directly.Earlier, Mr. Obama\u2019s commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, told an audience of 350 business leaders, \u201cWe must ask ourselves: What is the cost of delay?\u201d\u201cNow is the time for U.S.-German leadership,\u201d she said.Yet Germans often veer between admiration and scorn of the United States. Rarely was that more clear than in the contrasting ways that two groups prepared to greet Mr. Obama here this weekend.None of that impressed the tens of thousands of protesters who gathered in Hanover\u2019s Opera Square on Saturday. Their goal, as proclaimed in hundreds of banners and chants, was to topple the trade deal, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Germany depends on exports for its wealth and on the United States for its security. Yet many Germans do not see the trade agreement as a good thing.Monica Orth, 54, a therapist for teenagers who lives in Bonn, is one of many here who see the trade pact as a plot by big businesses \u2014 often American ones \u2014 to lower consumer standards, bypass national justice systems and undermine Europe\u2019s way of life.At least a dozen other protesters who were interviewed echoed her words. All accused corporations like Monsanto \u2014 the American biotechnology corporation reviled by some for using genetically modified seeds that it says help battle disease \u2014 or the German pharmaceutical company Bayer of trying to force on them products they do not want.In a way, these Germans should be a source of American pride, fierce believers in the democratic creed that the Western Allies spread after the defeat of the Nazis.Yet popular sentiment in Germany often turns against the United States, which, though admired for its liberty and technical prowess, is also mistrusted by many for its commercial and military dominance.\u201cWhat I personally find very difficult to understand is why Germans are so full of fears about trade and the future at a time when they have it good and unemployment is relatively low,\u201d Mr. Bluth said in an interview.Anton Hofreiter, a leader of the Greens party who observed the protest on Saturday, said anti-American beliefs were not the guiding force of the campaign against the trade pact. Yet he noted that demonstrators were wary that Mr. Obama had come to Europe partly to make a quick trade deal.Protesters who were asked why they so feared a pact likely to enhance Germany\u2019s trade prospects or why they distrusted American regulators, who uncovered the Volkswagen scandal when European regulators did not, insisted that they would be deceived, describing the trade talks as secretive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once a Bright Spot, Afghan Telecoms Face Unsustainable Losses", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Men thread their way through this city\u2019s traffic jams, hawking streamers of phone cards. Others stand behind crude wooden tables selling cheap Chinese-made mobile phones. Throngs of people navigate the sidewalks and streets with cellphones pressed to their ears.The boom in cellphones here has made the Afghan telecommunications industry one of the few bright spots in a moribund economy savaged by war, political gridlock and an exodus of money and people. Cellphones pumped $148 million into the economy last year. The industry was also the largest private employer, supplying 140,000 jobs, a feat in a country with 25 percent unemployment.But even that success is now looking shaky.The Afghan government has again increased taxes on the industry to replenish its coffers, cutting into the industry\u2019s shrinking profits. And the country\u2019s telecom companies are competing for a dwindling pool of customers after the drawdown in American and coalition troops and contractors.\u201cThe success that was is no longer there,\u201d said Karim Khoja, the chief executive of Roshan, one of the largest Afghan telecom companies. \u201cThe economics keep making it more and more difficult.\u201dThe explosion in cellphone use is remarkable in a country where most people did not own a phone before the American-led invasion in October 2001. The nation\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure fell into disrepair under the Taliban from lack of investment. With few phones, most people had to walk into Tajikistan or Pakistan or use satellite phones to call their relatives in the Afghan diaspora.After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the start of the war, Afghan Wireless, a joint venture with the government, opened, and Roshan began a year later. Inspired by Roshan\u2019s growth, three other players jumped into the market.Over the last decade, the companies have invested over $2 billion in the country, much of it in infrastructure like cellular towers. In this country of 32 million people, around 75 percent are now cellular service subscribers. And the cost of a call has plunged sharply.\u201cThe telecoms industry is one of the rare success stories in Afghanistan,\u201d said Walter Koenig, a former telecommunications executive and senior commercial officer at the American embassy in Kabul who left the post last fall.While the industry remains vital to the Afghan economy, its growth has also made it vulnerable. Aid money, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the federal budget, is drying up, and Afghan government officials are struggling to find new sources of revenue to plug the shortfall.Telecoms, which already provide 10 percent of the federal budget, are again in their sights. The total tax load on telecommunications has climbed over the last decade to more than 25 percent. In September, a presidential decree levied a 10 percent tax on customers who top up their mobile phones with more money, a move that so far has raised more than $26 million.The latest increase was part of a larger package of taxes and reforms introduced last year to stabilize and strengthen the economy under the International Monetary Fund\u2019s direction. The changes are necessary to maintain funding from international donor countries and government agencies.The government agency that oversees the industry has fought the tariffs, to little relief. \u201cI\u2019m against the tax,\u201d said Abdul Razaq Vahidi, the minister of communications and information technology, who leads the agency. \u201cThis is not affordable for the sector.\u201dThose taxes threaten to further undercut the industry. The companies\u2019 bottom lines have been hurt by the withdrawal of their best customers, American and coalition troops and the 500,000 people who have lost their jobs. Political gridlock, growing insecurity, inflation and the departure of the middle class have also crimped sales.After reporting steady growth through 2012, the country\u2019s cellphone companies watched revenue crumble as soldiers and contractors began to leave. Sales dropped 10 to 25 percent as the troop departures accelerated.Roshan pledged in 2014 that it would stay, no matter the cost. The company was founded by the charitable fund of the Aga Khan as a way to spark investment in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.The company, however, is re-evaluating its promise. Its chief executive, Mr. Khoja, said Roshan would never recoup its $600 million investment in the country. Revenue slid 10 percent in 2014 and declined slightly in 2015, according to the company.\u201cI have to keep the balance between longevity and sustainability,\u201d Mr. Khoja said. \u201cYou cannot sell below your cost forever.\u201dThe group blows up or burns cellphone towers as a show of strength against the government or as retribution when companies will not turn off service. The Taliban often force nighttime coverage blackouts so their movements cannot be tracked and locals cannot tip off security forces.\u201cYou build a tower 10 times in the same location,\u201d said Ali Asgharzadeh, chief commercial officer at Etisalat Afghanistan, a cell company based in Abu Dhabi and the country\u2019s largest mobile operator. \u201cThat\u2019s business in Afghanistan.\u201dReplacing towers, which cost roughly $100,000 each, is considered a normal business operation. While each site has guards, they are sometimes paid off, threatened or attacked by insurgents, Mr. Asgharzadeh said. The communications ministry is meeting with local elders to apply pressure on the Taliban to cut their attacks, and it is asking the federal government to increase security measures.As they look to shore up revenue, mobile phone companies are trying to expand their data services and bring more Afghans online. Increasing the number of regular users will be difficult because the country has a high rate of illiteracy and little online content in local languages. Most Afghans cannot afford Internet access.The challenges are also compounded by the government monopoly of the country\u2019s fiber optic network. Telecom companies must rely on their own satellite links and buy capacity on the network to provide data to customers. But it is expensive and not a reliable source because of frequent cuts in service.Cellular companies are working with the president\u2019s office to wrest control of the fiber optic network from the state-run operator, which has been criticized for its poor management, capricious rate-setting and poor quality, according to operators.The companies reached an agreement with the telecoms ministry that would allow them to share the network and lay down their own cables. The country\u2019s economic council has approved the agreement, and the president is expected to sign off on the plan to carry it out. By summer, operators should be able to start work, said Mohammad Qayoumi, the president\u2019s chief technology adviser.The changes hold the promise of cheaper and expanded access to the Internet, as well as increased revenue for the country. Government officials hope a bigger network will allow Afghanistan to become something of a digital hub, linking traffic from the Far East and its own neighbors and allowing the country to levy more taxes. Iraq earns over $1 billion from such taxes, and Afghan officials expect they can do the same.Oliver Dziggel, a senior telecom consultant to the American and Afghan governments who has worked on the agreement, said, \u201cFiber is the magic element that makes it all happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tubman\u2019s In. Jackson\u2019s Out. What\u2019s It Mean?", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byWesley Morris, a critic-at-large, Jennifer Schuessler, a culture reporter, and Binyamin Appelbaum, who covers the economy, talk about what the monetary makeover all means.What do you think? Does having her on the bill make a real difference \u2014 either to how we think about our history, or how we think about our money?Countries historically have used their currency to make sure everyone knows who\u2019s in charge. The United Kingdom still puts the queen on every single bill, although she always has company. Putting Tubman on the $20 strikes me as a powerful and necessary realignment of our symbols and our professed values.I guess one question on my mind is this: Do these changes go far enough? Tubman isn\u2019t exactly a modern figure; she died in 1913. And amazingly, there\u2019s still a Masonic pyramid on the back of the $1 bill.Having Tubman on cash is not simply reparative, although the idea of seeing her face and hearing her name during the months of the year that aren\u2019t February becomes nourishment in itself. Having her on cash is to me an uncontroversial no-brainer.But generally, yes, let\u2019s get some more modern candidates on our moola.So Treasury needed another bill. Andrew Jackson actually thought the United States shouldn\u2019t print paper money. He was also a bad president. So he gets shunted to the back of the $20, and Hamilton stays on the front of the $10 and women get the balance of the real estate.Tubman now joins the shorter list of nonpresidents who have been selected as \u201crepresentative Americans,\u201d alongside Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin.But this Harriet Tubman news will make me reconsider. For one thing, she\u2019s super-\u201crepresentative.\u201d For another, $20 bills are the favorite denomination of most ATMs, and I predict I\u2019ll feel scrupulous in spending it. How do I pay for a family-pack of toilet paper with a Tubman? Who knows, my savings game might go through the roof.And even if who\u2019s on what money doesn\u2019t matter to most people, it definitely matters to rebellious rappers, who\u2019ll have to adjust their rhymes to take in what it means to have a great black woman stacked among what \u201cdead presidents\u201d are still standing (Sorry, Mr. Jackson).There\u2019s also the Mount Rushmore problem. The bar is always lower for initial membership. Once the lineup is full, each decision is doubled: Every addition also requires a subtraction.Which raises an important question: Does Hamilton deserve to keep his spot?An article on Thursday in which three Times writers discussed the coming changes to United States currency and some aspects of bills now in circulation misidentified the scene shown on the back of the $2 bill. It is a presentation of a draft of the Declaration of Independence, not the signing of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript: Democratic Presidential Debate in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.Let\u2019s begin with Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.(APPLAUSE)Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.(APPLAUSE)Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging \u2014 guess what \u2014 $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we\u2019re doing something very radical: We\u2019re telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...(APPLAUSE)... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.(APPLAUSE)This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...(APPLAUSE)... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who\u2019d been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.(APPLAUSE)And that is \u2014 that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America. That\u2019s what I\u2019m offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about.(APPLAUSE)We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised. I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. \u201cWashington Post\u201d headline says \u201cClinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified\u201d and that\u2019s what the surrogates were saying.Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?Of course she does.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t believe that that is...(APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)When asked, he could not explain how...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Where does the money come from?Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she\u2019s going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?I don\u2019t think so.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary?(BOOS)(APPLAUSE)I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank. I\u2019m glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.There are two sections there. If they fail either one, that they\u2019re a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you\u2019re referring to, is inadequate.Let\u2019s look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. We\u2019ve got to execute under it. So, you\u2019re right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves? SANDERS: First, Dana...Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same. Now, I don\u2019t need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they\u2019re based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)But, there\u2019s another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that. Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office, the president \u2014 President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.That is the law. Now, this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law. You don\u2019t just say, we\u2019re upset about this. I\u2019m upset about it. You don\u2019t just say, go break them up. You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.(APPLAUSE)Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks, in my view, have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.If elected president, I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I\u2019m the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.Now, if you\u2019re going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you\u2019ve got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company, AIG. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.I\u2019m not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)Why not release them?But I will tell you this, there is \u2014 there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go \u2014 you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And I\u2019ve released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents. There were no speeches.(APPLAUSE)And second of all, of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. We\u2019ve been a little bit busy lately. You\u2019ll excuse us. But we will...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And this is \u2014 this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. That\u2019s his \u2014 that\u2019s his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and \u2014 and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(BOOS)So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America\u2019s middle class and poor?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And that\u2019s exactly what I will do.When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.So I think you\u2019ve got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting \u2014 more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And that\u2019s exactly what my plan would bring about.I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...(APPLAUSE)You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.As president...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)All right? When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let\u2019s raise it to $12. There\u2019s a difference. And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they\u2019re saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.(APPLAUSE)The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Now, in fact \u2014 in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. That\u2019s good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.(APPLAUSE)And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...(APPLAUSE)We\u2019re going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019ve said that Vermont, Senator Sanders\u2019 home state, has, quote, \u201cthe highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.\u201d But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont. Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York\u2019s gun violence?(LAUGHTER)And what I want to start by saying \u2014 it\u2019s not a laughing matter \u2014 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.So, yes, we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.(APPLAUSE)And what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield. He said they didn\u2019t deserve their day in court.And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd.Here is the fact on guns. Let\u2019s talk about guns. That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook \u2014 what\u2019s the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont. I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what? We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.I\u2019ve got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.(APPLAUSE)And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)But let me say this \u2014 in 1988, as we\u2019ve heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost. He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here\u2019s what he said. He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent. So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA. Voting \u2014 he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.(APPLAUSE)Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don\u2019t believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them \u2014 somebody walks in.SANDERS: They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.This is a \u2014 this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn\u2019t want a mom and pop store \u2014 that was not the point of this. And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.What was really going on, I\u2019ll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City. New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.Senator, go ahead.Let\u2019s turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?(APPLAUSE)On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct. I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.So we have a problem. And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.So that\u2019s how I see it. And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?I\u2019ve seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.(APPLAUSE)... especially I want \u2014 I want white people \u2014 I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism. It\u2019s also in employment, it\u2019s in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it. When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence. This took us a good step forward. We\u2019re talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook. This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means, for a start \u2014 and we don\u2019t talk about this. The media doesn\u2019t talk about it \u2014 you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.(APPLAUSE)And I\u2019ll tell you what else. And I\u2019ll tell you what else I think. And that is, we have got \u2014 and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it. We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this. So you\u2019ve said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration. To fulfill that promise, you\u2019d have to release roughly half a million prisoners. How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities. On this one, Errol, actually I think you\u2019re going to see progressive and conservative support. We can do it, if we\u2019re prepared to be bold.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Let\u2019s turn to another critically important issue.Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. You say you\u2019re sick and tired of him lying about your record.What are his lies?But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried \u2014 I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil. And I have proposed that again, because that\u2019s what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. Best we can tell from the reports that are done.But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it\u2019s important to distinguish that. And, let\u2019s talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.(APPLAUSE)Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, it is not good enough. You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. That was what 9/11 was about.We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There\u2019s going to be international conflict.(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.(APPLAUSE)And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn\u2019t go far enough. You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...(APPLAUSE CHEERING)(CHEERING)We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain\u2019t going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land. That\u2019s not Secretary Clinton\u2019s position.Let us support a tax on carbon...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)And, you know, I am getting a little bit \u2014 I\u2019m getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.That\u2019s why I\u2019ve set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.(APPLAUSE)So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.(APPLAUSE)Not right now. Not on climate change. Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world. Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.(APPLAUSE)And that means \u2014 and I would ask you to respond. Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t take a back seat to your legislation that you\u2019ve introduced that you haven\u2019t been able to get passed. I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis. That\u2019s exactly what I have proposed.(CROSSTALK)But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency \u2014 urgently and boldly.What does that mean?(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed. You were his secretary of State.Aren\u2019t you also responsible for that?We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.I was very proud of that.We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.We also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.And so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn\u2019t want to have others helping to provide that security.And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.And we can\u2019t walk away from that. We need to be working with European and Arab partners...The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government. And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them(APPLAUSE)\u201cThe New York Times\u201d told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change. And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn\u2019t think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Senator sanders voted for that, and that\u2019s exactly what we did.(CROSSTALK)This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them. And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue.Go ahead, Secretary.And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners. The decision was the president\u2019s. Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did. That\u2019s what a secretary of state does.But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power. And the president made that decision. And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans\u2019 obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.Go ahead, Senator.Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.The president said no. Now, that\u2019s how it works. People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. So I think it\u2019s only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.Do you still feel that way?(APPLAUSE)So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies. You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that.(APPLAUSE)But there\u2019s a larger question here. NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history. It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face. So...And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let\u2019s not forget what\u2019s really happening. With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests. Think of how much it would cost if Russia\u2019s aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.(APPLAUSE)Senator, let\u2019s talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel. Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel\u2019s response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, \u201cdisproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life.\u201d(APPLAUSE)What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?(APPLAUSE)But \u2014 but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that. Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism. But we had in the Gaza area \u2014 not a very large area \u2014 some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think...(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel. And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn\u2019t find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.So, I don\u2019t know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself.(APPLAUSE)That does not mean \u2014 that does not mean that you don\u2019t take appropriate precautions. And, I understand that there\u2019s always second guessing anytime there is a war. It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. That\u2019s not the debate. Was their response disproportionate?I believe that it was, you have not answered that.(CHEERING)(AUDIENCE REACTION)I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s anything other than terrible. It would be great \u2014 remember, Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.Senator.(APPLAUSE)That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that\u2019s the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government. And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel\u2019s security.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue.We have to take another quick, quick break. But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York. That is coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)Senator Sanders, you\u2019re promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt. How is this fiscally responsible?For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French. My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...(APPLAUSE)... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs. Public colleges and universities tuition free? Damn right. That is exactly what we should be doing.(APPLAUSE)Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent. The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.(APPLAUSE)And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable. We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families. There\u2019s no doubt about that.But I do think when you make proposals and you\u2019re running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...(APPLAUSE)... are actually going to work. And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out \u2014 remember, he had a plan for about, I don\u2019t know, 18, 20 years. He changed in the middle of this campaign. He put out another plan. People have been analyzing the new plan. And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals. In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor. A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.The same for free college. The free college offer \u2014 you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print. You read the fine print, and here\u2019s what it says.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know? It\u2019s not some kind of communist authoritarian country. They\u2019re doing OK. They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people. We can do the same.In terms of public colleges and universities, please don\u2019t tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing. Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime? For trying to get an education.(APPLAUSE)And perhaps that\u2019s why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama\u2019s signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress. So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let\u2019s make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...But here\u2019s the real issue, because I \u2014 I\u2019ve heard this, I\u2019ve seen the reports of it. I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security. I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we\u2019ve got to help people who are not being taken care of now. And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.And it\u2019s time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...Go ahead, Senator.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)What\u2019s wrong with that?Are you prepared to support it?(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Errol \u2014 Errol Louis, go ahead.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Hold on, Errol...Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...(APPLAUSE)(BOOS)(BOOS)(BOOS)Well, let me say then...(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CHEERING)Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court. President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election. If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?(APPLAUSE)I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.And I want to say something about this since we\u2019re talking about the Supreme Court and what\u2019s at stake. We\u2019ve had eight debates before, this is our ninth. We\u2019ve not had one question about a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.(APPLAUSE)And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Now you\u2019re seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she\u2019s not even sure you are a Democrat. Are you?I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points. And you know why? Because in fact a whole lot of people \u2014 this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.(APPLAUSE)And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors. I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)I think you have to look at the facts. And, the facts are that I\u2019m putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running. It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)But, let me also say it\u2019s going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...(APPLAUSE)(CHEERING)But you know what? We\u2019re out of the Deep South now. And we\u2019re moving up. We got here. We\u2019re going to California. We got a number of large states there. And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we\u2019re going to win this nomination, and I believe we\u2019re going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.(APPLAUSE)And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.(APPLAUSE)And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter. I\u2019m not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.So I\u2019m going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. I\u2019m going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California. And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...(APPLAUSE)And people understand, you can\u2019t take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you\u2019re going to stand up to these powerful special interests. So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don\u2019t accept that.What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.(APPLAUSE)That is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help, we\u2019re going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)We took on the challenges of 9/11 together. We got the money to rebuild New York. We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.(APPLAUSE)We worked to create jobs \u2014 despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush \u2014 across New York. And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.I\u2019m asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.You know, of course we have economic barriers. I\u2019ve been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.(APPLAUSE)We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday. I\u2019ll work my heart out for you again. And together, we won\u2019t just make promises we can\u2019t keep. We\u2019ll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do together. Thank you, New York.(APPLAUSE)I want to thank the candidates for a really terrific debate. Thanks also to Dana Bash and Errol Louis, as well as NY1, the Democratic National Committee, and everyone here at the Duggal Greenhouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Stay with CNN now for complete coverage of the New York primary next Tuesday.Anderson Cooper picks up our debate coverage right now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mitsubishi Says It Cheated on Fuel Tests for 25 Years", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Mitsubishi Motors admitted on Tuesday that it had used improper methods to test the fuel economy of cars sold in Japan for 25 years, drastically widening the scope of a mileage-doctoring scandal gripping the company.The automaker said it still did not know exactly how many models had been given exaggerated fuel ratings. But it said it now believed it had been using unapproved methods since 1991 \u2014 a period that covers dozens of vehicle introductions and millions of cars and trucks.Mitsubishi gave no indication that it had cheated on tests of cars sold in other markets.\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry that customers were led to buy vehicles based on incorrect fuel-efficiency ratings,\u201d Mitsubishi\u2019s president, Tetsuro Aikawa, said at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cAll I can do is apologize.\u201dMr. Aikawa said that Mitsubishi was still investigating who ordered the cheating, and he suggested that the company may not have initially been aware that it was breaking the rules.Last week, Mr. Aikawa said Mitsubishi employees had knowingly given the microcar line an exaggerated fuel rating by manipulating test conditions. The company\u2019s share price has dropped by half since then, including a nearly 10 percent decline on Tuesday.Mr. Aikawa was repeatedly pressed on Tuesday to say how many vehicles Mitsubishi now believes were affected. He declined to do so, saying the company was still investigating. But the use of unapproved testing methods appears to have been long prevalent.\u201cWe are examining every model,\u201d he said.Mitsubishi is already a much-diminished brand, especially in its home market, where its market share has shriveled since a scandal in the 2000s. That affair also involved admissions of long-running malfeasance: Officials had been hiding reports of dangerous vehicle defects for decades.In the latest revelations, Mitsubishi says it cheated Japanese regulators and car buyers by using an unapproved method to measure the effect of deceleration during fuel-economy testing. The method, which tends to give a more flattering mileage rating, is approved in the United States but not in Japan.Different countries require different methodologies when testing the fuel economy of vehicles intended for sale in their markets. They may require tests that mimic their own particular driving conditions, for instance more highway driving in the United States, compared with more stop-and-start city driving in Japan.Mitsubishi said it had begun using the unapproved tests in 1991 and had later incorporated data based on such tests into mathematical simulations that are also used to estimate fuel economy.In 2007, Japanese regulators notified carmakers that they were adjusting their fuel-economy testing standards. Mitsubishi had new manuals printed, but its development department ignored them, the company said.In the case of the microcar line, at least, engineers appear to have actively gamed the tests. During development in 2011, Mitsubishi said, it had initially given the vehicle, the eK, a fuel efficiency rating of 26.4 kilometers per liter, or 60 miles to the gallon. But between then and the car\u2019s release in 2013, the rating \u201cwas repeatedly revised upward in internal company meetings,\u201d until it ended up with a published standard fuel economy of 29.2 kilometers per liter.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Economy, Once Europe\u2019s Leader, Now Looks Like Laggard", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 China is cutting back on mining machinery as its economy slips. The United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern countries are no longer awash in oil money, putting luxury car brands at risk. Russia, still facing Western sanctions, cannot buy as much high-tech energy equipment.The downshift in the emerging markets is leaving Germany vulnerable \u2014 and, by extension, Europe.As many businesses in the region struggled just to tread water in recent years, German companies prospered by selling the goods and technology that emerging countries needed to become more modern economies. As they did, Germany\u2019s strength served as a counterweight to the economic malaise, financial turmoil and Greek debt drama that dragged down many European countries.Now, Germany, which accounts for the largest share of the European economy, is looking like the laggard. Compared with the economies of other countries in the region, Germany\u2019s has been more deeply tethered to emerging markets. And the political climate is only adding to the uncertainty, as Germany deals with a wave of migrants and a potential exit of Britain from the European Union.Against that backdrop, the country\u2019s export engine is sputtering, while business confidence is eroding.During the good times, the German manufacturer Eickhoff Bergbautechnik sold 20 machines a year as China dug ever more coal mines to feed its energy-hungry factories. The machines, shearer loaders that use giant spinning claws to scrape coal or potash from underground seams, sell for up to 4 million euros, or about $4.6 million apiece.Last year, the company sold just eight. With profit dropping, Eickhoff laid off about 10 percent of its local work force of 300.\u201cWe are going from an unbelievable boom to a down phase,\u201d said Karl-Heinz Rieser, the managing director of Eickhoff.Less torrid sales at Eickhoff and hundreds of other midsize German exporters translate into slower overall economic growth. Suppliers of mining equipment generated exports of \u20ac6.2 billion in 2012, according to the German Engineering Federation, an industry group. Last year, those exports fell to \u20ac3.5 billion, a trend that has played out in a number of industries.The German export machine has been fueled by the growth of emerging markets. As developing countries like China now pull back, it is leaving Germany more vulnerable, and by extension Europe.As exports have slipped, the mood in Germany has turned glum.Pessimists outnumbered optimists in February for the first time since late 2014, according to the survey of business managers by the Ifo Institute in Munich, which is considered a reliable predictor of the growth. Although there was a small uptick in March, manufacturers remain wary. If confidence remains weak, they are likely to cut back plans to invest in new equipment or hire people, prompting growth to slow.A weaker German economy would have political consequences for Europe.As much as other Europeans like to bash the Germans, it is doubtful that the eurozone could have survived its recent debt crisis without Germany\u2019s checkbook. Germany contributes more than a quarter of the financing for the European Stability Mechanism, the new bailout fund used to prevent the total collapse of countries like Greece.For producers around the eurozone, German shoppers also filled the void left by struggling Spaniards, Italians and Portuguese. When auto sales entered a deep slump beginning in 2009, Germans bought not only Volkswagens and Mercedeses but also Italian Fiats and French Renaults.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest market in Europe,\u201d Thierry Koskas, the executive vice president of sales at Renault, said in an interview. \u201cDue to the weight of this market, it\u2019s big volume for us and it\u2019s important.\u201dThe changing economic picture also threatens to undercut the influence of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.The country\u2019s financial strength has made it the dominant political power. Though protesters in Greece were known to burn effigies of Ms. Merkel over her harsh austerity policies, she helped impose a measure of discipline among bickering eurozone leaders.But there has been a tonal shift in recent months.Austria and other countries have defied Ms. Merkel\u2019s wishes on how to handle the influx of refugees from Syria. While she wanted to preserve Europe\u2019s openness, her counterparts instituted border controls.\u201cGermany\u2019s political standing in Europe has declined in the last number of quarters from a position of undisputed hegemony just to one where they are the most important country,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIt has been more difficult for Berlin to herd the cats.\u201dDuring the last decade, Germany has been something of a shopping mall for developing countries. If a country was mechanizing its farms, German companies like Claas made the tractors and grain harvesters. If a country needed a factory to produce liquid oxygen or one to bottle beer, German companies like Linde or Krones could design, equip and build the whole plant.Soaring demand from China, as well as places like Russia, Brazil and Kazakhstan, made Germany nearly impervious to the woes of its neighbors. While more than one-fifth of the work force in Spain is jobless, German unemployment has fallen to only 4.3 percent, lower than that of the United States. When Eickhoff, the mining company, had to lay off workers, many of them found jobs at sister companies.China has been particularly good to German automakers, and therefore to the whole country. Autos are Germany\u2019s biggest export and one of the most important sources of jobs. China last year became the biggest market for the German sports car maker Porsche, surpassing the United States for the first time.But there are signs of trouble. Growth in the Chinese auto market is expected to be around 4 percent this year, half what it was last year. \u201cWe will continue to grow,\u201d Detlev von Platen, the head of sales for Porsche, said in an interview. \u201cBut not as quickly as before.\u201dThe Middle East is another boom market turned troubled. Civil war in Syria and plunging oil prices have hurt the confidence and buying power of countries like Kuwait.German exports to oil-producing countries fell 7 percent last year. The decline hurt sales of companies like Voith, based in Heidenheim in southern Germany, which produces motors used to pump large quantities of oil in refineries or drilling sites. \u201cCustomers in these industries are postponing or stopping investments,\u201d said Dirk B\u00f6ckenhoff, a spokesman for Voith.No matter where German executives look, they struggle to identify any region that is booming the way that China did until recently.Growth in the United States is looking mixed. Brazil is in the midst of a severe recession. And Russia has suffered from low commodity prices and political tension with the West.Iran poses an opportunity, since sanctions have been lifted and the country has been opening up. German companies are rushing to exploit the new market. The engineering and electronics giant Siemens last month signed an agreement to deliver electricity-generating equipment to Mapna, an Iranian power and transportation conglomerate.But Iran, with an economy smaller than Turkey\u2019s, is not big enough to support German growth. And German companies will probably have to adapt to a growth rate that is closer to the mediocre eurozone average of about 1 percent \u2014 making it a member of the pack rather than the leader.Mr. Rieser, the maker of coal mining equipment, says his company is reacting to the slowdown by introducing machines for different segments of the market. He does not expect to have to cut any more jobs.But he added, \u201cThere are a lot of firms that are smaller than us that have a lot more trouble.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Primary Takeaways: Trump and Clinton Wins Highlight Opponents\u2019 Limits", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byThe state was always going to be friendly turf for them: Mrs. Clinton won two Senate races in New York, and Mr. Trump\u2019s political sensibilities are acutely attuned to the state\u2019s small and dwindling Republican minority.Mrs. Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by crushing him in New York City and its suburbs, easily winning black and Hispanic voters and holding down his margins in friendlier upstate areas. Her political coalition simply looks more like the national Democratic base than his does. In a big state like New York that is more closely reflective of national demographics, that is a decisive advantage.Even in upstate cities where Mr. Sanders might have been a more natural fit, like Syracuse and Buffalo, Mrs. Clinton won or fought him to an effective tie.Mr. Sanders managed to hold on to the slice of voters who agree most strongly with his message of economic populism. Exit polls show that he won by double digits among voters who said Wall Street mainly hurts the economy and among those who want the next president to be more liberal than Mr. Obama, and that he won by a narrower margin with those who said foreign trade destroys jobs.But in as urban and diverse a state as New York, that assemblage of voters goes only so far. Mr. Sanders got wiped out on issues of sharper local resonance: Mrs. Clinton made her more liberal record on gun control a major campaign theme and beat him on the issue by 22 percentage points.He needed a big win to reverse nearly a month of setbacks in the delegate race and to quiet stories about disorder in his campaign. And New York delivered: Mr. Trump captured the state by his largest victory margin of the campaign and left Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his closest rival in the delegate race, in a distant third place.If Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents hoped for even scattered signs of voters recoiling from his candidacy, there were none to be seen. He won voters of every age, race and income level, and he prevailed with two groups \u2014 college-educated voters and women \u2014 who have often rejected him. That adds up to a considerable show of strength for a candidate who still faces a narrow path to clinching the Republican nomination, even after a sweep or near sweep of his home state\u2019s 95 delegates.Mr. Kasich, always the softest-edged candidate in the race, has positioned himself in increasingly explicit terms as the standard-bearer for Republican moderates. That is a diminishing group, but it was enough to win him the only county in the state that Mr. Trump lost, and it could help him collect delegates in the blue-state primaries on April 26.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Smaller Cities Struggle to Cultivate an Interest in Classical Music", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 After more than a decade as the world\u2019s great hope for classical music, China is suffering growing pains.But stubborn roadblocks have drawn the concern of many in the field. Observers point to weak management at performing arts institutions and insufficient efforts to educate audiences, who then prove indifferent to adventurous fare.According to Long Yu, whose posts include artistic director and chief conductor of the China Philharmonic Orchestra and music director of the Shanghai Symphony, \u201cThe question for China now is, how do we cultivate passion for music, and not just stars?\u201dThe biggest hurdle appears to be institutional.It is true that China\u2019s major cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, are hives of classical activity. In the early 1990s, Beijing had only a few dedicated concert halls and concerts a year. Now, residents of the capital and of Shanghai can choose from hundreds of classical music performances annually.At the same time, many second- and third-tier cities, like Wuhan and Xi\u2019an, are struggling to fill their gleaming new theaters and concert halls with quality musicians and audiences. Most of these cities lack regular concert seasons and the funding to bring in distinguished foreign orchestras. In some, once-grand halls are falling apart because of poor upkeep.\u201cThe orchestras in these second-tier cities are very thirsty and looking for help,\u201d said Cai Jindong, a professor at Stanford and a frequent guest conductor in China. \u201cThey need soft-skills development, from the very top leadership down to the musicians, the maintenance of the concert hall, education, everything.\u201dIn many places, a lack of quality programming has led to weak ticket sales, a situation that some managers say has worsened because of the slowing Chinese economy. And the culture of philanthropy in China is relatively undeveloped, with few tax incentives to encourage individuals to support performing arts institutions.Throughout the country, the arts are still largely seen as \u201ca part of the revolutionary machine \u2014 the government runs the machine and the people passively receive,\u201d Mr. Ren said, drawing a contrast to Europe, where he said many governments aim to help, rather than control, the development of culture.Then there is the issue of Chinese concertgoers\u2019 appetite for music outside the mainstream.\u201cAt the time, people said it\u2019s too long, no one will buy tickets,\u201d said Mr. Wu. \u201cSo we played Bruckner\u2019s Overture in G minor, which is very short, and then we played Strauss, of course, because back then the \u2018Blue Danube\u2019 waltz was what Chinese thought of as classical music.\u201dProgram managers say there is now a demand to hear not only Brahms and Beethoven but also Bruckner, Mahler, even Prokofiev. But all of those composers are considered part of the standard canon by European and American standards and not adventurous.Many halls are struggling just to get the attention of a public increasingly drawn into the orbit of films and online television.As a result, educational programs at leading halls are often designed to cultivate an appreciation for the performing arts in general, not just Western classical music.Mr. Long, the conductor, said, \u201cMusic education needs to be more complex.\u201dStill, more halls are beginning to offer discounted student tickets and annual memberships.\u201cSince our main target audience is the middle class, we try to price a bulk of our tickets to be competitive with the cost of a movie ticket,\u201d Mr. Lin said.Many observers say that perhaps the biggest challenge for concert halls in China is finding strong managers who have both the musical knowledge and the patience to persuade local governments that supporting culture is about more than just building the halls.\u201cChina is so big and we have so many grand theaters and opera houses, but if you asked me to give you the names of five general managers who are running their halls professionally, I wouldn\u2019t be able to,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Even some managers who are succeeding acknowledge they faced a steep learning curve.Before joining the National Center for the Performing Arts in 2008, the year after it opened, Mr. Ren said, he had \u201cno idea about classical music.\u201d\u201cWe were learning about programing at that time and wondering, who is Mahler?\u201d he said. \u201cBut our knowledge of the music and of the music fans has increased over the last seven years.\u201dThat willingness to learn is especially important at places like the National Center, which depend on ticket sales for at least 50 percent of their revenues (compared with about 30 to 40 percent for many top American orchestras).\u201cBut once you get the general managers in the halls, China will take off,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Such optimism remains widespread.Tens of millions of young Chinese are studying instruments, believed to be one of the top drivers of audience growth. At the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, for example, over half the patrons for classical music are under 40, according to Mr. Lin, the general manager.Audiences now, he said, \u201chave really come to grips with the music and want to understand and engage with it in a real way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As people (including writers) live longer thanks to medical advances, we can expect many more books contemplating the vicissitudes of aging, illness and dying. These topics, previously thought uncommercial, not to mention unsexy, have been eloquently explored recently by Diana Athill (\u201cSomewhere Towards the End\u201d), Roger Angell (\u201cThis Old Man\u201d) and Christopher Hitchens (\u201cMortality\u201d), among others. Now that the baby boom generation, defined as those born between 1946 and 1964, \u201center life\u2019s last chapter,\u201d Michael Kinsley writes, \u201cthere is going to be a tsunami of books about health issues by every boomer journalist who has any, which ultimately will be all of them.\u201d Hoping to scoop the others, he has written \u201cOld Age,\u201d a short, witty \u201cbeginner\u2019s guide,\u201d with an appropriate blend of sincerity and opportunism.Kinsley is a well-known columnist for Vanity Fair; contributor to The New Yorker; former editor of The New Republic, Harper\u2019s and other periodicals; founder of Slate; and frequently seen liberal commentator on television. His distinguished career had been turning him into something of a public pundit when, in 1993, at the age of 43, he learned he had Parkinson\u2019s disease. For eight years he tried to keep his condition secret, understandably. \u201cAnyone who develops a chronic disease in midcareer dreads being written off \u2014 being thought of prematurely in the past tense.\u201d Despite the commiseration of co-workers, a yuppie may find that \u201cguess what? You\u2019ve had your last promotion.\u201d Though Kinsley mastered denial (a practice he advocates slyly) and bluffed good health, eventually his physical symptoms became too obvious and he outed himself with a column in Time. After going public, he found himself the object of intense scrutiny and unwanted sympathy. \u201cThere are people who now only see the Parkinson\u2019s \u2014 like the woman at a dinner party who offered to cut my meat into pieces for me even though she had just seen me wolfing a first course with no trouble.\u201dStill, the book refuses to wallow in self-pity or offer triumphalist narratives of overcoming victimhood. Rather, Kinsley is intent on being wryly realistic about coping with illness and the terminal prospects ahead. He makes fun of a fellow boomer, Larry Ellison, the C.E.O. of Oracle, who has spent millions in a quest for eternal life, and who was quoted as saying, \u201cDeath has never made any sense to me.\u201d Kinsley quips: \u201cActually the question is not whether death makes sense to Larry Ellison but whether Larry Ellison makes sense to death. And I\u2019m afraid he does.\u201dHe is equally sardonic on the prospect of losing one\u2019s marbles. \u201cOf the 79 million boomers, 28 million are expected to develop Alzheimer\u2019s or some other form of dementia. .\u2008.\u2008. That adds up to about 35 percent, or one out of three.\u201d Lest the vain ones think they can better their odds by living right, he adds: \u201cThey are jogging every day but will get Alzheimer\u2019s anyway.\u201d Once he learns that Parkinson\u2019s, thought simply as a \u201cmovement disorder\u201d that makes parts of the body shake or stiffen, can also adversely affect intellectual capacity, he keeps a close watch on his thinking. There follows a hilarious section in which he submits to a round of cognitive assessment tests, cheating a bit but still dismayed to find that some of his scores have decreased. \u201cDepending on the condition of my brain, should I be looking for a good nursing home? Or should I try to find a worthwhile but relaxing job teaching journalism somewhere?\u201d He tells himself one \u201ccan write perfectly pleasant editorials about the coming of spring.\u201d Fortunately, the old Kinsley intelligence remains much in evidence here.\u201cThe book is supposed to be funny, as well, on a subject that does not lend itself to humor.\u201d And funny it is, for the most part. Drawing on his extensive experience as a columnist \u201cwhose lifetime output mainly has been a thousand words or so a week commenting on current affairs,\u201d he \u00adcatches our attention quickly, sets up questions that need answering and writes in a clear, conversational, short-sentence manner, addressing the reader with rhythmic little pokes, prods, provocations. His transitions mock tendencies to self-absorption or senior-moment forgetfulness. (\u201cWhere were we? Oh yes, I decided to have myself tested.\u201d) He makes fun of his own arrogant self-certainty: \u201cI am perfectly willing to believe, on almost any subject, that I\u2019m right and a majority of other people are wrong. That\u2019s more or less been the basis of my career in journalism.\u201d This jaunty style comes off at times as a little too jokey and glib; but it must be said that he\u2019s so good at glibness, he can be forgiven for it. He can move from the anecdotal to the statistical to the aphoristic without any tonal dissonance.Regardless of his assertion that \u201cthis is not a book about Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d that condition remains a central preoccupation in the text, the other one being the hopes and worries of the boomer generation. Curiously, what the book is not about, despite its title, is old age. Kinsley, still only in his 60s, has not yet entered the kingdom of the elderly, though he may feel he has been given a precocious peek at it. As kidney stones were for Montaigne a teacher of wisdom and equanimity, so Parkinson\u2019s has been for this author.He almost ruins it all with a conclusion recommending that the boomers redeem themselves with a final sacrifice \u2014 wiping out the nation\u2019s debt. By having the money they leave behind sufficiently taxed when they die, he argues, they could leave a legacy that parallels the Greatest Generation\u2019s achievement in World War II. \u201cBoomers, those lazy, self-indulgent bums, those drugged-out draft dodgers, those mincing flower-power hippies who morphed into Wall Street greedheads with nothing left of their culture of peace and love except a paisley tie: We may not have the opportunity to save the world like our predecessors did, but we can save the American economy from the mess our predecessors are leaving.\u201d Backtracking a bit from this cockamamie scheme, he nevertheless takes it seriously enough to devote the whole last chapter to it. The real mistake, economic realities aside, is to have abandoned the more charmingly intimate, skeptical persona he had so meticulously built up beforehand, trading it in for a pundit\u2019s robes.Some of this book\u2019s chapters were published as separate essays in The New Yorker and The Atlantic, and either because of inattentive editing or unavoidable transitional needs, the same information is reintroduced several times \u2014 a nuisance in so small a volume but not a great crime. The book is attractively designed and just the right size \u2014 4\u215d by 6\u215e \u2014 to slip into one\u2019s pocket or purse. In short, it\u2019s been packaged as a nifty impulse purchase. One could do worse than give in to the impulse. If it\u2019s possible for a book about illness and death to be delightful, this one fills the bill.Phillip Lopate, the author of \u201cPortrait Inside My Head,\u201d directs the graduate nonfiction program at Columbia University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bernie Sanders Heads to Vatican, a Visit With Pope Francis Seems in Doubt", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byOn the campaign trail and in Congress, Senator Bernie Sanders has frequently invoked Pope Francis, quoting his writings about the \u201cidolatry of money,\u201d sending solicitations for donations headlined \u201cWhy we must listen to Pope Francis\u201d and praising the pope as a \u201cradical\u201d for \u201cspeaking out with courage and brilliance about some of the most important issues facing our world.\u201dSomeone was listening. On Friday, Mr. Sanders was scheduled to fly to Rome to address the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, in effect the Vatican\u2019s in-house think tank on social, economic and environmental issues.\u201cWe invited the candidate who cites the pope the most in his campaign, and that is Senator Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Bishop Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, the academy\u2019s chancellor.Monsignor S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, an Argentine who is close to the pope, said that Mr. Sanders\u2019s focus on climate change and his attention to poor people on the margins of society were \u201cvery analogous to that of the pope.\u201d He said that made the Vermont senator an obvious person to invite to Friday\u2019s conference, which celebrates the 25th anniversary of an encyclical by Pope John Paul II about the potential pitfalls of the market economy after the fall of the Berlin Wall.But the issues of globalization at the heart of the conference have been eclipsed by questions over whether Mr. Sanders fished for an invitation to the Vatican to help his presidential campaign and whether he would get a coveted meeting with the pope.As recently as Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said he was hoping to see Pope Francis. Though the possibility of that meeting was always a stretch, the Vatican seemingly put the matter to bed on Thursday.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a meeting with the Holy Father,\u201d a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said. The pope, who is leaving for Greece some time after Mr. Sanders\u2019s arrival, would not be meeting with any participants of the conference, Father Lombardi said.But that was not the final word for Monsignor S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, who has a reputation among some in the Vatican for attracting attention to his conferences with star-studded names. (Last year the academy screened a movie directed by Angelina Jolie, who did receive an audience with the pope.) He dismissed the Vatican statement on a potential papal audience as \u201call the Roman gossip\u201d and suggested Mr. Sanders could bump into the pope at the Vatican dormitory where he keeps his apartments.Almost since the moment that Mr. Sanders announced last week that he was \u201cdelighted to have been invited\u201d to what his campaign called a \u201chigh-level meeting\u201d at the Vatican, the visit has prompted typical Vatican politicking. That day, a Bloomberg News article quoted the academy\u2019s president, Margaret Archer, a laywoman professor, as saying that Mr. Sanders had asked for the invitation. \u201cSanders made the first move,\u201d she said. Monsignor Sanchez Sorondo called Ms. Archer\u2019s remarks \u201ca little strange\u201d and insisted he alone had the idea to invite Mr. Sanders.A visit to the Vatican is not, senior church officials pointed out, the same thing as receiving an audience from the pope. And while Mr. Sanders has not claimed that a papal reception was in the works, his campaign has made much of the Roman detour from the New York campaign trail.\u201cJust like they welcomed de Blasio, the mayor of New York, to their meeting once,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not mean de Blasio came to see the pope. He came to an event of the academy.\u201dReached in Vienna, where he was en route to the Vatican conference, Mr. Sachs, who is a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Sanders, said he was involved in the invitation, but only as a messenger. The Vatican, he said, \u201creached out to me to ask me how they could reach him. And I said I was happy to forward the invitation to him. Which I did.\u201dHe noted that the conference would be opened by Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga of Honduras, the pope\u2019s right-hand man, and that it also marked the 125th anniversary of an encyclical by Pope Leo XIII on capital and labor.\u201cThe takeaway for 125 years now is the church favors a market economy but one that operates within moral standards,\u201d he said.Pope John Paul II, a critical figure in the opening up of Eastern Europe, warned in 1991 of the eroding of worker rights, the rising inequality of income, and the ecological disasters that could result from a purely profit-driven economy.The senator, Mr. Sachs noted, \u201chas been saying these things for a long time. He has been distributing papal encyclicals for a long time going back to the time that he was mayor of Burlington.\u201dDecades later, Mr. Sanders is hoping to cement that common bond on economic issues with an embrace, however unlikely, from an unpredictable pope.\u201cIt\u2019s something that happens or doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Sachs said. \u201cOne never knows until the day of the event.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wall Street Primary", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byIT\u2019S not a great election year for the voters of Wall Street. The problem goes beyond the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders, who can\u2019t seem to go five minutes without labeling big banks Enemy No. 1.\u201cThe consensus, absolutely, is that the choices couldn\u2019t be worse,\u201d said William D. Cohan, a business writer and former Wall Street banker. \u201cThis has become the nightmare scenario for people on Wall Street.\u201dIn conversations with people who work on Wall Street \u2014 almost all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely about their industry \u2014 a theme emerged: There is a lot of confusion about what\u2019s happening, and no clear favored candidate.One senior executive at a Wall Street bank said he would most likely vote for Hillary Clinton in the primary, but was still undecided. The executive said that in election-year conversations with colleagues, around the water cooler or over cocktails, there usually arises a clear favorite. In 2012, that favorite was Mitt Romney by a mile. This year: \u201cIt\u2019s as mixed and confused as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201dAll of the Wall Street employees I interviewed took issue with Mr. Sanders\u2019s view of their industry, but they also confirmed his view that, yes, people who work in the financial sector tend to like Mrs. Clinton.\u201cBernie has forced Hillary to run a certain way that she probably would prefer not to, and it\u2019s a race to the bottom. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d said another senior Wall Street executive, a political independent who plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton in the fall. \u201cThe thing you continually hear is, there\u2019s no way Trump can be president, and there\u2019s no way Sanders can be president.\u201dSince the 2008 economic recession, the financial sector has attracted plenty of righteous scorn. Mr. Sanders has harnessed that disgust and resentment to great effect. The Occupy Wall Street movement has played a large role in making Mr. Sanders\u2019s message more broadly acceptable. Marina Sitrin, one of the early organizers of the movement, said it had \u201cnormalized looking at the roots of the problem rather seeing them as individual.\u201dStill, Democrats who work in finance have been frustrated by Mr. Sanders\u2019s broad anti-Wall Street rhetoric. The people I spoke to noted that the \u201cWall Street\u201d Mr. Sanders rails against isn\u2019t just made up of plutocratic hedge-fund types and predatory lenders, but money managers trying to help middle-class workers retire comfortably, and bankers trying to help small-business owners get a loan.Whatever happens today in New York, it does seem as though voters\u2019 trust in large institutions on Wall Street \u2014 along with the news media, Congress and political parties writ large \u2014 has eroded to the point of invisibility.In a recent fund-raising email, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign achieved a trifecta, criticizing all three industries in the same sentence.\u201cRight now, in lower Manhattan, the Wall Street bankers, corporate media types, and Democratic party establishment figures are hoping you\u2019ll sit this fight out,\u201d the email read.Still, at the very least, Wall Street executives and Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters can agree on one thing: their utter disgust with the idea of a Trump presidency.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In an Age of Privilege, Not Everyone Is in the Same Boat", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "The Velvet Rope EconomyCompanies are becoming adept at identifying wealthy customers and marketing to them, creating a money-based caste system.Supported byMIAMI \u2014 Behind a locked door aboard Norwegian Cruise Line\u2019s newest ship is a world most of the vessel\u2019s 4,200 passengers will never see. And that is exactly the point.In the Haven, as this ship within a ship is called, about 275 elite guests enjoy not only a concierge and 24-hour butler service, but also a private pool, sun deck and restaurant, creating an oasis free from the crowds elsewhere on the Norwegian Escape.If Haven passengers venture out of their aerie to see a show, a flash of their gold key card gets them the best seats in the house. When the ship returns to port, they disembark before everyone else.\u201cIt was always the intention to make the Haven somewhat obscure so it wasn\u2019t in the face of the masses,\u201d said Kevin Sheehan, Norwegian\u2019s former chief executive, who helped design the Escape with the hope of attracting a richer clientele. \u201cThat segment of the population wants to be surrounded by people with similar characteristics.\u201dWith disparities in wealth greater than at any time since the Gilded Age, the gap is widening between the highly affluent \u2014 who find themselves behind the velvet ropes of today\u2019s economy \u2014 and everyone else.It represents a degree of economic and social stratification unseen in America since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, J. P. Morgan and the rigidly separated classes on the Titanic a century ago.What is different today, though, is that companies have become much more adept at identifying their top customers and knowing which psychological buttons to push. The goal is to create extravagance and exclusivity for the select few, even if it stirs up resentment elsewhere. In fact, research has shown, a little envy can be good for the bottom line.When top-dollar travelers switch planes in Atlanta, New York and other cities, Delta ferries them between terminals in a Porsche, what the airline calls a \u201csurprise-and-delight service.\u201d Last month, Walt Disney World began offering after-hours access to visitors who want to avoid the crowds. In other words, you basically get the Magic Kingdom to yourself.When Royal Caribbean ships call at Labadee, the cruise line\u2019s private resort in Haiti, elite guests get their own special beach club away from fellow travelers \u2014 an enclave within an enclave.\u201cWe are living much more cloistered lives in terms of class,\u201d said Thomas Sander, who directs a project on civic engagement at the Kennedy School at Harvard. \u201cWe are doing a much worse job of living out the egalitarian dream that has been our hallmark.\u201dEmmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, estimates that the top 1 percent of American households now controls 42 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth, up from less than 30 percent two decades ago. The top 0.1 percent accounts for 22 percent, nearly double the 1995 proportion.But even as income inequality and the wealth gap stoke the discontent that has emerged as a powerful force in this year\u2019s presidential election, for American business it represents something else entirely. From cruise ship operators and casinos to amusement parks and airlines, the rise of the 1 percent spells opportunity and profit.Today, ever greater resources are being invested in winning market share at the very top of the pyramid, sometimes at the cost of diminished service for the rest of the public. While middle-class incomes are stagnating, the period since the end of the Great Recession has been a boom time for the very rich and the businesses that cater to them.From 2010 to 2014, the number of American households with at least $1 million in financial assets jumped by nearly one-third, to just under seven million, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group. For the $1 million-plus cohort, estimated wealth grew by 7.2 percent annually from 2010 to 2014, eight times the pace of gains for families with less than $1 million.\u201cYou go where the money is,\u201d said Steven Fazzari, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cThis is where companies are innovating and where there is demand.\u201dIn many ways, the rise of the velvet rope reverses the great democratization of travel and leisure, and other elements of American life, in the post-World War II era. As the Jet Set gave way to budget airlines, in places like airports and theme parks even the wealthiest often rubbed shoulders with hoi polloi.These days, whether the provider is a private company or a public agency, special treatment for the very rich isn\u2019t personal, it\u2019s business. Late last year, public officials in Los Angeles agreed to lease a separate facility at LAX to a private firm that would serve celebrities or anyone else willing to pay $1,800 to skip the traffic jams and lines at the main terminals.Of course, it could be more extreme, and in the past it was.The Titanic, in the early 20th century, separated the different classes of travelers with metal gates. In the 19th century, French railways refrained from putting roofs on third-class wagons so that passengers who could afford more expensive second-class seats would not hesitate to spend a few extra francs.What is new is just how far big American companies are now willing to go to pamper the biggest spenders.For example, as luggage-toting guests boarded Norwegian\u2019s Breakaway ship in New York recently, cramming into a handful of elevators, there was ample room in one bank. But it was off-limits to anyone but Haven guests going to the top decks. Not far away, in the ship\u2019s theater, red velvet ropes cordoned off a section up front for Haven passengers.At SeaWorld, a family of four can jump to the front of the line and score the best seats for rides and shows for an extra $80, in addition to the basic $320 admission. For people in the market for something more exclusive, there is Discovery Cove, next door to SeaWorld\u2019s traditional park in Orlando.Forget merely swimming with the dolphins. Today, parents can relax at a cabana and beach of their own, while their budding marine biologists spend the day with a trainer, feed the park\u2019s birds, otters, nurse sharks and other creatures and, of course, frolic with the dolphins as well.There are no lines to cut here: Daily attendance is capped at 1,300. A day at Discovery Cove can easily cost $1,000 for a family of four.Next year, Crystal Cruises will begin an airborne version of one of its luxury ships: a customized Boeing 777 that ferries passengers on 14- or 28-day trips around the world.In theory, according to Steve Tadelis, a professor of economics at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley, \u201cwhen an industry is able to create a richer line of products for people looking to spend their money, that makes everybody happier. But getting it right in reality is very, very hard.\u201dAs companies separate their clientele, a debate has developed over just how obvious the distinctions should be. Some experts, like David Clarke, who works with leisure industry giants as a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers, say that it is best to be open about what amounts to a money-based caste system.\u201cIt\u2019s about transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat customers hate is when you\u2019re trying to hide stuff and are not being honest with them.\u201dMany companies, though, have discovered that offering ordinary customers just a whiff of the rarefied air can actually enhance the bottom line, even if it stirs a certain amount of envy and resentment.As coach passengers pile into giant 747s and A380s, for example, \u201ca glimpse of a shower or private suite creates a marker in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Alex Dichter, a director at McKinsey who works with major airlines. \u201cA lot of brands use products like these as an aspirational tool, and class segregation can create something to which people can aspire.\u201dWhile choices for the rich are expanding, poorer Americans are benefiting less from product innovation, according to new research by Xavier Jaravel, a graduate student in economics at Harvard. Whether they are selling fancy cookware, natural cheeses or single malt Scotch, purveyors of goods aimed at the wealthy are competing more and offering new products. Downscale items like canned meat or tobacco aren\u2019t drawing as many new entrants into the market.There is also increasing demand from the most affluent shoppers. Spending by the top 5 percent of earners rose nearly 35 percent from 2003 to 2012 after adjusting for inflation, according to a study by Mr. Fazzari and Barry Z. Cynamon of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. For everyone else, spending grew less than 10 percent.And with the rise of the Internet and big data, companies can pinpoint and favor these wealthiest customers in ways unimaginable even a decade ago. \u201cAt the high end, we can get into real psychographics and know who spends more time at the concierge or goes skiing in February,\u201d said Bjorn Hanson, who teaches courses on tourism and hospitality management at New York University.For companies trying to entice moneyed customers, that means identifying and anticipating what they want. \u201cThe premium customer doesn\u2019t want to be asked questions,\u201d said Mr. Clarke of PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cThey don\u2019t want friction. They want things to happen through osmosis.\u201dBut for people at the lower end of the market, as well as in the middle, plenty of friction remains. The trade-off is that the amount of hassle is precisely calibrated to just how much you are willing to pay.\u201cAt the low end, people\u2019s expectations have fundamentally changed,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a fraction of the cost, people say, \u2018I\u2019m willing to take some discomfort because my wallet is staying full.\u2019\u201dExecutives describe the virtues of elite segmentation with a directness that might well serve as fodder for supporters of Occupy Wall Street or Senator Bernie Sanders. At its debut in 2006, the Haven was swamped by tourists from regular quarters who paid $200 to upgrade to one of its 40 or so rooms, Mr. Sheehan recalled.So he ordered an immediate halt to the upgrades, which undercut profit margins and undermined the Haven\u2019s main selling point, exclusivity.\u201cWe needed to fill the Haven by getting the right people on the ship,\u201d said Mr. Sheehan, who stepped down as chief executive last year. \u201cWhen the masses overwhelmed the group in the Haven, they didn\u2019t have the experience they were looking for.\u201dMr. Sheehan\u2019s focus on wealthier travelers proved prescient. Norwegian\u2019s stock has surged. And as the company designed new vessels in recent years, the Haven became more defined \u2014 with its own pool, lounge, bar and restaurant \u2014 and more isolated from the rest of the ship.With the launch of the 4,100-passenger Epic in 2010, \u201ca guest could enter the key card for access, and never leave,\u201d said Andy Stuart, Norwegian\u2019s president.And by last year, when the even newer Escape sailed on its maiden voyage, the Haven\u2019s 95 staterooms were located so high up in the forward part of the ship that even guests in comparatively expensive staterooms might remain unaware of its existence. Depending on the season, a room in the Haven might cost a couple $10,000 for a weeklong cruise vs. $3,000 for an ordinary stateroom elsewhere on the ship.While the Haven is hidden, or at least camouflaged, on Norwegian\u2019s cruise ships, its archrival Royal Caribbean, by contrast, makes no secret of what is available to passengers who pay the most. Its Royal Suite class isn\u2019t a ship within a ship, but it serves much the same function with one significant difference: Regular passengers can push their noses up against the glass, literally.On Royal Caribbean\u2019s new ship Anthem, diners must first walk past the frosted glass windows of Coastal Kitchen, reserved for suite occupants, before they can crowd around the buffet tables of the open-to-everyone Windjammer Caf\u00e9.There are no chafing dishes in sight at the Coastal Kitchen, where the order of the day is white table cloths and sit-down service. The atmosphere is as calm and leisurely as Windjammer is hectic, although suite guests are free to dine at the latter if they like.Royal Caribbean\u2019s business approach contrasts strikingly with Norwegian\u2019s.While Norwegian executives decided to mostly hide the Haven from view, Royal Caribbean went with transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s the American way,\u201d said Michael Bayley, president of Royal Caribbean. \u201cI think society is prepared to accept that if you pay more for certain elements, then you deserve them.\u201dMr. Bayley and Royal Caribbean\u2019s chairman, Richard Fain, say they ultimately decided against the ship-within-a-ship concept after studying the Haven.\u201cThat\u2019s not the mojo or the culture of Royal Caribbean,\u201d Mr. Bayley said. \u201cThe idea of segregating people into a class system is un-American. But if you live on Central Park, you are going to pay more. That\u2019s how the system works.\u201dAs has been the case elsewhere in the leisure industry in recent years, Royal Caribbean has become more comfortable with heightening the contrast between the treatment meted out to ordinary passengers and the level of service reserved for the top tier. Royal Caribbean has always considered the psychology of its guests when it designs new ships or introduces new amenities, said Adam Goldstein, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, but there has been a shift in passenger expectations in recent years.\u201cFor a long time there was an acceptance that outside the door of your room, you were on an equal footing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t attempt to have any differentiation in how services were delivered.\u201dSince the late 1990s, however, \u201cthere has been a huge evolution, maybe a revolution in attitudes,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. In addition to larger rooms or softer sheets, big spenders want to be coddled nowadays. \u201cThey are looking for constant validation that they are a higher-value customer,\u201d he said. For example, room service requests from Royal Suite occupants are automatically routed to a number different from the one used by regular passengers, who get slower, less personalized service.With a week in a top Royal Suite costing upward of $30,000, compared with $4,000 for an ordinary cabin, the focus is on \u201cvery affluent travelers, and we have no trouble filling these rooms,\u201d Mr. Bayley said.In May, the company will roll out its Royal Genie program \u2014 essentially a personal servant for the highest spenders on board. Royal Genies will research their guests\u2019 preferences even before they come aboard and come up with surprises like in-room drinks with their favorite vodka or Scotch.Even though this kind of pampering might be good for business, and delight those on the right side of the velvet rope, the gap between the privileged and the rest may ultimately leave everyone feeling uneasy, said Barry J. Nalebuff, a professor of management at Yale.\u201cIf I\u2019m in the back of the plane, I want to hiss at the people in first class,\u201d said Mr. Nalebuff, who has advised many Fortune 100 companies. \u201cIf I\u2019m up front, I cringe as people walk by.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs and Trade on the Campaign Trail", "Date": "2016-04-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis much is clear: While trade with other countries benefits the economy over all, it creates winners and losers. In recent decades, the winners have included consumers who are able to buy cheaper clothes, electronics and other imported goods, and companies like Boeing and General Electric that have been able to sell more of their products overseas.The losers have primarily been businesses and workers who face greater competition from foreign factories that can produce similar goods at lower prices. Economists and political leaders have long argued that if the winners compensate the losers, everybody should be better off. But in practice, American policy has allowed the winners to keep most of the spoils of trade and has given the losers crumbs. This has exacerbated income inequality by raising the profits of big corporations and the salaries of executives and other white-collar professionals while leaving blue-collar and lower-skilled workers poorer, as Mr. Sanders has correctly pointed out.Here is what will not work: imposing huge tariffs on imports and tearing up trade agreements, as some presidential candidates have called for.But the truth is, even if all trade agreements contained these and other strong provisions, some American workers would lose jobs to foreign competition. For one thing, the United States does not have trade agreements with many countries, including China, India and Brazil. And all competition among businesses, whether domestic or international, is bound to result in success for some companies and failure for others.It is impossible for the United States to seal its economy from the rest of the world; nor should it want to. But elected leaders can make sure that the competition among countries is fair and enact policies that mitigate inequality while giving workers who are hurt by trade the help they need.Advertisement"}

Yatsenyuk, the prime minister of Ukraine, announced his resignation on Sunday in a surprise move that opened a new period of political uncertainty here.Mr. Yatsenyuk, an economist backed by Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, including the United States, came to power two years ago behind the wave of popular anger that culminated with the Maidan street protests, which led to the downfall of President Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Yatsenyuk and Petro O. Poroshenko, who became president, emerged as the nation\u2019s most prominent political figures.But the revolution\u2019s leaders soon turned on each other. Although authority is supposed to be balanced evenly between the president and the prime minister, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies eventually sided with Mr. Poroshenko and pushed Mr. Yatsenyuk to step aside.In recent months, both men had been resisting compromises on appointments and were reportedly thwarting corruption investigations into allies, threatening Western aid.In a video released to television stations on Sunday, Mr. Yatsenyuk signaled that he would try to smooth over the cracks in the post-Maidan alliance. He said he would support as a candidate for prime minister Volodymyr B. Groysman, a member of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s political party and the current speaker of the Parliament, and would keep his party in the coalition after leaving office.\u201cWe cannot allow destabilization of the executive branch during a war,\u201d he said. \u201cThe desire to change one person has blinded politicians and paralyzed their will to bring about real changes in the country.\u201dSlender, cerebral and nicknamed \u201cThe Rabbit,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk had become emblematic of Ukraine\u2019s impasse after the heady days of the pro-European street movement.He emerged as a popular figure, but his support largely evaporated because of various scandals and missteps. A political ally, for example, was forced to resign from Parliament after it emerged that he was under investigation for money laundering in Switzerland.Mr. Yatsenyuk confronted tremendous challenges as prime minister, not least because of the Russian annexation of Crimea and military intervention in the east during his tenure. Ukraine\u2019s morass of financial problems required a $40 billion international bailout package.In tackling them, he faced deep suspicions from the public, and from political opponents and allies alike, that he had fallen back on traditions of negotiating back-room deals with Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet business elite, the oligarchs.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t abandon the former practice of consulting the oligarchs before making decisions,\u201d Yuri V. Lutsenko, the head of the president\u2019s faction in Parliament, said in a telephone interview on Sunday.Mr. Poroshenko, a chocolate and confectionary magnate whose offshore accounts surfaced in the leak of legal documents known as the Panama Papers, has also faced criticism of mixing business and politics, a longtime bane of Ukraine.Before Mr. Yatsenyuk\u2019s appointment as prime minister in 2014, a leaked recording of a telephone conversation between Victoria J. Nuland, a United States assistant secretary of state, and the American ambassador in Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, seemed to underscore the West\u2019s support for his candidacy. \u201cYats is the guy,\u201d Ms. Nuland had said.Five ministers will also resign in a cabinet shuffle, but the governing, pro-Western parties resisted calls for new elections that polls indicate could usher in pro-Russian politicians in eastern Ukraine.\u201cObjectively, it is ridiculous to claim responsibility remains only with Yatsenyuk for the bad state of the economy and ongoing corruption,\u201d Oleh Voloshyn, a consultant for the Opposition Bloc political party, which represents Russian speakers in Ukraine\u2019s southeast, said in an interview. \u201cThe best solution is the cleansing process of an election. Let the people decide.\u201dIn this reshuffle of the post-revolution leadership, the powerful position of prosecutor general remains unfilled.Mr. Lutsenko, who formerly held the top law enforcement position in Ukraine as minister of interior, before being sentenced to prison on political charges after a previous change of government here in 2010, confirmed that he had discussed with the president taking the post.Having been a police officer and a prisoner, Mr. Lutsenko said, qualified him to oversee prosecutions. \u201cI saw both sides of the coin,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Olympus Investigation Shows Ethical Lapses and a Caterer With Clout", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Managers at an Olympus factory in southern China struggled for years to resolve a thorny dispute with local customs authorities. The problem risked incurring millions of dollars in fines and harming a crucial manufacturing hub that churned out 50 million camera lenses a year.Then Olympus found an unlikely helper: an obscure Chinese company that ran the factory\u2019s cafeteria.The caterer had connections. In 2013, Olympus hired the company, Anyuan, to be a fixer, acting as a go-between with government officials in the customs case, according to an internal investigation into the matter. Soon after, the eight-year-old case was inexplicably dropped, and with it demands that Olympus pay at least $9 million in penalties and uncollected import duties.The activities in China, laid bare in a confidential 57-page report on the investigation, as well as internal memos and emails that were reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of ethical lapses and a corporate culture undermined by weak oversight. The documents said there was a nearly $700 million bookkeeping discrepancy, dubious real estate deals, \u201ctop secret\u201d emails and a hidden \u201cslush fund.\u201d While Olympus found no legal violations in its investigation, the previously unreported documents detailed \u201csloppy due diligence,\u201d \u201cmajor problems\u201d with corporate controls and instances where Olympus managers \u201cconcealed\u201d payments to Anyuan.That pledge makes the company\u2019s activities in China all the more glaring, since they did not involve the old guard. They were approved by its new leadership, including the president and the chairman. Senior executives signed off on millions of dollars in payments to the Chinese company, according to the internal investigation.And they did so despite the knowledge that Anyuan\u2019s chairman was linked to prominent bribery cases that were reported by China\u2019s state-run media. Some Olympus executives, the report said, understood that Chinese fixers \u201ccould commit bribery.\u201dThe situation in China has drawn attention from the authorities in the United States. Olympus briefed the Justice Department on the results of its internal inquiry. The Justice Department\u2019s foreign corporate bribery unit is monitoring developments, though it has not opened a formal investigation, according to an American official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it.Olympus acknowledged an investigation into its Chinese operations, which was conducted by three board members and a law professor, with assistance from outside law firms. But the company declined to elaborate, saying that the inquiry had found no evidence of legal violations. A spokesman for the company, Osamu Kobayashi, said of details described in internal documents: \u201cWe don\u2019t deny them, and we don\u2019t confirm them.\u201dThe company, which presented the findings of the China investigation to the board late last year, has taken some action.In February, Olympus quietly disciplined five managers who were directly involved in dealings with Anyuan. Two were demoted, one received a two-day suspension and two others received written reprimands.Olympus announced the actions on an internal notice board accessible by employees, without giving reasons. The inquiry\u2019s report recommended that the same managers be punished for violating company policies, although it said their actions fell short of legal wrongdoing.Mr. Kobayashi, the spokesman, called the actions an internal human resources matter and declined to comment further.Anyuan declined to comment. The company operates out of a building with a polished stone lobby in Shenzhen, an industrial city on the Chinese mainland a few miles from Hong Kong, where Olympus has its camera factory. In response to a visit by a reporter, a receptionist said the chairman, Chen Zuyuan was away. The company did not respond to multiple requests for interviews with Mr. Chen or other representatives.Anyuan did not cooperate with the Olympus inquiry, the investigators said in their report, beyond giving a short statement claiming it had \u201cused only legal means\u201d to aid Olympus with the customs issue.Olympus built its first plant in Shenzhen in the early 1990s, at a time when global companies were piling into China\u2019s rapidly developing coastal cities, looking to take advantage of the cheap labor force. It expanded a decade later, after the Chinese government set up a duty-free zone for overseas manufacturers in the city.Soon, Shenzhen became the source of most lenses that Olympus uses in its cameras. The plant, which employed several thousand workers, could produce more than 50 million lenses a year, as well as other camera components.The expansion in Shenzhen was not trouble-free. In 2011, fire inspectors found safety violations at the factory, including faults with \u201cemergency passages, smoke ventilation, doors and windows,\u201d two managers later wrote in a memo.It was then that Chinese public security officials introduced Olympus to Anyuan, according to one of the memos reviewed by The Times. The officials said that Anyuan could facilitate \u201ca smooth resolution\u201d to the fire-safety problem, the managers wrote.In China, such middlemen have played an invaluable, if sometimes dubious, role for overseas companies. Government officials hold significant sway over the Chinese economy, requiring companies to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucratic approvals and regulations to secure access, orders and licenses, or negotiate taxes and fees. Often operating out of view, the middlemen, who have connections to government and Communist Party officials, can help lubricate the process.Managers at Olympus described Anyuan in the internal memos as an influential fixer, with vaguely defined interests in a variety of industries like construction, mining and pharmaceuticals. Most important, they said, the company could be counted on to solve problems with Chinese officials, by using what they called \u201cstrong connections with the central government, the city and the security services.\u201dThe managers agreed to let Anyuan deal with the fire inspectors on Olympus\u2019s behalf, multiple Olympus documents show. They later reported that, as a result of Anyuan\u2019s intervention, the factory was certified as safe \u201cwithout any fines or line stoppages whatsoever.\u201d Olympus declined to comment on the matter.Olympus turned to Anyuan for help, despite hints of impropriety.In 2007, state-controlled media reported that Anyuan\u2019s chairman, Mr. Chen, paid a senior transportation official in Yunnan Province 32 million renminbi, or $4.9 million, to obtain roadway-related contracts \u2014 an amount one news report described as the largest bribe ever paid to a Chinese public official. The official, Hu Xing, was arrested in Singapore and extradited to China, where he was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes.For its help with the fire-safety problem, Anyuan requested an unusual form of payment.In October 2011, Olympus hired an Anyuan-affiliated company as a contractor at the factory, according to multiple Olympus documents. The affiliate\u2019s official job was to to provide catering, cleaning and security services to the employee cafeteria. But the affiliate, called An Ping Tai, was established just three days before it took on the contract, and it listed a nonexistent office as its address, the internal inquiry found. The affiliate appeared to exist only on paper.\u201cAn Ping Tai seems to be a shell company without substantial operations,\u201d lawyers at a Western law firm said in a confidential report prepared for Olympus in 2014, before the company decided to open a formal inquiry.According to the internal investigation, Olympus paid the affiliate at least 1.2 million renminbi, or about $180,000, in several upfront payments, followed by unspecified monthly service fees and other compensation. Some of the money was drawn from what the inquiry called a \u201cslush fund\u201d that was hidden from Olympus\u2019s official accounts.Olympus made other off-the-books payments to Anyuan, the internal inquiry found. In 2014, managers in Shenzhen diverted to An Ping Tai rent money that Olympus had collected from employees who lived in company dormitories. The managers then \u201ccovered up\u201d the payments by describing them in financial reports as maintenance fees, the inquiry found.The customs dispute at Olympus stretched back to 2006, when inspectors in Shenzhen found discrepancies with the factory\u2019s inventory records, according to the internal inquiry and managers\u2019 memos reviewed by The Times.Foreign companies in the city\u2019s special manufacturing zone are allowed to import duty-free raw materials on the condition that the products they assemble there are exported to other countries. They must not be sold in China, where they would compete unfairly with local goods.The customs inspectors discovered that the volume of materials that Olympus was importing into the zone did not match the finished components that it was shipping out. Such discrepancies can indicate that a company is violating the no-selling-in-China rule.The value of the discrepancy, $694 million, was so large that Olympus said it could only be explained by data-entry error. By way of comparison, Olympus sold only about $600 million worth of digital cameras worldwide last year. The internal inquiry blamed the problem on \u201csimple operational mistakes\u201d by workers logging inventory in record-keeping software.The customs authorities were unpersuaded.After years of back-and-forth with Olympus, officials threatened to levy at least 60 million renminbi, or $9.2 million, in fines and unpaid import tariffs, according the Olympus documents. In one memo, managers in Shenzhen said the fine could end up being 40 times as large, though the Western law firm\u2019s report questioned the legal basis for that estimate in its 2014 report.Customs authorities in Shenzhen declined to comment. The General Administration of Customs in Beijing, which oversees customs affairs nationally, said it did not comment on investigations.Managers also suggested in the memo that Olympus could lose its duty-free trading privileges in Shenzhen, a blow that would add costs to the already unprofitable camera business. Global digital camera sales have plunged by half in the last decade, hurt by the spread of camera-equipped smartphones.Olympus employees had previously tried to curry favor with Chinese officials, the inquiry\u2019s report suggested. Investigators found a proposal by a Chinese employee at the plant dated August 2011 to offer cash and cameras worth 20,000 renminbi, or about $3,000, to the head of the customs office\u2019s antismuggling department. The report does not make clear if the plan was approved or carried out.Anyuan proposed a more decisive intervention.The company told Olympus that it could resolve the problem quickly and relatively cheaply, the Shenzhen managers reported in mid-2013. Anyuan, they said, estimated it would cost Olympus half the amount that the customs authorities were threatening to impose in penalties.It was still a significant payment \u2014 equivalent to several million dollars. One manager in Shenzhen, the head of the accounting department at the factory, told the company inquiry that he suspected Anyuan would use part of the money to bribe Chinese officials. Discussions with Anyuan were handled by a Chinese Olympus employee, according to the inquiry.\u201cMy interpretation at the time, and still a possible interpretation now,\u201d the accounting manager is quoted in the inquiry\u2019s report as saying, was that the Chinese employee \u201cwas negotiating to deliver 100 million to 140 million renminbi in bribes to the government through Anyuan.\u201dThe confidential inquiry said there was no documentary evidence to prove the manager\u2019s claim. Other managers told investigators they had no reason to think Anyuan was bribing Chinese officials.Once again, the plan involved an unorthodox form of payment.Olympus, the documents show, proposed a real estate transaction. Olympus would sell two dormitory buildings in Shenzhen to the Anyuan affiliate. The sale price would be set well below the buildings\u2019 market value, according to the confidential report from the Western law firm. The deal would reward Anyuan, but more discreetly than a cash payment.Senior Olympus executives would have to sign off, and they were nervous. The reports and memos showed a debate ensued between Tokyo executives and the Asia-Pacific office, based in Hong Kong, over who would bear responsibility for the decision. Executives knew about the bribery accusations against Mr. Chen and were concerned about legal risks, according to the documents.At one point, the Olympus president, Hiroyuki Sasa; chairman, Yasuyuki Kimoto, who retired last year; and two other board members in Tokyo told subordinates in Hong Kong and Shenzhen to move forward with the real estate deal, according to the report by the Western law firm. Managers in Shenzhen were instructed \u201cnot to leave any written evidence of the purpose behind the transaction,\u201d the law firm found. Email memos on the matter were labeled \u201ctop secret.\u201dThere are conflicting accounts of what happened next. According to the inquiry, Olympus balked at the dormitory sale at the last minute, judging it too risky. But managers in Shenzhen had already signed a deal, which Anyuan claimed contained clauses promising the sale.In the end, Olympus paid Anyuan 24 million renminbi, or $3.7 million, in cash, through its affiliate An Ping Tai, according the inquiry. Olympus declined to comment on details of its arrangement with Anyuan, beyond saying it was \u201cone of many contractual relationships\u201d it maintained in the normal course of its business.In August 2014, eight months after its managers signed the deal with Anyuan, Olympus was informed that it would not be fined or otherwise punished for the inventory-recording discrepancy, according to the inquiry.\u201cIn the end, a fine that had been estimated at least 60 million renminbi was not levied at all,\u201d the inquiry found.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Shenzhen and Ben Protess from New York.

{"Headline": "Where Berkowitz Did Time and Cagney Spent Time", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byArts | WestchesterThere\u2019s something magical about Sing Sing, the maximum-security prison that sprawls over 75 acres on a bank of the Hudson River where it widens north of the Tappan Zee Bridge \u2014 if the word magical can be used to describe a place that in the late 19th century pioneered the use of the electric chair and that today houses about 1,600 inmates, many of them convicted of rape or murder.As wonderful as all of that makes Sing Sing appear, at least to those without a permanent address there, it may still be surprising that the community that houses it, the Village of Ossining, population 25,600, treats it with pride. It is, after all, still a prison.The village manager, Abraham Zambrano, has an explanation: \u201cIt has kind of put Ossining on the map.\u201dTentative plans call for the opening of an arrival center in the village, where visitors would board a \u201cprison bus\u201d to be taken to the museum, which would be in a former powerhouse building at the prison.

The village has had a head start on acquisitions, thanks to the Joseph Caputo Community Center, which displays replicas of prison cells and of the electric chair, \u201cOld Sparky.\u201d\u201cThe question\u2019s going to be, \u2018How do we fund the construction and the actual operation?\u2019\u201d said Jerry Faiella, the executive director of Historic Hudson River Towns. A board of directors is to be formed to oversee museum operations, which would be sustained through admission fees, memberships and annual giving, among other revenue sources.Initial financing to move the project forward came from a $250,000 grant from Empire State Development, New York\u2019s chief economic development agency.Just over $1 million is already available from the state to stabilize and preserve the powerhouse building and the 1825 cellblock, which remains standing but has no roof and was damaged in a fire in the 1980s.Gail Lord, co-founder and president of the Lord group, said the museum could help navigate the nation\u2019s current conversation on criminal justice.Part of the work now underway is determining just how much more money is needed before construction could begin.In its early days, Sing Sing was known as the House of Fear for its severe punishment and harsh discipline. From 1888 to 1963, when Eddie Mays became the last person to be put to death by the state, more than 600 inmates were executed there.That dark past was counterbalanced by periods of penal enlightenment, including the tenure of Warden Lewis E. Lawes, who saw rehabilitation as his first priority. Lawes had movie stars and sports teams visit Sing Sing, and his memoirs were made into the 1932 movie \u201c20,000 Years in Sing Sing.\u201dWarner Bros. built a gymnasium at the prison in the early 1930s to show gratitude for Sing Sing\u2019s role in so many films, Mr. Glass said.Cagney encountered the prison in \u201cAngels With Dirty Faces\u201d (1938), as Mr. De Niro did in \u201cAnalyze That\u201d (2002). Audrey Hepburn\u2019s character Holly Golightly visits the mobster Sally Tomato at Sing Sing in a scene in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201dIt would take a year to design the museum and then 18 months to build it. And there still is that pesky issue of getting all the money necessary to go forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Career Coaching for the Playdate Generation", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe job outlook for new graduates is the best it\u2019s been in years, but that\u2019s hardly the point. For the playdate generation, expertly guided through life transitions from preschool to college, graduation is scary. Raised with a keen awareness of competition, students see a degree not as a finish line but as the start of the next heat.Last fall, Jonathan Harsh, a senior majoring in political science at Beloit College in Wisconsin, was marinating in uncertainty: \u201cAm I good enough at what I am doing to get ahead? Are other people taking a better route?\u201d His career ambitions have swung from astronaut, biologist or chemist to \u201cmaybe being a writer or working on a political campaign.\u201d Plus, he likes theater.Cue the career coaches \u2014 onetime tutors, test preppers and executive coaches who have created a blossoming industry to guide students in choosing majors, landing internships, exploring careers and seeking first jobs.\u201cStudents are more confused than ever about what the next step is,\u201d said Nicole Oringer, co-owner of Ivy Educational Services, a New Jersey company that began career coaching four years ago, often to students they had helped with college applications. Turning to experts seems only natural: \u201cThis is a generation of students that has been given a lot of resources and advice.\u201dPersonal career guidance is not cheap. While help finding a job can cost a few hundred dollars, some companies charge $300 an hour for services that might involve deciphering strengths, arranging job shadowing and working on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, interview techniques and job search strategies. Walking a student through an extended exploration can run $5,000.Mr. Harsh\u2019s parents engaged Maura Koutoujian of Jody Michael Associates for the $4,995 package, including a proprietary \u201ccareer discovery process.\u201d From October through March, they met almost weekly in person or over FaceTime. Parents who can afford the service slip it under the cost umbrella of launching a child into adulthood, like tutoring or college application help. Mr. Harsh\u2019s father, Michael, a retired vice president at General Electric, sees it as a worthwhile investment to help his son learn how to leverage his skills \u201cto make a career.\u201d A coach \u201ccan help pull that out, frame it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it to be a deliberate step, not something that happens.\u201dIn the company\u2019s Zen-themed Chicago office, amid a \u201ccareer library\u201d of job guidebooks and self-awareness material, Mr. Harsh met Ms. Koutoujian to explore how those qualities match a job path. What might suit a specialist and introvert? What fields within government? Or theater? Ms. Koutoujian is careful not to prescribe: \u201cIt is really about him learning about himself.\u201dTo parents, such plotted ruminations sound foreign. \u201cIt was dumb luck that we ended up where we are,\u201d Michael Harsh said of his own path and his wife\u2019s, in nursing. But hopscotching your way to a career these days reads as risky, given escalating student loan debt. Students also worry about matching parents\u2019 success.\u201cThere is a fear of downward mobility and a sense that \u2018We have to get this right,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ms. Oringer said.He noted that high school graduates once could work up to engineering jobs. Now, requirements for more education have made training more drawn out and specialized. Between 1985 and 2010, the number of programs of study jumped from 462 to 2,260, to serve what he described as a \u201cmuch more complicated career pathway.\u201d Career fields have multiplied, too. In 1950, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracked 270; in 2010, there were 840.Students must figure out what they care about and where to jump on. And they want help doing it.That message has been slow to arrive on campuses, though some are shedding the job-posting-clearinghouse mentality to offer more personal help. The College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota has doubled its career counseling staff, bringing to 10 the number available to guide the college\u2019s 13,676 undergraduates. Last October, the office required first-year students to attend an open house to get an assignment (make a r\u00e9sum\u00e9), the first in the four-year career prep program.What\u2019s the best career for you? John L. Holland\u2019s theory of career choice could help you find out.Such hand-holding recognizes that, liberal arts education or not, everyone wants a return on investment for college dollars spent. It\u2019s also what this generation\u2019s involved parents demand, said Susie Ellen Clarke, director of Undergraduate Career Services at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business. \u201cParents have high expectations for the service their son or daughter will be provided.\u201d The resource center approach is out, she said. \u201cThey want it tailored to them.\u201dThat\u2019s why, two years ago, Ms. Clarke\u2019s office began assigning both an adviser and a career coach to students the moment they were admitted. \u201cPeople in my generation want to know what they are doing way ahead of time,\u201d said Lauren Deitch, a senior in the business school who sought out a part-time job at the career office\u2019s help desk to get extra guidance herself.Ms. Deitch won\u2019t send an important email without her go-to counselor looking it over. She had top summer internships in TV and film, but companies she\u2019s interested in didn\u2019t start recruiting until March. She is confident but has been rattled by the steady ping of alerts revealing others\u2019 job news.\u201cMy friends accept a job offer to Target and the first thing they think is, \u2018Oh, I have to post to Instagram,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey get 300 likes and that makes other people anxious.\u201d Before winter break she deleted her Instagram account. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to enjoy life if you are focused on what everyone else is doing.\u201dBeing out front with the perfect career move has suddenly become a social necessity. Ms. Clarke, herself the mother of a millennial, fears that parents have fed that fragile mind-set. \u201cWe have created a generation that doesn\u2019t want to make a mistake or fail.\u201d Sure, she said, \u201cwe all want the best for our children, but at some point, they have to do it on their own.\u201dAre today\u2019s children overcoached? Julie Lythcott-Haims, former dean of freshmen at Stanford and author of \u201cHow to Raise an Adult,\u201d thinks so. \u201cWhat we want is for them not to be continually looking over their shoulders for a parent or hired counselor to tell them what the next steps are,\u201d she said. A first job that ends up a poor fit may look like a mistake, but \u201cI regard that as really important information.\u201dAs the job scene grows more complex, she said, students need even more confidence to manage setbacks and plot moves. \u201cThis notion that you always need a handler, that you will always need somebody, that you don\u2019t have the wherewithal to figure it out yourself \u2014 I think that\u2019s damaging.\u201dWhen asked how they would respond to a negative review from an employer, instead of focusing on how they might improve, they were more likely than peers to say they would quit, argue that the rating was unfair or ask a parent to call their manager. If they woke up with a cold the day of a job fair, overparented students were more likely to think the solution was to \u201chave my parent bring my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and distribute it to employers.\u201dThe parents who pressed to get their children on coveted sports teams in grade school and edited their essays in high school continued their overinvolvement in college, and now \u201cit has moved to that early career level,\u201d said Dr. Olson-Buchanan. Parents are even in touch with their children\u2019s job recruiters, she said, \u201casking why their student wasn\u2019t hired.\u201dDr. Olson-Buchanan and her co-author, Jill Bradley-Geist, are doing a follow-up study this spring to see how the students have fared in the workplace.While riding the bumps is one thing and falling flat another, it may be hard to tell the difference. \u201cThe labor market is changing radically,\u201d said David L. Blustein, a professor in the counseling, developmental and educational psychology department at Boston College. More automation and the rise of what he calls \u201cprecarious work\u201d \u2014 unstable or short-term jobs \u2014 lets employers test-drive employees. If guidance can help students make career choices earlier, that\u2019s important, he said, because research shows \u201cthat if people know where they want to go, if they are more intentional about developing their goals, they are better at getting there.\u201dSo when to guide and when to let go? Parents like Thomas F. Fleming, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, a Manhattan law firm, is conflicted about how much to help out. Raised in Brooklyn, Mr. Fleming was the first in his family to attend college and navigated school and career himself. His father worked construction and his mother was a liquor store clerk.Yet for his sons \u2014 Joe, a 2012 Villanova graduate, and Will, a 2015 graduate of the University of Maryland \u2014 Mr. Fleming hired Susan Hay, an executive recruiter who in 2013 started LaunchingU to guide new grads.For two years after college, Joe had lived at home in Nyack, N.Y., while working for an online magazine and a political campaign. \u201cHe was stumbling,\u201d said Mr. Fleming, who landed his own first job as a food buyer for Sheraton Hotels before finding the law. \u201cToday\u2019s economy is more demanding and complex,\u201d with companies wanting well-trained new employees. His sons were eager to be successful, he said, but unclear how to do it. \u201cThey look at the mountain and they say, \u2018I can\u2019t reach it.\u2019\u2009\u201dMs. Hay helped Joe find his inner worker. He valued \u201cbeing seen as having expertise,\u201d she said. He didn\u2019t like settings that constantly changed, and \u201cwanted to clearly understand what was expected of him.\u201d Conversations about his interests led him to graduate school; he\u2019s now studying public policy at Duke.So last summer, after Will graduated and jobs didn\u2019t materialize, Mr. Fleming again hired Ms. Hay. With Will, who now works at a Maryland marketing firm, she focused on concrete job advice \u2014 take down the online frat pictures, use active verbs in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, prepare four or five stories for interviews that show how you stand out.Ms. Hay reminds her charges that \u201cthey are 90 percent responsible\u201d for the content of the interview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the interviewer asks,\u201d she said. \u201cA young person has to know how to project who they are.\u201dContrary to what some may think, \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d is not a prod to recite your chronology, said Carolyn Magnani, a career coach for Ivy Educational Services. Translate it as: \u201cHow do you fit with this position. Why should we hire you?\u201dDispensing tips and common sense is simple. The harder task, especially for students used to following a recipe for success, is answering questions with no right answer, like: What do you care about?\u201cThey don\u2019t know themselves and they don\u2019t know where to begin,\u201d said Chris Posti, who a year ago started College Grad CareerCoaching after running an executive coaching and outplacement firm. She blames childhoods in which daily transactions like playdates and soccer practice have trumped self-knowing.\u201cWe are not growing them in some of the ways we should be growing them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are more concerned with how they are doing on the lacrosse team.\u201dGuidance has become a given in a world that demands ambition not only to soar but also to take off. \u201cWhen you are getting coaching with ACTs and college stuff, this whole new process of being coached for a career sounds very familiar,\u201d said Ben Fuerst, who graduated in June from the University of Denver.Mr. Fuerst went to Ivy Educational Services for help with internships starting in his sophomore year (internships are no longer optional for securing desirable postcollege jobs).Ms. Magnani kept Mr. Fuerst on track with Skype conversations every other week \u2014 \u201cThis is who you should talk to by next week.\u201d Mr. Fuerst, who is from Tewksbury, N.J., interned in the office of a New Jersey company that makes packaging materials. Junior year, he landed an internship with Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and then with the state\u2019s Office of Early Childhood. Senior year required \u201ca few more spitball sessions.\u201d Try sports business or stick to politics and policy? He made it through several rounds toward a coveted internship with the National Football League but lost out.In October, he started a job at a consulting firm that works with a federal agency. He likes \u201chaving a schedule and a routine\u201d but doesn\u2019t know \u201cif this will be my job in a year or two.\u201d\u201cIn my generation, it is so normal and so expected for things to be competitive,\u201d said Mr. Fuerst, who was raised in an affluent community of high-achieving parents he describes as \u201chands-on.\u201d \u201cYou have to be the best or you won\u2019t stand out. You need guidance.\u201dMr. Harsh, too, sees the worth of career coaching \u2014 but mostly in how it helped him figure out himself: \u201cConfidence has been an issue. Sometimes I have fears of \u2018Should I do this or do that?\u2019\u201dCome January, Mr. Harsh was excited about a career he hadn\u2019t previously thought of: analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to see something that you would like to do and you are able to do,\u201d he said. Job requirements favor foreign language skills, and he had studied Japanese and Spanish. He is applying for a C.I.A. internship for 2017 and weighing graduate programs in political science.Paradoxically, coaching has made him see the limits of career planning. \u201cTalking with Maura made me realize you won\u2019t know until you try it,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I may have to wing it and go out and see what happens.\u201dLaura Pappano is author of \u201cInside School Turnarounds\u201d and writer in residence at the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Official Urges Quick Action on Puerto Rico Rescue", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Skeptical lawmakers at the House Natural Resources Committee heard testimony Wednesday on a plan to rescue Puerto Rico, as witnesses warned that only quick action by Congress could keep a bad situation from becoming a lost decade.Antonio Weiss, the counselor to the Treasury secretary, told lawmakers \u201ceverybody loses\u201d if Congress fails to intervene in time and Puerto Rico defaults on big debt payments in the coming weeks.On Tuesday the committee\u2019s draft bill was introduced in the House, proposing to put Puerto Rico under a seven-member federal oversight board and give it extraordinary powers to wipe out debt, something normally available only in bankruptcy. Under existing law, Puerto Rico is barred from declaring bankruptcy.\u201cThis legislation is not a bailout,\u201d Mr. Weiss added, \u201cbut if things go bad it could turn into one.\u201dThe situation has created a sense of urgency in Washington as well as in San Juan, though the drafting of the bill has drawn criticism from all sides. The island has a $422 million debt payment due on May 1, and is running out of cash. It has already defaulted on several smaller debt payments, and $2 billion more is due in July.Mr. Weiss said there were still parts of the bill that he did not support, but he urged the committee to repair them quickly so that Congress could put a legal framework in place in time for the coming debt payment deadlines. Otherwise, he and other witnesses said, a default could plunge Puerto Rico into an abyss.\u201cThere will be endless litigation,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe fear economic chaos.\u201dPuerto Rico has a total $72 billion of debt outstanding, most of it in the form of municipal bonds. It also owes at least $43 billion of government pensions that are almost entirely unfunded. It has stopped paying some of its vendors, and it risks losing its ability to provide essential services such as hospital care, clean water and electricity.The House committee\u2019s chairman, Rob Bishop of Utah, had put the rescue bill on a fast track. However, in a statement late Wednesday afternoon, he said he had adjourned the committee so it could consider proposed amendments, saying the administration was still negotiating on key provisions and members needed time to understand the complexities of the issue and the ramifications of any proposed changes.But lawmakers on the committee showed little enthusiasm.Republicans complained that no matter what they were being told, the bill still seemed like a bailout for Puerto Rico.Representative John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, said that even if taxpayers did not have to pay for the initial debt restructuring, they would probably have to sponsor costly subsidies or other measures to stimulate the economy.\u201cWhat is the next shoe to drop?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to have to be a cash bailout.\u201dTom McClintock, a Republican of California, said he thought that if Puerto Rico got the ability to wipe out debt, it would send a frightening signal to bond investors that Congress might also give such powers to troubled states. \u201cTaxpayers are going to end up shouldering those burdens by paying much higher interest rates,\u201d he said.Democrats also criticized the bill.Norma J. Torres, a California Democrat, said she was troubled by a provision that would lower the legal minimum wage in Puerto Rico to $4.25 an hour for people in the first five years of their careers. She said she thought employers might misuse this provision, dumping workers as soon as they completed five years and replacing them with low-cost new workers.\u201cIs this going to create a two-class type of employment?\u201d she asked. \u201cWill older ones be the first to be laid off?\u201dMr. Weiss said one of Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest problems was a declining population, and the provision could add to the problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Overtime Pay: A Lifeline for the Overworked American", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTHIS summer the Department of Labor is expected to introduce new rules to restore overtime pay to millions of Americans \u2014 rules that require no congressional approval. From the fearful protests coming from Republican leadership, you\u2019d think the sky was falling. \u201cThis mandate on employers will hurt the lowest paid American workers the most, by reducing their opportunities for a promotion or a better job,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.In fact, far from the right\u2019s end-of-the-world, Chicken-Little economics, restoring time-and-a-half overtime pay would return to American workers a protection they long had, one that made them more secure and productive.Half a century ago, overtime pay was the norm, with more than 60 percent of salaried employees qualifying. These are largely the sorts of office- and service-sector workers who never enjoyed the protection of union membership. But over the last 40 years the threshold has been allowed to steadily erode, so that only about 8 percent qualify today. If you feel as if you\u2019re working longer hours for less money than your parents did, it\u2019s probably because you are.Today, if you\u2019re salaried and earn more than $23,600 dollars a year, you don\u2019t automatically qualify for overtime: That means every extra hour you work, you work free. Under the new proposed rules, everyone earning a salary of $50,440 a year or less would be eligible to collect time-and-a-half pay for every hour worked over 40 hours a week.According to the Economic Policy Institute, it would give 13.5 million more workers a new or stronger right to overtime pay \u2014 substantially increasing both middle-class incomes and employment. It\u2019s not as high as the $69,000 threshold it would take to return to 1975 levels, after adjusting for inflation, but it\u2019s a courageous step in the right direction. It\u2019s like a minimum wage hike for the middle class.In a cruel twist, the longer and harder we work for the same wage, the fewer jobs there are for others, the higher unemployment goes and the more we weaken our own bargaining power. That helps explain why over the last 30 years, corporate profits have doubled from about 6 percent of gross domestic product to about 12 percent, while wages have fallen by almost exactly the same amount. The erosion of overtime and other labor protections is one of the main factors leading to worsening inequality. But a higher threshold would help reverse this trend.Under the restored salary threshold, employers would have a choice: They could either pay you time-and-a-half for your extra hours worked, or they could hire more workers at the standard rate to fill your previously unpaid hours. The former would grow your paycheck. The latter would increase your leisure time while directly adding more jobs to the economy. Either would be great for workers and great for economic growth.Lower- and middle-income workers don\u2019t stash their earnings in offshore accounts the way high-paid chief executives do \u2014 the more the typical worker is paid, the more she spends on goods and services. When workers have more money, businesses have more customers; and when businesses have more customers, they hire more workers.Whether through an increase in consumer demand or a reduction in unpaid hours, a higher overtime threshold would increase total employment, tightening the labor market and driving up real wages for the first time since the late 1990s.When it comes to labor standards, Senator Alexander and his Republican colleagues always sing the same old trickle-down tune: If wages go up, jobs must go down. Yet it never turns out to be true. And trickle-down economics looks more like Chicken Little economics with every passing day.Nick Hanauer is an entrepreneur, a venture capitalist and the founder of Civic Ventures, a public policy incubator.

{"Headline": "Flooded With Migrants, Germany Struggles to Integrate Them", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byNUREMBERG, Germany \u2014 If the urgent challenge for Germany last year was sheltering the hundreds of thousands of people who descended on the country almost at once seeking asylum, then this year\u2019s task is to integrate them.But before that can happen, there is sifting to do. Lots of it.More than a million migrants have arrived in Germany, but the government emphasizes that far fewer will stay. So far, only 660,000 have permission to remain, officials said. And the federal government has urged Germany\u2019s 16 states to double last year\u2019s total of almost 60,000 deportations.To whittle down the numbers, the authorities are halting family reunifications for two years and rejecting tens of thousands of applicants from the Balkans, Algeria and Morocco, arguing that these countries are not at war.The task of deciding who will stay and who will go has fallen to officials like Frank-J\u00fcrgen Weise, 64, who has led Germany\u2019s sprawling federal employment agency, based here in Nuremberg, since 2004.As the backlog of asylum applications surged to 300,000 last year, Mr. Weise, a colonel in the military reserves, was also tapped to lead the federal agency for migration, conveniently headquartered in this same Bavarian city.He has called the huge backlog \u201can embarrassment for Germany\u201d and said, \u201cThe impression arose that Germany has no plan as to what to do with the refugees.\u201dThe energetic Mr. Weise has engaged thousands of officials and begun a digital centralization of records to speed the processing of asylum applications and keep tabs on newcomers.Open battles have erupted with entrenched officials who argue that new, hurriedly trained recruits lack the experience to judge asylum applicants. The security forces want to keep out would-be terrorists and Islamic extremists, and to steer new arrivals to specific places of residence to prevent new migrant ghettos from forming in cities.But the difficulty of allaying security concerns and speeding integration quickly emerges when observing the individual asylum hearings mandated by law and international agreement.Even a straightforward case, of a Syrian man interviewed this month near Nuremberg, consumed well over an hour, with translation for each question and answer.The interviewing official then had to do the same for the man\u2019s wife. At this pace, officials are lucky to handle four cases in a day, even working the 50-hour weeks Mr. Weise has requested.But as Mr. Weise sees it, this is the only way to fulfill Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s mantra: \u201cWe\u2019ll manage this.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019ll try,\u2019 \u201d he said.So it is that the fates of eight, mostly young, men from Algeria and Morocco, gathered in a makeshift meeting room in Cologne, now rest in the hands of officials like him.With a map of Germany and handwritten conjugations of German verbs taped to the walls, these migrants, most of whom arrived late last year, said that all they wanted to do was learn German, get out of this refugee facility for some 600 people, work, pay taxes and build the future denied them at home.\u201cWe are praying for the people to accept us and not to discriminate,\u201d said Younis, 23, from Algiers. \u201cNot every dark-haired person is a criminal. We want to be treated as people. We are all equal.\u201dOf the 153 suspects identified in more than 1,500 cases of robbery and sexual assault, 103 are from Algeria and Morocco, according to the authorities. The Cologne police chief, J\u00fcrgen Mathies, said in an interview that most of the suspects had arrived in the recent influx of migrants.Almost all of the 130 people charged so far are between the ages of 18 and 25, said a court spokesman, Wolfgang Schorn.Even migrants who are eventually deported should be occupied somehow while here, Ms. Merkel has said, and they can take home any skills acquired.Otherwise, President Joachim Gauck said, \u201cwe risk that frustration and boredom turn into violence and crime, or that political and religious extremism flourish.\u201dThe city\u2019s new police chief, Mr. Mathies, has sharply increased police patrols, particularly around the station and cathedral where the New Year\u2019s assaults took place.

Today\u2019s voters have sorted themselves and polarized into partisan groups that look very different than they did in the late 1980s. And members of each side like the other side less than before. Americans aren\u2019t annoyed only by the economy; they\u2019re annoyed with one another.Even breaking the consumer sentiment data down by income levels does little to buoy the argument that Americans were pessimistic. From 2009-2015, the average gap in economic satisfaction between the upper and lower thirds of the income distribution was 13.7 points, much lower than it was during the Reagan years (21.3) and lower than the gap during the administrations of the elder George Bush (14.7), Bill Clinton (16.7) and George W. Bush (18.4).As we entered 2016, Americans of all income levels felt positively about the economy, though by some indicators many people had not recovered. The employment-population ratio and median household income, for example, began to recover only in 2015.Describing Americans\u2019 mood as distinctively angry in 2015 elides this evidence. Americans were optimistic about the nation\u2019s economy and generally happy \u2014 in fact, no less optimistic or happy than they had been historically.The increasing alignment between party and racial attitudes goes back to the early 1990s. The Pew Values Survey asks people whether they agree that \u201cwe should make every effort to improve the position of minorities, even if it means giving them preferential treatment.\u201dSome are political, like police misconduct. Others spill into areas we think of as more social than political, like sports, music and movies: about Academy Awards nominations, for example.Democrats and Republicans like each other a lot less now than they did 60 years ago, in part because they have sorted into parties based on attitudes on race, religion and ethnicity. These attitudes and emotions have been activated in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Add to this the fact that the country is becoming less white and that nonwhites are disproportionately more likely to be Democrats, and an explanation for the anger emerges.Advertisement"}

Saudi Arabia knew that in exchange for a steady flow of oil and billions of dollars for the American arms industry, the United States would come to the rescue if its ally faced an external threat \u2014 and that it would never speak out too loudly about the kingdom\u2019s closed political system or its poor human rights record.Over time, it became clear that Mr. Obama had prioritized combating the Islamic State over ousting Mr. Assad. This infuriated Riyadh, which wanted to marry the two causes. Privately, Saudi officials blame Mr. Obama for prolonging the war by barring Saudi Arabia and other countries from giving Syrian rebels more powerful arms, like antiaircraft missiles, which Mr. Obama feared could be used outside Syria by terrorists.Those moves surprised American officials, who have reported no change in the security situation in Lebanon and who continue to support the Lebanese Army as a counterbalance to Hezbollah.Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor\u2019s have downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating this year, and companies that depend on government contracts have struggled to pay workers, creating problems for citizens and for the kingdom\u2019s many foreign workers.\u201cThese are really uncharted waters,\u201d said Ms. Plotkin Boghardt, the Washington Institute fellow. \u201cThe oil income has been like the superglue between the Saudi government and the Saudi citizens. With this glue beginning to melt away, it opens up a whole situation that we\u2019ve never seen before and they\u2019ve never been in before.\u201dIt is not all dire news for the kingdom. Saudi Arabia still has the world\u2019s largest reported reserves of oil, which remains essential to the global economy. The country also has low debt and large cash reserves.And although Iran has increased its influence in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, it has done so at great cost, financially and militarily. \u201cThe Saudis took the region for granted while Iran put a strategy in place back in the \u201980s, and has been implementing it year by year and dollar by dollar,\u201d said Randa Slim, an analyst at the Middle East Institute.But the kingdom maintains strong ties with many other countries \u2014 including Egypt, Britain and Pakistan \u2014 and as a leading Sunni nation, it has the demographic upper hand against Shiite Iran. \u201cThe score is still in their favor because it is a majority Sunni Arab region,\u201d Ms. Slim said.Officials involved in the Saudi-United States relationship acknowledge the chill, but say that it has not filtered down to the operational level, and that cooperation remains robust on issues like security, counterterrorism and business. And many Saudis realize that Mr. Obama\u2019s days in the White House are almost over and that his successor may engage differently with the kingdom.\u201cI\u2019ve read so many accounts over the years predicting the demise of the House of Saud, and each time they\u2019ve managed to survive,\u201d said Robert W.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Adding Money for Water Tunnel in Brooklyn and Queens", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday that he was going to add $305 million to New York City\u2019s capital budget to speed up work on Water Tunnel No. 3 so that it would be able to serve Brooklyn and Queens.The money will pay for construction of two deep shafts in Maspeth, Queens, that will connect with the tunnel, which is virtually finished. When the work is done, the five million people who live in the two boroughs will have a robust supply of water other than Tunnel No. 2, which was built in 1936.The simplest part of the mayor\u2019s day may have been finding money to pay for the tunnel, not an especially difficult task in a budget swollen with revenues from a booming city economy.Far more awkward was the struggle by him and his aides to argue that they had never flagged in their support for the tunnel project, and to avoid an unflattering comparison to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, who drove progress on the construction after work on the tunnel had moved sluggishly for decades.Mr. de Blasio said he had always followed the schedule laid out by Mr. Bloomberg \u2014 \u201cWe were absolutely devoted to that timeline\u201d \u2014 and had put $52 million into the budget earlier this year to keep pace with it. With the additional $305 million announced on Wednesday, he said that he would outrace Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s schedule by beginning work in 2020, a year earlier.\u201cWe will move it forward a year and we will add the money into the executive budget to reflect that change,\u201d said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat.The mayor\u2019s assertion of timeliness was hard to square with accounts from multiple other sources, including the testimony of one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s commissioners, interviews with career engineers overseeing the project, annual reports to the city water authority and a document prepared by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s own budget office.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first budget, issued in October 2014, showed the \u201ccommitment\u201d date for the construction \u2014 meaning when contracts could be signed \u2014 as June 2019. That is a year earlier than what he promised on Wednesday.Asked about the discrepancy, the mayor\u2019s budget director, Dean Fuleihan, said the June 2019 date had been erroneously included in the document.\u201cClearly, we made a clerical mistake,\u201d Mr. Fuleihan said. \u201cAm I embarrassed? Completely.\u201dHe said that the erroneous date had not been repeated in any policy documents and that he had been assured by officials at the Environmental Protection Department that they had never expected to start work that soon. Moreover, he noted, some Bloomberg-era budget documents indicated that the work would start in 2021.Even harder to explain was why and how the money committed to the project\u2019s completion had vanished from the budget if Mr. de Blasio intended to keep up with the Bloomberg administration\u2019s schedule.When Mr. de Blasio took office in January 2014, he inherited a vast capital budget from Mr. Bloomberg that included $336 million for finishing the part of the Tunnel No. 3 meant to serve Brooklyn and Queens. That money was still in the first budget submitted by the de Blasio administration in October 2014.A few months later, in a January 2015 document, the $336 million was gone.\u201cI could say very comfortably that probably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do in terms of showing people the ongoing commitment,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday.The mayor noted that he had put $52 million back into the project in January, because it would permit design work to proceed.Administration officials also debunked some of the explanations offered by their colleagues for why the water project had fallen out of the budget. Earlier in the week, officials had said they were trying to keep water rates low. But the amount of money needed to finish the tunnel, around $350 million, spread out over 30 years and paid by millions of users, would have a very small impact on monthly water rates, noted Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor.The real reason the $336 million was pulled, Mr. de Blasio said, was that \u201cwe didn\u2019t think that the estimate was accurate.\u201dNow the $336 million has been replaced \u2014 with $357 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Productivity So Weak? Three Theories", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byEconomic MysteryMore than 151 million Americans count themselves employed, a number that has risen sharply in the last few years. The question is this: What are they doing all day?Productivity is one of the most important yet least understood areas of economics. Over long periods, it is the only pathway toward higher levels of prosperity; the reason an American worker makes much more today than a century ago is that each hour of labor produces much more in goods and services. Put bluntly, if the kind of productivity growth implied by the new data published Thursday were to persist indefinitely, your grandchildren would be no richer than you.But it is also really hard to measure, particularly for service firms. (How productive were employees at Facebook, or your local bank, last quarter? Have fun trying to figure it out.)That is a long way of saying we don\u2019t know for sure what is going on right now, or how long it will last. But the possible answers range from utterly depressing to downright optimistic.The productivity slowdown is real, and it\u2019s not going away. Earlier waves of innovation in technology (a computer on every office worker\u2019s desk, for example) and management strategies (like outsourcing noncore functions) have been fully put into place across corporate America, and so are no longer increasing productivity.Add to that a slowdown in capital spending by businesses since the 2008 recession, which means workers aren\u2019t getting better equipment or software that might help them do their jobs more efficiently. Moreover, if you believe the theory mentioned above about low-productivity workers being more likely to lose their jobs during the recession, the people returning to the labor force now may be less effective at boosting economic output for each hour they put in.In the depressing scenario, Americans\u2019 standards of living are just going to grow more slowly in the future, and there\u2019s not much we can do about it. Fortunately, this isn\u2019t the only possible one.Maybe we just aren\u2019t counting things right \u2014 or, to use the economists\u2019 preferred term, there is measurement error.After all, entire industries are being transformed in ways hard to account for in data on gross domestic product, particularly in technology and services. Having a high-powered computer in our pockets and social networks that let us stay in touch with friends may make us better off than the narrow math of gross domestic product \u2014 which counts only what we pay for \u2014 would suggest.Still, it\u2019s not clear why these nonmarket gains in quality of life would be so different now than they were in earlier generations when, for example, videocassette recorders became widespread or the air became cleaner thanks to environmental regulation.Their conclusion, after examining tech and other measurement issues, is that it isn\u2019t. That said, the tools that statistics-keepers use to measure the economy are never perfect, so there could be problems not yet understood that are creating a false impression of a productivity drought.Think about a business that is investing for the future. It hires a bunch of people and opens new offices and builds new factories. But while it is doing all that stuff, its actual productivity is quite low. It has a lot of people working a lot of hours, but very low economic output until its operations are fully up to speed.Maybe, just maybe, that is happening with the United States economy writ large. Businesses are adding workers in preparation for the future, but it will take time for their investments to pay off in terms of gross domestic product.There\u2019s a recent precedent for that pattern. In the late 1990s, the stock market was booming and companies were making huge investments in staff, equipment and information technology. But reported productivity growth was actually below the long-term trend \u2014 only about 1.7 percent a year from 1993 to 1998, for example. Then it began soaring in the years that followed, particularly in the early 2000s.But here\u2019s one piece of evidence that the pattern of the 1990s is not what is afoot today: Business investment spending on equipment, intellectual property and structures is low relative to the size of the economy. You\u2019d expect those numbers to be higher if this was just a productivity lull as the economy waits for big investments in the future to pay off.Still, there could be enough going on below the surface of those overall numbers that the optimistic case remains plausible. To use one example, engineers at several companies are hard at work trying to perfect driverless cars. At present, they are a sap on productivity \u2014 they put in many thousands of hours of work with no economic output to show for it. But if successful, their work could radically increase the nation\u2019s productivity in the decades ahead.Apply the same across a wide range of fields \u2014 industrial goods, pharmaceuticals and medicine, financial technology firms \u2014 and optimism becomes more plausible. That\u2019s the scenario we should all hope is occurring: Slow productivity growth now is just a down payment on a much brighter future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hamilton\u2019s Debt", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byShe will replace Andrew Jackson, a populist who campaigned against elites but was also, unfortunately, very much a racist, arguably an advocate of what we would nowadays call white supremacy. Hmm. Does that make you think about any currently prominent political figures?In that report, Hamilton proposed that the federal government assume and honor all of the debts individual states had run up during the Revolutionary War, imposing new tariffs on imported goods to raise the needed revenue. He believed that doing so would produce important benefits, which I\u2019ll get to in a minute.First, however, I think it\u2019s interesting to ask how such a proposal would be received today.On the left, it would surely be denounced as a bailout \u2014 a giveaway to speculators who had purchased devalued debt for pennies on the dollar, and would reap large capital gains. Indeed, a fair bit of the report is devoted to explaining why trying to prevent such windfall gains, via \u201cdiscrimination between the different classes of creditors,\u201d would be impractical and unwise.Meanwhile, on the right \u2014 well, Hamilton was calling for a tax increase, which modern conservatives oppose under any and all circumstances. Luckily for him, there was no Club for Growth to demand his impeachment.But why did Hamilton want to take on those state debts? Partly to establish a national reputation as a reliable borrower, so that funds could be raised cheaply in the future. Partly, also, to give wealthy, influential investors a stake in the new federal government, thereby creating a powerful pro-federal constituency.Beyond that, however, Hamilton argued that the existence of a significant, indeed fairly large national debt would be good for business. Why? Because \u201cin countries in which the national debt is properly funded, and an object of established confidence, it answers most of the purposes of money.\u201d That is, bonds issued by the U.S. government would provide a safe, easily traded asset that the private sector could use as a store of value, as collateral for deals, and in general as a lubricant for business activity. As a result, the debt would become a \u201cnational blessing,\u201d making the economy more productive.As a result, investors have been bidding up the prices of government debt, leading to incredibly low interest rates. But it would be better for almost everyone, the story goes, if governments were to issue more debt, investing the proceeds in much-needed infrastructure even while providing the private sector with the collateral it needs to function. And it\u2019s a very persuasive story to just about everyone who has looked hard at the evidence.Unfortunately, policy makers won\u2019t do the right thing, largely because they keep listening to fiscal scolds \u2014 people who insist that public debt is a terrible thing even when borrowing costs almost nothing. The influence of these scolds, their virtual veto over fiscal policy, somehow persists even though their predictions of soaring interest rates and runaway inflation keep not coming true.The point is that Alexander Hamilton knew better.Unfortunately, Hamilton isn\u2019t around to help counter foolish debt phobia. But maybe reminding policy makers of his wisdom is one way to chip away at the wall of folly that still constrains policy.

{"Headline": "Liberal Biases, Too, May Block Progress on Climate Change", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneAre liberals impairing our ability to combat climate change?And yet even as progressive environmentalists wring their hands at the G.O.P.\u2019s climate change denial, there are biases on the left that stray just as far from the scientific consensus.\u201cThe left is turning anti-science,\u201d Marc Andreessen, the creator of Netscape who as a venture capitalist has become one of the most prominent thinkers of Silicon Valley, told me not long ago.He was reflecting broadly about science and technology. His concerns ranged from liberals\u2019 fear of genetically modified organisms to their mistrust of technology\u2019s displacement of workers in some industries. \u201cSan Francisco is an interesting case,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe left has become reactionary.\u201dStill, liberal biases may be most dangerous in the context of climate change, the most significant scientific and technological challenge of our time. For starters, they stand against the only technology with an established track record of generating electricity at scale while emitting virtually no greenhouse gases: nuclear power.Highlighting the left\u2019s biases may seem like a pointless effort to apportion equal blame along ideological lines. But it is critical to understand how they have come into being. It suggests how difficult it will be to overcome our scientific and technological taboos.Research suggests that better scientific knowledge will not be sufficient, on its own, to overcome our biases. Neither will it be mostly about improving education in STEM fields. To defeat our scientific phobias and taboos will require understanding how the findings of science and their consequences fit into the cultural makeup of both liberals and conservatives.Joel Mokyr at Northwestern University, an expert on the history of science and technology, notes that the ease with which people accept scientific knowledge depends on how straightforward the proof is.Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity was readily accepted despite the fact that few people understood it because there were a couple of experimental results no other theory could explain. Natural selection is trickier.\u201cIt is awfully hard to find a smoking gun\u201d to prove evolution, Professor Mokyr told me. \u201cThis is by definition because the process is so slow.\u201dThe evolution of scientific knowledge is messy, too. It does not neatly converge on truth along a smooth line, but rather jumps around as new knowledge disproves old certainties. Scientists\u2019 understanding of the speed, intensity and implications of climate change is substantially different from what it was only a couple of decades ago.But perhaps the most important snag to the diffusion of scientific knowledge is motivation. The average American has little at stake riding on whether the general theory of relativity is right or not. Evolution, by contrast, is a body blow to evangelical Christians\u2019 worldview.Responses aren\u2019t necessarily driven by ignorance. \u201cWhere there is a sacred value that empirical science contradicts,\u201d science will have trouble making headway, notes Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at the Stern School of Business at New York University.And the value doesn\u2019t even have to be sacred.\u201cThe problem, it seems, is not that members of the public are unexposed or indifferent to what scientists say,\u201d they concluded. \u201cThey disagree about what scientists are telling them.\u201dPeople identified as more egalitarian and more open to government interventions to address social ills \u2014 the left, as it were \u2014 were much more likely to say that most scientists agree global warming is happening and that it is caused by human activity. Most also said scientists either disagreed or were divided on the safety of storing nuclear waste.On the right, people identified as individualistic and wary of Big Government responded differently: In their view, the scientific consensus said the opposite. How could they think that? They manufactured the expert consensus they wanted by defining as experts only those who agreed with their ideological position.It is not hard to figure out the biases. People on the right tend to like private businesses, which they see as productive job creators. They mistrust government. It\u2019s not surprising they will play down climate change when it seems to imply a package of policies that curb the actions of the former and give a bigger role to the latter.On the left, by contrast, people tend to mistrust corporations \u2014 especially big ones \u2014 as corrupt and destructive. These are the institutions bringing us both nuclear power and genetically modified agriculture.\u201cWhen science is aligned with big corporations the left immediately, intuitively perceives the technology as not benefiting the greater good but only benefiting the corporation,\u201d said Matthew Nisbet, an expert on the communication of science at Northeastern University.This doesn\u2019t affect only beliefs about climate change and energy policy. The research identified similar distortions in people\u2019s beliefs about the scientific consensus on the consequences of allowing concealed handguns. Biases also color beliefs in what science says and means across a range of other issues.Fixing it won\u2019t require just better science. Eliminating the roadblocks against taking substantive action against climate change may require somehow dissociating the scientific facts from deeply rooted preferences about the world we want to live in, on both sides of the ideological divide.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Handouts Are Often Better Than a Hand Up", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWHEN we talk about how the United States can be more competitive with the rest of the world, childhood poverty rarely comes up. Yet America has a higher rate of childhood poverty than all but a few developed nations.Children are America\u2019s poorest age group. In 2013, more than 12 million children lived below the poverty line, which for a family of four is slightly more than $24,000 a year. This comes to roughly 17 percent of American children. A third of these kids are white, another third are Latino, and about one-quarter are black, while the rest are American Indian and Asian-American.On average, children in poverty have lower I.Q. scores than their wealthier peers. Recent research has made it clear that just the stress of growing up in a poor family can be toxic to the growing brain.It almost goes without saying that the cost to the American economy is severe. We need quick-acting, powerful solutions. Cash allowances, ideally paid to a child\u2019s parents on a monthly basis, are a clean, direct way to raise a high proportion of children out of poverty.The United States once had a welfare program \u2014 Aid for Families With Dependent Children \u2014 that provided cash to families in need, but A.F.D.C. was hardly generous. Not only were the benefits paltry, the incentives were perverse: If you worked, you frequently lost most or all of your benefits. According to calculations by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, A.F.D.C. pulled only 10 percent of children out of poverty in the 1990s.Even so, many argued that without a work requirement, the program encouraged poor people to remain on welfare. In 1996, legislation put forward by congressional Republicans and ultimately supported by President Bill Clinton ended A.F.D.C. \u2014 \u201cwelfare as we know it\u201d \u2014 and put Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in its place.But the welfare payments to families with children under T.A.N.F. \u2014 in part because of the program\u2019s rules about work and looking for work and in part because the time period during which you can receive welfare is capped \u2014 reach a much smaller number of families than A.F.D.C. did. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, only 23 out of 100 poor families receive any T.A.N.F. benefits at all. In some states, which set their own rules for eligibility, remarkably few families get T.A.N.F. payments.One result, according to the social scientists Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer, is that in 2011, 1.5 million families with children lived on $2 per person a day. Though food stamps help ease the burden, they are inadequate. To survive, these families depend on food banks, collect aluminum cans for refunds, do the occasional odd job and live in crowded, unsafe quarters.This is not to say that America has not tried to reduce poverty. Besides food stamps, the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit also aid poor parents substantially. The problem is that these programs still leave the rate of childhood poverty unconscionably high.Per-child cash allowances may have the greatest impact. They do not change if you find work; they are generally larger than standard welfare payments; and they don\u2019t have eligibility requirements.Many other prosperous nations provide such allowances, as do some developing ones. Cash allowances in Europe and Canada, for example, are usually unconditional. In Canada the allowance is up to about $230 a month per child.How is this money used? A book by Jane Waldfogel, a social scientist at Columbia, shows that in Britain the cash allowance is largely spent by parents on the needs of the children. The program has helped cut child poverty sharply there.The results are eye-opening. A per-child allowance of $2,500 a year for kids under 6 (leaving the child tax credit intact) would raise more than three million poor children out of poverty. Its annual cost, the researchers estimate, would be $17.7 billion.Given the general stagnation of wages over the past several decades, it might well make sense to provide a cash allowance not just to the poor, but to all children. A universal child allowance in America of $2,500 a year would lift 5.5 million out of poverty, roughly reducing the poverty rate by a third. The price tag would come to $109.3 billion a year (reduced in part because higher-income families would pay income tax on the allowance).To cut child poverty in half, it would cost us $200 billion a year, about 1.1 percent of gross domestic product, or one-fourth of the cost of Social Security. If America makes cutting childhood poverty a priority, it can afford to do so.Why not just expand the child tax credit? That\u2019s a good idea and perhaps more politically practicable. But the Columbia research shows that a dollar spent on cash allowances reduces child poverty more than the equivalent increase in the tax credit because the benefits reach the very poorest families, who don\u2019t qualify for the tax credit. We should supplement new cash allowances with new jobs programs, but direct cash payments to parents is a widely tested and powerful weapon to combat the poverty that afflicts so many right now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands Could Lose Food Stamps as States Restore Pre-Recession Requirements", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of people could soon lose food stamps as states reimpose time limits and work requirements that were suspended in recent years because of high unemployment, state officials and advocates for the poor said Friday.Liberal groups said that many unemployed childless adults with low incomes could be cut off, starting this month, as a result of the time limits, which date back to the 1996 welfare law.About 45 million people receive benefits in the food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, estimates that 500,000 to a million people will lose benefits this year.The federal Food and Nutrition Service said many adults would need to take steps to meet work requirements or risk losing aid.\u201cAble-bodied adults without dependents are eligible for SNAP for only three months in any three-year period unless they are working or participating in qualifying education and training activities,\u201d said Kevin W. Concannon, the under secretary of agriculture in charge of food assistance programs.During and after the latest recession, which ended in mid-2009, most states qualified for waivers from the time limits. But the time limits will be in effect this year in more than 40 states. In 22 states, the limits are coming back for the first time since the recession.As the economy improves, the Food and Nutrition Service said, many places no longer qualify for time limit waivers.Dorothy Rosenbaum, a food policy expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that people could be particularly hard hit in Southern and Southeastern states, including Arkansas, Florida and Mississippi. In many states, she said, the time limits took effect in January, and the first people will be cut off this month.Ellen M. Vollinger, the legal director of the Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group, noted that the poet T.S. Eliot had described April as \u201cthe cruelest month,\u201d and for people losing SNAP benefits, she said, that description is appropriate.\u201cMany thousands of jobless adults without dependents will lose all their SNAP benefits even though they are seeking work,\u201d she said.In 2016, Ms. Rosenbaum said, the three-month time limit will be in effect in areas with about 65 percent of the United States population while the rest of the country can qualify for waivers because of high and persistent unemployment, and officials in those states have requested a continuation of the waivers.By contrast, Ms. Rosenbaum said, the 2015 time limits were in effect in areas with about 30 percent of the country\u2019s population.The Labor Department reported Friday that the national unemployment rate was 5 percent, just half of what it was in late 2009.\u201cAlthough the overall jobless rate has been slowly falling,\u201d Ms. Rosenbaum said, \u201cother labor market data indicate that many people who want to work still cannot find jobs. Cutting off food assistance does not enable them to find employment or secure more hours of work.\u201dPeople likely to lose benefits because of the time limits have monthly incomes averaging from $150 to $170 a person, or 17 percent of the official poverty level for individuals, Ms. Rosenbaum said.Congressional aides and food policy experts said they saw no immediate prospect that Congress would step in to extend any relief. In any event, states have discretion over whether to seek a waiver of the time limits, and some have chosen not to do so, even though they could qualify.Mr. Concannon, the federal official, said it was unwise for states to reimpose time limits in places where adults seeking work could not find jobs because of economic conditions.More than a million people received assistance last year in an employment and training program for SNAP recipients. But some states returned federal money to the government, and 21 states did not use any of the federal funds that were available to them in the program, federal officials said.In a recent notice to childless adults subject to the time limits, the Obama administration said, \u201cTo keep getting SNAP benefits, you must work halftime or do 80 hours per month of educational or training activities.\u201dParticipation in the SNAP program more than doubled from 2003 to 2012. In December of last year, 45.2 million people were receiving SNAP benefits. The number has fallen by 2.6 million since reaching a peak in December 2012.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Is the Job Market We\u2019ve Been Hoping for All These Years", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsIf you were going to sit down and sketch out an ideal scenario for the American job market in 2016, it would look something like this:The United States would keep adding jobs at a steady clip. Wages would rise gradually \u2014 enough to put more money in workers\u2019 pockets, but not so fast as to lead the Federal Reserve to move abruptly to keep the economy from overheating. Steady job growth wouldn\u2019t show up in continued drops in the unemployment rate, but rather in a rising labor force. That is, people who had stopped even looking for a job in recent years would come back into the job market, allowing for strong job growth mixed with a steady jobless rate.I don\u2019t want to sound hopelessly optimistic or na\u00efve about the problems the United States economy is facing. In the near term, measures of economic output have looked far weaker than measures of the job market, which implies productivity growth is exceptionally weak right now. In the longer term, incomes for working-class Americans haven\u2019t really grown over the last couple of decades.These are big, serious problems with far-reaching consequences. But in terms of the nuts and bolts of the labor market in 2016, things are really shaping up well for anyone who wants to see Americans get back to work and see the damage left by the recession eight years ago finally healed.Over the last four months, the size of the United States labor force has risen by 1.92 million, the strongest since the boom time of early 2000.Indeed, the jobless rate ticked up a bit in March, to 5 percent from 4.9 percent, precisely because among the 396,000 Americans who joined the labor force, not all found jobs.The unemployment rate has been exceptionally stable lately; it has been between 4.9 and 5.1 percent for eight consecutive months. That\u2019s good news if you\u2019re worried that the Fed might move too abruptly to raise interest rates and end the expansion prematurely. The fact that job growth remains strong but is pulling new people into the job market, not just pushing the unemployment rate lower, suggests the Fed can be patient, because the labor market is at less risk of getting too tight, fueling inflation.A couple of telling statistics: The number of people who are not in the labor force but who tell survey takers they want a job \u2014 these are people who aren\u2019t actively looking for work and therefore don\u2019t count as unemployed, yet have a vague sense that they\u2019d prefer to have a job \u2014 has fallen by more than 10 percent in the last year, to 5.4 million.And the proportion of the adult population that is working has risen to 59.9 percent, up from 59.3 percent a year ago. The level is still well below the roughly 63 percent that prevailed before the recession, but some portion of the drop is because of demographic shifts, and the progress since the start of 2014 is impressive.On wages, the 0.3 percent rise in average hourly earnings in March and 2.3 percent rise in the last year is hardly the stuff of raucous celebration, but inflation has been low enough that this still represents a meaningful uptick in buying power for the average worker. And its gradual pace of growth, as mentioned earlier, means the Federal Reserve will feel comfortable sticking with a cautious, slow path of raising interest rates, rather than get any ideas that a huge outbreak of inflation is on the way.The economy has a lot of profound problems, and the damage of the 2008 recession is still not fully healed. But the March numbers offer more comfort that, in terms of the job market at least, it\u2019s heading in the right direction.Advertisement"}

Kosovo broke away from Belgrade\u2019s rule in 1999 with the help of a NATO bombing campaign, and declared independence in 2008, though Serbia officially still considers it part of Serbian territory.While more than 100 countries, including the United States and most European countries, recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence, it remains unrecognized at the United Nations thanks to a Russian veto. But improving relations with Kosovo\u2019s government is a prerequisite for Serbia\u2019s European Union membership.\u201cVucic staying in office will not particularly affect the region, given his cooperation with the E.U.,\u201d said Boban Stojanovic, a political scientist at the University of Belgrade.Opponents accuse Mr. Vucic of using European Union ambitions to mask traits that belong to the Milosevic era: centralizing power and enriching his inner circle. The European Union has particularly criticized constraints on media freedom.Konstantin Samofalov, spokesman of the pro-European Social Democratic Party led by Boris Tadic, Serbia\u2019s president from 2004 to 2012, accused the Vucic government of \u201cerosion of media freedom, destruction of democratic institutions and devastation of the Serbian economy.\u201dBut liberal opposition to Mr. Vucic is fractious, divided on personal rather than political grounds, as the results showed.Mr. Vucic has said he will use a new, four-year mandate to push the difficult reforms needed for union membership. These include judicial, economic and political changes that experience from other former Communist countries in the region suggests will be complicated and often unpopular.His party\u2019s campaign focused on the message of four more years of stability to secure the nation\u2019s future. The liberal opposition was portrayed as yesterday\u2019s leaders and corrupt, and the nationalists as reckless anti-Europeans who would put the country at risk.During the campaign, the government said that postelection priorities would include privatizing state-owned enterprises, cutting the huge bill for public wages and attracting investors to Serbia, a strategically located country with low costs and favorable trade ties with the European Union, Russia and the Middle East. Many here doubt Mr. Vucic will deliver those reforms, but he continues to enjoy international support.\u201cAs I see it, the Serbian government would be capable of concluding E.U. membership talks in the next four years, with strong political will,\u201d said Liselott Agerlid, deputy head of mission at the Swedish Embassy in Belgrade. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t mean, though, that membership would follow immediately.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volodymyr Groysman Approved as New Prime Minister by Ukraine\u2019s Parliament", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 In Ukraine\u2019s most sweeping political reshuffle since its revolution two years ago, Parliament voted Thursday to seat a close ally of the president as prime minister and handed critical ministerial posts to presidential staff members.The previous government was swept into power in 2014 on a wave of popular anger at the authoritarian, corrupt and Russian-aligned presidency of Viktor F. Yanukovych. But infighting soon broke out among the victors, paralyzing the government and stalling International Monetary Fund aid for an economy on life support.Western countries \u2014 including the United States, which has increased military deployments in Eastern Europe along the western borders of Russia \u2014 have much at stake in Ukraine and are eager to prop up the country as a bulwark against Russian expansion. But the sharp-elbowed political fighting in Kiev and the failure to address deep-seated corruption that reaches the highest levels of the government are undermining those efforts.The initial signs for Mr. Groysman\u2019s government were not promising, as some pro-European lawmakers complained that it was concentrating evermore control in Ukraine\u2019s business and political clans, which in the past has been an invitation to large-scale corruption.\u201cWe are afraid there will be a monopolization of power,\u201d Alex Ryabchyn, a member of Parliament in the Fatherland party of a former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, said in a telephone interview. The Fatherland party did not back Mr. Groysman for premier.With the vote, three of the five parties that favor closer ties with Europe are now in open opposition to Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s government; two other pro-European parties backed the candidacy.Oleksandr Danylyuk, the deputy head of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s administration, was named minister of finance, replacing the American-born finance minister, Natalia Yaresko, who oversaw the bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and foreign creditors.Parliament elected as its new speaker Andriy Parubiy, an organizer of antigovernment street fighters during the 2014 uprising and a highly polarizing figure in Ukraine\u2019s east-west divide.Mr. Groysman, who at 38 will become Ukraine\u2019s youngest prime minister ever, is widely seen as beholden to Mr. Poroshenko. Before moving to Kiev after the 2014 revolution and winning a seat in Parliament as a member of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s party, he had served as mayor of Vinnytsya, a city intertwined in the business empire of Mr. Poroshenko, a confectionary magnate. A charity fund of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s business, for example, cooperated with the city government in 2011 to build a new fountain there.The vote for Mr. Groysman was 257 to 50, a wide victory that could help him navigate Ukraine\u2019s complex political waters with more success than his predecessor. But analysts say they doubt he has the political backing, even from the two parties that openly support him, to carry out a badly needed economic overhaul and a peace agreement with Russia and Russian-backed militants in eastern Ukraine, as demanded by the country\u2019s Western allies.The peace agreement, known as Minsk II, is being held up by a small but important party that is dead set against changing the Constitution to grant the separatist areas of eastern Ukraine the degree of autonomy called for in the accord.Opponents of Mr. Groysman, who served previously as speaker of Parliament, greeted his election with shouts of \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d He seemed to take that in stride, saying in his acceptance speech, \u201cAll these discussions in this hall will go down in history as just words.\u201d He added, \u201cThe shame is on those who in 24 years haven\u2019t given the people a good life.\u201dMr. Groysman said tackling corruption, opposing populism and improving state management would take priority in his government, despite the simmering conflict in the country\u2019s east.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking On the Ph.D. Later in Life", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byRetiringROBERT HEVEY was fascinated by gardening as a child, but then he grew up and took a 30-year career detour. Mr. Hevey earned a master\u2019s in business and became a certified public accountant, working for accounting firms and businesses ranging from manufacturing to enterprise software and corporate restructuring.\u201cI went to college and made the mistake of getting an M.B.A. and a C.P.A.,\u201d he recalled with a laugh.Now 61, Mr. Hevey is making up for lost time. He\u2019s a second-year Ph.D. student in a plant biology and conservation program offered jointly by Northwestern University and the Chicago Botanic Garden. Mr. Hevey, whose work focuses on invasive species, started on his master\u2019s at age 53, and he expects to finish his doctorate around five years from now, when he will be 66.\u201cWhen I walk into a classroom of 20-year-olds, I do raise the average age a bit,\u201d he says.While the overall age of Ph.D. candidates has dropped in the last decade, about 14 percent of all doctoral recipients are over age 40, according to the National Science Foundation. Relatively few students work on Ph.D.s at Mr. Hevey\u2019s age, but educators are seeing increasing enrollment in doctoral programs by students in their 40s and 50s. Many candidates hope doctorates will help them advance careers in business, government and nonprofit organizations; some, like Mr. Hevey, are headed for academic research or teaching positions.At Cornell University, the trend is driven by women. The number of new female doctoral students age 36 or older was 44 percent higher last year than in 2009, according to Barbara Knuth, senior vice provost and dean of the graduate school.\u201cOne of the shifts nationally is more emphasis on career paths that call for a Ph.D.,\u201d Dr. Knuth said. \u201cPart of it is that we have much more fluidity in career paths. It\u2019s unusual for people to hold the same job for many years.\u201d\u201cThe people we see coming back have a variety of reasons,\u201d she added. \u201cIt could be a personal interest or for career advancement. But they are very pragmatic and resilient: strong thinkers, willing to ask questions and take a risk in their lives.\u201dMany older doctoral candidates are motivated by a search for meaning, said Katrina Rogers, president of Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, Calif., which offers programs exclusively for adult learners in psychology, human and organizational development and education.\u201cStudents are asking what they can do with the rest of their lives, and how they can have an impact,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are approaching graduate school as a learning process for challenging themselves intellectually, but also along cognitive and emotional lines.\u201dMaking a home for older students also makes business sense for universities and colleges, said Barbara Vacarr, director of the higher education initiative at Encore.org, a nonprofit organization focused on midlife career change. \u201cThe convergence of an aging population and an undersupply of qualified traditional college students are both a call to action and an opportunity for higher education.\u201dSome schools are serving older students in midcareer with pragmatic doctoral programs that can be completed more quickly than the seven or eight years traditionally required to earn a Ph.D. Moreover, many of those do not require candidates to spend much time on campus or even leave their full-time jobs.That flexibility can help with the cost of obtaining a doctorate. In traditional programs, costs can range from $20,000 a year to $50,000 or more \u2014 although for some, tuition expenses are offset by fellowships. The shorter programs are less costly. The total cost at Fielding, for example, is $60,000.Susan Noyes, an occupational therapist in Portland, Me., with 20 years\u2019 experience under her belt, returned to school at age 40 for a master\u2019s degree in adult education at the University of Southern Maine, then pursued her Ph.D. at Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass. During that time, she continued to work full time and raise three children. She finished the master\u2019s at 44 \u2014 a confidence-builder that persuaded her to work toward a Ph.D. in adult learning, which she earned at age 49.Dr. Noyes, 53, made two visits annually to Lesley\u2019s campus during her doctoral studies, usually for a week to 10 days. She now works as an assistant professor of occupational therapy at the University of Southern Maine.At the outset of her graduate education, Dr. Noyes wasn\u2019t looking for a career change. Instead, she wanted to update her skills and knowledge in the occupational therapy field. But she soon found herself excited by the chance to broaden her intellectual horizons. \u201cI\u2019ve often said I accidentally got my Ph.D.,\u201d she said.Lisa Goff took the traditional Ph.D. path, spending eight years getting her doctorate in history. An accomplished business journalist, she decided to pursue a master\u2019s degree in history at the University of Virginia in 2001 while working on a book project. Later, she decided to keep going for her doctorate, which she earned in 2010, the year she turned 50. Her research is focused on cultural history, with a special interest in landscapes.Dr. Goff had planned to use the degree to land a job in a museum, but at the time, museum budgets were being cut in the struggling economy. Instead, a university mentor persuaded her to give teaching a try. She started as an adjunct professor in the American studies department at the University of Virginia, which quickly led to a full-time nontenure-track position. This year, her fourth full year teaching, her position was converted to a tenure-track job.\u201cI thought an academic job would be grueling \u2014 not what I wanted at all,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I love being in the classroom, finding ways to get students to contribute and build rapport with them.\u201dAs a graduate student, she never found the age gap to be a challenge. \u201cProfessors never treated me as anything but another student, and the other students were great to me,\u201d Dr. Goff said. The toughest part of the transition, she says, was the intellectual shock of returning to a rigorous academic environment. \u201cI was surprised to see just how creaky my classroom muscles were,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI really struggled in that first class just to keep up.\u201dMr. Hevey agrees, saying he has experienced more stress in his academic life than in the business world. \u201cI\u2019m using my brain in such a different way now. I\u2019m learning something new every day.\u201dHis advice to anyone considering a similar move? \u201cReally ask yourself if this is something you want to do. If you think it would just be nice to be a student again, that\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s not a life of ease: You\u2019ll be working all the time, perhaps for seven or eight years.\u201dMr. Hevey does not expect to teach, but he does hope to work in a laboratory or do research. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to start a new career at 66 or 67,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to go home and sit on the couch, either.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peabody Energy, a Coal Giant, Seeks Bankruptcy Protection", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byPeabody Energy, the world\u2019s largest publicly owned coal producer, with mines around the world from Australia to the United States, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Wednesday.The company was weighed down by the collapse of coal prices, increasing competition from natural gas and tightening regulations to control climate change.The bankruptcy filing came as no surprise after the company announced last month that it was delaying interest payments on two loans. It comes after a number of bankruptcy filings over the last two years by other coal companies, including industry giants like Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources.\u201cThis was a difficult decision, but it is the right path forward for Peabody,\u201d Glenn Kellow, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cThis process enables us to strengthen liquidity and reduce debt, build upon the significant operational achievements we\u2019ve made in recent years, and lay the foundation for long-term stability and success in the future.\u201dThe collapse in natural gas prices over the last three years and new environmental regulations by the Obama administration have led to a rapid decline of the industry, especially in the Appalachia region, where mines are deep and expensive to operate. Domestic production last year slumped to a three-decade low.Coal was once the provider of roughly half of the nation\u2019s power, but it was surpassed by natural gas as the No. 1 source of electricity for the first time a year ago.But many analysts say the bankruptcy filings do not mean the coal industry will disappear. Under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection laws, the companies have been exchanging debt to lenders for equity in the company, known in financial parlance as a debt-for-equity swap.Most energy experts say coal will probably provide as much as a third of the nation\u2019s power for years to come. They point out that several European and Asian countries continue to rely on coal for electricity, even as they try to turn more to renewable power sources like wind and solar.Peabody still produces coal for customers in 25 countries on six continents.\u201cIt\u2019s a very mixed picture,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS, the energy consulting firm. \u201cCoal plants in the U.S. will continue to retire, but coal will continue to be part of electricity generation in the United States.\u201dHe added, \u201cChina\u2019s plans, even with its renewables push, still show a rise in coal consumption.\u201dBut expectations for growing Asian economies proved to be unrealistic. Growth in steel production in China was disappointing as the country began to shift its economy from exports toward more domestic consumption. At the same time, India is expanding its railroad system to connect its own coal fields to domestic industry.Now, with the industry in near free fall, many banks are pulling away from financing coal projects. Utilities are closing aging coal-fired power plants rather than upgrade them to meet new environmental standards, in large part because the glut of natural gas has offered a cheaper alternative.While filing for protection for its American assets in Federal Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, Peabody disclosed that it has had problems selling holdings in Colorado and New Mexico. Peabody\u2019s last best hope to avert bankruptcy was its attempt to sell three mines to Bowie Resource Partners, but that company has had trouble raising the full $650 million in debt to acquire them.Not surprisingly, environmentalists who have been leading an effort to persuade investors and banks to divest from coal cheered the new bankruptcy.Peabody is cutting its payroll and otherwise curbing costs. Late last month, it cut 235 hourly and salaried employees from its North Antelope Rochelle mine in the Powder River Basin, roughly 15 percent of the mine\u2019s work force.Shares of the company have sold for around $2 in recent days after plunging in value by 99 percent since its high in 2008 just before the financial crisis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lower Growth Expectations Cloud World Finance Leaders\u2019 Forum", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The world\u2019s finance ministers opened their annual spring meeting here on Tuesday facing dampened expectations for global growth and warnings about financial risks and political movements toward nationalism and protectionism \u2014 in the United States and abroad.As the six-day gathering of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank began, the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for 2016 was more disappointing than worrisome: a modest 3.2 percent expansion much like last year, but 0.2 percentage points lower than projected in January.The report of the 188-country I.M.F. on the sluggish recovery from the 2008 recession did forecast a stronger recovery in 2017, but officials emphasized that global risks could thwart that. Among them were noneconomic risks, including terrorist attacks, waves of refugees and rising nationalism, as well as the impact of economic inequality.\u201cIn many countries, the lack of wage growth and greater inequality have created widespread senses that economic growth has mainly been to the benefit of economic elites,\u201d Maurice Obstfeld, economic counselor to the I.M.F., told reporters in outlining the latest World Economic Outlook.\u201cLower growth reinforces this trend turn toward inward-looking, nationalistic attitudes,\u201d he added, before echoing a remark by Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F.\u2019s managing director, in a speech last week in Frankfurt previewing the meeting, \u201cWe are on alert, not alarm.\u201dThe strength of the United States economy, the world\u2019s largest, is the bright spot, said the I.M.F. and the American contingent, led by Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. But the I.M.F. downgraded its forecast of American growth this year by 0.2 percentage points, to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent.Even that growth is vulnerable to headwinds from elsewhere \u2014 a slowdown in China, downturns in Brazil and Russia, tightening in other emerging economies, a fraying European Union threatened by the refugee crisis and potential departure of Britain, and the effect, especially in the Middle East and Africa, of low prices for oil and other commodities.The I.M.F. now projects Brazil\u2019s economy to shrink 3.8 percent. Its estimates for Japanese growth were cut in half, to 0.5 percent.Mr. Obstfeld cited two factors impeding growth in the United States: the decline of energy investment and a strong dollar that, despite recent weakening, has hurt manufacturers and other exporters, raising the cost of their goods relative to competitors\u2019.\u201cPerhaps what is more surprising is how robust the performance of the economy has been given these two major headwinds,\u201d he said.The assemblage of the I.M.F. and World Bank, two of the foremost international organizations created after World War II, is occurring as those economic, trade and security forums have been assailed in the American presidential contest, chiefly by Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, who repeatedly contends Americans are being \u201cripped off,\u201d and to a lesser extent by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic nominating race.Against that backdrop, Mr. Lew began this week with a public-relations counteroffensive. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, an essay in its Foreign Affairs magazine, and in interviews, he underscored the importance of the United States\u2019 continued leadership in institutions like the I.M.F. to advance its economic and national security interests and those of its allies.\u201cInternational economic cooperation has delivered benefits to the United States and other countries that would have been impossible to attain otherwise,\u201d Mr. Lew wrote. \u201cA major reason that the global financial crisis that began in late 2007 never turned into a second Great Depression is that the United States and other countries coordinated their efforts through the I.M.F. and the G-20,\u201d the group of top industrial nations, avoiding protectionism and starting simultaneous economic stimulus programs.For signs that the United States would continue to lead, Mr. Lew cited the Obama administration\u2019s success in the last year in winning the approval of the Republican-led Congress for legislation empowering the president to negotiate free-trade agreements, specifically the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal; reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank; tightening trade and customs enforcement; and, not least, ratifying an overhaul of the I.M.F. that doubled its resources and increased the influence of emerging powers like China and India.Yet that I.M.F. measure took five years to get through Congress, as Mr. Lew acknowledged, while the other bills also were tough to pass.\u201cMaking the case for sustained U.S. leadership is not always easy,\u201d Mr. Lew wrote. \u201cUnilateralism or isolationism often make for better sound bites.\u201dSimilarly, Ms. Lagarde, in her address last week, alluded to the appeal of populist critiques of internationalism.\u201cIt is no wonder that perceptions abound that the cards are stacked against the common man, and woman, in favor of elites,\u201d she said, also not naming politicians. \u201cThese frustrations are leading people to question established institutions and international norms. To some, the answer is to look inward, to somehow unwind these linkages, to close borders and retreat into protectionism.\u201d\u201cAs history has told us, time and again, this would be a tragic course,\u201d she added.Ms. Lagarde called on the United States to increase its work force by raising the federal minimum wage, strengthening \u201cfamily friendly\u201d benefits and expanding the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers.Mr. Lew advised the I.M.F. to do more to call out countries that manipulate currency to underprice exports, run up trade surpluses and keep their finances opaque.Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the start of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and World Bank misstated the percent to which the I.M.F. downgraded its forecast of American growth this year. It was downgraded to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent \u2014 not to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent.Advertisement"}

Macdonald\u2019s poetic debut in the United States, then, is a new old book \u2014 or an old new book \u2014 that contains the genetic code of her mature prose. Like DNA, the language of \u201cShaler\u2019s Fish\u201d is compressed, torqued and encrypted. \u201cTake a voice you know only\u2009/\u2009spliced, known as Pantagruel\u2009/\u2009and shut in a clasp of warm rose,\u201d the high-density ars poetica \u201cPoem\u201d opens.

For now, it\u2019s hard not to feel that Macdonald has done herself a disservice by recycling such fledgling work at this point in an otherwise extraordinary career.Rash\u2019s family has lived in the mountains of southern Appalachia since the 1700s. \u201cPoems: New and Selected\u201d assembles work from four prior collections \u2014 plus a handful of new lyrics \u2014 that chronicle the history of this region from its colonial settlement to the continuous present. An accomplished novelist, Rash in his verse foregrounds minor characters with names like Silas Broughton and Nolan White whose stories unfold in obscure places like Dismal Gorge, Parkson\u2019s Cove and Wildhog Ridge. What Robert Frost did for rural New England and Edgar Lee Masters for our small-town Midwest, Rash aims to do for the Appalachian experience.These poems salvage a literary ecology from lost meadows, overgrown junkyards and hidden mountain springs. \u201cLike a memory\u2009/\u2009surfaced long after,\u201d Rash\u2019s lines are entwined as deeply in the understory of the Smoky Mountains as a forgotten snarl of barbed wire, \u201ctime-dulled,\u2009/\u2009but still able to draw blood.\u201d A Southern Gothic legacy haunts the volume \u2014 with its funerals, vigils, ruined homesteads and economic hardship \u2014 but Rash illuminates his dark material with humor and tenderness, too. The most memorable poems here evoke a rural childhood with prehensile immediacy. \u201cThe first\u2009/\u2009blackberry pings the milk pail\u2019s\u2009/\u2009emptiness, begins the slow\u2009/\u2009filling up, the plush feel of\u2009/\u2009berries only yesterday\u2009/\u2009red-green knots before steeped in\u2009/\u2009dark to a deep purple hue,\u201d Rash writes, \u201cand as dawn passes, the pail\u2009/\u2009grows heavy, wearies my arm\u2009/\u2009until I sit down inside\u2009/\u2009that maze of briar I make\u2009/\u2009my kingdom.\u201dTradition-bound from beginning to end, these poems won\u2019t be mistaken for the work of a literary innovator. Occasionally, Rash\u2019s reverence for a romanticized version of white Southern masculinity flattens out the depth and diversity of Appalachian life. For a novelist, he can be surprisingly oblivious of women\u2019s psychologies, with one woman seeing herself in terms of \u201cface, breasts, child-widened hips.\u201d Such blind spots compromise Rash\u2019s memorialization of unsung histories throughout the collection. Nonetheless, the elegies for a landscape and its inhabitants in \u201cPoems: New and Selected\u201d leave us with a renewed sense of how \u201ctoo much too soon disappears.\u201dWeighing in at 586 pages, Young\u2019s \u201cBlue Laws\u201d may be a contender for heavyweight champion of midcareer poetry retrospectives on the basis of sheer volume alone. So it makes perfect sense that the great boxer Jack Johnson should deliver one of the compilation\u2019s knockout soliloquies. Like the Galveston Giant \u2014 \u201calways a swinger\u2009/\u2009a fast talker \u2014\u2009/\u2009my rights\u2009/\u2009the kind that broke\u2009/\u2009men\u2019s jaws\u201d \u2014 this poet makes a virtue of immodesty.\u201cBlue Laws\u201d celebrates black cultural traditions with the swagger of a prizefighter stepping into the ring. \u201cMama, I\u2019m the man\u2009/\u2009with the most\u2009/\u2009biggest feet,\u201d Young writes in the poem \u201cBoasts,\u201d advertising not only his own feet \u2014 both prosodic and pedestrian \u2014 but a vibrant historical vernacular as well. (The wry innuendo of these lines offers an object lesson on race and sexuality, too.) Incorporating poetic sequences on a range of historical figures \u2014 the painter Jean-Michel \u00adBasquiat, the \u00adcolonial-era poet Phillis Wheatley, the Amistad slave mutineers \u2014 as well as blues poems, odes to soul food and an imaginary black film noir in couplets, \u201cBlue Laws\u201d could serve as a sourcebook for African-American \u00adStudies 101.Any book about the history of a people is, in a sense, a book of elegies. Throughout \u201cBlue Laws,\u201d the political devastations of black experience frame Young\u2019s poetry of personal loss. In \u201cThe Mission,\u201d the sudden death of the poet\u2019s father elicits this meditation on how to live with an irremediable past: \u201cI have come to know\u2009/\u2009sorrow\u2019s\u2009/\u2009not noun\u2009/\u2009but verb, something\u2009/\u2009that, unlike living,\u2009/\u2009by doing right\u2009/\u2009you do less of.\u201d The formal economy of Young\u2019s best work attunes us to the grammar of sorrow and living alike.The American paradox \u2014 freedom and constraint, openness and exclusion, abundance and want \u2014 is visible in the maximalist dimensions and minimalist prosody of \u201cBlue Laws.\u201d Would a selection of, say, 400 pages have done the trick? Young ends his book with a declarative, triumphant and unanswerable question of his own: \u201cWhy not sing.\u201dSrikanth Reddy\u2019s latest collection of poetry is \u201cVoyager.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brighter Job Market, for Some", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byNew college graduates looking for their first full-time job have reason to be optimistic. After a string of dismal to lackluster years, the job outlook brightened considerably for the class of 2015. And despite uncertainty about the strength of the economy, recruiters, on-campus career specialists and economists remain generally upbeat about prospects for this year\u2019s graduates.Of course, applicants\u2019 experiences will vary, perhaps significantly, depending on their field of study and position sought.In contrast, anthropology, geography and mass media majors faced jobless rates upward of 8 percent. Liberal arts majors, whose studies emphasize critical thinking, communication and creativity, were nestled in between, at 5.8 percent.\u201cThe occupation-specific majors tend to do much better,\u201d said Jaison Abel, head of regional analysis at the New York Fed who conducted the analysis with Richard Deitz, senior economist there. \u201cEven within business, the more specific majors \u2014 accounting or finance \u2014 tend to do much better than those with a general major.\u201dJob conditions appear grimmer when viewed through the lens of another metric: the share of recent graduates (age 22 to 27 with bachelor\u2019s degree or higher) working in jobs that do not require degrees. That number hovered at 44 percent at the end of September, high by historical standards, according to the analysis. The low was about 38 percent in 2000.But this phenomenon, called underemployment, may not be unusual. The two economists point out that, through good and poor economic times, roughly one-third of all graduates occupy jobs that don\u2019t require a bachelor\u2019s degree. And even during the depths of the recession, new graduates had an advantage: Most weren\u2019t cashiers and baristas. They held higher-paying positions in areas like office and administrative support.What we\u2019re seeing, Dr. Abel said, are \u201cfairly typical trends of transitioning from college to the job market,\u201d and many who start careers in a low-skilled service job transition to a better job after gaining experience in the labor market.Paychecks have also edged higher. The median wage for recent graduates with only a bachelor\u2019s degree was $43,000 in 2015, up from $40,000 in 2014, according to the New York Fed report. (Individuals with only a high-school diploma had a median wage of $25,000 in 2015.)Meanwhile, the mood on campuses is encouraging. At Wake Forest University in North Carolina, the number of employers participating in on-campus recruiting events is holding steady with 2015, when attendees rose 33 percent compared to 2014.And at Rutgers University in New Jersey, nearly 300 employers attended its February career fair, about as many as its venues can handle. \u201cIf these 290 employers weren\u2019t in a hiring posture,\u201d said Rick Hearin, executive director of career services at Rutgers, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t invest their time and money to come to New Brunswick to recruit our students.\u201dTara Siegel Bernard is a personal finance reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kasich Channels Ronald Reagan in New York Speech", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "John Kasich, the Republican primary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most moderate candidate, worked to expand on promising poll numbers in New York with a speech this morning sharply criticizing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, without mentioning them by name.In the speech, the Ohio governor cast himself as a nuts-and-bolts choice who is more tolerant, more compassionate, and, as a successful state governor and a budget hawk while in Congress, more adept at handling the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly a leap, given his opponents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vows to deport millions of immigrants, ban Muslims from entering the United States and patrol neighborhoods where they live.Polls suggest that Mr. Kasich is the Republican candidate who would give Hillary Clinton the toughest battle in November, should they each become their respective parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nominees. But he has struggled to gain traction, so far winning only his home state. He is currently in second place in New York, which votes on April 19, behind Mr. Trump. Mr. Kasich remains in the race in hopes that if neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Cruz, both deeply unpopular with the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership, garner enough delegates necessary to win the nomination outright, he could prevail in a contested nominating convention in July.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kasich said this morning to the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Republican Club, according to the prepared text. Though Mr. Kasich has criticized Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misogynistic statements, he oddly did not address them in this speech.However, Mr. Kasich hit Mr. Trump hard on his immigration and foreign policy stances, such as they are, as part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpath to darkness\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz represent.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have heard proposals to create a religious test for immigration, to target neighborhoods for surveillance, impose draconian tariffs which would crush trade and destroy American jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have heard proposals to drop out of NATO, abandon Europe to Russia, possibly use nuclear weapons in Europe, end our defense partnerships in Asia, and tell our Middle East allies that they have to go it alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been offered hollow promises to impose a value-added tax, balance budgets through simple and whimsical cuts in \u00e2\u0080\u0098fraud, waste and abuse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn an optimistic speech that aimed to be Reaganesque, Mr. Kasich presented plans for a first 100 days in office. They include a balanced-budget plan, a menu of tax cuts and a plan for welfare, education, Medicaid, highway infrastructure and job training back to where we live in the states and strengthening of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s border in combination with a guest worker program.The full text of the speech is below.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo Paths\u00e2\u0080\u009dINTRODUCTIONThank you.And, thank you to the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Republican Club.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pleasure to be here in this wonderful and historic clubhouse.This organization is so steeped in history of its own as well as in the history of this city, our party and the country.The Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Republican Club was founded by leaders of the suffrage movement.With their new voting rights in mind, this clubhouse was intended to be a place where women could meet and share knowledge about political issues so as to be better informed participants in the electoral process.As new voters, women could participate in the choice between candidates and ideas.It is in that spirit that I speak to you today.I am going to talk today about the choice America faces in this election.It is a choice between two paths\u00e2\u0080\u0094two very different paths.As we make this choice, the world is watching.The world is watching because America is civilization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brightest beacon.Freedom-loving people depend on our leadership for peace and stability.Civilization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies only seek our fall.Presidents come and presidents go, and while the President does really matter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the democratic principles that have made us that leader for more than two centuries and that have been sturdy enough to transcend political and ideological differences, a civil war, two world wars, and a century of technological and societal upheaval.Through it all we have remained history\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest force for good because we have stayed true to who we are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.This election may well be one of the most consequential of many generations because the next President will face so many complex pressures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from within and without.They will force tough decisions from not only our leaders but from each of us, and we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always like our options.The issues we confront \u2013 from fighting ISIS, handling Russia, China, North Korea and the Middle East to addressing displaced workers, civil rights and the new plague of drug addiction at home as well as slow economic growth and rising debt are all \u00e2\u0080\u009cCRITICAL.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe importance of making the right choices certainly cannot be under-stated.It can overload us if we let it.But even in the face of this multitude of complex, thorny problems, clarity can emerge.From the fog of anxiety, the seemingly endless choices can be reduced and then reduced again and reduced again and they eventually are whittled down to just two.Here they are: Will we turn our backs on the ideals of America that have seen us through for more than two centuries; or, are we going to reaffirm that America is, in Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis last best hope for man on earth?\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis is our choice.\u00c2\u00a0A Path to DarknessFor some, the challenges we face, the myriad choices, the potential changes that each decision presents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it could give rise to fear or anger.It could be paralyzing.The response for some is to retreat into the past\u00e2\u0080\u0094to yearn for \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe way things used to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo these people, today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s America is only seen as a broken place, and the people who did the breaking are \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe other:\u00e2\u0080\u009d people with more money\u00e2\u0080\u0094or less money, people with different-sounding last names, or different religious beliefs, or different colored skin or lifestyles or \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you get the idea\u2026We have been told that, because of all this change, America has become dark, that we have succumbed and that we are no longer strong.We are told that we are no longer respected in the world.In fact, we are even told that foreign governments are actually controlling our destiny because they have become smarter than us and tougher than us.This picture of America in economic and moral decline is, of course, always followed up with warnings of our impending destruction.For many Americans these fears and this outlook are as real as the building we are in today.And the anger they cause is real.It is true, we are fighters in America, but we fight for what is good and what is right \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and when we do that we win.Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let anyone ever tell you otherwise.When we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins.For those who are angry or afraid, I want to assure you there is another, better way.Some who feed off of the fears and anger that is felt by some of us and exploit it feed their own insatiable desire for fame or attention.That could drive America down into a ditch, not make us great again.Just as disturbing are the solutions they offer.We have heard proposals to create a religious test for immigration, to target neighborhoods for surveillance, impose draconian tariffs which would crush trade and destroy American jobs.We have heard proposals to drop out of NATO, abandon Europe to Russia, possibly use nuclear weapons in Europe, end our defense partnerships in Asia, and tell our Middle East allies that they have to go it alone.We have been offered hollow promises to impose a value-added tax, balance budgets through simple and whimsical cuts in \u00e2\u0080\u009cfraud, waste and abuse.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWe have been promised that unpopular laws shall be repealed simply through the will of a strong man in the White House and that Supreme Court justices will be empowered with some new extra-constitutional ability to investigate former public officials.I have stood on a stage and watched with amazement as candidates wallowed in the mud, viciously attacked one another, called each other liars and disparaged each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character.Those who continuously push that type of behavior are not worthy of the office they are seeking.And as for me, I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land.Just as an all-consuming fear of America in decline ends in visions of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s destruction, a political strategy based on exploiting Americans instead of lifting them up inevitably leads to divisions, paranoia, isolation, and promises that can never, ever be fulfilled.I say to you that this path to darkness is the antithesis of all that America has meant for 240 years.\u00c2\u00a0America IS GreatSome have a different response to the pressures they see bearing down on America\u00e2\u0080\u0094and themselves.It would never occur to me that America would break\u00e2\u0080\u0094or could break\u00e2\u0080\u0094from challenges to our economy or security.We harden with resolve through ingenuity and coming together.We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit by idly and expect fate or destiny to sweep in and rescue us.We always roll up our sleeves and get to work when the going gets tough.We have never seen the American spirit fail.America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength is that we are bound by shared ideas, by communities and families and people who are free, creative and giving.This is what makes America great, not some politician or some law.The spirit of our country rests in us.And, notwithstanding all our challenges, America still is great.Take any measure, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life expectancy, medicine, nutrition, technology, innovation, transportation or even economic power.America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy is still the largest and most productive in the world.We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bigger than the next two economies \u2013 China and Japan \u2013 combined.America still leads the world in making things.America is among the largest exporters of goods and services in the world.America is home to six out of the top ten universities in the world.America is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventor and leads in intellectual property.Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let anybody, particularly a politician, tell you that America is not great.That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t capable of drifting.We can\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we have been.And, too many Americans are still being left behind\u00e2\u0080\u0094or are making it but feel betrayed by a system that became \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo big to fail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo many feel that government and politicians have betrayed them.There are a lot of Americans who ask why no one is speaking for them?Why is it, no one is working for you?Why is it, you hear all these promises from politicians and nothing comes of it?And, you are right.For too long, politicians have been making promises based upon polling or what was politically expedient.That is not leadership.Leadership is the willingness to walk a lonely road with a team of people with their eyes fixed on the horizon focused on solving problems and healing our country.Leading is serving.\u00c2\u00a0Another PathThere is a better, higher path.True leadership means pursuing it, even if it is hard.The sacrifice is part of the job, however, because leaders can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lead unless they are servants first.To run for President you have to respect the dignity of a job where close to 320 million people are depending on you.Our campaigns should be full of ideas that provide energy and solutions, innovations and excitement for whatever office we are running for.Because we all have to look our families in the eyes and know that we raised the bar.I want to be able to look my wife and daughters in the eyes and know that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of me and the campaign we are running.American leadership is at its finest when it buckles on that irrepressible \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan do\u00e2\u0080\u009d spirit that says anything is possible and that everyone can participate in America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blessings.You see, we can restore our economy, rebuild our military, make America safe from terrorism and re-engage as the leader in the world again.We can do this with reasonable and proven solutions rooted in the American ideals that have seen us through tough days before.The proven solutions are right in front of us.We know what needs to be done.There is no better and quicker cure to America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenges than to grow the economy and stimulate private sector job creation.To have the resources to solve problems we need economic strength.In the 90s when we balanced the federal budget, paid down the federal debt, cut taxes and created surpluses, the result was a sustained period of economic growth, lower interest rates, job creation and national prosperity.Businesses were growing, unemployment was at historic lows and nearly anyone who wanted a job, could have one.In fact, the labor market became a buyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market for the job seeker.This was no small feat.Think for a moment about what we did: for the first time since Americans walked on the moon the federal government had a balanced budget.We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only balance the budget.We were also able to reform welfare, end generational dependency; reform the pentagon to strengthen our defenses, cut the capital gains tax and much more.You know, I tell younger audiences about this and they look at me like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crazy.They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it ever happened.But, we know it did and it can happen again.It just takes leadership, the will to challenge the status quo and a willingness to work across the aisle.Yes, we have to be willing to work with the other party.I believe that Americans are not only fed up with Washington for what they have not done but also tired of the partisan bickering.That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you compromise your principles.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone would accuse Ronald Reagan of compromising his principles, but he did work with the Democrat Speaker, Tip O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neil.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because Ronald Reagan was a leader.The job of a leader is to first slow down and listen.Then, you set an agenda that meets America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs and you bring everyone together to make it reality.There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no place for dividing, polarizing, pointing fingers or trading on short term political gain.I hold to this philosophy of leadership because I watched great leaders practice it successfully and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it work in my own experience.I worked for ten years to pass that balanced budget.It was hard work.When I became chairman of the budget committee, our team was able to get it done \u2013 even with a Democrat in the White House.We were proud when we reformed welfare and as a member of the Armed Services Committee we all came together to reform the Pentagon and realign our military services that resulted in a central command structure that allowed the services to work together.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same formula we used in Ohio.We were facing an $8 billion deficit and had lost 350,000 jobs.In a few short years we turned that deficit into a surplus of $2 billion and gave Ohioans the largest tax cut of any state in the country.We even repealed the death tax.Ohio has now created 417,000 private sector jobs.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working.And we continue to work to make sure that no one is left behind.This can work for America again as well.This is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proposed a 100 Day agenda for when I am President.When we do these things, we will unleash economic growth which means more jobs, higher wages, and the restoration of the American Dream that our children will inherit a better America than we received from our parents.We will resume leadership of the world and as we do that we will treat our veterans with respect and lift them to make sure they have what they need whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healthcare, jobs or housing.When America is strong, less dependent on debt and growing economically, we can reclaim our place as a leader in the world.Finally, when America is strong and actively engaged in the world, the world is a safer place and America is a safer place.You know, this is why we do these things.This is about how we want our country to be.You see, economic growth is not an end unto itself.It is a means to make possible everything we want for our nation and our communities and our families.And, by the way, as we have growth, we have the ability to bring in from the cold those who live in the shadows, those who are forgotten.The poor, the mentally ill, the disabled.As Americans, we believe that everyone deserves a chance to get ahead.We give them the chance when we give them a hand.Everyone should have an opportunity to pursue their God given destiny.\u00c2\u00a0The American SpiritYes, there is much to fix in America.Yes, there are reasons for our anxieties and fears.Our country has been drifting.Why?Because we have forgotten the formula that makes us strong and caved to political considerations instead.We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seemed to have lost our way.We are stalled.We are at risk of jeopardizing a better future for our children.I understand why Americans are fearful and distrustful and looking for a reason for the way they feel.I was raised in a small Pennsylvania steel town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people would be out of work.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awful to feel that insecurity.To feel that circumstances are out of your control.To feel like nobody cares and all the institutions have abandoned you.But, we Americans have overcome challenges before.Some think that the anger some Americans are expressing is defined by some nostalgic look backward for simpler times.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree.What Americans are looking for is that quality of leadership we are sorely missing from the past to address today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems.At each moment of crises in America, we have united as a country and a people.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been our secret weapon.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so simple but it is also invincible.I spoke earlier about the spirit of our country.But, let me say, our strength and spirit does not reside with a president or any politician.Our strength resides within ourselves.The spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods.It rests in our people.We are the ones with the strength to change the world.The power is within each and every one of us.A united America is undefeatable.We are an exceptional country.And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because we are the exception in history \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we are not an ethnic group or religion or language.We are that last great hope for earth that Reagan often spoke of, because we have shown that when people from many different backgrounds and ideas and beliefs come together with a common, noble purpose\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be free and just\u00e2\u0080\u0094we are unbeatable.\u00c2\u00a0Two PathsTwo paths.One choice\u00e2\u0080\u0094the path that exploits anger, encourages resentment, turns fear into hatred and divides people.This path solves nothing, demeans our history, weakens our country and cheapens each of us.It has but one beneficiary and that is to the politician who speaks of it.The other path is the one America has been down before.It is well trod, it is at times steep, but it is solid.It is the same path our forebears took together.It is from this higher path that we are offered the greater view.And, imagine for a moment with me that view.Fear turns to hope because we remember to take strength from each other.Uncertainty turns to peace because we reclaim our faith in the American ideals that have carried us upward before.And America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed decline becomes its finest hour, because we came together to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cno\u00e2\u0080\u009d to those who would prey on our human weakness and instead chose leadership that serves, helping us look up, not down.This is the path I believe in.This is the America I believe in.And, this is the America I know all Americans want us to be.Please, join me on this higher path.Together, united, we can reclaim the America we love and hold so dear.And lift all of us up to partake in its, and the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, many blessings.Thank you.Advertisement"}

It was also substantial among middle-aged Americans, sending a signal of deep anguish from a group whose suicide rates had been stable or falling since the 1950s.The increases were so widespread that they lifted the nation\u2019s suicide rate to 13 per 100,000 people, the highest since 1986. The rate rose by 2 percent a year starting in 2006, double the annual rise in the earlier period of the study. In all, 42,773 people died from suicide in 2014, compared with 29,199 in 1999.Researchers also found an alarming increase among girls 10 to 14, whose suicide rate, while still very low, had tripled. The number of girls who killed themselves rose to 150 in 2014 from 50 in 1999. \u201cThis one certainly jumped out,\u201d said Sally Curtin, a statistician at the center and an author of the report.American Indians had the sharpest rise of all racial and ethnic groups, with rates rising by 89 percent for women and 38 percent for men. White middle-aged women had an increase of 80 percent.The rate declined for just one racial group: black men. And it declined for only one age group: men and women over 75.\u201cThis is part of the larger emerging pattern of evidence of the links between poverty, hopelessness and health,\u201d said Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard and the author of \u201cOur Kids,\u201d an investigation of new class divisions in America.The rise in suicide rates has happened slowly over many years. Federal health researchers said they chose 1999 as the start of the period they studied because it was a low point in the national suicide rate and they wanted to cover the full period of its recent sustained rise.Policy makers say efforts to prevent suicide across the country are spotty. While some hospitals and health systems screen for suicidal thinking and operate good treatment programs, many do not.She noted that while N.I.H. funding for suicide prevention projects had been relatively flat \u2014 rising to $25 million in 2016 from $22 million in 2012 \u2014 it was a small fraction of funding for research of mental illnesses, including mood disorders like depression.The new federal analysis noted that the methods of suicide were changing. About one in four suicides in 2014 involved suffocation, which includes hanging and strangulation, compared with fewer than one in five in 1999. Suffocation deaths are harder to prevent because nearly anyone has access to the means, Ms. Hempstead said. And while the share of suicides involving guns declined \u2014 guns went from being involved in 37 percent of female suicides to 31 percent, and from 62 percent to 55 percent for men \u2014 the total number of gun suicides increased..The question of what has driven the increases is unresolved, leaving experts to muse on the reasons.Disappointed expectations of social and economic well-being among less educated white men from the baby-boom generation may also be playing a role, she said. They grew up in an era that valued \u201cmasculinity and self-reliance\u201d \u2014 characteristics that could get in the way of asking for help.\u201cIt appears this group isn\u2019t seeking help but rather turning to self-destructive means of dealing with their despair,\u201d Professor Phillips said.Another possible explanation: an economy that has eaten away at the prospects of families on the lower rungs of the income ladder.\u201cThere was a consistent pattern,\u201d he said, which held for all ages between 25 and 64. \u201cWhen the economy got worse, suicides went up, and when it got better, they went down.\u201dBut other experts pointed out that the unemployment rate had been declining in the latter period of the study, and questioned how important the economy was to suicide.The gap in suicide rates for men and women has narrowed because women\u2019s rates are increasing faster than men\u2019s. But men still kill themselves at a rate 3.6 times that of women. Though suicide rates for older adults fell over the period of the study, men over 75 still have the highest suicide rate of any age group \u2014 38.8 per 100,000 in 2014, compared with just four per 100,000 for their female counterparts.Advertisement"}

AOL eventually did exactly that, though Starboard did not gain any board seats.

Mr. Zuckerberg would obtain a large amount of C shares that he can donate without diluting his voting power in the company. Most investors currently hold A shares, which only have about a quarter of the overall shareholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 voting power so they may not be forgoing much if they choose to sell their A shares versus their C shares.

Let\u2019s make sure they know their place. Keep them in check and all else falls into line, or at least America notches one victory amid so many defeats.That must be the thinking behind Republican efforts to push through so-called religious liberty laws and other legislation \u2014 most egregiously in North Carolina \u2014 that excuse and legitimize anti-gay discrimination. They\u2019re cynical distractions. Politically opportunistic sideshows.And the Republicans who are promoting them are playing a short game, not a long one, by refusing to acknowledge a clear movement in our society toward L.G.B.T. equality, a trajectory with only one shape and only one destination.They\u2019re also playing a provincial game, not a national one, and scoring points in their corners of the universe at the expense of the Republican Party\u2019s image from north to south and coast to coast, a brand that needed a makeover \u2014 remember the broadly ballyhooed \u201cautopsy\u201d following Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat? \u2014 and somehow didn\u2019t get so much as a tweezed eyebrow or dab of blush.Yes, two of the four longest-lasting candidates for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are the sons of Cuban immigrants, but much of the oratorical gunfire they exchanged revolved around who would be tougher on immigration. The autopsy didn\u2019t recommend that.It takes forever in this country to build a new bridge, tunnel or train line, but it took no time flat for politicians in the Tar Heel State to convene a special session, formally ostracize North Carolina\u2019s L.G.B.T. voters and wrap conservative Christians in a tight embrace. Who says America\u2019s can-do spirit is dead?What happened in North Carolina is a problem for Republicans atop the major trouble (Cruz, Donald Trump) that they already had. It exposes divides within the party that are ever more difficult to paper over and contradictions that aren\u2019t easy to explain away.While the marriage of the party\u2019s evangelical and business wings has never been a cuddly one, it\u2019s especially frosty now, their incompatible desires evident in the significant number of prominent corporations that have denounced the North Carolina law and that successfully pressed the Republican governor of Georgia, Nathan Deal, to veto recent legislation that would have permitted the denial of services to L.G.B.T. people by Georgians citing religious convictions.So they\u2019re increasingly at loggerheads with the G.O.P., whose gay-rights advocates are still in the minority and whose socially conservative members still profit from and promote a derisive view of gays.The gay-rights front isn\u2019t the only one on which there\u2019s tension between the party and big business. The Republican primaries are awash in anti-immigrant sentiment and screed; corporate America generally backs immigration reform. The protectionism and nativism that have had such currency in the contest so far conflict with many corporations\u2019 interests.THE party\u2019s anti-gay efforts not only undermine its pro-business stance but also contradict conservatives\u2019 exaltation of local decision making. The North Carolina law was drafted and passed expressly to undo and override an ordinance in the state\u2019s most populous city, Charlotte, that extended L.G.B.T. protections against discrimination to transgender people who want to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The law went so far as to forbid any municipality from instituting its own anti-discrimination protections, lest they contradict the state\u2019s.Apparently conservatives love the concept of local control when the locality being given control tilts right, but they have a different view when it leans left. Rural sensibilities must be defended while cosmopolitan ones are dismissed.North Carolina harbors both. Its tensions are America\u2019s in miniature, and in terms of gay rights, they\u2019re a reminder that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last June to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide was hardly the finish of the fight.That ruling was certain to prompt the kind of backlash now occurring in North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere, because the steadily growing majority of Americans who favor gay equality is not yet overwhelming, and the climate of acceptance changes greatly from state to state and county to county.Too many of us L.G.B.T. Americans and our allies were too busy celebrating to stay alert to that. Too few of us acknowledged the tenaciousness of opponents who will resort to whatever they must, including the hallucinated specter of male sexual predators entering women\u2019s restrooms, to sweep aside anti-discrimination laws that include us and to turn public sentiment against us.They\u2019ll also steal oxygen from matters more central to this country\u2019s continued vitality and prosperity.Look, I used to be a restaurant critic. I know dessert is important. But if you want to make America great again, you can\u2019t waste time worrying about who\u2019s cutting the wedding cake.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina and Mississippi See Tourist Backlash After L.G.B.T. Laws", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byThe reaction has been swift.While the celebrity response is drawing considerable attention, the travel industry in each state is more concerned about lower-profile visitors: the everyday tourists who have already begun canceling trips or planning vacations elsewhere.The effect is already being felt in North Carolina, which last month passed a law that limits transgender people to using bathrooms that match the sex on their birth certificates. Tourism is a crucial driver of the economy in the state, the sixth most-visited in the country, where domestic travelers spent a record $21.3 billion in 2014, according to Visit North Carolina, the state\u2019s tourist board.Dr. Barbara Risman, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the former president of the Southern Sociological Society, a Virginia-based group dedicated to sociological research, recently canceled the group\u2019s conference of 1,200 attendees at the Westin, scheduled for 2019, because of the law. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to spend our money in a state that discriminates against the L.G.B.T. community,\u201d she said, \u201cand since our members often bring their families along to the conferences and stay in the destination for a few days after for fun, we\u2019re talking about tourist dollars from airfare, hotel rooms and meals not going to Charlotte.\u201dThomas Maloney, the senior director of government affairs for Marriott, said its properties\u2019 handful of cancellations may not have a big financial effect now, but the brand was taking a longer view. \u201cThe biggest risk we are looking to measure is not cancellations right now but bookings that don\u2019t come in down the line,\u201d he said.Mississippi is facing its own backlash among tourists in response to a law that allows people to discriminate against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people based on religious grounds. Like North Carolina, the state is highly dependent on its travel industry. In 2015, travel and tourism total employment \u2014 direct, indirect and induced \u2014 was 117,685, or 10.5 percent of statewide employment, according to Visit Mississippi.Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi did not respond to requests for comment but said on Twitter that hotel occupancy rates at non-casino hotels had risen compared with those a year ago. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend may not hold.Travel industry executives and officials in North Carolina and in Mississippi are attempting to counter the message that they say the legislation delivers. Mr. Hughes on April 12 introduced the Mississippi Economic Tourism and Recovery Act to the House, which would prevent businesses and individuals from discriminating against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.The Mississippi travel industry is also expressing a welcoming attitude in dealing with the effects of the bill that was passed there on March 30. Linda G. Hornsby of the Mississippi Hotel and Lodging Association said: \u201cThe first thing we did after the bill was passed was to put up a banner on our website that says, \u2018Everyone Is Welcome Here,\u2019 because that\u2019s how we feel. This law is not what Mississippi is about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stern to convert the building, a 37-story office tower between 55th and 56th Streets that was most recently inhabited by Sony, to apartments. An international hotel group said it would build a five-star hotel on eight floors, and Mr. Chetrit filed plans to create a triplex penthouse with a marble staircase and a record $150 million price tag.Now, in the latest example of the slowdown at real estate\u2019s highest end, Mr. Chetrit signed a deal this week to sell the tower for $1.4 billion to the Olayan Group, which is controlled by a Saudi family, and Chelsfield, which manages its properties. The companies said the building would become, yes, an office building.Mr. Chetrit and his partner, David Bistricer, were under pressure to pay off short-term loans on the property totaling $925 million. They also had trouble obtaining a construction loan as lenders became wary of projects promising oversize prices and profits.Mr. Bistricer said he and Mr. Chetrit were prohibited from talking about the deal until the sale closed at the end of May.\u201cIt was providential,\u201d said Nancy Packes, a consultant for luxury residential projects, that Mr. Chetrit was able to find a cash-rich buyer for the building. Over the past three years, she said, the market for billionaire apartment buyers has gone from \u201cmush to ice.\u201d\u201cEven breaking even is a win,\u201d added Ms. Packes, who was not working on the 550 Madison project.It was unclear how much money the partners made. Estimated interest payments for the building totaled $180 million over three years, and property taxes for that period came to nearly $45 million, according to public records. Some of those costs were covered by the rent Sony paid to continue to occupy the building. The company recently moved.The partners also presumably had to pay millions of dollars for lawyers, architectural plans and the marketing firm for the project.But in 2013, when Sony put the office tower on the auction block, the residential market was white hot. Mr. Chetrit outbid commercial developers with a $1.1 billion offer. Sony leased the space for another three years as it looked for a new home, while Mr. Chetrit and Mr. Bistricer began making their plans.Mr. Chetrit is not the only developer who has been affected by the recent disappearance of buyers willing to pay $100 million for an apartment.This year, there were about three dozen buildings in Manhattan offering apartments priced around $5,000 a square foot. But sales have slowed drastically, even at One57 and 432 Park, two of the most luxurious new buildings that sit along a stretch of 57th Street known as Billionaires\u2019 Row.One developer has scrapped plans to build a superluxury tower on the site of the Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South. Another developer who wanted to build a high-end tower near Sutton Place is in bankruptcy court. And now Mr. Chetrit\u2019s plans have fizzled.\u201cThe appetite of that group of investors has dimmed,\u201d Ms. Packes said.Still, there are three superluxury towers under construction on 57th Street alone.And New York is still regarded as a relatively safe haven for the world\u2019s superrich. But the richest apartment hunters have largely retreated from buying very expensive apartments as investments, brokers said, because of the collapse of oil prices, weaknesses in the Chinese and Russian economies, and crises in Africa and the Middle East.But Mr. Bistricer, while not addressing 550 Madison directly, said the situation was not so dire. Contrary to most developers and real estate executives, there is \u201cno shortage of money for big projects,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put together the right sponsors, the right banks, you\u2019ll find financing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Griesa of the United States District Court in Manhattan to lift an injunction that had barred Argentina from paying its creditors and eventually led the country to default in 2014.The ruling caps years of bitter legal wrangling that goes back to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on nearly $100 billion of bonds. A small group of holdout investors, including the hedge fund billionaire Paul E. Singer, refused to take part in two debt restructurings by Argentina since then.Argentina is now poised to raise more than $12 billion through bond sales, the proceeds of which will pay its holdout creditors. Top officials from Argentina will travel to New York and other American cities this week to meet with potential investors.\u201cThis is going to be settled next week,\u201d Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentina\u2019s economy minister, told journalists in New York, where he is pitching Argentina\u2019s multibillion bond sale to investors, according to news media reports in Argentina.

{"Headline": "After South Korea Spurns Park Geun-hye, She May Press Agenda Abroad", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 President Park Geun-hye of South Korea had hoped that this week\u2019s legislative elections would give her party a stronger majority in Parliament, one that would let her finally push through changes to labor law and other domestic initiatives that have long been stalled.\u201cShe will likely drive hard to boost her visibility in foreign policy to prevent herself from becoming a lame duck,\u201d said Kim Sung-han, a professor at Korea University in Seoul who served as a vice foreign minister under Ms. Park\u2019s predecessor. \u201cShe may emulate how President Obama has tried to avoid becoming a lame duck in his final years by engineering breakthroughs with Iran and Cuba and on such global agendas as climate change.\u201dMs. Park\u2019s conservative Saenuri Party did not merely lose its majority in Parliament in the elections on Wednesday, an outcome that few analysts had expected. It was reduced to becoming the No. 2 party in the 300-member body, winning a mere 122 seats \u2014 just short of the 123 won by the more progressive Minjoo Party. Minjoo favors reconciliation with North Korea, seeing Ms. Park\u2019s policy as too rigid and too focused on punishing Pyongyang with sanctions.The elections took place amid widespread anxiety over economic concerns, such as sluggish growth and rising youth unemployment. In addition, many South Koreans have been dissatisfied with the governing style of Ms. Park, whose term expires in early 2018 and who is barred under the Constitution from seeking re-election. Many see her as a disconnected and even arrogant leader.Ms. Park\u2019s foreign policy proved far less important to voters than domestic concerns. And policy-making authority here is concentrated in the presidency, limiting the legislature\u2019s influence on relations with the North and other countries.Still, analysts agreed on Thursday that Ms. Park\u2019s foreign policy, especially her approach to North Korea, would come under greater scrutiny in the new Parliament, the first in 16 years in which a party that does not hold the presidency has the most seats. A third, centrist party, the People\u2019s Party, whose 38 seats will give it considerable sway, also supports a conciliatory approach to North Korea.\u201cIt has become difficult for the government to get cooperation from the opposition parties without amending its North Korean policy, which is lopsidedly about imposing sanctions,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a research institute south of Seoul.Ms. Park\u2019s weakening domestic clout has also magnified the complex foreign policy challenges her country faces. Her government and Washington have been discussing deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, a United States antimissile system. But many of the progressives now in control in Parliament oppose such a deployment because it would raise tensions with China.As of Thursday evening, the only response to the elections from Ms. Park\u2019s office was a two-sentence statement urging Parliament to pass her economic legislation to improve the \u201clivelihood of the people.\u201dBut North Korea policy could be another matter, they said. Mr. Kim, the Korea University professor, said he expected Ms. Park to put a new emphasis on dialogue, accelerating efforts to induce Pyongyang to come to the negotiating table, using the pressure built up through sanctions as leverage.But Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said he thought it was also likely that Ms. Park would deploy adversarial language, highlighting the dangers posed by the North in a bid to consolidate support with her conservative base. \u201cHer government may even exaggerate the threats, trying to use national security to maintain her influence and relevance,\u201d Mr. Kim said.(On Thursday, the South Korean Defense Ministry said it was monitoring North Korea more closely on the suspicion that it planned to conduct another nuclear test or the first-ever flight test of its Musudan ballistic missile, whose range is long enough to reach United States military bases in Guam.)Over the years, many South Koreans have grown disillusioned with attempts to engage North Korea, which has often repaid economic largess from the South with armed provocation. There is also widespread wariness of exaggerating North Korean threats and starting witch hunts for Communist sympathizers \u2014 a practice that past conservative leaders, including Ms. Park\u2019s father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee, were accused of engaging in.The Saenuri Party\u2019s prolonged campaign against progressive South Koreans \u2014 whom it often refers to as \u201cjongbuk,\u201d or untrustworthy sympathizers with North Korea \u2014 has raised eyebrows among many politically moderate South Koreans. That campaign \u201chelped poison the voters\u2019 mood against the government party,\u201d said Mr. Kim, the Dongguk University professor.\u201cPeople have been tired of President Park continuing to talk about North Korea while their main concern was the economy,\u201d he said.Kim Dong-yup, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul, said Ms. Park was unlikely to make a drastic change in favor of reconciliation with the North, for fear of alienating conservative supporters.\u201cI wonder how many of those who voted against her party voted against it because of its North Korea policy,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cRather, they voted against it because of things like her arrogance as leader.\u201d\u201cBesides, would liberal South Koreans suddenly support her if she changed her North Korea policy? I doubt it,\u201d he said.Past attempts by South Korean presidents to reach out to the North toward the end of their terms have been poorly received. When the liberal President Roh Moo-hyun held a summit meeting in 2007 with North Korea\u2019s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, it was widely derided in the South as a desperate attempt to create a legacy. The subsequent conservative government nullified Mr. Roh\u2019s summit meeting deal with Mr. Kim, which called for substantial South Korean investment in the North.\u201cIf President Park now suddenly accosts North Korea for a deal to improve ties, it will certainly demand outrageous economic and other incentives,\u201d said Mr. Kim, the Kyungnam University analyst. \u201cShe could lose more than she gained.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Learning From Obama", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byAt the end of 2015 Mr. Obama was still underwater, with significantly more Americans disapproving than approving. Since then, however, his approval has risen sharply while disapproval has plunged. He\u2019s still only in modestly positive territory, but the net movement in polling averages has been about 11 percentage points, which is a lot.What\u2019s going on?Well, one answer is that voters have lately been given a taste of what really bad leaders look like. But I\u2019d like to think that the public is also starting to realize just how successful the Obama administration has been in addressing America\u2019s problems. And there are lessons from that success for those willing to learn.I know that it\u2019s hard for many people on both sides to wrap their minds around the notion of Obama-as-success. On the left, those caught up in the enthusiasms of 2008 feel let down by the prosaic reality of governing in a deeply polarized political system. Meanwhile, conservative ideology predicts disaster from any attempt to tax the rich, help the less fortunate and rein in the excesses of the market; and what are you going to believe, the ideology or your own lying eyes?But the successes are there for all to see.Start with the economy. You might argue that presidents don\u2019t have as much effect on economic performance as voters seem to imagine \u2014 especially presidents facing scorched-earth opposition from Congress for most of their time in office. But that misses the point: Republicans have spent the past seven years claiming incessantly that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies are a \u201cjob killing\u201d disaster, destroying business incentives, so it\u2019s important news if the economy has performed well.The details have been something of a surprise: fewer people than expected signing up on the exchanges, but fewer employers than expected dropping coverage, and more people signing up for Medicaid \u2014 which means, incidentally, that Obamacare is looking much more like a single-payer system than anyone seems to realize. But the point is that reform has indeed delivered the big improvements in coverage it promised, and has done so at lower cost than expected.Last but one hopes not least, the Obama administration has used executive authority to take steps on the environment that, if not canceled by a Republican president and upheld by future Supreme Courts, will amount to very significant action on climate change.All in all, it\u2019s quite a record. Assuming Democrats hold the presidency, Mr. Obama will emerge as a hugely consequential president \u2014 more than Reagan. And I\u2019m sure Republicans will learn a lot from his achievements.April fools!The 2008 election didn\u2019t bring the political transformation Obama enthusiasts expected, nor did it destroy the power of the vested interests: Wall Street, the medical-industrial complex and the fossil fuel lobby are all still out there, using their money to buy influence. But they have been pushed back in ways that have made American lives better and more secure.The lesson of the Obama years, in other words, is that success doesn\u2019t have to be complete to be very real. You say you want a revolution? Well, you can\u2019t always get what you want \u2014 but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The 8 A.M. Call", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byAs it turned out, once in office Mr. Obama, a notably coolheaded type who listens to advice, handled foreign affairs pretty well \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how I see it. But asking how a would-be president might respond to crises is definitely fair game.And military emergencies aren\u2019t the only kind of crisis to worry about. That 3 a.m. call is one thing; but what about the 8 a.m. call \u2013 the one warning that financial markets will melt down as soon as they open?For make no mistake about it: The world economy is still a dangerous place. Financial reform has, I\u2019d argue, made our system somewhat more robust than it was in 2008, but fumbling the response to a shock could still have disastrous consequences. So what do we know about the shocks we might face, and how the people who might be president would respond?Right now there are two fairly obvious potential economic flash points: China and oil.Then there\u2019s a potential oil crisis, very different from the ones we used to have: the problem now is a glut, not a shortage, with many producers having run up large debts they probably can\u2019t repay. You could say that shale oil is the new subprime.Nobody knows how big these problems could become, or what other potential crises we\u2019re missing. But it seems all too likely that the next president will have to deal with some kind of financial turmoil. How will she or he perform?At this point there are three candidates who have a serious chance of receiving their party\u2019s presidential nomination. Barring the political equivalent of a meteor strike, Mrs. Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. Donald Trump is the clear front-runner on the G.O.P. side, but if he falls short of an outright majority on the first ballot, Ted Cruz might still pull it out. So what do we know about their economic policy skills?Well, Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t just the most knowledgeable, well-informed candidate in this election, she\u2019s arguably the best-prepared candidate on matters economic ever to run for president. She could nonetheless mess up \u2014 but ignorance won\u2019t be the reason.On the other side, I doubt that anyone will be shocked if I say that Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t know much about economic policy, or for that matter any kind of policy. He still seems to imagine, for example, that China is taking advantage of America by keeping its currency weak \u2014 which was true once upon a time, but bears no resemblance to current reality.Oh, and coping with crisis in the modern world requires a lot of international cooperation. Things like currency swap lines (don\u2019t ask) played a much bigger role than most people realize in avoiding a second Great Depression. How well do you think that kind of cooperation would work in a Trump administration?Mr. Cruz is, in other words, a man of firm economic convictions \u2014 convictions that are utterly divorced from reality and impervious to evidence, to a degree that\u2019s unusual even among Republicans. A financial crisis with him in the White House could be, let\u2019s say, an interesting experience.I don\u2019t know how much play the candidates\u2019 readiness for economic emergencies will get in the general election. There will, after all, be so many horrifying positions, on everything from immigration to Planned Parenthood, to dissect. But let\u2019s try to make some room for this issue. For that 8 a.m. call is probably coming, one way or another.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "TV\u2019s Dwindling Middle Class", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "The Money IssueMoney worries and striving were part of the mainstream sitcom. Now most characters exist in a classless world.Supported byWhat arouses Sarah is not Roger himself. It\u2019s Roger\u2019s work. It\u2019s as if she hasn\u2019t seen a man wield a tape measure or tighten table legs in so long that she has pornographized it.I get it, sister. I\u2019ve been watching TV. We\u2019re out of Rogers, what few we even had. In 2007, television underwent a great expansion \u2014 beyond the major broadcast networks, beyond televisions and into all kinds of genres \u2014 just at the moment the economy shrank, and a fantasy emerged. As real people became poorer and lost their jobs, the ones on TV got richer, and their jobs seemed more beside the point. All that space to tell new stories ended up dedicated to a limited set of jobs and an increasingly homogeneous notion of what work even means.By the 1960s, prime-time television was barely two decades old, and it was already a little nostalgic and class-neutral, broadcasting shows safely ensconced in either the suburbs or the distant past. But the decade\u2019s relentless turmoil (civil rights, Vietnam, political assassinations, Watergate, feminism) demanded discourse. On TV, that conversation happened in the living rooms of the working class, middle class and working poor, on \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cMaude\u201d and \u201cGood Times,\u201d each a creation of Norman Lear, each a demonstrable emblem of its characters\u2019 social station. Archie Bunker (\u201cAll in the Family\u201d) was a white foreman in Queens; Florida Evans (\u201cGood Times\u201d) was a sporadically unemployed black housekeeper in Chicago\u2019s Near North Side projects. Bunker's armchair racism, sexism and all the rest wouldn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with Evans's prideful despair. But the two shows dramatized their opposing dissatisfaction. Class was the perch from which to see who you were and were not, and from which members of the television audience could see who they were, too.The discontent on those shows ran like a fuse through the 1970s into the late 1980s. The end of the Reagan era and start of the first Bush administration coincided with the arrival of \u201cMarried ... with Children\u201d and \u201cRoseanne,\u201d a pair of long-running sitcoms about the white lower-middle class and working poor \u2014 the Bundys and Conners, respectively. The first was more bitterly toxic (my mother got a whiff of its vulgarity and forbade it) than the second. But each show descended from Lear\u2019s righteous class consciousness. And each felt like a rebuke of the vertiginous affluence and physical beauty of soaps like \u201cDallas\u201d and \u201cDynasty\u201d and a rejoinder to the upper-middle-class comfort of \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201dAt the time, the country welcomed the duality of Brooklyn\u2019s prosperous black Huxtables and the penniless white Conners. Rather than sink to the bottom of the ratings, \u201cRoseanne\u201d hovered at or near the top, often alongside \u201cCosby,\u201d for most of its run. Some weeks, more than 20 million people watched them both.In latter-season \u201cRoseanne,\u201d something crucial changed. Roseanne became an owner of a loose-meat-sandwich spot. Her financial worries didn\u2019t abate (until, of course, a final-season Hail Mary had the Conners hit the lottery), but steady employment changed the nature of the show. Gradually, everybody spent more time at the restaurant, hanging out. The change now feels like both a socioeconomic triumph and a creative capitulation: The show was just following where other sitcoms were already headed. Characters went from hanging out at work (\u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati,\u201d \u201cTaxi\u201d) to hanging out instead of working.TV became \u2014 and still is \u2014 a medium struggling to understand \u201caverage,\u201d \u201cordinary,\u201d \u201cnormal.\u201d When the economy began to tank in 2007, television was barely equipped to reflect the collapse, in part because the people who make shows were largely immune: They were well-compensated creatures of the entertainment industry, mostly unaffected by a shrinking economy. That disconnection sanitized TV against the complexities of race and class. Many sitcoms now are set in the places their creators know best: soundstages and writers\u2019 rooms.There is, currently, a diet version of the Huxtable-Conner dichotomy recurring on ABC. It pairs \u201cThe Middle,\u201d about getting by in the heartland, with \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d which asks whether prosperity dilutes blackness. But the network\u2019s marquee show, \u201cModern Family,\u201d a masterful machine that makes highly polished sitcommery, has so little to do with most modern families that its claim of modernity often feels like a joke.People working for minimum wage or doing manual labor became the province of reality television shows like \u201cDirty Jobs\u201d and \u201cUndercover Boss,\u201d which has company executives pretend to be employees. More than once, the revelations and class disjunction that emerge from the ruse have made me cry. We\u2019re still some distance from \u201cThe King of Queens,\u201d which was set at a UPS-like facility.Watching \u201cModern Family,\u201d \u201cTwo Broke Girls\u201d and \u201cGirls,\u201d I often find myself asking what it even means to work. The characters on these shows, especially \u201cGirls,\u201d exist in an alternative realm \u2014 a kind of \u201cwhatever\u201d class. Neurosis, there, is a condition of identity, not of social station. The work you do is on yourself. But after five seasons on HBO, even \u201cGirls\u201d suspects a problem. The show has always been a stealthily shrewd satire of Millennial life. Its characters\u2019 relationship to work has ranged from nonexistent to insultingly indulgent. The triumph of the most recent season\u2019s final episode is the glee it takes in thumbing its nose at gentrification in our neighborhoods and on TV. Flighty Shoshanna converts conscientious Ray\u2019s empty cafe into a anti-hipster coffee shop. As the original owner, Hermie, goes on a tirade while pouring free coffee around the shop, you can see the place is busy with cops and nurses, the average-looking and the elderly, the solidly middle-class.It\u2019s a joke \u2014 if you\u2019re not working, you\u2019re not real \u2014 that doubles as a critique of both \u201cGirls\u201d itself and the cultural ravages of the hangout show, especially. Television is losing what work is and knows it. Sarah\u2019s arousal by that old working man on \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d is a recognition that something primal has gone: the making, the doing that prove that we exist. We built this; we manufactured that. Those jobs are disappearing. The factories and mills and laundries are now lofts and cafes where characters sit around and talk \u2014 where all they do is hang out.An article on May 1 about the representation of the middle class on TV misspelled the surname of an actress featured in an episode of \u201cHorace and Pete.\u201d She is Laurie Metcalf, not Metcalfe.An article on May 1 about the representation of the middle class on TV, including shows like \u201cRoseanne,\u201d misstated the job that the character Roseanne Conner had at her loose-meat-sandwich restaurant. She was an owner, not the manager.Wesley Morris is the critic at large for The New York Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Student of \u2018Cultural Environmentalism\u2019 Explores the Many Views of Earth\u2019s Anthropocene \u2018Age of Us\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "I\u00c2\u00a0encourage you to read the entire essay. The link is below. But here are a couple of my favorite excerpts, followed by a brief note about some unmentioned voices.Literature and art are confronted with particular challenges by the idea of the Anthropocene. Old forms of representation are experiencing drastic new pressures and being tasked with daunting new responsibilities. How might a novel or a poem possibly account for our authorship of global-scale environmental change across millennia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 let alone shape the nature of that change? The indifferent scale of the Anthropocene can induce a crushing sense of the cultural sphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impotence.Projects are presently under way around the world to gain the most basic of purchases on the Anthropocene \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a lexis with which to reckon it. Cultural anthropologists in America have begun a glossary for what they call \u00e2\u0080\u009can Anthropocene as yet unseen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d intended as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cresource\u00e2\u0080\u009d for confronting the \u00e2\u0080\u009curgent concerns of the present moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There, familiar terms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 petroleum, melt, distribution, dream \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are made strange again, vested with new resilience or menace when viewed through the \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobal optic\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Anthropocene.That section has an amusing coda on some contemporaneous neologisms that have accompanied \u201cAnthropocene\u201d into dictionaries:The word \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d itself entered the Oxford English Dictionary surprisingly late, along with \u00e2\u0080\u009cselfie\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cupcycle\u00e2\u0080\u009d, in June 2014 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 15 years after it is generally agreed to have first been used in its popular sense.Toward the end, Macfarlane describes the varied challenges to the idea of an Anthropocene epoch:Across these texts and others, three main objections recur: that the idea of the Anthropocene is arrogant, universalist and capitalist-technocratic. Arrogant, because the designation of the Anthropocene \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Age of Humans\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is our crowning act of self-mythologization (we are the super-species, we the Prometheans, we have ended nature), and as such only embeds the narcissist delusions that have produced the current crisis.And capitalist-technocratic, because the dominant narrative of the Anthropocene has technology as its driver: recent Earth history reduced to a succession of inventions (fire, the combustion engine, the synthesis of plastic, nuclear weaponry). The monolithic concept bulk of this scientific Anthropocene can crush the subtleties out of both past and future, disregarding the roles of ideology, empire and political economy. Such a technocratic narrative will also tend to encourage technocratic solutions: geoengineering as a quick-fix for climate change, say, or the Anthropocene imagined as a pragmatic problem to be managed, such that \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene science\u00e2\u0080\u009d is translated smoothly into \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d within existing structures of governance. Moore argues that the Anthropocene is not the geology of a species at all, but rather the geology of a system, capitalism \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and as such should be rechristened the Capitalocene.There are signs that we will soon be exhausted by the Anthropocene: glutted by its ubiquity as a cultural shorthand, fatigued by its imprecisions, and enervated by its variant names \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthrobscene,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMisanthropocene,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLichenocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d (actually, that last one is mine). Perhaps the Anthropocene has already become an anthropomeme: punned and pimped into stuplimity, its presence in popular discourse often just a virtue signal that merely mandates the user to proceed with the work of consumption.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Iran Needs to Fix", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byEditorialSince concluding the nuclear deal with the United States and other major powers last July, Iran has yet to realize the expected economic benefits. The Iranians are frustrated, but to a large extent have themselves to blame.The agreement promised an end to sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the European Union in return for a freeze on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran has fulfilled its part; so have the major powers, and businesses are flocking to Iran in search of deals. Technically, Iran is free to export crude oil and access about $50 billion in foreign exchange reserves in foreign banks.One impediment is that most American sanctions remain in place because of Iran\u2019s involvement in terrorism and human rights abuses and its testing of ballistic missiles. Iran knew that lifting all American sanctions was never part of the nuclear deal. This means American companies are still banned from doing business in Iran, except for trade in civil aviation, carpets and agricultural products. Also, Iran is still barred from using the American financial system, and its dollars, through which most international business is conducted. Many foreign banks who are free to engage with Iran hesitate to do so, fearing they will run afoul of American sanctions.The Treasury Department, concerned that Iran has not benefited enough from sanctions relief, is working to clarify the conditions for doing business with Tehran. There are no restrictions on foreign banks that want to do deals with Iran in euros or other non-dollar currencies. Foreign banks can also do trades in dollars if they can cover the transaction with the dollars they have on hand. In practice, that means smaller deals, because for larger ones, like oil contracts, they would have to access the American financial system, which is off limits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Avoiding the Dreaded Middle Seat May Now Cost You", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byItinerariesAs flying goes, the only thing more uncomfortable than sitting next to a couple having a spat on an airplane, Maury Rogoff learned, is sitting between that couple \u2014 especially when one partner prefers bare feet.Ms. Rogoff, who owns a public relations firm with offices in New York and Florida and travels frequently, discovered what a growing number of travelers now know: The middle seat has become the third rail of flying \u2014 and it is getting harder to avoid.As planes fly at record capacity and new cabin configurations squeeze in ever more passengers, airlines are, intentionally or not, nudging fliers into paying extra to avoid drawing the proverbial short straw.\u201cI was literally in the middle of their argument,\u201d Ms. Rogoff said. \u201cIt was just that awful.\u201d Her discomfort was magnified when the husband kicked off his shoes and crossed his legs, thrusting a bare foot into Ms. Rogoff\u2019s space.Her entreaties with his wife to swap seats fell on deaf ears. \u201cOf course she had no interest because it was middle, and because it was a smelly foot,\u201d Ms. Rogoff said.For travelers like Ms. Rogoff, airlines are making it harder than ever to avoid the middle seat based on luck alone.Southwest, which does not assign seats, raised the price of an early-boarding pass to $15 from $12.50 last month. For those who do not pay up, it is a mad rush when online check-in opens 24 hours before the flight.Delta Air Lines\u2019 Basic Economy fare, introduced last year, does not allow seat assignments to be made until after check-in \u2014 when higher-paying customers have had a chance to claim window and aisle seats.American Airlines and United Airlines plan to introduce similar fares this year. Neither would confirm whether selecting a seat would be one of the perks eliminated, but one airline analyst said it was likely, given the competition legacy airlines face from low-fare carriers.\u201cIt\u2019s a way to compete,\u201d said Max Rayner, a partner at Hudson Crossing, a consulting firm in New York. \u201cIf you want to go at premium times, there will be far fewer seats available at the lower end of prices.\u201dMr. Rayner suggested that this shift in pricing models wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, saying it could be a boon for the most price-sensitive customers. \u201cYou can think of it actually as opening up choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just want basic transportation \u2014 sure, here it is.\u201dBut the crunch has left some travelers taking extreme measures to avoid getting stuck in the middle.Fliers said they have offered fellow travelers money or drinks to switch seats, paid the fee to upgrade to a premium or exit row, feigned illness or switched flights. Some travelers even report buying two seats, just to have an empty one next to them.Dr. Sachin Shridharani, a plastic surgeon in New York, found himself on an overbooked flight back from San Diego, and a middle seat was the only one available.\u201cI told them I\u2019d be willing to take another flight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll pretty much do just about anything to avoid sitting in that notorious, infamous middle seat.\u201dThe trade-off was to wait in the airport for four hours, but Dr. Shridharani said it was worth it so he could work on the way home. \u201cYou can\u2019t have someone looking over your shoulder,\u201d he said.In the end, analysts say, airlines are selling a form of real estate, but they are trading in square inches, not square feet.\u201cPeople buy work space; that\u2019s really what they buy on board,\u201d said Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry consultant. \u201cSome of those configurations may not give you enough room, for example, to take out a laptop and use it productively.\u201dOne carrier, though, has tried to address the issue. Frontier Airlines recently installed new seats on its Airbus A319 and A320 planes, with the middle seats about an inch wider than the window and aisle seats.But for most passengers, the tight squeeze continues, and business travelers say counting on their frequent-flier status to avoid the middle seat is no longer a sure thing.\u201cYou can\u2019t show up at the airport hoping to talk your way into an upgrade,\u201d said Mark Jeffries, a corporate speaker and author. \u201cYou don\u2019t see free seats anymore.\u201dMr. Jeffries said he sometimes buys two seats \u2014 a window or aisle, and a middle. It\u2019s cheaper than buying a business- or first-class ticket on a legacy carrier, he said.\u201cWe find that people will pay for premium economy or any kind of seat assignment if they\u2019re traveling solo to avoid the middle seat,\u201d said Julia Douglas, owner and president of Jet Set World Travel in Chicago. Some travelers will spend hundreds of dollars more, she added.Another approach is to appeal to another traveler. \u201cThere have been instances where I\u2019ve bought someone an upgrade,\u201d said Michael Winston, who used to travel once or twice a week while working in management consulting. At times, he said, he had resorted to bargaining with seatmates to avoid the middle seat.It is not an uncommon transaction, frequent travelers say, with cash, upgrades and cocktails all serving as forms of currency. But that is assuming that the seats are available.Last year, airline capacity again hit a record high, just shy of 85 percent, meaning that a lot of flights are full.And that leaves flight attendants and travel agents acting as de facto referees for games of midair musical chairs. The excuses passengers use to avoid the middle seat are many, they say.\u201cLong legs is always one,\u201d Ms. Douglas said. She then listed the most common complaints: claustrophobia, a need for frequent trips to the bathroom, flight-induced panic attacks and a penchant for airsickness.\u201cI don\u2019t know if any of them are truly medically founded,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s anxiety about being in that middle seat.\u201dOf all the excuses, genuine or exaggerated, the one that seems most effective is the threat of gastrointestinal distress.William Bauer, who travels frequently as an executive at a manufacturer of leather goods, said that hinting at a medical need for quick access to the bathroom usually prompted either gate agents or fellow passengers to make the switch for him.\u201cMake it clear that you need that aisle seat. Really convey a compelling sense of urgency,\u201d he said. \u201cThus far, I\u2019ve never been rejected.\u201dOn one recent flight, though, the tables were turned when Mr. Bauer found himself on the receiving end of a plea to swap seats on a cross-country, red-eye flight.\u201cThere was a woman I gave up my aisle seat for because she cried,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you cry, you win.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Hyundai Elantra Offers Fewer Curves, but a Better Ride", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byDrivenAROUND six years ago, Hyundai figured a 10-year warranty was not enough to attract shoppers and conjured up daring design for more attention. Sonata was the first to get the Fluidic Sculpture makeover, but the fifth-generation Elantra ended up being the swoopiest of the fleet. Hyundai\u2019s newest gamble? Toning down those curves.The South Korean brand is after a more sophisticated and \u2014 ahem \u2014 mature look. Alas, Sonata simply became more conservative. The 2017 Elantra\u2019s new wrapper is also less emotional, but more successful. The departing Hot Wheels flame motif yields to a more refined appearance, and everything beneath the shape delivers on that promise.The previous Elantra had three problems: The steering hero-worshiped Novocain, occupants grew hoarse from shouting over road noise, and large potholes betrayed a lack of structure. The tires now offer the fingertips some feedback through the steering wheel, acoustical tricks quell the roar and the chassis gets twice as much high-strength steel. As it is welded, nearly 400 feet of adhesive is applied for additional structural strength.A 147-horsepower, 2-liter, 4-cylinder engine makes it go (the Eco model runs with a 1.4-liter turbo). Connecting it to the front wheels is a 6-speed automatic gearbox with a manual mode, although there are no steering wheel paddles. Drive modes allow steering weight and throttle response adjustment.Getting from 0 to 60 takes about eight seconds, on the leisurely side of brisk. Unlike in most modern cars, the gearbox shifts down smartly with a throttle stab. Elantra is for the masses \u2014 quiet, comfortable, controlled and predictable. Driving enthusiasts should wait for the expected Sport model or buy a Mazda 3. Officially, the government rates fuel economy at 28 miles per gallon in the city, 37 highway. I saw 32.Intelligent people always cross-shop. That means browsing sedans like the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus and Nissan Sentra. As with the Elantra, many compacts like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic have grown up. The Environmental Protection Agency classifies their cabin volumes as midsize, about as roomy as a BMW 3 Series. Check them out for size before pulling the trigger on a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Chevy Malibu or Hyundai Sonata.Materials look and feel good in comparison with other models in its class, but don\u2019t expect soft-touch materials throughout the interior. Storage cubbies are plentiful and the sun visors get extra adjustability. Laugh at that detail now \u2014 you won\u2019t when the sun is blinding you at 75 miles an hour on a curve. A backup camera comes standard on Limited models (cough, cough, BMW and Mercedes).The back seat is plenty spacious for two adults and doors open wide to help with the child seat shuffle. Heated cushions are available in back but a power port and pocket on the back of the driver\u2019s chair are not. The large trunk, complete with split seat backs, is ample for airport shuttle runs, something your mooching friends don\u2019t need to know.Elantra begins its price climb at $17,985 with a 6-speed manual transmission. As tested, the loaded Limited model tops out at $27,710 when stuffed with blind-spot warning, adaptive cruise control, a well-executed lane-keep assist system and auto-braking with pedestrian detection. That is technology found only in luxury cars 10 years ago, when Elantra\u2019s auto-opening trunk and available Android Auto and Apple CarPlay did not even exist.While the previous Elantra had visual appeal, the new one is far better in motion. Talk about throwing competitors a curve.Advertisement"}

By the 1980s, those days seemed long gone.Kermit Lynch, the American importer and writer, lamented in his 1988 book, \u201cAdventures on the Wine Route: A Wine Buyer\u2019s Tour of France,\u201d that the lively low-alcohol wine he knew and treasured as Beaujolais could no longer be found. Instead, much of the wine in the region was going into a commodity called Beaujolais Nouveau, after the quaint local tradition of using a small portion of the new harvest to make an early-drinking wine for end-of-the-year festivals and celebrations.The global rise in popularity of Beaujolais Nouveau, more akin to an alcoholic soft drink than a fresh wine, transformed the local wine economy. Then the collapse of the Nouveau fad nearly killed it.What pointed the way forward was a handful of producers who had largely sat out the craze. Instead, these producers, some associated with Mr. Lynch, paid attention to working more naturally and making the best wines they could. The future, they believed, lay in focused expressions of the terroirs of the 10 crus of Beaujolais.These areas in the northern part of the region had the sorts of poor soils \u2014 largely granite, occasionally schist \u2014 in which gamay, the grape of Beaujolais, produced the most eloquent wines. The 10 crus are: Brouilly, C\u00f4te de Brouilly, Ch\u00e9nas, Chiroubles, Fleurie, Juli\u00e9nas, Morgon, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, R\u00e9gni\u00e9 and St.-Amour.Over the last 20 years, these producers have been proved correct. They have demonstrated the greatness of these crus, even if the wines are a far cry from the style that Mr. Lynch so loved.Dare we say these wines have gravitas? Only in the sense that the best examples clearly express the character of their crus, though the differences are often detectable only in nuances. Yet they remain imbued with the sense of joy that seems inherent in good gamay. They can be enjoyed early and fresh, or they can be aged for five to 15 years, and sometimes longer. They are great, yet they are fun. So maybe we reject gravitas.Nowadays, the name \u201cBeaujolais\u201d is rarely seen on bottles from these crus. Instead, they simply carry the name of the cru, part of a concerted effort to differentiate the crus from the more fertile areas to the south, where the lighter, less complex wines carry the simple appellation \u201cBeaujolais\u201d or, a step up, \u201cBeaujolais-Villages.\u201dThe 2014 vintage, we generally agreed, was a very good one, maybe even superb. The wines were gloriously aromatic, full of the aromas of red fruit and flowers, fresh rather than jammy. On the palate the best had great minerality, as if the floral, fruity flavors were laced with the essence of granite. And the wines had a sense of structure. You can certainly enjoy these wines over the next five to seven years, perhaps even longer.It was not so easy in our blind tasting to tell the difference between Fleuries and Morgons. Theoretically, at least, Morgons should be a little denser and Fleuries a little more elegant. But differences in sites and winemaking methods sometimes blur those distinctions. I was right on just over half the bottles, which was maybe little better than if I had simply guessed without tasting the wines.Our top wine was from Patrick Brunet\u2019s Domaine de Robert, a producer I don\u2019t remember encountering before, but I will certainly look for this terrific Fleurie in the future. It was bright, pure and complex, structured enough to age well.Right behind was a cluster of excellent producers. Julien Sunier\u2019s Morgon was also complex and structured, with flavors of fruit, flowers and herbs that lingered. Christophe Pacalet seems to get better every year. His 2014 Fleurie was pure and tangy, and, at just $16, it was our best value.Alain Coudert\u2019s Clos de la Roilette is a longtime favorite Fleurie producer whose wines should not be overshadowed by newer, more faddish names. His 2014 was typically firm, with peppery fruit, herb and mineral flavors.Just about as delicious was the Morgon from Mr. Lapierre\u2019s old friend Jean Foillard, richer and juicier than the Lapierre, but with a similar set of flavors and aromas.Rounding out the top 10 list was a Fleurie from B. Perraud and Morgons from Guy Breton (another Lapierre friend), Damien Coquelet and Daniel Bouland.But don\u2019t stop with this brief list. Other producers of Fleurie and Morgon that would be well worth your time include Julie Balagny, Jean-Louis Dutraive\u2019s Domaine de la Grand Cour, Georges Descombes, Pierre-Marie Chermette\u2019s Domaine du Vissoux, Louis-Claude Desvignes, Jean-Paul Brun, Domaine Chignard and, if you can find the small trickle of bottles that flows into the United States, Yvon M\u00e9tras.Pure and structured, with bright red fruit flavors threaded with granite and earth. (Petit Pois/Sussex Wines, Moorestown, N.J.)Beautifully structured, with complex, lingering flavors of red fruit, flowers, herbs and minerals. (Polaner Selections, Mt. Kisco, N.Y.)Pure, tangy flavors of earthy red fruit, herbs and flowers. (Winebow, New York)Firm and brambly, with peppery flavors of red fruit, herbs and minerals.

{"Headline": "Despite Timing, Bernie Sanders Says, Accepting Vatican Offer Was a Must", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySenator Bernie Sanders, in the midst of a contentious battle for the Democratic nomination, says he could not refuse an invitation to visit the Vatican and talk about the world economy and social justice \u2014 two issues at the core of his presidential campaign \u2014 even if it meant he would be out of the country for days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s crucial primary in New York.Just hours after debating Hillary Clinton in Brooklyn, Mr. Sanders will travel to Vatican City on Friday morning to deliver a 10-minute speech at a conference hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, a scholarly association that was established by Pope John Paul II in 1994.Mr. Sanders insists the visit is not a political maneuver and that he was inspired to make the trip by Pope Francis\u2019 message of caring for others and combating economic inequality. Others, however, say Mr. Sanders is not only seeking to discuss issues, but is also driven by a desire to be seen as a global leader on issues of social justice.Mr. Sanders said in an interview on Thursday that he thought Francis has played \u201can extraordinary role, and with great courage\u201d in getting the world to think more about the \u201cmoral economy and how we have to deal with economic and environmental and social injustice.\u201d\u201cI have been a very strong supporter of what he has been trying to do since he became pope, and I am extremely honored to have received an invitation from the Vatican to participate in this important conference,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI would just be kicking myself for the rest of my life if I rejected this opportunity, so I\u2019m delighted to be going.\u201dEarlier this week, however, the announcement that Mr. Sanders would be attending the conference created an international dust-up amid confusion about how he was invited and whether he would meet Francis.The Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences is one of 12 academies established as part of the Vatican. But unlike pontifical councils, which put out official documents on behalf of the church, these academies aim simply to continue dialogue on church teachings on various subjects.According to the Rev. Manuel Dorantes, a Vatican spokesman, a foundation affiliated with the academy \u2014 which is led by lay people and is at least two bureaucratic steps away from the pope \u2014 invited Mr. Sanders to speak at the conference.Father Dorantes also said that the pope does not usually attend the foundation\u2019s conferences, and that as of now, officials had not planned any official meeting between Mr. Sanders and Francis.But, Father Dorantes did leave the door open for a chance encounter in Vatican City. \u201cI mean, the fact that they happen to be at the same place, it can happen, but officially there isn\u2019t anything in the books right now,\u201d he said.But in a briefing with reporters in the Vatican press office on Thursday, the chief spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, was more direct. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a meeting with the Holy Father,\u201d Father Lombardi said.Mr. Sanders, however, is still hoping for a meeting. \u201cI certainly would be delighted and proud if I had the opportunity to meet with him,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I would like to hear from him is his views as to the role that the United States of America could play in creating a more moral world economy.\u201dChad C. Pecknold, a theology professor at Catholic University who specializes in American politics and religion, said he thought Mr. Sanders was looking past the election and angling to start a foundation like the Clinton Global Initiative.\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that the Sanders campaign is aware that their chances of being the Democratic nominee are slim,\u201d Dr. Pecknold said. \u201cHe is looking ahead to the future for what sort of influence he is going to have beyond the election, and he knows his signature issue is economic justice.\u201d Going to a conference of world leaders held by the Vatican, he continued, could help Mr. Sanders establish a higher profile on a global scale.Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology at the University of St. Thomas, said Vatican officials have tried to distance the pope from the invitation in an effort to make sure not to create the impression that he is meddling in the presidential race. Dr. Faggioli said he found the timing of the invitation unusual and questioned whether Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters pushed for him to be included.\u201cPope Francis has always chosen to keep a clear distance from politicians who are running for office and running a campaign,\u201d Dr. Faggioli said. And while the pope often meets with heads of state, he said, \u201che doesn\u2019t deal with politicians, so that\u2019s why this invitation is an incident.\u201dStill, Miguel H. Diaz, a former United States ambassador to the Holy See, said that Mr. Sanders\u2019s attending the conference made sense because the senator and Francis have similar goals.\u201cWe have a pope whose focus has been very much on the globalization of human indifference, marginalized persons, the poor, the impoverished earth in terms of ecological concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd finally here is a pope that has a huge appeal to the young, and again we have a senator who shares that.\u201dStu Loeser, who owns a media strategy firm and was a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said it was unclear what if anything Mr. Sanders might gain politically from the trip.One third of all registered voters in New York State identify as Catholic, according to a 2015 study by the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit focused on research and education. Among those Catholic voters in the state, 25 percent identify as Republican, 29 percent are independent and 41 percent identify as Democrat, the group found.Mr. Loeser added that though people admire the pope, most New Yorkers have already decided whom to support.\u201cA picture with the pope would be worth a thousand words, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth a thousand votes,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Impurity in the Pursuit of Salvation Is No Vice", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "I very much agree with the spirit, and probably with the specifics.The common idea, among economists anyway, that a carbon tax should ideally be paired with offsetting cuts in other taxes, looks good in terms of Econ 101, and sounds like something that should help sell the thing to the public \u2014 that is, it sounds that way if you imagine that the public consists of econ grad students. In reality, revenue neutrality is an abstract concept that people will not, in general, believe in even if you try to explain it. Linking a new tax to some concrete goal is much more likely to work politically.How do I know this? Look at the new taxes that have in fact been passed over the decades. The payroll tax was created \u2014 and increased a lot over time \u2014 by tying it to Social Security and Medicare. A significant part of the new taxes enacted under Obama were directly tied to the funding of the ACA. Economists may point out that such links are basically a fiction \u2014 the government has a bunch of revenue sources, it has a bunch of spending commitments, and any link between an item in column A and an item in column B is more or less arbitrary. But the people who set it up that way weren\u2019t stupid, they were responding to a shrewd assessment of how voters think. Oh, and voters aren\u2019t necessarily stupid either: they don\u2019t do budget analysis, but they do resort to various rough heuristics to make sense of complex issues, and is that such a bad thing?So I\u2019m with Roberts here: do whatever is likely to work. Don\u2019t insist that a perfect, Econ 101 revenue-neutral carbon tax is the only way to go. A mix of regulations, dedicated taxes, subsidies, whatever, as long as it makes a big difference to emissions is just fine.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s New Model 3 Jump-Starts Demand for Electric Cars", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Despite a steady stream of new models from a number of automakers, sales this year of electric and hybrid vehicles have failed to keep pace with the growth in the overall American market.Given that electric and hybrid vehicles account for only about 2 percent of last year\u2019s record-setting sales in the United States, the extraordinary reaction to Tesla\u2019s first mass-market model was a vivid demonstration of the potential demand in the segment.\u201cIt shows that the future of electric vehicles is not necessarily bleak,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve been waiting for the right products that resonate with consumers.\u201dTesla said on Friday that it had booked reservations \u2014 at $1,000 each \u2014 from nearly 200,000 people for the first Model 3 sedans, which will not be available until next year.With a starting price of $35,000 and a battery range of 215 miles, the new Tesla is a big leap in the company\u2019s expansion beyond expensive luxury models.\u201cThe final step in the master plan is a mass-market, affordable car,\u201d Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said at the lavish introduction of the Model 3 held at the company\u2019s design studios in Hawthorne, Calif.Other automakers are also pressing ahead with important new electric models, including the Chevrolet Bolt from General Motors, a revamped version of the Nissan Leaf, and new entries from Ford Motor and Hyundai.With those and other electrified vehicles coming in the next couple of years, the segment could finally begin to grow beyond the fringes of the market.Last year, automakers sold fewer than 400,000 electric and hybrid vehicles in the United States, even as the overall market soared to record sales of 17.5 million, analysts said.On Friday, automakers said the torrid pace of sales cooled some in March, when overall sales increased about 3 percent, to about 1.6 million vehicles sold. That was lower than Wall Street estimates, and the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual sales rate dropped below 17 million for the first time this year.Sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles continued to account for most of the gains, while passenger cars lagged behind. And despite the introduction of a new Prius hybrid from Toyota, there was little improvement in overall sales of electrified models.\u201cThe segment has been pretty soft over all, and we expect to see that continue this year,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said.Electric cars and hybrid models, which are powered by both a gasoline engine and a battery, are critical to nearly every automaker\u2019s efforts to improve their overall fleetwide fuel economy to meet a new federal standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. And meeting the goals has become even more important in the wake of the Paris climate accord last year, which mandated significant reductions in carbon emissions.Despite the lukewarm acceptance of electrified vehicles so far by consumers, environmental groups are praising the impact that the relatively small sales have had already.A report released this week by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows, for example, that about 200,000 electric cars have been sold in California to date, which has reduced annual gasoline consumption in the state by 56 million gallons.\u201cNew models like G.M.\u2019s Bolt, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and the new plug-in Prius Prime should keep the number of electric vehicles growing,\u201d said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer with the scientists group.Trends in the marketplace, however, are working against electrified models. With fuel prices still hovering at about $2 a gallon, many consumers are choosing larger vehicles that are more affordable to own when gas is cheap.And with automakers also improving the mileage of their existing compact cars and small sport utility vehicles, many buyers are meeting their fuel-economy needs with conventional, gas-powered models instead of electrified ones.Still, the Tesla\u2019s introduction is a sign that latent demand for electric cars could translate into big sales in the showroom down the road.Mr. Musk said Tesla was preparing for a surge in demand by adding dealerships, prepping its California assembly plant to build as many as 500,000 electric cars a year, and building a new factory in Nevada to produce batteries.As far as the Model 3 is concerned, Mr. Musk was characteristically confident of its ability to compete with any car \u2014 electric or not \u2014 on the market. \u201cYou will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000,\u201d he said.For the most part, industry executives say that lower prices and greater driving range are the key factors in jump-starting the electric market.Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of the Japanese automaker Nissan and the French carmaker Renault, said recently that the electric segment needed a wider and more diverse array of models to interest a larger audience of potential buyers.Nissan has had limited success with the all-electric Leaf, but growth is a \u201cstep by step\u201d process, Mr. Ghosn said last month at the New York International Auto Show.\u201cWe\u2019re not in it so much to showcase technology,\u201d he said. \u201cOur main driver is going to be the mass market for electric cars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Oil Nations Consider a Freeze, Looking for Tensions to Thaw", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byThe fact is that the two biggest players at the meeting \u2014 Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 are already pumping virtually flat out. They have little room to increase production even if they wanted to.But signals the two countries have sent recently, indicating they would rather discuss cooperation than continue cutthroat competition, have buoyed oil prices well above their lows in mid-January, when the Brent crude international benchmark dipped below $30 a barrel. On Monday Brent crude was trading above $41.Analysts, oil buyers and speculators will be watching the Doha meeting mainly to see whether the 13 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia show signs of being able to cooperate enough to exercise market discipline \u2014 and maybe even to cut production at some point, if necessary, to bolster oil prices.\u201cA freeze is laughable, given that Russia is at a post-Soviet high and Saudi Arabia is producing 10.2 million barrels per day,\u201d said Robert McNally, president of the Rapidan Group, an energy consultancy based in Bethesda, Md. And yet, the mere talk of a freeze, he said, \u201chas worked spectacularly, at least initially.\u201dMany analysts say that a freeze, if agreed to, would have little impact on the estimated one million or more barrels of excess oil that each day is pouring into already brimming storage tanks and tankers around the world.Mr. McNally, who served as a White House energy adviser during the George W. Bush administration, says an output freeze would be \u201ca very poor cousin\u201d to some earlier efforts by oil producers to manage supply. That includes the substantial cuts by OPEC members in 2008.This time Saudi Arabia, which would probably need to make the bulk of any OPEC cuts, has adamantly refused to do so on its own.Mr. McNally and other analysts speculate that the oil producers hope a freeze agreement would be sufficient to shore up prices until gradually growing demand catches up with supply \u2014 which many forecasts say will happen either this year or in early 2017.\u201cOnce we get into the summer, falling supplies will come to dominate the market,\u201d said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London.OPEC countries are also hoping that the price-pressured cuts in production by some energy providers, like smaller shale-oil drillers in the United States, will help reduce the surpluses. So might the eventual impact of big oil companies\u2019 postponing hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of projects in response to low prices.The main goal of the Doha meeting seems to be assuring markets that countries whose economies depend on selling oil can still find ways to collaborate.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.At least one proposed meeting has been scrubbed since Russia, Saudi Arabia and other producers agreed, at a Doha meeting in February, to consider the idea of a freeze \u2014 on the condition that other major exporters came aboard. Non-OPEC countries including Mexico, Brazil and Oman may attend this week\u2019s meeting, and Norway may follow its tradition of sending \u201cobservers\u201d to such gatherings.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know what the freeze really means in terms of detail \u2014 how it is measured, and the duration,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at the research firm IHS in Washington.One looming question is whether some accommodation can be found to bring Iran into the fold. Iran is a member of OPEC, but it is also a sworn geopolitical enemy of Saudi Arabia.The Iranians, whose production and exports were slashed by international sanctions over their nuclear program, are determined to regain their former share of the market now that most of those sanctions have been lifted.Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, is a seasoned official who will be unlikely to agree publicly to a freeze, analysts say, but will also be wary of causing prices to collapse.A related question is whether Saudi Arabia, hostile to growing Iranian influence in the Middle East and locked in a fierce competition with Iran and other Persian Gulf producers for customers like China and India, will accept a compromise that makes an exception for Iran.In a recent interview with Bloomberg News, Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and a crucial power broker in Saudi Arabia, suggested that the Saudis would not go along with a freeze without Iran\u2019s participation.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.And yet, there are limits to how much Iran could raise production even if it rejected a freeze.Since the relaxing of international sanctions last autumn, Iran has increased production to slightly more than 3.2 million barrels a day from about 2.9 million. But because much of its production infrastructure is old and rickety, Iran may be unable to increase output significantly without spending time and money upgrading its oil fields.\u201cThey have already added 300-and-some-thousand barrels, and that tells me that they have pretty much topped out for a while before they can go higher,\u201d said Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of the Saudi national oil company, Saudi Aramco, who now runs Husseini Energy, a consulting firm based in Dhahran.But others note that some other OPEC members with their own political and economic problems, like Libya and Iraq, might feel compelled to keep pumping at current levels or even step up production.\u201cIf everyone produces at maximum capacity, the price is at risk of revisiting the lows seen earlier this year,\u201d said Harry Tchilinguirian, the head of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas in London.He and others see little chance of a strong recovery in oil prices anytime soon without significant curtailments by major oil-producing countries. And they say those reductions will not happen unless the Saudis lead the way on an agreement to cut back.\u201cI am not very optimistic about the proposed Doha deal nor on the producers\u2019 ability to manage a gradual improvement in prices,\u201d said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a former energy minister of Algeria who now runs Nalcosa, a consulting firm based in Geneva.\u201cWith the Saudi no-cut diktat,\u201d Mr. Ait-Laoussine said, \u201cI don\u2019t see production going down in the short term. I only see it going up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vote to Impeach Rousseff Prompted Cheers, But Won\u2019t End Turmoil in Brazil", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 To those unfamiliar with the cacophonous tenor of Brazilian politics, the legislative session on Sunday night that approved the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff could have been mistaken for a soccer match.As the outcome of the vote became clear, deputies in the lower house of Congress hooted, pumped their fists and hoisted onto their shoulders the man who had cast the pivotal vote.One lawmaker, wearing a flag as a cape, fired a gun that shot confetti.The unrestrained merriment was mirrored on the streets of cities across Brazil, where thousands of people celebrated what they hope will be the ouster of Ms. Rousseff on charges that she illegally used money from state-owned banks to hide a catastrophic budget deficit and bolster her chances of re-election.But on Monday, Brazilians awoke to the sobering reality that the political and economic turmoil that has consumed their country, Latin America\u2019s largest, for the past two years is far from over.Inflation is running at 10 percent, unemployment is at a seven-year high and the economy is expected to contract by as much as 3.8 percent for a second year in a row.A Zika epidemic is coursing through the northeast, and a cash-strapped local government in Rio de Janeiro is racing to prepare for the Summer Olympics. If the impeachment process moves forward as many experts predict, Brazilian televisions this August are likely to feature a split-screen spectacle of sporting events and their president on trial.\u201cWe may be witnessing the end of Dilma but not the end of the Brazilian crisis,\u201d Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congresso em Foco, an anticorruption watchdog group.And the political paralysis that has hobbled the government is not likely to ease anytime soon. Ms. Rousseff will have to step down temporarily next month if the Senate votes by a simple majority to take on her impeachment trial, an outcome that many analysts say is all but assured.Ms. Rousseff, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as a Marxist guerrilla, has vowed to fight on. \u201cDespite much sadness, I have sufficient spirit, strength and courage to confront this injustice,\u201d she said in a televised news conference on Monday. \u201cI won\u2019t be taken down.\u201dThe man who is expected to replace her, Vice President Michel Temer, is not exactly a knight in shining armor. Mr. Temer, 75, a career politician whose Brazilian Democratic Movement Party has been ensnared in the nation\u2019s ever-expanding corruption scandal, is almost as unpopular as Ms. Rousseff.A survey released on Monday by the polling firm Datafolha found that 68 percent of those who supported Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment think Mr. Temer should not be president; more than half thought that he, too, should be impeached.Writing in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, the columnist Bernardo Mello Franco took stock of the troubling state of affairs, among them legislative gridlock and at least five leaderless ministries.\u201cIn the next weeks Brazil will be in an exotic predicament,\u201d he wrote on Monday. \u201cDilma is almost an ex-president and Temer is almost a future president. And because their relationship is broken, the sum of the two cannot give the country one head of government.\u201dThough a large majority of deputies voted for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, this nation of 200 million remains deeply divided.Many of her supporters have promised to take to the streets in an effort to stave off her removal from office.In recent days, a growing number of officials have been calling for new elections, a process that would require the consent of Congress and the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cIt is clear to society that the party of Vice President Temer is as responsible for the political, ethical and economic crisis as is the party of President Dilma,\u201d said Marina Silva, a former minister and outspoken critic of Ms. Rousseff.The vast majority of Brazilians also have little faith left in their leaders.A third of the deputies in the lower house have been charged or are being investigated for corruption, including its speaker, Eduardo Cunha, the man who orchestrated Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. Mr. Cunha, who faces charges that he accepted $40 million in bribes, is especially disliked, with nearly 90 percent of Brazilians calling for him to step down, according to Datafolha.Senate President Renan Calheiros has his own ethical challenges. He is under investigation on accusations of receiving bribes, evading taxes and allowing a lobbyist to pay child support for a daughter of his born from an extramarital affair.\u201cWe have two thieves leading our Congress and they should both be in prison,\u201d said Mr. Costa, the anticorruption activist.As he watched the balloting on Sunday night on television, Julio Barboza, 33, an environmental scientist from S\u00e3o Paulo, grew despondent as a stream of deputies cited God, clean government and democracy as they cast their votes against the president.He noted that just a handful used their brief speeches to mention the accusations Ms. Rousseff is facing. \u201cIt made me realize that the impeachment process has little to do with fiscal crimes,\u201d Mr. Barboza said.For the moment, all eyes are on Mr. Temer, the vice president, a taciturn man who has long preferred operating behind the scenes. Although he is also the subject of an impeachment petition, most experts believe the matter will be dropped in the interest of national stability.Despite his dismal popularity on the street, many business leaders believe Mr. Temer, a centrist, is the best hope for righting the Brazilian economy. Expectations that Mr. Temer would replace Ms. Rousseff have had one tangible effect on the nation\u2019s financial outlook: As the impeachment process moved forward in recent months, Brazilian stocks rallied 35 percent, though they lost two points on Monday.A former speaker of the lower house and an adroit deal maker, Mr. Temer will need to build a coalition to enact the economic reforms, tax increases and painful austerity required to contain a ballooning deficit.The road will be steep. Mr. Temer\u2019s party enjoys scant public support and members of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, angry over his defection to the opposition last month, are likely to stymie his work in Congress. And any effort to pare back social spending and trim bloated public pensions will stir up fierce resistance from labor unions and left-leaning activists.\u201cThe economy is in disarray and most Brazilians are hopeless about the current political class,\u201d said Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva, a senior consultant at the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation. \u201cTemer is the personification of the old political class, so he will have a big challenge.\u201dAndrew Jacobs reported from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.

{"Headline": "The Next Playwright to Know? Florian Zeller, From France to Broadway in a Big, Busy Leap", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 An old man, Andr\u00e9, is home in his apartment as people come and go. There\u2019s his daughter, Anne, and her boyfriend. Or is it her first husband? And is she really moving to London? Laura, his new caregiver, the one he seems to like, keeps him company. So then why would she steal his watch?Although \u201cThe Father\u201d explores old age, Mr. Zeller is a boyish 36-year-old, who has been going places since publishing his first novel in his early 20s. His playwriting style is comic, his characters the middle-aged French bourgeoisie, his themes reality and perception, fidelity and infidelity. And he often takes a construct \u2014 a mind, a marriage \u2014 and dismantles it from multiple perspectives.But of all his plays, \u201cThe Father,\u201d which he wrote in 2012 and calls \u201ca tragic farce,\u201d has made the strongest emotional impact.\u201cI wrote the play the way one has a dream \u2014 that is to say, unconscious of where I was going,\u201d Mr. Zeller said recently over green tea at the elegant Royal Monceau Hotel, a venue he chose. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t until almost the end that I said to myself, \u2018Ah, that\u2019s what I was talking about, about senile dementia, about Alzheimer\u2019s, about the moment when one loses one\u2019s faculties, one\u2019s sense of who one is.\u2019\u201dWith carefully mussed blond hair and well-groomed stubble, Mr. Zeller wore black jeans, polished black ankle boots and a black shirt, rakishly unbuttoned. As he spoke, rapidly and candidly, he sometimes played with a large ring on one finger, studded with tiny sparkling stones.Drawing on memories of his grandmother, who developed dementia when he was growing up, Mr. Zeller wrote \u201cThe Father\u201d for the veteran Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise actor Robert Hirsch, now 90, who was a ballet dancer in his youth. He performed it for three years after it opened here in the fall of 2012.It was \u201ca very powerful experience,\u201d Mr. Zeller said. \u201cHe lives in a permanent state of precariousness. One never knows whether it\u2019s going to be the last performance. And he has a kind of fragility that resonated with what I was trying to convey.\u201dAfter critical acclaim in France, \u201cThe Father\u201d opened in Bath before moving to the small Tricycle Theater in North London, and then to the West End, where a second run starred Kenneth Cranham. The Times of London wrote that Mr. Zeller\u2019s \u201cmasterful, well-mannered mix of laughter and desolation puts you into the mind-set of someone in the midst of mental decay like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201dMr. Hampton, the playwright and screenwriter, said he had been \u201cblown away\u201d when he first saw \u201cThe Father\u201d in Paris. Mr. Hampton\u2019s theatrical translations include plays by the French playwright Yasmina Reza (\u201cArt,\u201d \u201cGod of Carnage\u201d). She and Mr. Zeller are often compared for their success outside France.In Mr. Zeller\u2019s hands, the same scenes are often replayed with different outcomes. \u201cWhat I like most about Florian and particularly about \u2018The Mother\u2019 and \u2018The Father\u2019 is that he uses these tricks to entirely legitimate effect, not just to be tricksy,\u201d Mr. Hampton said. \u201cRather than describing it, he throws you into it.\u201dMr. Zeller cites Harold Pinter as an influence, as well as the French theater of the absurd. \u201cThe Father\u201d was inspired by a production of Eugene Ionesco\u2019s \u201cThe Chairs,\u201d in which an old man stops in midthought and calls for his mother. \u201cSuddenly, in a matter of seconds, someone who looked like an old man resembles a baby crying out for his mother,\u201d Mr. Zeller said. \u201cThat completely destroyed me.\u201dThe emotions are intense. Mr. Langella, who is 78, said that performing in \u201cThe Father\u201d could be frightening at times. But he said he agreed to the role before he had even finished reading the script, which Mr. Hughes sent his way. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be influenced by the ending,\u201d Mr. Langella said.On one recent Tuesday, we spent an hour each with a dozen upcoming Broadway shows as they worked under looming deadlines. From the costume shop to the first curtain call, here's how the steps and stories, the stitches and salesmanship come together.He had been struck by Mr. Zeller\u2019s economy of language. \u201cHe\u2019s able to achieve a powerhouse of feeling in fewer words than almost any other writer I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Mr. Langella said. He joked about their initial meeting in New York: \u201cThe first thing I said was, \u2018It\u2019s not in the rule book that the playwright should be better-looking than the actor.\u2019\u201dThe second of three children, Mr. Zeller grew up outside Paris, raised by his mother, who liked to read Tarot cards. His father, an engineer, worked in Germany. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of culture in the house, not a lot of books, but it was present in another way,\u201d he said. His mother, he added, \u201ctaught me about narration, about stories, about invention. She was pretty theatrical.\u201dAs a child, Mr. Zeller suffered from terrible asthma and was often hospitalized. When he was 15, he fell into an asthma-induced coma. \u201cThat was a definitive moment,\u201d he said. Afterward, \u201cI didn\u2019t see the world through the same glasses, in the same way. I think it\u2019s at that moment that worry and writing entered my life.\u201dAlong the way, he met his wife, Marine Delterme, a French television actress nine years his senior, when, after his first novel came out, a magazine asked him to interview her along with her best friend: Carla Bruni, her roommate in New York at 18. Ms. Delterme was a witness when Ms. Bruni married former French President Nicolas Sarkozy.The playwright and his wife regularly make the social pages \u2014 the opening last fall of \u201cLe Mensonge\u201d (\u201cThe Lie\u201d) got a full-page spread in Paris Match, and it and another of his plays have been filling houses despite a Paris still rattled by the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks. But \u201cThe Father\u2019\u2019 brings him to a new audience: his first American production, straight to Broadway.Starting out, he could never have imagined it. \u201cI consider myself very spoiled,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Zeller said as the tea grew cold. \u201cIt took a lot of steps and accidents to get there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said it had increased its consumer loans \u2014 extending 1.2 million new credit cards in the quarter \u2014 while also releasing millions of dollars it had set aside to cover potential losses from defaulting consumers.Much of the good news that came from the banks\u2019 consumer businesses, however, was overshadowed by issues in their commercial loan portfolios, where persistently low oil and gas prices have put pressure on the highly indebted energy industry.Bank of America said it had set aside an additional $525 million for oil- and gas-related loan losses, bringing its total energy reserves up to about $1 billion, covering about 4.6 percent of its energy loans.Wells Fargo increased its oil- and gas-related reserves to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, covering 9.3 percent of its energy portfolio, and began to record losses on some of the loans.Trading in stocks and bonds was hurt by volatility in world markets, as the outlook for the global economy darkened and the direction of interest rates became uncertain.Overall market revenue at JPMorgan fell 13 percent from a year earlier. At Bank of America, sales and trading revenue dropped 16 percent after accounting for certain debt valuation adjustments.Wells was less affected by the rough market conditions because its Wall Street operations are smaller than those of its peers.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.As the fortunes of their investment and consumer banking units seesaw, banks might seem tempted to increase their the most profitable businesses and take more risks on the strength of American consumer.But bank executives vowed they would stay prudent. Mr. Donofrio said Bank of America was able to expand its credit card business without extending loans to people with less than stellar credit.John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the bank had been willing to give up market share in the red-hot auto market to avoid taking too much risk. Wells said it has capped its subprime exposure at 10 percent of total auto loans.\u201cWe drew a line and lost some share,\u201d Mr. Shrewsberry said in an interview. \u201cWe have stuck with the approach not to take any more credit risk.\u201dDespite the challenges, the quarter was better than expected. All three big banks reported higher profit than analysts polled by Reuters had forecast.Bank of America said its profit declined 13 percent from a year ago to $2.7 billion, or 21 cents a share. Analysts expected profit of 20 cents a share.\u201cWe are running this company so we can be a source of stability and strength,\u201d Mr. Donofrio said. \u201cWe are not trying to earn all of our money in good times only to give it back in tough times.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Apple is taking advantage of the economic mess and enjoying extra profit on the backs of its lowest employees. Apple employees shouldn&apost be paid significantly more than other floor workers at other retail stores just because Apple products are expensive and desirable and bring in a lot of revenue. Until those employees unionize, they&aposll continue to get the smallest crumbs possible. Henry Ford realized many years ago that in order for his company to succeed his workers had to be paid wages high enough in order for them to purchase the products the company produced. Apple is able to do this because Apple can recruit employees from its cult-like user base. They have users who would work for free because of their religious devotion to Apple products.

When it comes to paying Uncle Sam, the strategy for the vast majority, is to pay as little as is legally possible. And\n                                                        why not - the government&aposs greatest talent is wasting taxpayer dollars. Hopefully, Apple contributes generously to US charities, benefiting Americans in ways the government does not.The fundamental flaw is that all federal corporate tax returns of public corporations should be made public. And those returns should be reconciled with all SEC filings. The interested public has a right\n                                                        to know since only public charters allow the corporate form.I expect better of Apple.

The increases would be breathtaking from a Western perspective.We need to remind these companies that there&aposs marketable value in doing the right things.This article ignores a living standard common to hundreds of millions of workers, and instead solely focuses on Foxconn and the large shadow it casts.I would be willing to pay a premium to know my purchase was going to support more jobs in the US.Apple is kidding itself if it believes it can blame their decision to outsource assembly on the fact the American workers aren&apost \"skilled\" enough. It comes down to cold efficiency.China is simply like the United States and England were during the Industrial Revolution. What I don&apost understand is why these companies assume there is only a market for the lowest priced product and not also one for customers who want to pay more for a product made in the USA.We need a global movement so that long term public well-being is served by business, not destroyed by it.What happens to these Chinese workers if, as some suggest, the world was to shut down the &aposevil empire&apos known as Apple?It&aposs one thing to maximize profits; it&aposs another thing entirely to make so much money at the expense of exploiting workers in China.You can&apost really blame companies like Apple, which have to compete on price and features.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rise Shows Religion Is Losing Its Political Power", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe most surprising aspect about Mr. Trump\u2019s solid appeal among Republican primary voters, though, may be what it says about the waning place of religion in American politics and the revival of a populism centered more on economic nationalism and white working-class discontent.\u201cIt is intriguing that we have some notable challenges to the political establishment that are not coming from a traditional American religious place but from a surprisingly secular tradition,\u201d said David Voas, head of the social science department at University College London.Scholars like Professor Voas argue Americans are undergoing a process similar to what has happened in Europe, where secular institutions took over many of the jobs once performed by the church. Professors Hout and Fischer argue, instead, that the erosion reflects the shocks and aftershocks from the 1960s: like churches\u2019 censureship of premarital sex and young people\u2019s growing acceptance of homosexuality.\u201cOrganized religion gained influence by espousing a conservative social agenda that led liberals and young people who already had weak attachment to organized religion to drop that identification,\u201d they wrote. By 2012, 36 percent of liberals preferred no religion, compared to just 7 percent of conservatives.Regardless of the deeper dynamics, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign poses a critical question: Is the alignment of interests on the right, entwining religious fervor with free market economics, fraying? If so, what will take its place?\u201cThe notion that evangelical voters are nonresponsive to anything other than abortion and homosexuality overstates the power of religion on political choice,\u201d said Nolan McCarty, professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.Republicans\u2019 longstanding strategy has been showing signs of wear for a while. By 2012, Professor Hout argued, it was clear that they \u201chad pretty much gotten as much as they were going to get out of religion.\u201d They couldn\u2019t expand the base any further by appealing to devout Christians, he said, \u201cbecause they had rounded them up already.\u201dStill, it took Mr. Trump to identify the real Achilles\u2019 heel in the Reagan coalition: an economic policy built around tax cuts for the wealthy that has failed to deliver the goods to the Republican base for far too long.While Mr. Trump\u2019s economic proposals may not add up to a coherent agenda for most voters, it does suggest, said Kenneth Scheve, a professor of political science at Stanford, that \u201cthere is something wrong in the policy bundle Republicans have offered them over and over again.\u201dMr. Trump may not be able to ride his coalition to the White House (he has alienated too many women and Hispanics, among others). But he has probably changed American politics for good. And that calls for more policy experimentation to address directly the traumas of the working class.\u201cI can\u2019t see the rhetoric of small government go away,\u201d Professor Scheve said. \u201cBut some Republicans might try including support for social insurance as a strategy.\u201dHe compared the position of contemporary Republicans to that of British Conservatives after their devastating political defeat at the end of World War II, when they accepted the legitimacy of a social safety net. \u201cThe Tories at some point said this is the way democratic capitalism works,\u201d Professor Scheve said.Democrats, of course, have not been able to carry out an economic agenda that unites working-class whites with minority constituencies, either.All that suggests that the 2016 election is emerging as one that potentially leads to a major realignment of political allegiances, much as the election of 1968 did. Then, Lyndon Johnson\u2019s desegregation policies pushed Southern whites from the Democratic Party into the arms of Republicans, who built a long-lasting political coalition around resentment over the rise of racial and ethnic minorities.Mr. Trump\u2019s naked appeal to those resentments is likely to come up short. So where will the next majority come from?\u201cThe new winning coalition is up for grabs,\u201d Professor Hout said. It doesn\u2019t seem to have a big place for religion, though.\u201cThey can\u2019t win without them,\u201d Professor Hout added, speaking of Republicans and their Christian supporters. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t enough.\u201dAn earlier version of this column gave an outdated position for David Voas. He is head of the social science department at University College in London, no longer a sociologist of religion at the University of Essex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Lower House of Congress Votes for Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported byAfter three days of impassioned debate, the lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, voted to send the case against Ms. Rousseff to the Senate. Its 81 members will vote by a simple majority on whether to hold a trial on charges that the president illegally used money from state-owned banks to conceal a yawning budget deficit in an effort to bolster her re-election prospects. That vote is expected to take place next month.Those pressing for impeachment had to win the support of two-thirds of the 513 deputies in the lower house; the decisive 342nd vote for impeachment happened at about 10:10 p.m. Eastern time. The final vote was 367 for impeachment, 137 against and 7 abstaining. Two deputies did not vote.If the Senate accepts the case, Ms. Rousseff will step down temporarily while it deliberates her fate. Vice President Michel Temer, a constitutional law scholar and seasoned politician, will assume the presidency.Given the larger-than-expected margin of deputies voting for impeachment, some political analysts said the Senate was likely to remove Ms. Rousseff from office, a ruling that would require a two-thirds majority.\u201cPoliticians know how to read society pretty well, and they can sense that the people want her out,\u201d said Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.Ms. Rousseff can still appeal to the Supreme Federal Tribunal, Brazil\u2019s highest court, though it has rejected previous motions to have the impeachment measure dismissed.The chamber\u2019s decision to impeach Ms. Rousseff less than halfway through her second term provoked shouts of joy among the thousands of protesters who had gathered in the capital and in cities across the country, but also cries of treachery from her supporters.Weeping as she stood amid the throngs rallying in support of the president, Gabriela Correia, 22, a customer service representative, said she was disgusted that so many deputies, some of them notoriously corrupt, had voted against Ms. Rousseff. \u201cI want to make clear that I\u2019m not here to defend a politician, but to protect our democratic political system,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart is aching.\u201dSome political analysts said they worried that the move to impeach Ms. Rousseff would cause lasting damage to Brazil\u2019s young democracy, re-established in 1985 after two decades of military dictatorship.\u201cThis is a coup, a traumatic injury to Brazil\u2019s presidential system,\u201d said Pedro Arruda, a political analyst at the Pontifical Catholic University in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThis is just pretext to take down a president who was elected by 54 million people. She doesn\u2019t have foreign bank accounts, and she hasn\u2019t been accused of corruption, unlike those who are trying to impeach her.\u201dAlthough legal experts and political analysts are divided, many have expressed concern over the basis of the impeachment drive. They note that the budgetary sleight of hand that Ms. Rousseff is accused of employing to address the deficit has been used by many elected officials, though not on so large a scale.\u201cIt\u2019s putting a very large bullet in Brazilian democracy,\u201d said Lincoln Secco, a professor of history at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThis will set a very dangerous precedent for democracy in Brazil, because from now on, any moment that we have a highly unpopular president, there will be pressure to start an impeachment process.\u201dThe vote to impeach is a crushing defeat for Ms. Rousseff and her Workers\u2019 Party, a former band of leftist agitators who battled the nation\u2019s military rulers in the 1980s and who swept to power in 2002 with the election of one of the group\u2019s founders, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, to the presidency.Mr. da Silva, a skillful politician who endeared himself to both rich and poor, presided over heady economic growth and a generous expansion of social welfare benefits that helped lift millions of Brazilians out of abject poverty.He also moved to strengthen the government\u2019s control of key industries like petroleum. That set the stage for abuses at Petrobras, the state-owned oil company, that would later ensnare scores of the nation\u2019s political and business elite in a scheme that funneled kickbacks into campaign coffers.Barred by the constitution from running for a third term, he anointed Ms. Rouseff as his successor, and she easily won election in 2010.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.A former Marxist guerrilla, Ms. Rousseff had never before held elected office, and critics say her lack of political skills hampered her ability to work with opposition members in Congress as well as key figures in her governing coalition.In 2014, she was re-elected by a thin margin after an especially divisive campaign.As the economy went into a tailspin and a huge corruption scandal took down once-untouchable political figures, Ms. Rousseff was abandoned by many of her allies, giving momentum to an impeachment initiative conceived by her rivals.\u201cWhen things started going wrong, she was unable to get the situation under control, and her lack of flexibility and stubbornness made things worse,\u201d said Mathieu Turgeon, a political scientist at the University of Bras\u00edlia. \u201cAll of this has now caught up with her.\u201dThe impeachment drive has been polarizing, spurring raucous street protests, sundering friendships and provoking widespread anxiety over the potential impact to Brazil\u2019s democracy.Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have likened the impeachment drive to a slow-rolling coup by her political rivals, among them Mr. Temer, her vice president, who last month joined those calling for her impeachment.The recent fortunes of Brazil, once an economic powerhouse of the developing world, have gone from bad to worse, with the economy expected to contract at least 3.5 percent for a second year in a row. Millions of Brazilians have lost their jobs since the days of double-digit growth, fueled in part by China\u2019s hunger for commodities.In recent months, her once-favorable approval ratings have dipped below 8 percent.\u201cThis is a government that has lost legitimacy, credibility and the ability to govern,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation.\u201dAlthough Ms. Rousseff is not accused of corruption, the Petrobras scandal has implicated important members of her party, including Mr. da Silva. He is being investigated over allegations that he and his foundation received the equivalent of $7.8 million in services and lecture fees from construction companies seeking government contracts.The unfolding scandal, known as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash, has riveted Brazilians, as prosecutors have released details of how Petrobras funneled millions of dollars into the political campaigns of Workers\u2019 Party politicians and their allies.\u201cThe impeachment is on relatively weak constitutional grounds, but at the end of the day, this is a vote on the massive corruption probe, deep recession and a series of other issues that have plagued this administration,\u201d said Christopher Garman, a Brazil analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.Ms. Rousseff is the second Brazilian leader to be impeached since 1992, when Fernando Collor de Mello, facing huge protests over an influence-peddling scandal, resigned moments before the Senate was to vote on his ouster.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predicament is somewhat different. Unlike Mr. Collor de Mello, she has not been accused of self-enrichment, and despite her sagging popularity, only 61 percent of Brazilians support impeachment, down from 68 percent last month, according to a survey by the polling firm Datafolha.Then there is the question of who and what comes next. Vice President Temer, a senior member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, will have to grapple with political and economic challenges.He also faces possible impeachment over the same allegations lodged against Ms. Rousseff, as well as accusations that he was involved in an illegal ethanol-buying scheme.Next in line for the presidency after Mr. Temer is Eduardo Cunha, the powerful leader of the lower house, who has been a driving force behind Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. An evangelical Christian who is fond of using his Twitter account to spread biblical verse, Mr. Cunha is accused of using a Swiss bank account to conceal $40 million in bribes.\u201cPeople are fed up with the mismanagement and economic mistakes of Dilma, and the corruption and arrogance of the Workers\u2019 Party, but no one feels any optimism for what might come next,\u201d said Raul Juste Lores, the editor at large for Folha de S.Paulo, a leading Brazilian newspaper.As tens of thousands of people gathered outside the National Congress on Sunday to express their support for or against impeachment, some celebrated by setting off fireworks, while others said there were no winners in the day\u2019s vote.Among them was Stephany Machado, 22, a Portuguese teacher who had made the 16-hour trip by bus from S\u00e3o Paulo. Although she said she was not a supporter of the Workers\u2019 Party, she worries about the long-term damage that impeachment could inflict on democracy in Brazil.\u201cDilma is president through the power of our votes, and what they are trying to do is remove her from power in an anticonstitutional way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t give this up without a fight.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from Bras\u00edlia, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

You know, women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues.The other candidates, all men, talk about those issues, too.Certainly, Mrs. Clinton has said that her election to the presidency would be historic.

And she does point out rather frequently that electing someone like Mr. Trump as president would be bad for American women \u00e2\u0080\u0093 starting with his fairly recently minted right-wing views on abortion. But Bernie Sanders says that kind of thing about Mr. Trump too, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a woman.Only members of privileged elites are bothered when members of oppressed groups, like women and African-Americans, have the bad taste to be who they are in public.Mr. Trump was not all negative, though, on the Clinton gender issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beautiful thing is, women don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like her, okay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd look at how well I did with women tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump did well among women who voted in the Republican primaries on Tuesday.

{"Headline": "Taking a Trip, Literally, on Colorado\u2019s Pot Trail", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byWe were somewhere north of Denver, not far from the pot farm, when my neighbor on the party bus pulled hard on his pipe and said: \u201cKnow what it is I love about this country? Everyone gets stoned.\u201dFor purely professional reasons, I was myself at that point something slightly less than wholly sober and shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that our tour that day \u2014 from farm to head shop to post-smoke munchies meal \u2014 had attracted such a rich assortment of potheads. Then again, there isn\u2019t much surprising about Colorado\u2019s marijuana tourist boom.Imagine visiting Napa Valley \u2014 but with weed instead of wine. The state\u2019s \u201cgreen rush,\u201d as everybody calls it, is a billion-dollar enterprise of hydroponic grow labs and artisanal dispensaries, but the tourist infrastructure that\u2019s emerged to stoke you up and squire you around to see it all operates on a fairly simple principle: Everything is better when you\u2019re high.As I began my exploration of Colorado\u2019s marijuana tourist trade, it occurred to me that a certain amount of lethargy was, well, baked into the notion from the start. So I went looking for something more extensive than a two-hour suds and buds tour, but nothing quite so much as a fully immersive Ganja Yoga Retreat.I should note from the start that I\u2019m not much of a smoker. While bourbon doesn\u2019t last long on my shelf, I get high, at most, a few times a year. That\u2019s why I appreciated the weekend\u2019s first event: an orientation with a cannabis sommelier. I had by then already checked into my hotel downtown, the Crowne Plaza Denver, where a winking desk clerk handed me a large metal vaporizer, my so-called in-room unit. Alone, upstairs, I took it for a shakedown run. It was only 9 a.m.Like almost everyone I met in the local pot trade, Mr. Metoyer, who is 22 and grew up in a Pentecostal church, had come to marijuana only recently. A few years ago, he told me as we made our way into a ballroom, he\u2019d been working as a docent at a silver mine in the mountains when J.J. Walker, founder of My 420, went on one of his trips. Mr. Walker was apparently impressed and offered Mr. Metoyer a job. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe at first that \u2018pot tour guide\u2019 was, you know, an actual position,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as you can see, it obviously is.\u201dWaiting for us in the ballroom was our sommelier, Michael Pyatt, the director of training at Native Roots \u2014 \u201cthe Gucci of dispensaries,\u201d Mr. Metoyer whispered as we sat down at a table. Mr. Pyatt is a tall, thin man of 27, formerly employed in sales at Best Buy. His knowledge of the product, accumulated over years of personal research, was exhaustive and, within a few minutes, he had filled our table with little plastic canisters of weed.\u201cYou a smoker?\u201d Mr. Pyatt asked. I told him not so much. And so, in an almost oenological language, he started to describe for me the qualities of the Native Roots proprietary brands: Harlequin, for instance (\u201ca mix of three sativas\u201d) and Sour Kush (\u201cmusky, sweet, cerebral with a nice tight nug structure\u201d).As Mr. Pyatt peered into his goody bag for another strain to show, I turned to Mr. Metoyer and asked what kinds of people usually sign up for his tours. \u201cI get everyone,\u201d he told me, \u201cmen, women, young, old, but 60 percent of my clients are from Texas.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s a weed-repressed society,\u201d Mr. Pyatt said.) Then Mr. Metoyer added: \u201cMost of our customers are blown away the first time they start smoking on the party bus. They\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a sec, you\u2019re sure this is legal?\u2019 When I tell them it is, then they\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa, dude, I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life for this!\u2019\u201dBy that point, he had found a package of his favorite brand, Jellybean, and told me, with a little thirsty lick of his lips, \u201cThis one\u2019s got a great head high \u2014 it\u2019s the perfect daytime smoke.\u201d My 420 doesn\u2019t have a marijuana vendor\u2019s license and can\u2019t give samples to its customers, but a workaround was hastily arranged. Mr. Metoyer asked if I had had a chance to test the small vaporizer in my swag bag. When I told him I hadn\u2019t, Mr. Pyatt plucked a frosty bud of Jellybean and offered his assistance: \u201cI could, um, demonstrate it for you \u2014 if you like.\u201dOne perk of a My 420 all-inclusive cannabis vacation was a livery car and driver. When I\u2019d arrived the day before at Denver International Airport, a huge black Chevrolet Suburban had been waiting at the curb. Climbing inside, I discovered leather seats, a lingering smell of skunk weed and, behind the wheel, a man named Tariq Williams. Mr. Williams became my escort for the weekend, driving me to various events, including the next one: a cannabis cooking class.A couple of years ago, Mr. Williams had been driving for the airport service Super Shuttle when he came to the conclusion that recreational pot was about to take Denver\u2019s economy by storm. So he quit his job, bought the Suburban used (for $28,000) and hasn\u2019t looked back since.\u201cI saw it coming,\u201d he told me that first day, \u201cand I had to get my feet in at an early stage.\u201d While he isn\u2019t yet making what he once made at the airport, he expects he will be soon. At any rate, everyone he knows works in marijuana these days. His brother, who owns a security company, now has contracts with various dispensaries, and one of his friends does waste removal for a cultivation plant. Other friends work as budtenders, or as hash extractors, or as couriers moving plants from farm to store.I found myself at a work station with two more couples: Jason Lewis, a 43-year-old chef, and Holly Gulbranson, 36, a hair stylist, who had come in from Atlanta to celebrate her birthday; and Scottie and Lauren Long, a young musician and insurance-saleswomen pair, who were on their honeymoon from Orlando. All of them said that they had come to Colorado for the pot. \u201cScottie doesn\u2019t drink so we wanted to go somewhere we could both enjoy ourselves,\u201d Ms. Long told me. \u201cThe wedding was for everybody else, but the honeymoon\u2019s for us.\u201dThis winter, a study commissioned by the Colorado Tourism Office found that nearly half of the people polled said that the state\u2019s loose marijuana laws had influenced their decision to visit. While state officials have themselves argued that the poll was misleading \u2014 it never asked whether the influence was positive or negative \u2014 if the cooking class was any measure, then weed has now joined skiing and microbreweries as one of Colorado\u2019s tourist draws.Mr. Lewis and Ms. Gulbranson had already made the rounds of several Denver restaurants and planned to travel to Pagosa Springs, but the common denominator in their movement through the state was marijuana. Mr. Lewis, a longtime pot enthusiast, told me it was simply nice to be someplace where he didn\u2019t really have to hide his habit. \u201cWe do live in Georgia,\u201d Ms. Gulbranson said.It was the same thing with the Longs. In Florida, they explained, they worried all the time about smoking on the street or getting caught with a joint inside their glovebox, but in Denver they could sit on the patio of their pot-friendly rental and pass a bowl in plain sight of the neighbors. \u201cIt was a little weird at first because we\u2019re so used to hiding it,\u201d Ms. Long went on. \u201cBut when we came in from the airport, they let us smoke in the car. We were both like: \u2018Holy cow, the car!\u2019 \u201dMaybe I just like drinking, but I have to say, I didn\u2019t get it. I mean, I got it: It was cool getting high without fear of being hassled by the cops. But was that really something around which you could plan a whole vacation? I understand that people go on wine trips, but generally speaking, they\u2019re not popping bottles of shiraz the minute they leave the baggage claim. When I thought about it later, it occurred to me that what I might have been reacting to was the hard sell that Denver\u2019s ganja-preneurial class was putting on these poor, weed-repressed out-of-towners, the way in which their stifled desire for pot was being commodified.At a certain point, I started to suspect that the city\u2019s reefer tourist moguls were getting their clients high mainly for the purpose of relieving them of their money. \u201cFeel free to load those pipes, guys \u2014 someone roll a fatty!,\u201d our guide aboard the party bus encouraged us, as we climbed on for the tour. This was only hours after the cooking class, and those taking part in both events were by that point wasted. But the exhortation to smoke more pot \u2014 not least, on the way to a pot lab \u2014 was simply too enticing to pass up.The technical aspects of the lab were pretty interesting: cryogenic freezers, low-temp ovens, lots of fluorescent lights \u2014 like something you might find at a pharmaceutical plant or in crime scene photos. Ms. Sanders informed us that every seedling in the building had been tagged at birth with an RFID chip so that the state could monitor its progress from cultivation to retail sale. She was pretty interesting herself: a former financial compliance officer who, like many others, saw an opportunity in pot. \u201cI had a passion for the plant,\u201d she said as we made our way past a giant indoor copse of marijuana, \u201cand\u201d \u2014 this seemed especially important \u2014 \u201cthere was no glass ceiling.\u201dThings became a bit less interesting as the lab tour ended and, back onboard the bus \u2014 joints and pipes ablaze again \u2014 we took a ride to a Mindful dispensary, the pot vacation version of a museum gift shop. The transformation from tourist to consumer was immediate, if only because our options were so numerous. There, on the shelves before the spellbound heads, was Mindful\u2019s entire product line: transdermal pot patches, marijuana taffy, pot bacon brittle, all-natural vegan pot capsules, Incredible Affogato pot candy bars, CannaPunch cannabis drinks, a Bubba Kush strain of root beer, Wake and Shake canna coffee, Lip Buzz lip balm, Apothecanna pain creams, and, of course, a wide variety of hashes, extracts and smokeables.Next morning, after visiting the hotel gym, I had brunch with Danny Schaefer, the chief executive of Pioneer Industries, parent of My 420. Wanting me to get \u201cthe full experience,\u201d Mr. Schaefer urged me to \u201cconsume\u201d before our meal \u2014 if I missed any reportorial details, he\u2019d make sure I got them later.While that was kind, I kept to the restaurant\u2019s menu, listening as he talked about the growth of My 420\u2019s business. In 2015, its second year of operation, the company handled 300 to 600 customers a week, he said, with an average ticket price of $650. This year, he added, ticket sales were already up by 35 percent.Mr. Schafer went on to say that \u201ctaboo tourism\u201d was only one part of the local pot economy, which, he added, also included packaging, labeling and lighting companies, not to mention law firms, consultants and \u2014 because the industry uses only cash \u2014 heavily armed security firms. It was then that he told me that the ultimate goal of Pioneer Industries was to unite these businesses into a single vocal lobby, and thus turn Colorado into the country\u2019s premier pot vacation destination. \u201cWe\u2019ve got skiing, hiking, microbreweries,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re already the Mile High City.\u201dBut to seize that throne will require competing with states like Washington, which legalized recreational weed in 2012, and Oregon, which did the same on a slightly more restrictive basis in 2014. It will also require the cooperation of state tourism officials who, at least so far, have failed to embrace the vision of Colorado as the Promised Land of pot.\u201cFor most travelers, marijuana is a ho-hum issue,\u201d said Cathy Ritter, the director of the Colorado Tourism Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small segment of our travel population.\u201d When I spoke with her by phone, Ms. Ritter acknowledged that she hadn\u2019t used state money to promote pot tourism because most of the funds would, by definition, be spent outside of Colorado and, as she explained, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that that\u2019s a federal offense.\u201dBut it seemed to me that he had a different \u2014 and slightly darker \u2014 take on the future of the industry. \u201cThe big boys are coming,\u201d Mr. Breton said as we walked through his lab. \u201cAnd when that happens, I won\u2019t be able to compete anymore. I just hope I can sell at the right time and get a good price.\u201dThat evening, after my massage (no, you don\u2019t get high), I went for a long walk through the city. In the twilight, set against the mountains, Denver was changing. You could see it \u2014 in the construction cranes, in the old brick buildings giving way to boxy condominiums, in the faces of the tourists on the 16th Street pedestrian mall.What would happen, I wondered, when, like Mr. Breton suggested, Philip Morris and Pfizer \u2014 the big boys \u2014 arrived, and the quirky, prepubescent marijuana trade suddenly grew up and then went corporate? It was already grasping now, but then?By that point I had crossed the South Platte River to the Highlands again. In the neighborhood of quiet streets, I came across a burger joint and went inside for dinner. The room was warm, college basketball was playing on TV, and I took a seat among the large crowd at the bar. Ordering a beer, it occurred to me that I was very glad to have visited Denver when I did.Alan Feuer is a metro reporter for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Satellite Images Can Pinpoint Poverty Where Surveys Can\u2019t", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewAn explosion of data has already changed how we market products and politicians. Now a similar innovation is beginning to change how we combat poverty around the world.Consider an unlikely problem: finding the poor. Even in a world riddled with poverty, nearly every government, nonprofit and aid agency struggles with this issue. Where in Kigali should the Rwandan health ministry place a new health clinic? Which rural districts in India should receive rice at subsidized prices? All these decisions require not just knowing poverty exists, but pinpointing areas of greatest need.These challenges make new kinds of data \u2014 information that can be gathered indirectly using algorithms and novel sources \u2014 particularly valuable. Google searches and Twitter and Facebook posts, which are very useful in the United States, are unlikely to help us in Kibera or Dhaka, Bangladesh. But the core idea behind these sources of data \u2014 measuring without asking people directly \u2014 can be enormously helpful.Take the case of measuring the most basic of economic variables: gross domestic product. The numbers can be unreliable in countries where the statistical infrastructure is weak, the informal businesses do not want to be tracked and the numbers may be manipulated. Morten Jerven, an economist at Simon Fraser University, argues in his book, \u201cPoor Numbers,\u201d that for many African countries the lack of quality data impedes development.It also shows a vast darkness between them, depicting the grim reality of North Korea, where night lighting is a rare luxury. If North Korea is experiencing an economic miracle, it is a purely daytime affair.There are many other important, unconventional sources of data. Consider cellphones. For most of the world\u2019s poor, each call and text has a very noticeable and real monetary cost.We are beginning to see tangible benefits. For example, GiveDirectly, a nonprofit group that gives cash to the poor, now uses satellite imagery to identify villages where thatched roofs signal that they may need help. \u201cRemote sensing data can be powerful, especially when combined with cheap classification tools like crowdsourcing or machine learning,\u201d says Paul Niehaus, co-founder of the organization. \u201cThey\u2019ve let us strip cost and time out of the process.\u201dSome of these projects are about changing how we use old sources of data. Typically we take surveys to determine which variables are most correlated with poverty, such as having a thatched roof or a dirt floor or not having a toilet. These variables are then added up to form a score that ranks households. Those with the highest rank may be deemed eligible for help, whether it is a microloan, a food subsidy or a cash transfer.But this kind of simple score card does not take advantage of the latest technologies. For example, in the United States, modern credit scoring agencies do not simply add a few variables. They use predictive algorithms to scour data for complex relationships most associated with default, which are then combined into a tailored prediction of credit risk. Why should the financial services industry, where mere dollars are at stake, be using more advanced technologies than the aid industry, where human life is at stake?A winning World Bank Innovation Challenge project, with which I collaborated, aims to close this gap. Melissa Adelman, an economist at the World Bank and one of the lead researchers in our project, says: \u201cExisting surveys may contain much more information for poverty measurement than is actually used. We\u2019re exploring how many more of the poor could be identified and targeted for services by using machine-learning tools. It\u2019s exciting because those better algorithms are essentially free to use, so the benefit-to-cost ratio of any gain in targeting will be very large.\u201dAll of these efforts improve efficiency. It doesn\u2019t sound very romantic: Costs go down and accuracy goes up. Typically, efficiency gains like these excite only technocrats. But when these improvements truly help the neediest, all of us should be excited.SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN is the Robert C. Waggoner Professor of Economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Cruz Is Worse Than Trump", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "On economics, that is. On other issues \u2014 well, who was worse, Mussolini or Torquemada? Decisions, decisions.But on economics, Trump is a big protectionist, while Cruz is a devotee of the gold standard. And we know quite a lot about what these policies would do.Protectionism makes economies less efficient, but it does not, in general, destroy jobs. Put a tariff on imports and people will spend less on imports \u2014 but they will normally spend more on other things instead. So a worldwide turn toward protectionism would both reduce everyone\u2019s exports and reduce their imports, with the overall effect on spending and hence on employment more or less a wash.Which brings us to Cruz, who is enthusiastic about the gold standard \u2014 which did play a major role in spreading the Depression. The problem with gold is, first of all, that it removes flexibility. Given an adverse shock to demand, it rules out any offsetting loosening of monetary policy.Worse, relying on gold can easily have the effect of forcing a tightening of monetary policy at precisely the wrong moment. In a crisis, people get worried about banks and seek cash, increasing the demand for monetary base \u2014 but you can\u2019t expand the monetary base to meet this demand, because it\u2019s tied to gold. On top of that, a slump drives interest rates down, increasing the demand for real assets perceived as safe \u2014 like gold \u2014 which is why gold prices rose after the 2008 crisis. But if you\u2019re on a gold standard, nominal gold prices can\u2019t rise; the only way real prices can rise is a fall in the prices of everything else. Hello, deflation!So on economics, again, Trump is ignorant and unpredictable \u2014 but Cruz knows what isn\u2019t so, and would lead us to predictably dire results.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Union Seeks Higher Tariffs on U.S. Imports of Raw Aluminum", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 An American labor union is pushing the United States to impose broad, steep tariffs on aluminum imports using a little-used but wide-ranging trade law that has riled the country\u2019s trading partners in the past.The union blames China\u2019s rising exports, though if successful its effort would also affect American imports from Canada and many other countries.But Section 201 cases are also harder to win. They require proof that a domestic industry has been \u201cseriously injured\u201d by imports, a harder test than the mere proof of \u201cinjury\u201d from imports that is required for other trade cases.The union also argues that aluminum is important to national defense because it is widely used in military equipment.Presidents have almost always followed the commission\u2019s advice, although President Carter turned down a recommendation for tariffs on stainless steel flatware in 1978 and President George H.W. Bush rejected a recommendation for tariffs on extruded rubber threads in 1992. The Office of the United States Trade Representative declined to comment on the union\u2019s contentions.China, which already produces more than half the world\u2019s aluminum, is expanding capacity even as its economy decelerates. The result has been a surge in exports and falling prices for aluminum.Chinese exports of aluminum jumped more than 27 percent in the past two years, Chinese customs figures show.A spokesman for the government-affiliated China Aluminum Association, who gave his family name as Zeng, said aluminum\u2019s increasing use in high-speed railway equipment, aerospace and electronics justified China\u2019s expanding production capacity and rising exports.Smelters in Canada and elsewhere, having been displaced in their traditional international markets, have stepped up shipments of raw aluminum to the United States. American imports of raw aluminum from Canada, the biggest supplier, jumped 10 percent by tonnage last year, United States customs data shows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Book Reviews: Behind a Powerful Portfolio, a Successful Career", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfPersonal finance advice is often so focused on making sure our assets are properly diversified, taking every deduction we are entitled to and keeping investment costs low that it is easy to forget one important fact: When it comes to securing your financial future, the better you manage your career, the more money you are likely to have.Two new books about handling your family\u2019s finances stress that idea: The more money you make, the more you can save. Since raises are typically a percentage of what you currently earn, the higher the base, the greater the increase. Contributions that your employer makes to your retirement account are usually based on how much you put in. The higher your salary, the more you can invest. Your Social Security benefits are based on your earnings.For example, while she is all in favor of saving money on purchases, Ms. Palmer adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a dark side to penny-pinching. It keeps us focused on small, short-term savings instead of working on the far more significant strategies that can really build our family\u2019s wealth. We get a rush from saving $5 at checkout, while leaving $500 on the table because we didn\u2019t sign up for a flex-spending account at work to pay for child care expenses.\u201dHer general points \u2014 for example, that the spending and saving habits we develop in our 20s have a significant impact on our financial future \u2014 are solid. And she is occasionally very witty. \u201cI sometimes spend my lunch break texting with my younger sister, urging her to skip the $50 massage and instead learn to relax in less expensive ways after a bad day, in between offering her dating advice and career guidance. I am a full-service sister.\u201dStill, it would have been better if she had provided even more specific advice.Mr. McCormick, a managing partner of the private equity firm HCI Equity Partners, which invests in companies that generate about $20 million to $200 million in revenue, specifies his focus in his book\u2019s subtitle: \u201cUsing Business Principles to Maximize Your Family\u2019s Wealth.\u201dWhere Ms. Palmer is supportive, Mr. McCormick is hard-nosed, perhaps fitting for a graduate of both West Point and Harvard Business School.In talking about his recommendations, Mr. McCormick assumes \u201cyou have the discipline and intellectual honesty to act rationally.\u201d He adds, by way of example: \u201cMany advisers suggest you pay off your mortgage as quickly as possible. On the contrary, I recommend you pay off real estate debt last, even after making other investments, given the relatively low after-tax cost of this debt. But this assumes you actually save and reinvest this increased cash flow and don\u2019t blow it on a new flat screen or vacation.\u201dIf you own a home, having additional real estate investments, like shares of a real estate investment trust, or REIT, is not a good idea, he adds. But, he says, you probably want to own more international stocks.\u201cToday U.S. equities represent about half the global economy, a percentage that has been consistently decreasing. Basing your equity allocations on relative global market capitalization values will ensure your allocations change with the changing dynamics\u201d of the global economy.Conversely, he believes, you may have too much money in fixed-income investments. His recommendation, which strikes me as aggressive, is if you are three or more years away from retirement, you need to have only 36 months of total living expenses in bonds, Treasuries and money market funds. \u201cSo long as you are more than three years from retirement, there is no need for more fixed income exposure.\u201d Everything else, he says, should be in stocks.And those stocks should be in index funds. Active investing \u201cis analogous to the joke about how good the technology is on new airplanes these days,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead of two pilots, these new airplanes require one pilot and one dog. The dog\u2019s job is to bite the pilot if he tries to touch the controls. Many of us would be better off if we had a dog around to bite us when we are tempted to \u2018actively manage\u2019 our investments.\u201dBut for all that investing advice, Mr. McCormick devotes the first 50 pages of his book to the need to \u201cmaximize the value of your single biggest asset \u2014 your labor,\u201d making points such as, \u201cInvestments in education are one of the surest ways to financial security and wealth creation.\u201dArmed with that education, he adds, you want to \u201cmake career choices that extend your possibilities.\u201d You want to gain skills in fields like finance or marketing that are transferable to other industries as opposed to learning everything about one industry that could end up being disrupted out of existence.The proven principles of personal investing are important. But if you want to have a secure financial future, it will certainly help if you manage your career well. Neither Mr. McCormick nor Ms. Palmer advises that you choose a career based solely on what it pays, but it is certainly one factor to keep in mind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Calls Meeting With European Leaders Over Shared Challenges", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 President Obama will meet with Western European leaders on Sunday and Monday amid a growing sense in his administration that Europe is faltering in the face of multiple challenges, undercutting the trans-Atlantic alliance at a critical time.Even as Mr. Obama has tried to focus United States foreign policy more on Asia and China\u2019s rising power, administration aides say they have watched with concern as European unity has come under increased strain at a time of increased Russian aggression, slow economic growth, a virulent terrorism threat, and a huge influx of migrants from the Middle East and beyond.In meeting in Germany on Sunday with Chancellor Angela Merkel and on Monday with Ms. Merkel, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, Mr. Obama intends to press his European counterparts on a number of issues, aides said.They include a new trans-Atlantic trade pact, the need for better intelligence sharing within Europe about the terrorism threat, holding firm against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and trying to find a solution to the civil war in Syria.He is scheduled to give a speech Monday in Germany taking stock of Europe\u2019s challenges.\u201cThis speech allows him to step back at a time when the United States and Europe, together, are dealing with a range of challenges, from counter-ISIL and the threat of terrorism, to the current refugee crisis,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser.Mr. Rhodes said part of the president\u2019s address would focus on trade, including efforts by Europe and the United States \u201cto combat the headwinds in the global economy and promote sustainable growth.\u201dIn an interview published in a German newspaper on the eve of his visit there, Mr. Obama said it was \u201cnot my place to tell Europe how to manage Europe.\u201d But he said it benefited the United States to have a \u201cstrong, united, democratic Europe.\u201d And he said the \u201cserious challenges\u201d facing Europe must be confronted boldly.\u201cThe terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels were not only strikes on two of the world\u2019s great cities, they were assaults on the values of openness and diversity that we cherish on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the German paper, Bild Zeitung. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned through painful experience that threats to Europe ultimately become threats to the United States.\u201dHis message was similar in tone to the one he delivered Friday in London, where he bluntly urged British voters to reject a proposal to leave the European Union. He said that Britain was stronger inside the bloc and that a united Europe was in the interests of the United States.European unity \u201cis under strain,\u201d Mr. Obama said Friday as he stood by Mr. Cameron at a news conference and offered full-throated support for the prime minister\u2019s campaign to keep Britain in the European Union.At the same news conference, Mr. Obama asserted that \u201cthe ties that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than the forces that are trying to pull them apart.\u201d But administration aides say they share the fears among European officials in Brussels that a British vote to quit the European Union could pull a vital brick out of an already shaky structure.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some divisions and difficulties between the southern and the northern parts of Europe,\u201d Mr. Obama said Friday, referring to the euro crisis and migration. \u201cThat\u2019s created some strains.\u201dBut there are further tensions between Eastern and Western members of the European Union and NATO, too, over how to manage a more assertive, revanchist Russia, which has torn up the post-Cold War order in Ukraine and is trying to undermine confidence in NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense.The economy of the European Union has been much slower to recover from the crash in 2008, making the challenge of mass migration from the Middle East and North Africa harder to handle. The confusion and popular fear that matters are not under control have undermined public confidence in Ms. Merkel and in other European leaders, while promoting populism, Islamophobia and ultranationalism among a growing minority of voters.Those same forces have also helped to stall negotiations toward a far-reaching trade deal between the United States and the European Union. Opponents, particularly in Germany, argue that the agreement would inevitably favor the interests of large corporations and cause a shift of jobs to outsiders.Thousands of people protesting the trade deal are expected in Hanover, Germany, on Sunday when Mr. Obama arrives to tour an industrial trade show with Ms. Merkel.Mr. Obama, whose vision of a stronger, more cohesive Europe includes passage of the trade deal, campaigned Saturday on its behalf in London, where he urged a roomful of young people to view it as a positive approach.\u201cPart of the argument I\u2019m making in the United States is that the answer to globalization and income inequality and lack of wage growth is not to pull up the drawbridge and shut off trade,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Among the main concerns of Mr. Obama\u2019s delegation is major, consistent gaps in intelligence gathering and intelligence sharing within Europe when the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is targeting the Continent and exploiting the ease of movement across borders.That vulnerability prompted Mr. Obama to call together the meeting on Monday with his counterparts from the four biggest Western European nations, to discuss counterterrorism strategies and intelligence sharing.\u201cThey understand how indispensable U.S. intelligence is for understanding who is in the country, where they are moving around,\u201d said Heather Conley, a former State Department official and now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThis is completely weighing down Europe.\u201dThe five leaders are also likely to discuss the situations in Syria and in Libya, where the Islamic State has built a strong presence close to Europe in the chaos that resulted from the Western intervention to overthrow Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.The president will be back in Europe for a NATO summit meeting in early July, when many of these same issues will be on the table, including a pronounced political shift to the right in the host country, Poland.Mr. Obama has already agreed to increase the number of American troops in Europe, announcing in March that he would deploy rotations of United States-based armored brigade combat teams to Eastern Europe to create what officials call a continuous, but not a \u201cpermanent,\u201d presence.But there are also concerns about an increasingly authoritarian presidential regime in Turkey, a NATO member that is a front-line state with Syria. Turkey is also playing an important if controversial role in preventing migrants and asylum seekers from trying to reach Europe by boat.In the interview in the German paper, Mr. Obama praised Ms. Merkel as being \u201ccourageous\u201d in handling of the surge of migrants into Europe from Syria. The president said Ms. Merkel had \u201cspoken of our moral obligation to people, including families and children, fleeing horrific conditions, including the barbarity of the Assad regime in Syria and ISIL.\u201dThe president also used the trip to buck up Mr. Cameron, with whom he played golf on Saturday at the Grove, the site of the 2016 British Masters tournament and one of England\u2019s most luxurious courses.But the president\u2019s intervention in the British debate over the European Union has been controversial, with a significant number of commentators saying he was overstepping. Robin Niblett, however, the director of Chatham House, a policy institute in London, said the United States was right to try to intervene after having fought two wars in the last century to keep Europe free.A British exit, Mr. Niblett said, \u201cwould potentially destabilize the E.U. at just the wrong time: when a rearmed Russia has rejected the rules-based order created to sustain peace in Europe after the Cold War, when Continental E.U. governments are struggling to manage an unprecedented inflow of refugees and migrants, and when populist parties are gaining in strength on the back of a still painful economic recession for many.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, \u201cit would leave just as the U.S. is trying to strengthen the trans-Atlantic relationship in the face of a more economically and politically assertive China.\u2019\u2019An article in some editions on April 24 about President Obama\u2019s scheduling of meetings with Western European leaders amid a growing sense in his administration that Europe is faltering in the face of multiple challenges misstated the day on which he was scheduled to give a speech in Germany. It was Monday, April 25, not Sunday, April 24.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Growing Ardor for Overseas Shopping", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNelson Peltz sat on the board of Legg Mason, the $3.7 billion asset management company, for five years while his hedge fund, Trian Partners, scooped up 10 percent of the company\u2019s stock.Mr. Peltz shook things up as he always does. He ousted the chief executive and got Legg to cut costs and return billions of dollars to shareholders. When it came time to exit the investment, Mr. Peltz sold his shares to the Shanda Group.Wait, what? You heard right. Shanda is a Chinese investment company that started out as an interactive-gaming company but now \u201cseeks global opportunities that offer business growth or unique breakthrough potential.\u201d On Tuesday, it spent $340 million to buy Mr. Peltz\u2019s stake in Legg, which got its start selling stocks out of a back office in the Baltimore Stock Exchange in 1899.The logic of this deal is hard to follow \u2013 not least because Shanda paid a premium to the market price for the Legg shares, something that almost nobody ever does for a passive minority stake. Yet such situations are hardly unique at a moment when Chinese companies and investors are going wild for assets of pretty much any color or stripe in the world\u2019s developed economies.Indeed, the Chinese ardor for overseas shopping has become so fervent that there\u2019s a new mantra making the rounds of Wall Street bankers who have an asset to sell anywhere in the world: \u201cWho\u2019s the Chinese buyer we\u2019ve never heard of?\u201dThe biggest advisory companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs routinely fly China specialists across the ocean when they pitch companies for the mandate to help sell a business.The surge in Chinese buyers, many of them unknown in the West \u2013 sometimes even in Hong Kong \u2014 requires a new level of due diligence and heightened vigilance, from banks, lawyers and accountants. As the curious case of Anbang Insurance\u2019s aborted \u2013 and inexplicable from the start \u2013 $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels suggests, it\u2019s harder for investment banks to really understand their Chinese clients\u2019 motivations.The examples cross nearly every industry and region. Though head-scratchers abound, not all of them are as hard to fathom as Shanda\u2019s Legg investment. Some reflect the overarching ambitions of Chinese Communist Party leaders. Some, like Alibaba\u2019s purchase of Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post, look like vanity plays. Others just take a creative stretch of industrial logic to justify. Underpinning them all seems to be a lack of confidence about prospects in the People\u2019s Republic.The China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s $43 billion takeover of the agrochemicals giant Syngenta falls squarely into the first category. The state-owned enterprise was set up by the country\u2019s former Ministry of Chemical Industry. Its chairman, Ren Jianxin, undoubtedly has a red phone linking his desk to the Communist Party\u2019s top brass in Beijing.The Syngenta deal looks like it is intended to satisfy China\u2019s goals to bolster food production in the world\u2019s largest agricultural market. Syngenta\u2019s chemicals and patent-protected seeds are a strategic asset for a nation that has a population of 1.4 billion. This deal, China\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition, is a relatively logical pairing.The same cannot be said of Shandong Ruyi\u2019s surprise $1.2 billion purchase last month of SMCP, the operator of the second-tier European fashion chains Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot. It\u2019s hard to argue, as Shandong Ruyi does on its website, that \u201cbeing involved in rabbit-hair spinning, textile & clothing, cotton textile, cotton printing and dyeing, knitting, fiber, jeans and real estate\u201d has made it a \u201cwell-known textile-related pluralism group.\u201d Still, kudos to the enterprising banker who alerted the firm to the willingness of the owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to part with the French retailer.At least Shandong Ruyi has a website. In the auction of Dah Sing Financial\u2019s insurance business, more than two dozen suitors showed up for the first round of bids, half of them from the mainland, and some so obscure that bankers involved in the process had never heard of them.That\u2019s not unusual. When the private equity firm EQT was selling a German company that generates energy from waste matter, eight interested parties from the mainland showed up. And unlike banks or insurers interested in Dah Sing, they weren\u2019t highly regulated entities. In the end, the business sold for 1.43 billion euros to Beijing Enterprises Holding, a conglomerate listed in Hong Kong with three business lines: gas, beer and sewage treatment.China\u2019s lunge for foreign assets has hit $92 billion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters, nearly reaching last year\u2019s $103 billion record with eight and a half months to spare.At that pace, it won\u2019t be long before Mandarin solidly displaces money as the language of opportunity on Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Menstruation Joins the Economic Conversation", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byLate-night pharmacy runs. Bulky pads. Periods have simply long been an uncomfortable experience.But now it has become an economic issue, too. Businesses, lawmakers and advertisers, prodded in large part by a frank online discussion of menstrual cycles and backed by calls for gender equality, have sought ways to make menstrual cycles a little less agonizing.Eight states and the District of Columbia have moved to eliminate sales tax on pads and tampons, and bills have recently passed in the New York and Mississippi State Senates. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the measure into law in the coming weeks.New companies are pursuing products to make women more comfortable during their period, including underwear that its manufacturer says will not leak and tampons made from 100 percent cotton.Even advertisers are taking a bolder approach to menstruation. Instead of displaying blue liquids squirting out of pipettes and women in white dresses frolicking on the beach, they are showing real women doing real activities, like working at a computer.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that this really goes to the heart of women\u2019s opportunity to participate fully in school, in the economy, in society, and we need to do something about it,\u201d said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a vice president at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School.\u201cMenstrual products are expensive, and it\u2019s absolutely debilitating if you don\u2019t have access to them,\u201d she said.Businesses and politicians are taking their cue from a growing effort to talk more openly about periods, with much of it happening online.\u201cThere was a reframe,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich was: \u2018Hey, that insult doesn\u2019t stick because there\u2019s nothing shameful about periods. And by the way, let\u2019s fix that.\u2019\u201dSince the start of the 2016 state legislative calendar, bills to exempt tampons and pads from sales tax have been introduced or resurrected in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, and have passed in Mississippi and New York, largely with bipartisan support. Similar legislation is being discussed in committees in South Carolina and Tennessee. Last month, Chicago passed an ordinance to eliminate the city\u2019s portion of the tax. In Utah, an all-male committee of lawmakers shut down a proposal to get rid of the state\u2019s tampon tax.If the suit is successful, women in New York could receive rebates for the last two years of taxes paid on menstrual products, an amount that most likely adds up to about $28 million over all, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. The women would continue to push for the refunds even after Governor Cuomo repealed the tax, they said.\u201cTampons and sanitary pads are a necessity for women, not a luxury,\u201d said Zoe Salzman, a lawyer for the women. \u201cThere is no way these products would be taxed if men had to use them.\u201dJames Gazzale, a spokesman for the New York State Taxation and Finance Department, said he could not comment on continuing litigation.\u201cIn terms of growth, you\u2019re basically just looking at population growth,\u201d said Jabel Parayil, an analyst at Euromonitor. \u201cThese manufacturers are trying to drive added value through advertising rather than true technological value. The new trends are really coming from the smaller companies.\u201dMiki Agrawal, a co-founder of Thinx, said conventional period products and marketing \u201cmake women uncomfortable, not sexy, not like themselves and not in their full power.\u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201dThe flurry of start-up activity has come as fresh competition for the big-name pad and tampon makers. Kanchan Patkar, brand director for Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Kotex brand, which logged global sales of more than $1 billion last year, said the traditional brands had not ignored feminine care.In an interview, Ms. Patkar listed a string of Kotex innovations over the years: panty liners for light days, compact tampon applicators, 3-D modeling of pads for a better fit and ultrathin pads that she says have reduced the bulkiness of period pads by 67 percent.Ms. Patkar says that Kotex also overhauled how it talks about periods. Its U by Kotex tampons and liners have abandoned their medicinal pale packaging for bold colors and designs.And the brand has moved away from what Ms. Patkar said was frivolous advertising of women with periods frolicking in white dresses. Some of its most recent ads feature women in a college dorm room, at a computer and Skyping with friends.\u201cWe decided to call out the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have cramps. You have bloating. You don\u2019t feel like jumping around in a field or doing extreme sports. And that\u2019s O.K.\u201dStill, as some of the start-ups have found, the topic is still not always easy to discuss.When Alexandra Friedman and Jordana Kier pitched their idea for a tampon delivery service to a potential investor last year, they found him wary of discussing the intimate product. So Ms. Friedman grabbed his glass of water, dunked one of her prototype tampons in it and forced him to look.\u201cI told him: \u2018This is what it\u2019s doing in a woman\u2019s body. It\u2019s absorbing liquid, and it\u2019s becoming bigger,\u2019\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cThen we left it in the middle of the table, and we finished eating.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with an article about start-ups that offer improved menstrual products described the material of the Lola tampon incorrectly. It is made of 100 percent cotton, but not organic cotton.An article on Friday about start-ups offering improved menstrual products omitted two people who helped found Thinx, an underwear company.

{"Headline": "Regulators Warn 5 Top Banks They Are Still Too Big to Fail", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byThe nation\u2019s top bank regulators have added an unexpected voice to the growing chorus of critics worried that the biggest American banks, nearly eight years after the financial crisis, are still too big to fail.The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Wednesday that five of the nation\u2019s eight largest banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 did not have \u201ccredible\u201d plans for how they would wind themselves down in a crisis without sowing panic.That suggests that if there were another crisis today, the government would need to prop up the largest banks if it wanted to avoid financial chaos.The announcement coincides with a presidential campaign that at times has been dominated by a debate over what danger the big banks still pose to the nation\u2019s economic security. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has called for the biggest banks to be broken up, a stand that his opponent, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, has criticized.But Mr. Sanders\u2019 position has drawn sympathy from some on the other side of the political spectrum, including the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, who was a Treasury official during the financial crisis.In long letters sent to the banks this week, the two regulatory agencies pointed to the dangers created by the global reach and complexity of the largest banks, which are bigger now than they were before the 2008 crisis.The current arrangement could \u201cpose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States,\u201d the regulators said in their letter to JPMorgan.The regulators this week did not come close to calling for a breakup, yet they did in effect provide backing for Mr. Sanders\u2019s premise that not enough has been done to safeguard the financial system.\u201cThe goal to end too big to fail and protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts remains just that: only a goal,\u201d Thomas M. Hoenig, the vice chairman of the F.D.I.C., said in a statement.The regulators were responding to the so-called living wills that banks must submit to regulators on a regular basis to explain how the banks plan to enter bankruptcy in an orderly fashion in case of a crisis. The living wills are a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, intended to help make large financial institutions less of a threat to the wider economy.The Fed and the F.D.I.C., which jointly oversee the largest banks, agreed that the plans put forward by five of the big banks, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon, were \u201cnot credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\u201dOnly one of the biggest banks, Citigroup, was given a passing grade by both agencies, though it too was told that its plans needed improvements. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley received passing grades from only one of the two agencies.Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman who was one of the architects of the Dodd-Frank law, said on Wednesday that the rejection of the living wills indicated that the regulators believed they still have more to do to tackle the too-big-to-fail issue. But he added that the regulators were showing resolve.\u201cIt sends a message,\u201d Mr. Frank said in an interview. \u201cIt signals that they are serious.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Frank has criticized the financial overhaul proposals by Mr. Sanders. Mr. Frank contends that some of the plans to break up the banks are simplistic because they take a one-size-fits-all approach. In contrast, he said, measures like the living wills allow regulators to press for banks to shrink, based on specific conditions at those firms.The five banks that received rejections have until Oct. 1 to fix their plans.After those adjustments, if the Fed and the F.D.I.C. are still dissatisfied with the living wills, they may impose restrictions on the banks\u2019 activities or require the banks to raise their capital levels, which in practice means using less borrowed money to finance their business.And if, after two years, the regulators still find the plans deficient, they may require the banks to sell assets and businesses, with the aim of making them less complex and simpler to unwind in a bankruptcy.\u201cObviously we were disappointed,\u201d Marianne Lake, chief financial officer of JPMorgan, said on Wednesday morning.The letter also said that JPMorgan did not have a good plan to wind down its outstanding derivative contracts if other banks stopped trading with it.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation\u2019s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.Ms. Lake said \u201cthere\u2019s going to be significant work to meet the expectations of regulators.\u201d But she also expressed confidence that the bank could do so without significantly changing how it does business.Investors appeared to agree that the verdicts from regulators did not endanger the banks\u2019 current business models. Shares of all of the big banks rose on Wednesday.The agencies criticized Wells Fargo\u2019s governance and legal structure, and faulted it for \u201cmaterial errors,\u201d which, the regulators said, raised questions about whether the bank has a \u201crobust process to ensure quality control and accuracy.\u201dIn a statement, Wells Fargo said it was disappointed and added, \u201cWe understand the importance of these findings, and we will address them as we update our plan.\u201dThe banking industry has complained that the process of submitting living wills is complex and hard to complete and it has suggested changes.\u201cA useful process reform might be to do living wills every two or three years, instead of annually,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, a public relations firm that works with the banks. \u201cThe time required for banks to produce them and regulators to react to them is clearly too tight.\u201dBut Martin J. Gruenberg, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., said on Wednesday that regulators were \u201ccommitted to carrying out the statutory mandate that systemically important financial institutions demonstrate a clear path to an orderly failure under bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s action is a significant step toward achieving that goal,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

The reason is her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Nearly 30 years before she worked for foreign companies in China, Ms. Chen served a stint in the Chinese military. After that, she was involved in a joint venture that was partly owned by the country\u2019s powerful domestic security ministry.Like many foreign-owned Internet services, Twitter has long been blocked in China. But Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment \u2014 and the stir it has caused \u2014 shows the complicated relationship between Twitter, the technology industry and China. The country has some of the world\u2019s strictest limits on online expression, and it requires Internet companies to place servers in the mainland. It has shown little compunction about blocking or banning companies that will not play along.Twitter has become an online home to a number of Chinese political activists abroad, who use it to communicate with one another and to share their views of current events in China with the world. Some of them reacted with condemnation over the weekend to Ms. Chen\u2019s appointment.In a statement, Dickson Seow, a Twitter spokesman, said that after college in the late 1980s, Ms. Chen was assigned by the Chinese government to become a junior engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army. She left in 1994, when the opening of the Chinese economy provided a chance, the statement said.She then was hired by Computer Associates, an American company, to lead its joint venture in China. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security owned a 20 percent stake in that venture through a local company, the statement said, and Ms. Chen focused on selling antivirus products and never worked for the ministry itself. According to her LinkedIn biography, she worked for Microsoft from 2005 to 2009 and for Cisco from 2009 to 2013, before returning to Microsoft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Family of Immigrants, Only One a Citizen, Anxiously Awaits Supreme Court Ruling", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byFAIRFAX, Va. \u2014 Jerry Pinto, an immigrant from Bolivia, has visions of opening a spacious carpentry workshop in this suburban city, with his name in bold letters over the door.\u201cI want a place where I can be visible,\u201d he says wistfully. But for now he knows he has to lie low, because he is in the country illegally. He runs his carpentry business almost surreptitiously from the cramped garage behind his house.Mr. Pinto is among more than four million unauthorized immigrants whose lives could be transformed by the Supreme Court. On Monday, the justices will hear oral arguments in a challenge brought by 26 states, led by Texas, to President Obama\u2019s effort through executive action to give the immigrants legal work permits and protection from deportation.Depending on the outcome, people like Mr. Pinto will have a chance to come out into the open or will remain, perhaps for years, in a twilight underground. And the stakes are high in this election year, since the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have both said they would deport all 11 million foreigners in the country illegally.The larger of the president\u2019s programs before the Supreme Court would benefit immigrants who are parents of United States citizens and legal permanent residents, if they pass background checks and have no serious criminal records.Most of those parents have families like Mr. Pinto\u2019s: an immigration mix that leads to differing opportunities and limits, and to openness, secrecy and fear all within one family.His wife, Elvira, 47, is from Mexico, and also here illegally. His daughter, Ambar, 22, and son Jerry Rodrigo, 15, were born in Bolivia but have grown up like American children in Virginia, although without legal residency. His youngest son, Christian, 8, is the American-born citizen who makes his parents eligible for Mr. Obama\u2019s program, should it be affirmed.Mr. Pinto was the first in the family to come. He and his wife, whom he met while they were studying in Mexico to be economists, were middle-class professionals in Bolivia before the economy collapsed in the 1990s. They returned to Mexico, and in 2004 he joined a tide of Mexicans running the border into the United States. He recalls being lost for four days without water in the Arizona desert in the heat of high summer, his feet so blistered he had to crawl.He made his way to Virginia where he had relatives, and he quickly discovered the work available to him without legal papers or a Social Security number was in construction \u2014 outdoors. He soon added a second trade, learning plumbing to work two jobs at once. Then he learned another skill, making exterior moldings. Several years ago he purchased an industrial saw that he installed in his garage and started his own company.Still, Mr. Pinto said, \u201cI can\u2019t think about anything more than survival and making sure my children have something to eat.\u201d Surrounded by the comforts of a well-to-do suburb, he sometimes could not pay rent and buy food.His wife cleans houses to add to the family income. But even after more than a decade here, she is often reluctant to leave the house.\u201cI hear news on the radio of an immigration raid nearby,\u201d she said, \u201cand it makes me think I might go out tomorrow morning and never return to see my children.\u201dThe Pintos know how the Supreme Court could change things for them because of what happened to Ambar. At first she was wary of signing up for an initiative by Mr. Obama in 2012, which gave a legal foothold to millions of young undocumented immigrants who came here as children, including authorization to work.\u201cI was giving my information to the government,\u201d Ambar recalled. \u201cThey are going to know my dad\u2019s and my mom\u2019s full names, our address.\u201d Eventually, she applied.The impact was immediate. She got a secretarial job at a Washington law firm to help pay her college costs. Emboldened, she joined a campaign to persuade Virginia officials to let immigrant students in the program attend state colleges at the lower, resident tuition rates. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, was impressed by her zeal and invited her to be his guest at Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in 2013.She was present \u2014 bursting into tears \u2014 when a new Virginia attorney general, Mark Herring, announced in 2014 that he would allow the immigrants to pay resident rates. After two years of community college, Ambar will move on this year to a state university, George Mason.Mr. Pinto observed his daughter\u2019s gains with pride and a twinge of envy. \u201cWe have to stop having our own dreams and just think about the future of our children,\u201d he said.Like the youth program, Mr. Obama\u2019s more recent initiative, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, also offered temporary deportation deferrals and work permits, but no lasting immigration status. The immigrants would be able to get driver\u2019s licenses in some states, to take out loans and own homes and businesses. The president also expanded the youth program, eliminating an upper age limit.The states that sued to stop the programs say Mr. Obama overstepped his powers and gave lawbreakers a quasi-legal status that Congress never approved, one that would burden their budgets with costs of services for the immigrants. An injunction was imposed by a federal court in Texas in February 2015, and upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.Sixteen states, including Virginia, and the District of Columbia submitted a brief to the Supreme Court supporting Mr. Obama, saying they expect to benefit through increased tax revenues from immigrants working legally and improved public safety.Virginia officials are divided on the issue. \u201cDo you go after gang members and drug dealers or spend those limited enforcement resources on breaking up families?\u201d Mr. Herring, the Virginia attorney general who is a Democrat, asked in an interview. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s an easy call.\u201dBut Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, signed a Supreme Court brief opposing the programs. \u201cThe lack of respect for our immigration laws on the part of government officials and unlawful immigrants is not conducive to promoting respect for the rule of law in general, for preventing crimes and promoting public safety,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. A decision from the court is expected in June.The Pintos are waiting anxiously. Christian, the American citizen now in third grade, has understood for the first time what could happen if immigration agents came for the family. His father and siblings could be sent to Bolivia, his mother to Mexico, and he could be left in the United States.\u201cAt first, like, I didn\u2019t even know what the word immigrant meant,\u201d Christian said. \u201cNow I know that being a citizen means a lot to me because if I wasn\u2019t born here, I wouldn\u2019t be able to help my mom and dad live here.\u201dIf the Supreme Court upholds the programs, Mr. Pinto will rush to apply. He will get a Virginia driver\u2019s license (the one he has now is from Maryland). He will take out a loan to open his workshop, then go back for a mortgage to buy their home.Hopeful, the family is already taking steps out of hiding, inviting a Democratic congressman, Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, to dinner earlier this month.\u201cI feel like an American,\u201d Mr. Pinto said. \u201cThis is my country now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syria\u2019s Future: A Black Hole of Instability", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 NOOR, who is a commander in a pro-government militia near Damascus, thinks that President Bashar al-Assad will prevail in Syria\u2019s civil war. But even so, he thinks it will take his country a generation to recover. \u201cAfter we finish this war, we\u2019ll spend another 10 years cleaning up the thugs and warlords on our own side,\u201d he told me when I met him in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana, in an apartment overlooking a highway where rebels and government forces clash nightly.That was last fall, shortly after Russia began bombing in support of the government. This infusion of firepower changed the course of the conflict. After years of stalemate, Syria\u2019s civil war became unstuck. But that hasn\u2019t made it ready for settlement.But all of this misses the central point: Syria, one of the most important states in the Arab world, has cracked up, and no peace settlement can put it back together.Despite talk of a \u201cregime\u201d and \u201copposition,\u201d Syria today is a mosaic of tiny fiefs. The government has ceded control of stretches of land to Iran, Russia and Hezbollah. Its opponents range from the apocalyptic Islamic State to a coterie of tiny insurgent groups led by local warlords reliant on foreign donors. On all sides of the conflict, warlords mark territory with armed checkpoints. These low-level bosses have tasted power; it\u2019s hard to imagine they will readily submit to any national government.Without Damascus, a rogue\u2019s gallery of militant movements might never have survived. Hezbollah grew into a powerful regional actor with sustained aid from Syria. Hamas\u2019s leaders weathered lean years in exile in Damascus. Many groups labeled terrorists by Western governments found refuge in Syria. The Assad government\u2019s patronage of Iraqi rebels helped fuel the uprising against the American occupation, and provided crucial early support to radicals who today lead the Islamic State.And yet, for all these destabilizing moves, Syria was a coherent focal point in a region short on leaders who could deal and deliver. On occasion, even the United States and Israel enjoyed close collaboration with Damascus.Now, Syria seems destined to influence the region not as a puppet-master but as a black hole. Syria\u2019s war already has spawned chaos, from the millions of refugees seeking safety beyond the country\u2019s borders to the rise of the Islamic State and the tremendous traffic in weapons and cash to militants.The next chapter could be even worse. Even if some fraction of the opposition can reach an accord with the government, the area they could try to rule would amount to a rump state. The nation\u2019s industrial heartland and most populous city, Aleppo, has been almost completely destroyed. Before the war, Syria\u2019s manufacturing economy, education and health systems all functioned well by regional standards; they are unlikely to recover. The postwar landscape will probably play host to extremists, entrepreneurs of violence and widespread graft.So why does anyone have hope for the talks in Geneva?One reason is superpower politics. Russia and the United States are looking for ways to calm tensions, and diplomats from both countries believe an accord could lead to progress on issues they consider more important, like Ukraine. Another critical factor is exhaustion: Iran and Hezbollah backed the regime for years but, without Russia\u2019s assistance, were unable to help it hold ground, much less win. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United States, the main sponsors of the opposition, have pulled back support whenever their proxies have surged, perhaps unsure that they\u2019ll behave responsibly if they win power.Syria\u2019s civilians are desperate. The ranks of fighters are dwindling, especially on the government side. None of the parties have given up hope of outright victory, but an increasing number of rebels and midlevel government supporters acknowledge that they will either have to settle for a divided country or join forces with their sworn enemies. Some of the rebel commanders I interviewed in March said they believed the war had entered an endgame, but that it would take at least a few more years of fighting before serious negotiating would begin. Until now, none of the players have taken peace talks seriously.Russia and America\u2019s renewed engagement has drawn the notice of negotiators, but that means only that they believe they might be embarking on a real process \u2014 not that they expect a result soon. That rivals like Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as Russia and the United States, will see eye to eye on a brokered deal to end the war is a long shot. But the idea that they would work together to prevent Syria\u2019s continued decay into a zone of violence is an even longer one.Thanassis Cambanis is a fellow at the Century Foundation and the author of, most recently, \u201cOnce Upon a Revolution: An Egyptian Story.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nor will his followers.Mr. Sanders probably has no more than a 10 percent shot at winning the Democratic nomination \u2014 and that\u2019s if something bad happens to Hillary Clinton or, less likely, if after winning in Wisconsin this week, he scores a huge upset in New York two weeks later and transforms the race.Yet Mr. Sanders, who for the left wing was a consolation choice after Senator Elizabeth Warren wouldn\u2019t run, has a message that will continue to resonate, especially among the multitudes of young supporters.The clarity and coherence of the campaign have surprised even those who sharply disagree with him.\u201cBernie has run a much better campaign than I ever thought he would,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Senate Republican leader and Mississippi conservative.Mr. Sanders is setting much of the Democratic agenda, forcing Mrs. Clinton to move left by opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone pipeline and by frequently assailing Wall Street. Even Republicans have picked up some of his populist rhetoric.If, as the odds-makers now predict, Mrs. Clinton wins the nomination and the presidency, Mr. Sanders, with two years left in his Senate term, will be looking over her left shoulder.If Democrats, including the next president or the next Democratic Senate leader (likely Chuck Schumer of New York), cozy up to Wall Street, expect a Sanders-Warren barrage. The so-called bank bailout in 2008 probably prevented the economy from going over the cliff. But Mr. Sanders has reinforced a public sense that bankers are making out like bandits while Main Street struggles.One virtual certainty: The next Treasury secretary won\u2019t come from Wall Street.Mr. Sanders also has galvanized public outrage over Supreme Court decisions that unleashed a flood of big money into politics. Most Americans agree with him that the United States system of money in politics is corrupt. Both President Bill Clinton and President Obama gave lip service to campaign-finance reform and then put it on the back burner. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign ensures that another President Clinton won\u2019t have that luxury.Some of his notions, including higher taxes on the wealthy and a completely government-run health care system, are nonstarters. But the public has moved closer to his view on economic fairness, and his call for free public higher education is a debate that will endure.Mr. Sanders has attracted extraordinary support from young voters, beating Mrs. Clinton by huge margins. These Americans have grown up in tough times, with more limited opportunities. They\u2019re skeptical about the establishment, and the socialist label doesn\u2019t have the negative connotation it does for many older Americans.The question is whether Mr. Sanders will keep these young people politically energized. The last such cause-centric candidate was Eugene McCarthy in 1968, though he basically checked out of Democratic politics after he lost the presidential nomination.Katy Harriger, a political scientist at Wake Forest University who has studied the youth vote, thinks that Mr. Sanders has the capacity to keep them mobilized on issues like campaign financing and economic inequality. That engagement could carry to the off-year elections, when the participation of young voters traditionally drops off. \u201cHe has tapped into something very real and has credibility with a lot of these young voters,\u201d Ms. Harriger said.Unlike McCarthy, whose views evolved over time, Mr. Sanders has been consistently to the left for almost a half-century. Although he started in dingy basements and sparsely attended rallies for lost causes, he now has a national megaphone that he\u2019s not likely to relinquish. He also will have more than two million contributors, mostly small donors, and almost four million \u201clikes\u201d on his Facebook page. In today\u2019s politics, that\u2019s a machine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lost in Nicaragua, a Chinese Tycoon\u2019s Canal Project", "Date": "2016-04-03", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosBut when a Chinese billionaire, Wang Jing, officially broke ground in a field outside this sleepy Pacific Coast village about a year ago, many Nicaraguans believed that this time, finally, they would get their canal.Yet 16 months later, Mr. Wang\u2019s project \u2014 it would be the largest movement of earth in the planet\u2019s history \u2014 is shrouded in mystery and producing angry protests here. President Daniel Ortega has not talked about the canal in public for months. And there are no visible signs of progress. Cows graze in the field where Mr. Wang officially began the project.Experts say they are baffled by Mr. Wang\u2019s canal. It may be backed by the Chinese government, part of its growing interest in Latin America, or may simply be a private investment cast adrift by the convulsions of China\u2019s stock markets and its slowing economy.Others, however, say Chinese business practices are so opaque that it is hard to tell. Facilitating the movement of goods from the Pacific to the Atlantic aligns with Chinese interests, and the cost of the project is hardly an obstacle if the Chinese government wants to go forward \u2014 if it is involved.Officials of Mr. Wang\u2019s company say they are simply taking more time to do preconstruction studies.What does seem clear is that the project\u2019s critics \u2014 environmentalists, human rights advocates and economists \u2014 have grown more outspoken and organized. In this part of the country, many homeowners have stenciled \u201cGo Away Chinese\u201d on the sides of their houses, and virtually all the re-election posters for Mr. Ortega have been hit with black paint balls.When he announced the deal in 2013, Mr. Ortega, a left-wing guerrilla turned pro-business politician, promised that the canal would transform Nicaragua and create hundreds of thousands of jobs, eventually doubling the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Many Nicaraguans, eager for a better future, embraced the idea, and many still do.But a growing number say the benefits of the deal are not so clear.Some question whether the canal would even be commercially viable. Few supertankers and massive container ships now afloat will not be able to pass through the expanded Panama Canal set to open soon. And few ports are big enough to welcome those megaships. In the short term, some experts say, the combination of the Panama and Nicaragua canals would lead to overcapacity and price wars.There are also concerns about the seismic activity in the area, or the many volcanos. Some analysts point to China\u2019s poor record on environmental matters and Mr. Wang\u2019s inexperience in building anything, let alone a $50 billion (some say $80 billion) canal carving through miles of protected areas that are home to many endangered species, including the jaguar, and legally recognized indigenous lands. The little-known Mr. Wang made his fortune in telecommunications, not in construction.And then there is the 50-mile trench to be dug on the floor of Lake Nicaragua, the largest body of fresh water in Central America \u2014 which many fear could end up contaminating, even killing, the lake.Economists and human rights activists also object to the powers Mr. Wang has to expropriate land at far less than market rates, saying the terms of Mr. Wang\u2019s concession could discourage anyone else from investing in Nicaragua.That aspect has prompted protests from farmers, some of which have turned violent. Experts say Mr. Wang will have to pay only the assessed value, or about 5 percent of the market value, for any lands he takes. But many farmers would not be entitled to even that. In a country that is short of adequate roads and government offices, many do not have formal title to the fields they have cultivated for generations.\u201cIn theory, if Mr. Wang wanted to take this building we are sitting in right now for his project, he could,\u201d Mr. Chamorro said, his hand sweeping across his office in downtown Managua, the capital. \u201cWho would want to buy or build here with that possibility hanging over their heads?\u201dMr. Chamorro said that the majority of the construction jobs would not go to Nicaraguans and that Panama did not become prosperous until it won control of its canal. That is unlikely to happen here for 100 years, according to the agreement with Mr. Wang, which he can sell to a third party.Under the current plan, the canal would begin along a stretch of pristine beach in Brito, then cut through Lake Nicaragua, which, with two volcanoes rising out of it, is one of the country\u2019s major tourist destinations. It would reach the Caribbean coast by cutting through the land of the Rama and Kriol people, in areas that are not accessible by road right now.But the plan is much broader than just a canal. Mr. Wang\u2019s vision includes new airports, new ports on both ends of the canal, new lakes in the mountains to make sure the canal has enough water, and new islands in Lake Nicaragua to dispose of excavated sediment and rock.A 1,100-page study of the project, conducted by the British consulting firm ERM and issued five months ago, reinforced the notion of how much is at stake. It recommended further studies in many areas before going forward and noted that a wide range of mitigation efforts would be needed, like reforestation and job training.Some see hope in those efforts. Jeffrey McCrary, an American fish biologist who lives in Nicaragua and worked on the study, supports the project, saying Mr. Wang\u2019s company will have to provide money to clean up environmental damage already caused by deforestation, poor land management, crop fumigation and general dumping into Lake Nicaragua.\u201cI\u2019ve seen that lake, and it is in miserable shape,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we going to kill a lot of fish to build the canal? Yeah, we are. But without the canal, I think we are doomed.\u201dKamilo Lara, a member of the Nicaragua Canal Commission, a group appointed by the government to oversee the project, said many critics of the project were political opportunists. Mr. Lara said the canal plan had been adjusted to deal with problem issues, like potential earthquakes, tsunamis and environmental concerns. And people who might be displaced by it, he said, could be moved to small cities with new schools and services they never had before.\u201cI have been to China,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the incredible capital they have to invest.\u201dMr. Pang also said the company, though not obligated to do so, would pay market rates for the land it wanted. \u201cWe are in Nicaragua to bring progress and play a fair game,\u201d he said.In the meantime, speculating about the canal has become a national pastime, though polls show that Nicaraguans grow less inclined to believe that it will be built.Some still hope it will lift this country out of poverty.But in Brito and the nearby city of Rivas, those who expect to be displaced are angry. Teresa de Jesus Henriquez Delgado, 31, is one of the residents who used a stencil to paint \u201cGo Away Chinese!\u201d on the outside of her house.\u201cI will resist with all of my strength when the bulldozers come to tear down my house,\u201d she said. \u201cI will fight until I die.

{"Headline": "The Mirage of a Return to Manufacturing Greatness", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneHalf a century ago, harvesting California\u2019s 2.2 million tons of tomatoes for ketchup required as many as 45,000 workers. In the 1960s, though, scientists and engineers at the University of California, Davis, developed an oblong tomato that lent itself to being machine-picked and an efficient mechanical harvester to do the job in one pass through a field.The battle to save jobs was on.How could a publicly funded university invest in research that cut farmworker jobs only to help large-scale growers? That was the question raised in a lawsuit filed by a farmworker advocacy group against U.C. Davis in 1979.C\u00e9sar Chavez\u2019s United Farm Workers union made stopping mechanization its No. 1 legislative priority. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s agriculture secretary, Robert Bergland, declared that the federal government would no longer finance research that could lead to the \u201creplacing of an adequate and willing work force with machines.\u201dThese days, the battle to save American jobs has a different flavor. It echoes in Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise \u201cto win the global competition for manufacturing jobs and production.\u201d It lives in Donald Trump\u2019s call to break Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against Chinese imports, and in Bernie Sanders\u2019s rallying cry against trade agreements.\u201cThe observation is uncontroversial,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist at Columbia University. \u201cGlobal employment in manufacturing is going down because productivity increases are exceeding increases in demand for manufactured products by a significant amount.\u201dThe consequences of this dynamic are often misunderstood, not least by politicians offering slogans to fix them.No matter how high the tariffs Mr. Trump wants to raise to encircle the American economy, he will not be able to produce a manufacturing renaissance at home. Neither would changing tax rules to limit corporate flight from the United States, as Mrs. Clinton proposes.\u201cThe likelihood that we will get a manufacturing recovery is close to nil,\u201d Professor Stiglitz said. \u201cWe are more likely to have a smaller share of a shrinking pie.\u201dThe shrinking of manufacturing employment is global. In other words, strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country will amount to destroying them in another, in a worldwide zero-sum game.The loss of such jobs has created plenty of problems in the United States. For the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world, though, it adds up to a potential disaster.Japan\u2019s long stagnation can be read as a consequence of a decades-long development strategy that left the nation overly dependent on manufacturing. \u201cThey are focused on a dead-end business,\u201d said Bruce Greenwald, an expert on investment strategy at Columbia Business School. \u201cThey are not eliminating hours of work in manufacturing fast enough to keep pace with the reduction in work needed.\u201dThe richest countries today started deindustrializing when they were already well off and benefited from fairly skilled and productive work forces that could make the transition into well-paid service jobs, as increasingly affluent consumers devoted less of their incomes to physical goods and more to leisure, advanced health care and other services.Poorer countries have more limited options. If the demise of manufacturing jobs in the United States forced many workers into low-paid retail jobs and the like, imagine the challenge in a country like India, where factory employment has already topped out, yet income per person is only one twenty-fifth of what it was in the United States at its peak.\u201cDeveloping countries are suffering premature deindustrialization,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, a leading expert on the international economy who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. \u201cBoth employment and output deindustrialization is setting in at much lower levels of income.\u201dThis is even happening in a manufacturing behemoth like China \u2014 which appears to have maxed out the industrial export strategy at a much lower income level than its successful Asian predecessors, like Japan and Taiwan.Manufacturing, Professor Rodrik points out, has unique advantages. For one thing, it can quickly employ lots of unskilled workers. \u201cSetting up a factory to make toys puts you on a productivity escalator in a way that traditional agriculture and services didn\u2019t do,\u201d he said.Moreover, production isn\u2019t constrained by a small domestic market: Exports of goods can easily flow around the world, allowing industry room to grow and giving developing countries time to ride up the ladder of income, skills and sophistication.The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries don\u2019t have these features. They employ few workers and offer little added value. They do not encourage acquiring skills, and they expose countries to violent swings in commodity prices.High-end services such as finance and programming do pay well. But these aren\u2019t the service sectors most poor countries build. A majority of service jobs in most poor countries are generally limited to housework, mom and pop retail and the like. Since these sectors offer little productivity growth and are generally isolated from foreign competition, they cannot pull a nation out of poverty.The first large transition from agriculture to industry in the early 20th century \u2014 well lubricated by public spending on world wars \u2014 liberated workers from their chains far more effectively than Karl Marx\u2019s revolution ever did.The current transition, from manufacturing to services, is more problematic. In poor countries, Mr. Rodrik says, workers may have to pare back their aspirations of development. Who knows \u201chow will political systems manage?\u201d he asks.Note to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump: A grab at the world\u2019s manufacturing jobs is the wrong answer. Walls will damage prosperity, not enhance it. Promises to recapture industrial-era greatness ring hollow.The United States, though, does have options: health care, education and clean energy, just to name a few. They present big economic and political challenges, of course \u2014 not least the enormous inefficiency of private American medicine and Republicans\u2019 blanket opposition to more public spending.Yet just as the federal government once provided a critical push to move the economy from its agricultural past into its industrial future, so, too, could it help build a postindustrial tomorrow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lifting the Patent Barrier to New Drugs and Energy Sources", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe lack of interest of the pharmaceutical industry, which generates huge profits protected by a web of patents enforced around the world, raises an important question.Do we need a different way to spur innovation and disseminate new technologies quickly around the world? Are patents, which reward inventors by providing them with a government-guaranteed monopoly over their inventions for many years, the best way to encourage new inventions?The question applies to more than how we develop lifesaving drugs. It has acquired new urgency as the world rushes to discover and spread new technologies to replace fossil fuels as sources of energy and stave off impending climate change.The argument is now being echoed in the climate debate.A group of countries led by India argued for transferring intellectual property rights for clean energy technologies to developing nations to accelerate their diffusion. Professor Stavins offers a counterargument: \u201cIn the long term, if there are no property rights, it will destroy the incentive to develop the next generation of technologies.\u201dThe battle against climate change is young. There is little empirical evidence of the effects of patents on clean energy technology. But the evidence from other industries in which intellectual property protections have been ratcheted up in the name of innovation offers a decidedly mixed picture.Take the World Trade Organization\u2019s 22-year-old Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, known as Trips, the world\u2019s first enforceable deal to protect patents globally. Developing countries were told it would promote their access to innovation. Multinationals would be more likely to sell or license new technologies if they knew their ideas would not be pirated. The deal would encourage foreign investment in local research and development.Tight intellectual property protection can backfire, stopping locals from piggybacking on foreign inventions, discouraging indigenous innovation in less-developed countries.\u201cI do not think we need stronger patents than we have now,\u201d said Bronwyn H. Hall, an expert on intellectual property at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere is a large body of evidence that suggests patents are not viewed by firms as key to securing returns to innovation, except in the pharma sector and a subset of firms in other sectors.\u201dThe answer to the conundrum about new innovation and diffusion of existing technology might hinge on what is more important \u2014 spreading existing clean energy systems in the developing world, where energy use is rising sharply, or inventing new ones.It depends, unsurprisingly, on where you sit. \u201cYou do want a pipeline of new technologies,\u201d said Ambuj D. Sagar, professor of policy studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. \u201cBut diffusion is the more substantial point, given the time scale in which we need to make substantial progress.\u201dAdam Jaffe, a lead author on the third and fifth assessment reports of the climate change panel who now directs the research foundation Motu Economic and Public Policy Research in Wellington, New Zealand, disagrees. Technology diffusion, he says, is not yet a problem: \u201cToday the problem is inventing the thing.\u201dTo be sure, energy systems are not the same as drugs, which are hard to invent but cheap to make. The most popular technologies being deployed around the world \u2014 like solar panels made in China \u2014 are hardly cutting edge. Finance and know-how are bigger obstacles to the spread of clean energy systems in poor countries than intellectual property rights.Nonetheless, patents are probably here to stay. Still, rich countries will end up one way or another paying to spread clean energy technology among the world\u2019s poor. Why not create a government-supported global fund to buy intellectual property on behalf of poorer nations? Another idea: Finance prizes to encourage innovation to solve poor people\u2019s problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba Eases Decades-long Restriction on Sea Travel", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byCuba risked losing millions of dollars in the next year if the cruise line had been forced to cancel its trips on the Adonia, a 704-passenger luxury ship, according to an analysis by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. The directive, which will take effect on Tuesday, also marked a rare turn of events: an American corporation persuading the Castro government to alter a policy.Last month, Carnival became the first American cruise company to obtain Cuban approval to sail to the island. European and Canadian cruise lines have already been making the trip.\u201cWe made history in March, and we are a part of making history again today,\u201d said Arnold Donald, the president and chief executive of the Carnival Corporation, adding, \u201cWe were very positive there would be this outcome and were proceeding in that fashion.\u201dMr. Donald said the company\u2019s negotiators underscored to Cuban officials that Cuban passengers have long been permitted to fly in and out of Cuba and that the same policy should apply to sea travel. Cruises are crucial to Cuba\u2019s tourism sector because they allow for more visitors without pressuring the country\u2019s already strained hotel capacity.Starting on Tuesday, the government will also allow Cubans aboard commercial vessels, including cargo ships, to enter or leave Cuba.The mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos A. Gimenez, who at one point explored options for a lawsuit against Carnival, praised the resolution.\u201cThis policy change was the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Gimenez, who is Cuban-born, said in a statement.The Cuban government on Friday also hinted at its next move: the possibility of allowing Cuban-born people to travel to the island aboard recreational boats. That authorization, the government said, would come gradually and when circumstances are right.Cuban-Americans in Miami who support engagement with Cuba have long envisioned the possibility of taking their own boats to the island, which is 90 miles away from Florida, to visit family.Friday\u2019s decision is significant because the Cuban government has long been wary of sea travel between the United States and Cuba. For decades, Cubans have fled the island by raft and rustic boats, something that continues today. The government also feared that allowing Cuban citizens to travel by sea would make it easier for hostile Cuban-Americans to enter the country and to undermine the government.The Cuban government stressed that all passengers and crew members entering or leaving Cuba must have valid documents to do so. It also needled the United States, pointing out that American law continues to restrict American tourist travel to Cuba, although regulations have been eased.The uproar, which Carnival did not anticipate, began this month when Cubans in Florida tried to buy tickets for the weeklong voyage. Carnival agents refused to book them on the cruise, saying that because they were Cuban-born, the Cuban government barred them from entering the country by sea.\u201cCarnival acted responsibly within the context of a horrific public relations environment,\u201d said John Kavulich, the president of the trade council.Pedro A. Freyre, whose law firm, Akerman, represents Carnival, and who was one of several lawyers to advise the company, said Carnival began working on getting the directive changed soon after its cruise was approved by the Cuban government.Mr. Freyre, who is Cuban-born and supports closer ties to the island nation, said even he was surprised by the fervor in Miami over the cruise.\u201cI had been around my community long enough to know that emotions are very deep here,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the beginning, I said, \u2018What? Why are people so upset \u2014 300,000 travel every year to Cuba.\u2019 But this one tugged at the heart strings.\u201dDr. Andy Gomez, a senior policy adviser for Poblete Tamargo, a law and public policy firm, said the face-off served as a reminder that Cuba\u2019s thicket of laws and regulations remained far from business friendly.But Mr. Freyre said the episode also shows that a more measured approach to Cuba works best.\u201cWhat the Cubans did today is reflect that it\u2019s good to be engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can talk calmly about things instead of shouting at each other.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carbon Pricing Becomes a Cause for the World Bank and I.M.F.", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pressing governments to impose a price tag on planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions, using economic leverage and technical assistance that institutions like the United Nations cannot muster.The campaign by two of the largest international lenders comes as world leaders have begun to sign the Paris agreement on climate change, the United Nations accord that is supposed to commit nearly every country to take action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The document opened for signatures on Friday and will remain open for a year.But the leaders of the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other major global institutions say cutting emissions enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change will not be possible unless all fossil fuel polluters are forced to pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.\u201cThere is now an overwhelmingly obvious scientific consensus that the more carbon pollution we put into the air the more impact it has on warming the massive melting of the Arctic, the cycles of droughts and flooding, the die-offs of coral reefs,\u201d the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said in an interview. \u201cAnd to our economists, who have been studying this for quite some time, there is an equally obvious consensus that putting a price on carbon pollution is by far the most powerful and efficient way to reduce emissions.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe strongly urge people to prepare for the carbon pricing that is to come.\u201dTo press that case, the bank has created a Carbon Finance Unit to give financial and technical assistance to countries that are creating a system to put a price on carbon. This is usually set up as a tax on fossil fuels like coal and oil or as a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system that sets limits on overall carbon emissions, then allows companies to buy and sell emission allotments sold by the government.The bank is already working with 18 countries with emerging economies, including China, which has received an $8 million grant to develop what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest cap-and-trade program. South Africa and Chile have received similar grants, and World Bank officials are meeting with the governments of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Panama to help them create carbon pricing systems.Under the Paris agreement, all countries submitted plans to reduce their carbon emissions, and they are required to update and strengthen those plans over the coming years. Already, about 90 countries have included some form of carbon pricing in their plans. The World Bank has reviewed those United Nations plans, hoping eventually to link the systems into a global carbon trading market.\u201cWe\u2019ve now got carbon pricing on the radar screen in a way it hasn\u2019t been before,\u201d said John Roome, the senior director for climate change programs at the World Bank Group. \u201cWe\u2019re moving from why to how.\u201dThe I.M.F., often seen as the world\u2019s lender of last resort, is also consulting and advising countries on how best to introduce carbon pricing, in part as a way for struggling nations to raise more revenue.\u201cWe can\u2019t make a loan conditional on carbon pricing, but for a country facing a large deficit, we could recommend that they use carbon pricing as a way to simultaneously meet their pledges in Paris and close their deficit,\u201d said Ian Parry, principal environmental fiscal policy expert at the I.M.F.Any policy that drives up the cost of fossil fuels can be expected to generate intense opposition. In the United States, voters \u2014 especially in the depleted middle class \u2014 are leery of the economic pain, and political groups funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch stand in the way.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to watch unelected bureaucrats like the World Bank and other institutions try to leverage their power to force elected leaders to take actions that harm their citizens,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed advocacy group.The point of a carbon price is to make fossil fuels more expensive, charging for the toll they take on the environment and guiding markets toward cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar.About 40 countries, including the 28 members of the European Union, along with 23 cities, states and regions around the world, have introduced carbon pricing policies. They cover about 12 percent of the world\u2019s carbon pollution.\u201cOur government has heard loud and clear that Canadians care about standing up for our environment and our livelihoods,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said.Four of Canada\u2019s 13 provinces and territories already have some form of carbon pricing, and Mr. Trudeau hopes to enact a national plan.Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., called carbon pricing the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of efforts to mitigate climate change.Absent from the statement was President Obama, whose own cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate early in his first administration, when the Democrats controlled the chamber. The bill had passed the House, but many of its Democratic supporters were voted out of office in the Republican avalanche of 2010.Among the 2016 presidential candidates, only Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has publicly embraced carbon pricing, calling for a national tax. Hillary Clinton backs the Paris agreement and has pledged to strengthen Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies, but she has stopped short of calling for a carbon price. Both Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who question the established science of human-caused climate change, have vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord.Still, carbon pricing is expanding at the state level. California and nine Northeast states have introduced cap-and-trade systems. The Oregon Legislature is considering its own trading regime, and a ballot initiative to create a carbon tax is expected to be on the Washington State ballot in November.\u201cWe started the momentum on carbon pricing, and we hope to see it spread across the global economy,\u201d said S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the French ecology minister, who helped negotiate the Paris agreement.Mr. Kim, the World Bank president, acknowledged that carbon pricing would come with burdens including higher energy costs.\u201cThese policy reforms may be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is difficult, politically. But we are an organization that is completely committed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Woes in Europe Are Likely to Grow", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byGoogle\u2019s antitrust problems in Europe are about to get a whole lot bigger.The company is expected to be charged with breaking the European Union\u2019s competition rules by unfairly favoring Google services, like its search engine and Google Maps, on its Android smartphone operating system over those of rivals, according to three people. The three, who work in either government or the private sector, spoke on the condition of anonymity.The charges, known formally as a statement of objections, may be announced in Brussels as soon as Wednesday, though the announcement could still be postponed until later this month, according to one of the people.The expected charges against Google are the latest in a raft of regulatory problems that American tech giants have faced as the European Union has cracked down on these companies\u2019 perceived dominance over how people in the 28-member bloc get access to digital services.Google denies that it has breached the region\u2019s tough competition laws, and it will have several months to respond to the charges from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.\u201cAnyone can use Android with or without Google applications,\u201d Mark Jansen, a Google spokesman, said in a statement when asked about the company\u2019s mobile software. \u201cHardware manufacturers and carriers can decide how to use Android, and consumers have the last word about which apps they want to use on their devices.\u201dA spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment.Despite the company\u2019s denials, the expected charges linked to Android, which powers 77 percent of European smartphones, would represent a major setback for the Silicon Valley company as it grapples with a growing number of global competition investigations into Google\u2019s vast operations.Canadian authorities, though, said on Tuesday that they had closed their investigation into claims that Google had misused its dominant position in online search. They added they would continue monitoring the company\u2019s activities.Apple continues to generate the largest share of revenue from global smartphone sales. The company also bundles its own services, including digital maps, into its mobile software, but has yet to face similar questions over whether it has broken Europe\u2019s antitrust rules.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.If European officials demand that the company provide rivals greater access to the Android universe \u2014 a possibility if Google is found to have broken the region\u2019s laws \u2014 the search giant may find it more difficult to promote its own mobile services to users worldwide as well as to smartphone makers.As part of the charges to be announced as soon as Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, is expected to focus on Google\u2019s deals with cellphone manufacturers that include bundles of Google services included in Android.Speaking in Amsterdam on Monday, Ms. Vestager said that these deals may have hindered competition by forcing cellphone manufacturers to rely on Google\u2019s mobile services that come preinstalled on certain versions of the Android software.\u201cOur concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to preload a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers,\u201d Ms. Vestager said ahead of the charges being announced.The case related to Google\u2019s Android operating system has been long expected.These companies say that they have been financially hurt by Google practices that they call unfair, an accusation the company rejects.\u201cConsumers deserve more choice and innovation in mobile devices and applications,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch. \u201cA statement of objections in the Android case would be an important step forward for competition and consumers.\u201dGoogle says that its partnerships with cellphone makers that rely on its operating system are voluntary, and that these relationships offer benefits to consumers as well as manufacturers.In February, Mr. Pichai traveled to Brussels to meet with Ms. Vestager and other European politicians, including G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German politician in charge of the digital economy in the bloc. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, has also been a regular visitor to Europe, meeting often with regional officials, in part to discuss the company\u2019s continuing antitrust problems.Now, Google faces mounting pressure over accusations it abused its position in everything from online search to its Android operating system. And it is the turn of Mr. Pichai, along with other Google executives, to respond.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. She is Margrethe Vestager, not Margrethre.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Listen Carefully for Hints of the Next Global Recession", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewEconomists are good at measuring the past but inconsistent at forecasting future events, particularly recessions. That\u2019s because recessions aren\u2019t caused merely by concrete changes in the markets. Beliefs and stories passed on by thousands of individuals are important factors, maybe even the main ones, in determining big shifts in the economy.It is therefore worth asking what actually sets off a real global recession. Most discussions focus on leading indicators \u2014 statistics about economic variables that have preceded recessions. While these kinds of correlations can sometimes be useful in forecasting, they provide little understanding of why major changes are taking place. Leading indicators don\u2019t usually address ultimate causes, nor do econometric models that try to predict events.Economists were alarmed by the crash, she found, and their warnings helped make consumers wary. But let\u2019s not overestimate the importance of these economic forecasts: Most people never actually read them. They received their information from other channels.Back then, immediately after the market crash, church sermons were a powerful influence. Congregations were told that many businesspeople had behaved like gamblers and hucksters. Through these sermons and other word-of-mouth sources, moralizing about the stock market crash spread, affecting mass psychology. Frederick Lewis Allen, in the epilogue to his 1931 best seller \u201cOnly Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s,\u201d wrote that cultural values changed after the crash: People began to dress more modestly, adopting a new formality and religiosity, reviving Victorian sexual taboos. It is reasonable to assume that many of these changes had an economic impact, mainly by discouraging spending.Let\u2019s jump to the most recent global recession, the one of 2009. Oil prices, subprime mortgages and the freezing up of the financial system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers were all important factors. But why did we have a global recession? The transformation of distinct events into a broad global slowdown occurred through a variety of mechanisms. Reports about financial misdoings, the possible collapse of venerable institutions, rising unemployment caused by advanced technology \u2014 all of these affected the psychology of spending.We don\u2019t know whether any specific event \u2014 say, an unexpected spike in oil prices or a decline in the stock market \u2014 will help transform any of the current social stories into a truly virulent economic disruption. We don\u2019t know what is coming or when. But history does tell us that human imagination can spontaneously transform discrete events into world-shaking narratives of unexpected color and force.ROBERT J.

Mr. Obama is not getting the recognition historically accorded a president who presides over economic revival, but then again, neither are divided Republicans seen as offering a positive alternative.\u201cWhether he gets the credit or not, people\u2019s home equity has gone back up, fuel prices are the best we\u2019ve had in a long time, there\u2019s a lot of things that make this all go,\u201d Larry Thompson, a former longtime mayor of nearby Nappanee and a Republican, said as he showed off an expanding cabinetry factory, Kountry Wood Products.\u201cBut I think that maybe it\u2019s just some of the other things he\u2019s been involved with that people in our area\u201d \u2014 Mr. Thompson stopped, shaking his head in unspoken reference to various social issues.For Mr. Obama, pondering his legacy and hearing how it is debated in the contest for his successor, the dearth of credit is plainly vexing. \u201cWe avoided a Great Depression,\u201d he interjected during an onstage interview last month in Austin, Tex., adding sardonically, \u201cThanks, Obama.\u201dFew people here are thanking him for their recovery, despite benefits from the administration\u2019s $800 billion stimulus package \u2014 Mr. Obama came here in August 2009 to personally announce one grant \u2014 and from the rescues of the auto and financial industries.\u201cHe gets very, very little credit, and I think that\u2019s too bad because we got quite a bit of help,\u201d said Dick Moore, Elkhart\u2019s mayor the past eight years, a Democrat who lost election to a third term in November. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we would have done without it.\u201dInstead, it is Mr. Trump who is making the impression. The New York billionaire routinely attacks Carrier Corporation since it announced in February that it would close two Indiana factories and shift about 2,000 heating and air-conditioning jobs to Mexico. Recently a high school basketball game west of here drew national attention after students hoisted Trump signs and taunted \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d at fans from the rival, heavily Latino school.Many workers remain discouraged. Around Elkhart, \u201cPeople still don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re doing well,\u201d said Mike Perez, a director at Faith Mission, which provides meals for the poor and shelter for about 150 who are homeless. Many earn less than before the recession, he said. \u201cThere still isn\u2019t a sense that everything\u2019s O.K.\u201dIn 2008 Mr. Obama won Indiana, the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so since 1964. In 2012 he did not even contest the state. Among those who opposed him was Mr. Neufeldt. Now 69, he holds four part-time jobs, but boasts that a daughter and three sons-in-law again have good jobs in Elkhart\u2019s boom-and-bust recreational vehicle industry where he worked 32 years. His problem with the president is over abortion.Brian A. Howey, publisher of the Howey Politics Indiana newsletter and once a reporter in Elkhart, sounded stumped, even allowing for the state\u2019s conservatism: \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Hoosier. I\u2019m just amazed that not only do people not appreciate what happened in \u201909, but there\u2019s a lot of hostility toward Obama. I think part of it is racial and a lot of it is political.\u201d\u201cThis state stood to lose 150,000 auto jobs if Chrysler and G.M. had liquidated,\u201d Mr. Howey added. \u201cWe would have had a bona fide depression here.\u201dSenator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat who represented this area in the House until his election to the Senate in 2012, likewise praised the administration\u2019s auto and financial rescues for averting disaster. \u201cPresident Obama had about half the people on his own team telling him to let Chrysler go,\u201d he recalled.Now, Mr. Donnelly noted, Chrysler plants employ more than 5,000 people to the south in Kokomo, up from 100 at their nadir, and 7,000 statewide. Yet autoworkers are more apt to complain about the president\u2019s gun proposals than to acknowledge the auto turnaround.While Indiana\u2019s presidential primaries are relatively late in the race \u2014 May 3 \u2014 and polls are lacking, Mr. Howey predicted that Mr. Trump would do well.Nearly half of Elkhart County\u2019s jobs are in manufacturing, a higher proportion than in all but 13 of the 3,140 counties nationwide, according to Jerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana University. With so many skilled factory workers, he said, local wages are above national averages though education levels are relatively modest.For 2014, economic growth was up 48 percent from 2001, double the nation\u2019s growth rate. Yet the area\u2019s reliance on a narrow range of manufacturing, mostly R.V.-related, makes it \u201cquite vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Conover said. Locals\u2019 awareness of that possibility explains some of their economic insecurity.Mr. Obama sought to help the county diversify, with $39 million from the stimulus money to develop electric trucks at a former R.V. factory. But the effort fizzled, the owners sold the plant and now it is back to making R.V.s exclusively. (Mr. Neufeldt, still a believer in Mr. Obama\u2019s push for green jobs, again wears green wristbands to signify that cause.)Additional stimulus money went to improve the municipal airport and local highways, buy law enforcement equipment, remove lead and weatherize buildings \u2014 purposes that did not create many jobs but helped avoid layoffs, said Kyle Hannon, the president of the Greater Elkhart Chamber of Commerce.\u201cWe knew we would be back,\u201d Mr. Hannon said, reflecting locals\u2019 sense of their resilience and self-sufficiency, regardless of government\u2019s hand.Now, with unemployment so low, local leaders say the challenge is finding workers who can pass employers\u2019 drug tests.\u201cEverybody is back to work,\u201d Mr. Neufeldt said recently, driving past once-closed plants lining county roads, their lots full of employees\u2019 vehicles and, in many, newly manufactured R.V.s.Mark Dobson, the president of the Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County, said his group was using social media to advertise widely that Elkhart offers \u201chead-of-household opportunities\u201d \u2014 industrial jobs that pay perhaps $75,000, enough for a single wage earner to sustain a family.\u201cAnytime we see a mention of a plant closure and some significant number of people who have been laid off\u201d \u2014 like from Carrier \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re making sure they know there are jobs in Elkhart County,\u201d Mr. Dobson said.Busy employers also are turning to Faith Mission, the homeless shelter. Dan Browning, its programming director, said he gets dozens of calls monthly \u2014 the previous day a boat maker sought 75 workers \u2014 and no longer deals with companies that will not pay more than minimum wage.\u201cNow the employers are desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore it was the workers who were desperate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described it as a \u201chammer blow against those who hide their illegal tax evasion in the dark corners of the financial system.\u201dThe announcement by the five countries was welcomed by the International Monetary Fund and by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The United States is not part of the information-sharing plan. But a letter, released by the finance ministers of the five countries, called on all members of the Group of 20 to create a global information exchange that would \u201clift the veil of secrecy\u201d that facilitates tax evasion.In the early stages, the five European nations will conduct a pilot project under which they will automatically exchange information on the ultimate ownership of companies.\u201cIt shows the benefit of working together,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in a statement. \u201cNo single country can tackle international tax evasion alone \u2014 and Britain should never fool itself into thinking that it can do this by itself.\u201dCritics say that Britain has done too little to clamp down on tax evasion. Richard Murphy, a leading campaigner for more transparency, welcomed the fact that Germany had joined the new agreement but said that Britain was \u201cnot collecting this information from its own tax havens, and I don\u2019t believe it is going to.\u201d\u201cUntil we get our house in order this is a hollow promise,\u201d Mr. Murphy told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a good first step,\u201d Meg Hillier, who leads the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, told the BBC. \u201cOne hammer blow doesn\u2019t crack a nut, but it\u2019s a great start.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "First-Quarter Growth Slows a Bit in China, as Expected", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s growth rate slowed as expected in the first three months of the year, but a notable pickup in debt-driven industrial activity last month probably cushioned the slowdown.Growth slowed to 6.7 percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, according to official data released on Friday morning in Beijing. That was the slowest quarterly rate since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, but it was also exactly what economists had forecast and it was in line with the government\u2019s target this year for growth of 6.5 to 7 percent.China is increasingly a two-speed economy. Traditional industries that had relied on a boom in housing construction, like steel, mining and manufacturing, are mired in a brutal downturn.That grim reality is countered by resilient growth in consumer demand, as China\u2019s dynamic service sector continues to account for a larger share of overall economic output and job creation. This is best reflected in the rise of e-commerce and innovative high-tech companies.China\u2019s industrial juggernaut, which has traditionally relied heavily on cheap and plentiful loans from the state-controlled financial system, also appears to have rebounded in recent months. New government stimulus measures, like recent interest rate cuts and increased fiscal spending, are taking hold.Industrial production in March climbed 6.8 percent from a year earlier, separate data released on Friday showed, significantly better than the 5.9 percent increase that economists were expecting. The rise appears to have been helped by a notable increase in new loans, which in March totaled 1.37 trillion renminbi, or about $210 billion, higher than forecasts of 1.1 trillion renminbi.\u201cData from the investment-industry nexus show that the tried and tested stimulus measures of recent months have stirred up the physical part of the economy,\u201d Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, wrote on Friday morning in a research note.Economists for years have regarded China\u2019s topline data on gross domestic product with suspicion. Although it accurately captures the trend of slowing growth, the official figures are uncannily stable when compared with those of most other countries. The G.D.P. data is also increasingly out of step with other indicators that suggest an even sharper growth slowdown, economists say.Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, says this divergence has risen since 2012; he estimates China\u2019s actual growth rate today is closer to 4.5 percent.\u201cEvidence that the official figures overstate growth just add to the general impression that something is badly wrong with China\u2019s economy,\u201d Mr. Williams said. He pointed out that 4.5 percent growth would still be a fairly impressive rate compared with most other large economies, but this gets overshadowed by questions over data accuracy.\u201cMost observers will remain skeptical about the official data, and I suspect this has a broader impact in undermining the credibility of policy,\u201d Mr. Williams added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Did the Government Jobs Go?", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "The Money IssueLong a ticket to the middle class, especially for African-Americans, they have become increasingly difficult to find.Supported byOn a muggy afternoon in April, Angelina Iles, 65, folded herself into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of her beloved Pineville, La., a sleepy town smack in the middle of the low, wet state. We drove past spaced-out, low-slung houses and boarded-up businesses \u2014 shuttered restaurants, a decrepit gas station \u2014 as Iles, an African-American retired lunchroom worker and community activist, guided me toward the muddy banks of the Red River. Near there stands the locked-up Art Deco shell of the Huey P. Long hospital, which once served the poorest of the poor in Rapides Parish \u2014 and employed more than 300 workers.When employers leave towns like Pineville, they often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments. But in the case of Huey P. Long, the employer was the government itself. Its demise began, arguably, in 2008, when Bobby Jindal was swept into the Louisiana governor\u2019s mansion on a small-government-and-ethics platform, promising to modernize the state and unleash the power of American private industry along the Gulf Coast. At the time, Louisiana was flush with federal funds for Hurricane Katrina reconstruction and running a budget surplus. Jindal and the State Legislature slashed income taxes and started privatizing and cutting. This was a source of great pride for Jindal. During his failed bid for the presidency last year, he boasted that bureaucrats are now an endangered species in Louisiana. \u201cI\u2019ve laid off more of them than Trump has fired people,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve cut my state\u2019s budget by more than he\u2019s worth.\u201dHe laid off more than just bureaucrats. Jindal cut appropriations for higher education, shifting the cost burden onto students themselves. (State spending per student was down more than 40 percent between 2008 and 2014; just one state, Arizona, cut more.) And he shuttered or privatized nine charity hospitals that served the state\u2019s uninsured and indigent. They were outdated and costly, Jindal argued, and private management would improve access, care and the bottom line. Huey P. Long was one of those hospitals.Iles, along with dozens of other workers and activists, helped organize a protest against the cuts, she told me. They held a vigil on the hospital\u2019s front lawn. Iles even helped produce an anti-Jindal documentary called \u201cBad Medicine\u201d that was broadcast on local television. But it was all for naught. \u201cThe good governor did not want to listen to us,\u201d Iles said, checking her constantly buzzing phone in the car. The hospital closed its doors in 2014, and its patients were redirected to other local medical centers and clinics. All of the hospital\u2019s workers lost their jobs.Driving around Pineville, Iles and I dropped in on a friend of hers from church, Theresa Jardoin, 68, who worked in the hospital for 41 years, most recently as an EKG supervisor. Out of work, she spends most of her days at home, taking care of her family. Earlier, Iles had introduced me to another friend, Linette Richard, whose story was similar. She had been working as an ultrasound technician when the hospital closed. She lost much of what she had been expecting for her retirement, because she had not been there long enough. \u201cNobody\u2019s jumping to hire a 58-year-old, especially in my field,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou can get a low-paying job, like McDonald\u2019s or Burger King. But higher up? We don\u2019t have positions available. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201dThat\u2019s the way it is across much of Louisiana. The state has added 80,000 new jobs since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. But at the same time, jobs have been shrinking at every level of government, with local offices losing 10,600 workers, the state government 31,900 and the federal government 1,600. Louisiana is an exaggerated case, but the pattern persists when you look at the country as a whole. Since the recession hit, private employers have added five million jobs and the government has lost 323,000. The country has recovered from the recession. But public employment has not.The public sector has long been home to the sorts of jobs that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. These are jobs that have predictable hours, stable pay and protection from arbitrary layoffs, particularly for those without college or graduate degrees. They\u2019re also more likely to be unionized; less than 7 percent of private-sector workers are represented by a union, while more than a third of those in the public sector are. In other words, they look like the blue-collar jobs our middle class was built on during the postwar years.The public sector\u2019s slow decimation is one of the unheralded reasons that the middle class has shrunk as the ranks of the poor and the rich have swollen in the post-recession years. This is certainly true in Louisiana, where five of the 10 biggest employers are public institutions, or health centers that in no small part rely on public funds. In Rapides Parish, which includes Pineville, the biggest employer is the school district.Across the country, when public-sector workers lose their jobs, the burden disproportionately falls on black workers, and particularly women \u2014 people like Theresa Jardoin and Linette Richard.\u201cWe felt middle class,\u201d Richard told me. \u201cNow we feel kind of lower.\u201dThrough the middle of the century, the wage gap between white and black workers narrowed as social forces and political pressure compelled private businesses to open up better jobs to black workers. \u201cPublic-sector work has been a backbone of the black middle class for many reasons,\u201d says Mary Pattillo, a sociologist at Northwestern who studies race and class. Affirmative action helped bring marginalized groups into the public work force; there, they benefited from more public scrutiny of employment practices. \u201cThe inability to fire people in a willy-nilly fashion has likely protected African-Americans, who are perhaps likely to be fired in a willy-nilly fashion,\u201d she says. As of 2007, black workers were 30 percent more likely than workers of other races to be employed in the public sector.For any number of reasons, the Great Recession unraveled much of the progress made by the black middle class. Leading up to the mortgage crisis, black families tended to have a higher proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes. And regardless of their income, black families were much more likely to be rejected for conventional mortgages and pushed into high-cost subprime loans. All of this meant that when housing prices turned down, the black-white wealth gap yawned. As of 2013, white households were, on average, 13 times wealthier than black households, the biggest gap since 1989, according to Pew Research Center data.Declining tax revenue led to tightened state budgets, which led to tens of thousands of layoffs for public-sector employees. And during the recovery, public workers became easy political targets precisely because of their labor protections. Collective-bargaining rights, pension funds and mandatory raises look like unnecessary drains on state coffers to a work force increasingly unfamiliar with such benefits. And when the layoffs came, black Americans experienced a disproportionate share of the ill effects. A graduate student of sociology at the University of Washington, Jennifer Laird, wrote a widely cited dissertation, examining the effects of public-sector layoffs on different races. She found that the government-worker unemployment rate climbed more for black men than for white men \u2014 and much more for black women than for white women, with the gap between the two groups soaring from less than a percentage point in 2008 to 5.5 percentage points in 2011. \u201cIt may be that black workers are more likely to be laid off when the layoffs are triggered by a sudden and significant reduction in funding,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen the number of layoff decisions increases, managers have more opportunities to discriminate.\u201d Worse, once unemployed, black women were \u201cthe least likely to find private-sector employment and the most likely to make a full exit from the labor force.\u201d As a result of all these economic punishments, a recession that set America back half a decade may have set black families back a whole generation, if not longer.And because the public sector provides so many essential services, cuts to it have a cascading effect. Hospitals close, and people have to drive farther away for medical care. Teachers\u2019 aides lose their positions, and local kids no longer have the same degree of special-education attention. Angelina Iles, the retiree I met in Pineville, cited the loss of dental, mental-health and emergency medical services as being a particularly profound problem for her community.Other states and towns are electing to have smaller public work forces. Wisconsin, for instance, has thinned its ranks of government workers by some 5,000 since its Republican governor, Scott Walker, led a push to abrogate public workers\u2019 organizing rights \u2014 a political choice with profound economic and racial ramifications. \u201cThey try to say that collective bargaining is a drain on the economy, when it provides the ability and opportunity for folks to have a seat at the table,\u201d Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told me. And the economic evidence does show that a higher concentration of unionized workers increases intergenerational mobility and raises wages for all workers, public and private.With time, government jobs should come back; that pathway to the middle class should grow again. \u201cGovernment jobs are always slower to come back after a recession,\u201d says Roderick Harrison, a former Howard University demographer. It takes time for private businesses to rehire workers. It takes time for tax revenue to rise to a level at which cities and states feel comfortable adding public workers back onto their payrolls. \u201cThat means that the portion of the black middle class that was dependent on government jobs \u2014 police, schools, emergency workers and so on \u2014 is going to take longer to recoup and regain whatever positions they had,\u201d he says.For Pineville, that recovery might come too late for many of its workers, especially those who were looking toward retirement. Because Linette Richard can\u2019t find suitable work, she and her husband get by on what he makes as a car salesman. She has given up trying to find work again around Pineville. So has Theresa Jardoin, who has resigned herself to a tougher retirement than she thought she would enjoy.\u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, sitting in an easy chair in her living room, just blocks from Huey P. Long, playing with her granddaughter\u2019s hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t enjoy retirement in this situation.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even get a pocket watch, did you?\u201d Iles asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Jardoin said, with a resigned laugh. \u201cJust aches and pains.\u201dAnnie Lowrey is a contributing editor at New York magazine and a former business reporter for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s Vulnerable Side Is at Fore in Call-In Show", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 A somewhat humbled, or at least not swaggering, President Vladimir V. Putin held his annual, live call-in show on Thursday, with his answers to the choreographed calls intended to underscore his concern for the plight of ordinary Russians amid a second, punishing year of recession.Largely gone were the diatribes against opponents like the United States and Turkey. In their place was praise for domestic cheesemongers and Russian fishermen, and approval of government efforts to keep prices down for everything.\u201cWe should not be thinking about how to cope with America, we should think about how to cope with our internal problems, our internal issues,\u201d Mr. Putin answered. \u201cRoads, problems with the public health service, the education system, the development of our economy, economic recovery, problems of setting the pace of growth.\u201dIf Russia addressed those problems, Mr. Putin said, the country would feel \u201cinvulnerable.\u201dBut Russians were clearly feeling vulnerable, as questions poured in about high prices, unpaid wages, rising utility bills, and the closing of schools and hospitals. In all, around three million questions were submitted by telephone and Internet, television executives said, of which Mr. Putin answered about 60.The first questions were posed by two studio anchors who pulled them from social media platforms, one about the steep rise in prices and the second asking when the economy would hit bottom.\u201cThe government\u2019s economic officials keep telling us that we have hit the bottom in the crisis and are now on the way up again,\u201d noted the caller. \u201cThey\u2019ve already said this seven times. Where is the Russian economy now as you see it?\u201dRussia has been operating at a deficit since 2012, and its Reserve Fund is slated to run out by 2017.Mr. Putin, who had previously predicted that economic growth would rebound by now, was more cautious this time, calling it a \u201cgray period.\u201d The president admitted that the economy had shrunk by 3.7 percent last year, but said he expected it would only contract by 0.3 percent in 2016 and register modest growth after that.He also said there was enough money in the two main sovereign wealth funds and other reserves to tide Russia over for the next four years.Mr. Putin spent time defending the higher prices caused by a ban on some food imports from Western nations in retaliation for their sanctions over Russian military actions in Ukraine. In the long run it would make Russia more secure by producing more of its own food, he said, adding that, \u201call in all, I fully understand, I\u2019m fully aware that that\u2019s a burden for people, for consumers.\u201dHe also said that the government would maintain a high level of orders to military factories even as the Kremlin has cut defense spending, a claim questioned by experts.There were complaints from members of the studio audience on perennial issues, like business inspections carried out by government agents that impeded entrepreneurial work. Mr. Putin said that the number of such inspections had been reduced by one-third.Inspectors also raided the corporate offices of Ikea, the Swedish retail giant, according to an announcement by the company\u2019s lawyer. Officials have long cast an envious eye on the booming trade that the chain maintains in Russia, and there is now a fight over the land on which one of its biggest stores in Moscow sits.Amid all the economic issues, there were some questions on foreign policy. Mr. Putin said that the Russian military had stabilized the situation in Syria and left enough forces behind to allow the government to carry on offensive action if needed.When asked whom he would save first if he saw both President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey drowning, he gave a subtle smile and said, \u201cIf someone has already decided to drown, it\u2019s impossible to save them.\u201dHe demurred when asked to endorse an American presidential candidate, but in response to a question about the lack of choice in Russian politics, he pointed to the United States to defend his record. Bushes or Clintons had been running America for many years, he said, with another Clinton now running.\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s that bad, there are benefits and there are drawbacks,\u201d he said.When he was asked a question about his romantic life, Mr. Putin tried to brush it off and turn back to the economy.\u201cI\u2019m happy with my life,\u201d he said, while suggesting that saying more might have unpredictable consequences. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that will affect the exchange rate or oil price.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Earthquake Jolts Ecuador Into Enacting Long-Avoided Fiscal Changes", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byPORTOVIEJO, Ecuador \u2014 Even before the earthquake struck, prospects were rough for this tiny Andean nation.On Wednesday, President Rafael Correa delivered the news on television: There would be an increase of two percentage points in the sales tax, a one-time garnishing of government wages for those earning more than $1,000 a month and the possible sale of government assets. He also announced a new personal wealth tax for millionaires.In recent days, he has spoken about asking the international community for loans, ones likely to come with their own difficult conditions. And his opponents are talking about the possibility of approaching the International Monetary Fund, long shunned here for its demands to cut government spending.\u201cThe deficit, the lack of savings and now an earthquake have made it clear that the old way of doing things simply can\u2019t continue in Ecuador,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Hidalgo, an economist who directs the Corporation for Development Studies, a research institute in Quito, the capital. Ecuador has become the latest country in the region where falling commodity prices have joined with other circumstances in pressuring leaders to renege on populist promises of the last decade.In oil-producing Venezuela this year, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered gas stations to begin charging a nominal rate for the first time. Mauricio Macri, Argentina\u2019s new market-oriented president, has ordered his country to undergo an audit by the monetary fund for the first time in a decade, which may signal austerity ahead.In Ecuador, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake a week ago helped set off what many say was a debate years in the making. Over the last decade, the government made significant investments in infrastructure and education while depleting emergency funds set aside for disasters like earthquakes, analysts say. Spending on government salaries also ballooned as the government grew.Mr. Correa said the bill for reconstruction would be more than $3 billion, a sum he said the government did not have.\u201cThe government is using the earthquake as an excuse to introduce measures it had needed to introduce for a long time,\u201d said Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, the chief Andean economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The news did not go over well in Portoviejo, the largest city hit by the earthquake, where the death toll has passed 100 people. More than 600 have died throughout the country.Roberto Rodr\u00edguez, a former congressman who lives in the city, said raising taxes after a natural disaster would only make the reconstruction effort more costly for residents.\u201cThe price of everything will simply go up \u2014 concrete, asphalt, any construction material you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cThere need to be incentives to build at a time like this.\u201dEvelyn Poggi, the owner of a warehouse in Portoviejo, said taxes had already been too high for her business before the earthquake. And Ecuador\u2019s economic contractions, felt even more profoundly in provincial cities like Portoviejo, had given her business a beating.\u201cWe went from having an average of $1,500 in sales a day to suddenly $800,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we went to $300. Public institutions stopped paying their bills. If there\u2019s no money, we don\u2019t sell anything.\u201dYet while the new taxes are expected to cover the costs of the earthquake, economists say larger economic problems still lie ahead for Ecuador.Its main challenge \u2014 one faced by the leftist oil-dependent governments of Venezuela and Brazil \u2014 is petroleum prices, which have collapsed in the last year. More than half of Ecuador\u2019s exports still come from oil.Ecuador, however, failed to save much income from the high energy prices for rainy days like these.Mr. Hidalgo, the economist, said that between 2010 and 2013, the price of oil exceeded the government\u2019s budget projections. Had it saved the surpluses from those years, it would now have a $7.5 billion cushion, according to his calculations.Adding to the country\u2019s woes is its use of the dollar, a switch that took place in 2000, when a financial crisis caused the national currency, the sucre, to collapse. Now the dollar has appreciated against other currencies in the region, and Ecuador\u2019s exports have suffered as they have grown more expensive.Because Ecuador is unable to control its currency, it faces recession and contraction of wages, a process that Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the economist, said was already underway.With Mr. Correa leaving office next year, opponents say they see a chance to put their stamp on the country\u2019s balance sheet.Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram Jr., a candidate for president from the Ecuador Force party, said the country needed to follow the model of Argentina, which after years of conflict with the monetary fund is beginning the process to accept assistance.While Mr. Correa\u2019s public spending was popular in the previous decade, Mr. Bucaram said, the consequences are becoming widely visible.\u201cPoverty hasn\u2019t been eliminated in Ecuador,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has only gotten a coat of cement.\u201dMaggy Ayala contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Greek View of Brexit", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byFor around 200 years, Greece and Britain have been tied together. Britain, as a leading economic, political, military and technological power, has had inordinate influence on modern Greek history. At the height of its imperial power, Britain was decisive in helping the Greeks break free of the Ottoman Empire; in World War II and the Greek civil war that followed, Winston Churchill fought to keep Greece in the Western camp and succeeded. Now both nations, from very different positions, pose a serious threat to the European Union.The two have been partners in NATO since 1952 and in what is now the European Union since 1981. Britain was and remains a great, mature democracy, a leading economy, a nuclear power, an educational superpower, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Greece, ever since having raised costly loans in London in 1824 and 1825 to fund its war of independence, has stumbled and soared, with bankruptcies, wars and dictatorship punctuating periods of territorial expansion, domestic reform and prosperity. The longest stretch of stability came with accession to the European Union, followed, since 2010, by an economic collapse longer and deeper than the Great Depression in the United States.The latest great debt crisis has brought Greece to the brink of being forced out of the common currency, and a flood of refugees and immigrants has prompted other European Union members to propose Greece\u2019s suspension from the passport-free zone known as the Schengen Area.Most Greeks are afraid to leave the euro and the European Union. An economy that has shrunk by 25 percent, a large number of pensioners and unemployed, and a declining population suggest that the country would not survive outside of a larger economic unit. \u201cEver closer union\u201d is the only way, goes the thinking, and reforms that our partners demand in exchange for support make us stronger.In Britain, on the other hand, those in favor of exiting the European Union present this as a declaration of national sovereignty. As Michael Gove, the justice secretary and a leading Brexit campaigner, put it in a recent speech: \u201cIf we vote to stay, British taxpayers will inevitably be paying ever-higher bills for years to come as the E.U. uses its growing and unchecked power to transfer resources to subsidize failure. If we vote to stay, we are not settling for the status quo \u2014 we are voting to be a hostage, locked in the boot of a car driven by others to a place and at a pace that we have no control over. In stark contrast, if we vote to leave, we take back control.\u201dGreeks know about being powerless. Long periods of our history have resembled Mr. Gove\u2019s nightmarish scenario, with foreign powers and military dictators controlling our fate.European Union membership put an end to that \u2014 no matter how much we bridle at Brussels\u2019 mismanagement and alleged \u201cdemocratic deficit.\u201d For us, European values helped entrench the rule of law and political institutions as never before (albeit without strengthening them to the point where we could have averted bankruptcy). Britain, on the other hand, already had a long and proud tradition of liberal democracy, economic dynamism, social stability and the rule of law, which attracts investors, students, academics and professionals from across the globe (many Greeks among them). European Union membership is in line with these values and it is not true that Britain is powerless to influence events.At the heart of the British referendum is a fundamental paradox. Prime Minister David Cameron campaigned for reform in the European Union, and when he got most of what he wanted, backed the campaign to stay. If, however, his compatriots vote for leaving, the reforms will be irrelevant to Britain, which will suddenly be looking for a new modus vivendi with its former partners. Britain will not only lose its ability to influence developments but will also be a catalyst for further change in the bloc. Whether this will be toward further union or fragmentation, Britain will be powerless to act \u2014 like being in the trunk of Mr. Gove\u2019s proverbial car.The argument that Britain can do better on its own seems to be based on nostalgia for a time when it was a great power. In Greece, though, we remember how, at the height of our civil war in early 1947, an exhausted Britain handed the Greek problem to the United States \u2014 leading to the Truman Doctrine, confirming American dominance in the region. Within two decades, all but a couple of outposts of Britain\u2019s empire had been abandoned.President Barack Obama, visiting London on Friday, referred to the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between his country and Britain, adding, however, that Britain would be stronger by remaining in the European Union.The analysis by Mr. Cameron\u2019s government says that annual economic output would be \u00a34,300 (about $6,100) lower per household if Britain left the bloc. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, fears that Britain could lose its status as a pre-eminent financial center. Mr. Gove argued that Britons could hedge their bets \u2014 voting to leave but taking their time to do so. \u201cWe can set the pace,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter we establish full legal independence we can then decide which E.U.-inspired rules and regulations we want to keep ... while we calmly take our time to change the law, one thing which won\u2019t change is our ability to trade freely with Europe.\u201dLast summer, Greece\u2019s government had a similar win-win idea: hold a referendum and campaign against a new bailout agreement with creditors, but stay in the eurozone. However, when creditors made it clear to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that he had no alternative but to lead his country into the wilderness, he signed on to the deal. Mr. Tsipras \u2014 like Brexit campaigners \u2014 had ignored the observation on Britain\u2019s great gift to the world, attributed to Jean-Paul Sartre : \u201cIn football everything is complicated by the presence of the opposite team.\u201dNikos Konstandaras is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Blame Silicon Valley for Theranos", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTHREE years ago, Walgreens (b. 1901) arrived in Silicon Valley for the same reason many old economy companies do: to hurry and join the digital vanguard before it was left behind. Walgreens quickly made a deal with Theranos (b. 2004), the medical diagnostics company and media darling that promised a revolutionary approach to blood tests.That hopeful beginning seems so long ago. Last fall, a series of investigative articles in The Wall Street Journal cast suspicion on Theranos\u2019s methods, a devastating federal report found serious deficiencies in the company\u2019s quality control, and Theranos is now under investigation by federal prosecutors and by the Securities and Exchange Commission.It is tempting to see Theranos as another example of Silicon Valley hype \u2014 a company based on a wisp of an unproven idea becomes a multibillion-dollar phenomenon with the backing of pump-and-dump venture capitalists.In fact, however, Silicon Valley\u2019s most experienced investors in start-ups saw red flags at Theranos before anyone else. The Theranos saga shows just how well Silicon Valley does its homework, especially when considering medical technology, in which the risks of doing real harm to people are higher than those posed by the next photo-sharing app.Walgreens made a rookie mistake when it looked at Theranos\u2019s GPS coordinates. Silicon Valley actually consists of two very separate places. The first is the start-up ecosystem built around the 15 or 20 venture capital firms in the tech sector and a similar number in life sciences that account for almost all of the successful companies.The second place is the surrounding fringe, occupied by small companies in perpetual search of well-connected investors, and investors in perpetual search of novel start-ups. Their desperation for partners resembles that of bar patrons who are unattached at last call.Both groups of Silicon Valley players are similar in appearance, but they couldn\u2019t be more different in status or access to critical networks and knowledge. Historically, the top 10 percent of venture-capital firms produce returns almost 10 times greater than the average of the remaining 90 percent.Theranos did make presentations to many, if not most, of the top life sciences firms. Part of the company\u2019s appeal was the familiar origin myth of Theranos\u2019s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, who, like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg before her, dropped out of college in order to found her company.That might impress some social media investors, but in life sciences, everyone puts in years of formal study just to earn a seat at the table. For example, at MPM Capital, a venture firm that invests in life sciences, almost every one of its 20 investing directors and partners has either a Ph.D. or M.D., and one has both. Even the general counsel has a Ph.D. in cell, molecular and developmental biology.GV, formerly Google Ventures, has a five-person investment team for Life Science & Health that includes two members with Ph.D.s in bioengineering; another with both an M.D. and a Ph.D. in biophysics; and a partner who, unlike Ms. Holmes, finished at Stanford, then went on to earn an M.D. and M.B.A. at Harvard.Theranos approached GV twice and was turned down twice because of what one partner called \u201cso much hand-waving.\u201d People I have talked to at other investment firms said they turned down Theranos for similar reasons, unsatisfied with Theranos\u2019s attempt to substitute its intangible \u201ccoolness\u201d in place of technical details needed to validate its diagnostic technology.Another tipoff? Theranos wouldn\u2019t publish in peer-reviewed journals. Guy Cavet, chief technology officer for the biotech firm Atreca, said: \u201cEvery smart prospective partner of a life sciences start-up looks for strong peer-reviewed publications. It\u2019s a way of getting expert due diligence at zero cost.\u201dExperience in health care is critical for a company like Theranos, which has to comply with government regulations. Instead, even the board of directors was weighted during most of the company\u2019s life with older political figures like George P. Shultz and Henry A. Kissinger.Luke Evnin, a co-founder at MPM Capital, said he had never met with Theranos or Ms. Holmes, but he found the makeup of the board puzzling: \u201cIt is pretty weird that if you look at her board, there\u2019s not a single person who knows what they\u2019re doing in the business.\u201dThe first million dollars that the company received was from Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who became a venture capitalist through a very un-Silicon Valley-like route: His father was one (as was his grandfather). Mr. Draper had known Ms. Holmes as a childhood neighbor and playmate. The investors that followed Mr. Draper are a motley group, at least the ones visible in S.E.C. filings: a tiny firm named ATA Ventures; Continental Properties, a real estate company; and Donald L. Lucas, whose claim to fame was having invested in Oracle Corporation early.No, they needed results. Theranos might still prove viable. But if Walgreens ends up with swampland, it\u2019s not Silicon Valley\u2019s fault.Advertisement"}

And with more than 115,000 orders before the car was even introduced, it is well on its way.A crowd of Tesla fans cheered as the Model 3, a sleek five-seater, was unveiled Thursday evening at the company\u2019s design studio in Hawthorne, Calif. Interested customers lined up at Tesla dealerships around the country, and the enthusiasm was matched with a torrent of comments online.The Model 3 is \u201cthe final step in the master plan, which is a mass market, affordable car,\u201d Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said at the unveiling. \u201cIt was only possible to do after going through the prior steps.\u201d\u201cWith any new technology, it takes multiple iterations and it takes economies of scale before you can make it great and affordable,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The Model 3 will be able to travel at least 215 miles on a single charge and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than six seconds.Each advance order included a charge of $1,000, and the company took in more than $115 million within 24 hours. If those orders all translate into sales, revenue from the Model 3 will exceed $4 billion. A screen at the debut event Thursday showed online reservations continuing to tick past 133,000.\u201cThis is kind of crazy,\u201d Mr. Musk said in announcing the number of advance orders.Although the Model 3 unveiling generated intense buzz, the company faces competition from automotive giants like General Motors and Renault-Nissan, which have also begun manufacturing electric vehicles. Low fuel prices could hurt overall sales of electric vehicles.\u201cI do feel fairly confident it will be next year,\u201d Mr. Musk said to laughter from the audience.Meeting anticipated interest in the cheaper model will require a sharp increase in Tesla\u2019s production capacity. Last year the company delivered 50,580 vehicles.Mr. Musk said Thursday that he believed the company\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif., could produce as many as 500,000 vehicles annually.\u201cIt\u2019s very doable,\u201d he said.The expansion also requires the construction of a huge battery production plant. Tesla began construction of its Gigafactory 1 in northern Nevada in 2014. It is now operational, and once it is at full capacity, it will \u201cproduce more lithium ion batteries than all other factories in the world combined,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Despite Bashing Beijing, Is Not Without Fans in China", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySinosphereThe reasons for Chinese interest in Mr. Trump vary. There are those who endorse his positions, such as those who, mindful of China\u2019s own tense relations with some of its ethnic and religious minorities, voice support for Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to ban noncitizen Muslims from entering the United States. Some like his strongman politics, believing the world needs a stronger American president. Then there are those who root for him to win in the expectation that a Trump-led United States would antagonize other countries and hasten China\u2019s rise.Many simply find Mr. Trump an intriguing exception to the usual sedate lineup of politicians.\u201cHe speaks out of line, and that appeals to me,\u201d Lai Quanzhong, 47, a Trump Fan Club follower from Fujian Province, said in a telephone interview. He said that this was the first time he had paid close attention to an American election but that \u201ceven for those who don\u2019t understand American elections, they just can\u2019t avoid listening to what he says.\u201dHis flamboyance is part of his attraction to Chinese who normally are indifferent to American politics, said Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cThat\u2019s why they pay attention to Trump, who is quite entertaining,\u201d he said.But Mr. Trump also appeals to a practical streak in many Chinese, he said. \u201cHe makes lots of money,\u201d Mr. Jin said. \u201cChinese people like to be friends with pragmatists.\u201dMr. Ding, the fan club founder, who has been posting news and videos about Mr. Trump since November, said, \u201cI admire his outspokenness and personal charisma.\u201d The fan club, he said, is a way to inform Chinese about a man who could become the next American president.The number of club followers has risen from about 2,000 in late February to nearly 9,000 at the end of March. They discuss the election, watch the debates and attack Mr. Trump\u2019s detractors.Interviews with about a dozen fans suggest that some are well-educated professionals. Their views can seem contradictory: advocating personal liberty and free markets, but also nationalism and a strong state. They are interested in the American electoral process but say China is not ready for popularly elected leaders.Some have been following Mr. Trump since \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the reality television show that he hosted. In fact, Sun Jianguo, 31, a building technician, said in an interview that it was Mr. Trump who got him interested in American politics.Mr. Sun also likes Mr. Trump\u2019s critical comments about Muslims. He said there are Muslims in his home province of Hebei and the city of Tianjin, where he went to college, \u201cand they can be bossy sometimes.\u201dTan Zhenxing, 29, another fan club follower, said in an interview that Mr. Trump could be the strong leader the United States needs to remain at the forefront of innovation. \u201cIf America fails,\u201d Mr. Tan said, \u201cEurope will fail, and then China will fail.\u201dThe Chinese state media has faulted Mr. Trump for his statements on immigrants. But many of Mr. Trump\u2019s middle-class Chinese fans do not see his proposals to expel illegal immigrants and bar low-skilled workers from entering the United States as applying to them.Mr. Trump has denounced Chinese trade policies and promised to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports. Some Chinese commenters doubted such a tariff would actually materialize. Others say a President Trump would prod China to rely less on manufacturing and exports. Kang Yuekui, 35, said: \u201cIt would be good for the Chinese economy in the long run, and short-term pain is better than long-term suffering.\u201dJiang Shuai, 27, a salesman from Shenzhen, argues that Mr. Trump would anger American businesses and make enemies in the Middle East and Europe and that in the process he would \u201cmake China great again.\u201dIn the first survey, which simply listed the candidates, Mr. Trump won with 38 percent of the 729 respondents\u2019 votes. But in the second survey, Mr. Hartzell included each candidate\u2019s opinions on issues like abortion, immigration and foreign policy. This time, Mr. Trump fell to 18 percent out of 474 respondents, well below Hillary Clinton\u2019s 46 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Disrupted,\u2019 by Dan Lyons", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Dan Lyons is the last journalist who should have been surprised when he became yet another casualty in the war on old-media workers. A longtime tech writer (he began writing for PC Week in the 1980s, before the field became sexy), he was the technology editor at Newsweek in 2012 when he was \u201cunceremoniously dumped\u201d (would \u201cceremoniously dumped\u201d have been better?) and at the age of 52 became what a story about the recession in his own magazine the previous year called a \u201cbeached white male.\u201d When Lyons started his job four years earlier, Newsweek employees were already being offered buyouts; how could he not have seen what was coming? But he is also the last journalist who should have been leveled by the blow, since he had already shown himself to be enviably resourceful: In 2006, while he was the technology reporter at Forbes, he started a wicked, at first anonymous blog called The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs, in which, writing as Fake Steve, he portrayed the real Jobs as a constellation of personality disorders and satirized everyone of note in Silicon Valley. He turned the blog into a novel and also got a TV deal out of it. And though the show was never produced, he developed some pretty sweet Hollywood connections \u2014 the superagent Ari Emanuel and Larry Charles, of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d fame.\u201cDisrupted\u201d is born of Lyons\u2019s attempt to cross over from covering tech to getting a piece of the action in the second, current Internet bubble. He lucks out to a degree that is enviable, not because of his payday (he never tells us his salary, and his stock-option payout isn\u2019t grand), but because the company he ends up working for, HubSpot, a marketing-software firm in Cambridge, Mass., is tailor-made for someone like him to write about, not as Fake Steve but as Real Dan. HubSpot embodies everything that\u2019s ridiculous about the culture of start-ups, and in the bargain it reinforces every paranoid worry Lyons has about his age: As he learned from the beached-white-male piece, \u201cin the new economy, age 50 was the new 65.\u201dIf I were not able to confirm the existence of HubSpot on the web, I might think Lyons had invented it. The place is, to use Lyons\u2019s references, a hash of Orwellian doublespeak, the movie \u201cOffice Space\u201d and Scientology. HubSpot blasts its customers with what normal people call spam but they call \u201clovable marketing content.\u201d It wants to put its customers into a state of \u201cdelightion.\u201d Employees are entitled to unlimited free food and unlimited vacation time. There\u2019s a wall of candy. One of the founders of the company brings a teddy bear to meetings so that the idea of \u201cthe customer\u201d they are determined to delight is less abstract. And then there\u2019s the unnerving, unreal reality that HubSpot shares with a number of other Internet companies: Although it has a valuation of around $2 billion, it has never made a profit. Unfortunately, Lyons isn\u2019t able to get beyond the obvious ridiculousnesses. The young people who work at HubSpot \u2014 they\u2019re so horribly, horribly young \u2014 are indistinguishable aliens to Lyons, and incapable, he says, of appreciating irony or sarcasm, or him.None of this will be new to anyone who read even a couple of pieces about the first Internet bubble. The Ping-Pong \u00adtables, the snacks, the beanbag chairs \u2014 it\u2019s all very familiar. Lyons doesn\u2019t get below the surface of the place, or get to know anyone; connection and insight don\u2019t seem to be his strengths. It\u2019s not all his fault: After being hired as a \u201cmarketing fellow,\u201d he is essentially ignored, and has nothing useful to do, and no one listens to his ideas. Naturally, he hates HubSpot almost instantly, gets into power struggles with co-workers and posts trouble-courting comments on Facebook. The disrupted is now a disrupter. You can\u2019t blame him for what seems to be a kind of termination wish \u2014 HubSpot is clearly a crazy-\u00admaking company. One of the founders promulgates a corporate \u201cculture code\u201d called Heart, an acronym of five deadening words: humble, effective, adaptable, remarkable, transparent. At the same time, when employees are fired it is said they are \u201cgraduated,\u201d and their names are never mentioned again.Lyons\u2019s book derails about three-\u00adquarters of the way through, as he becomes obsessed with the unpredictable behavior of one of his co-workers, a fellow he calls Trotsky, toward him. (Almost everyone in the book has been given a mildly clever pseudonym.) The reader can\u2019t make sense of their relationship either, and soon stops caring enough to try. What carries the book through to the end are two twists: One is that Lyons is summoned to Hollywood again, to write for the HBO comedy \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d for a few months (while he\u2019s still at HubSpot); the other is that once Lyons leaves HubSpot and writes this book, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer is caught trying to procure the manuscript before it\u2019s published, and is fired for his enterprising efforts.That is, of course, a gift to Lyons, but he disingenuously professes shock over the news: \u201cWhy would anyone go to such lengths to get hold of a memoir whose essential purpose was to entertain?\u201d (Oh, perhaps because people don\u2019t find it very entertaining to be depicted as charlatans.) Such faux na\u00efvet\u00e9 is unbecoming in someone as savvy as Lyons is, and makes him seem, in the end, an unreliable narrator of his own story.Nancy Franklin was the television critic of The New Yorker from 1998 to 2011.Advertisement"}

There is no sign or name on the door, which is outfitted with a camera to prevent unwelcome visitors. \u201cEven the neighbors don\u2019t know what\u2019s here,\u201d he said with a laugh.But inside the walls, Mr. Gharem, 43, has created an oasis of sorts for a group of young Saudi artists to whom he serves as role model, mentor and sometime financier. This year, he will lead about 20 of the artists on a tour sponsored by a Saudi government cultural center to showcase the country\u2019s art in the United States, with events in Houston, Los Angeles and other cities.Mr. Gharem is in some ways a curious choice for such a job, having spent his career taking aim at what he sees as the stifling aspects of Saudi life: the byzantine bureaucracy, religious dogmatism and dependence on oil.He is not a political dissident. His longtime day job, in fact, was in the Saudi Army, where he became a lieutenant colonel before retiring in 2014.Despite the limitations, Mr. Gharem remains in the kingdom, hoping his ideas will echo in society.\u201cThat is your role as an artist, to bring out the option that the politician can\u2019t say and that the religious man can\u2019t say,\u201d he said. \u201cYou bring out the solutions that people can\u2019t say.\u201dMr. Gharem charted his own path in a country where the term \u201cart career\u201d is an oxymoron.Raised in the conservative town of Khamis Mushayt in southwestern Saudi Arabia, he liked to draw as a child, but even then he was criticized by those who believed that the ability to render living beings should be left to God alone.\u201cWhy did you draw a portrait?\u201d he said his teachers would ask. \u201cIt was like you were guilty, as if art was a sin you were committing.\u201dAfter high school, Mr. Gharem applied to study art at a Saudi university but was not accepted. Instead, he joined the army, one of the only pathways to social standing for young men from the provinces. He graduated from a military academy and went to a post near the border with Yemen, where there was little to do.The free time turned out to be a blessing, he said, because he had time to read and, after he gained Internet access, to learn about subjects not widely taught in the kingdom, like philosophy, comparative religion, music and art.His first major work was inspired by a rural bridge where villagers had been told by a religious leader to seek refuge during a flash flood. But the water had made the bridge collapse, killing the villagers.Mr. Gharem and some friends spray-painted the word \u201csirat,\u201d or path, on the bridge, a commentary on what Mr. Gharem called \u201cthe culture of the herd.\u201d\u201cI saw how people listened without thinking, like a flock of sheep,\u201d he said.Later, Mr. Gharem stumbled on a fisherman\u2019s community that the government had scheduled for destruction by painting \u201cto be removed\u201d on its houses in red paint. Mr. Gharem painted \u201cto be removed\u201d on his shirt and had a friend take photographs of him walking among the residents and their homes.Mr. Gharem said he had little choice but to comply, but he was impressed that his work had such an effect.\u201cI knew I had to go back to Saudi in a week, and I had a job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I felt the power I had and the reaction that I could create.\u201dMr. Gharem\u2019s international breakthrough came with an installation called \u201cMessage/Messenger,\u201d a large, golden dome propped up like an animal trap with a white dove suspended underneath. He said it was a commentary on religion, which he believes is beautiful but can be used for ill.In 2011, he put the piece up for auction in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where an Iranian collector bought it for $842,000, the highest price ever for the work of a living Arab artist at that time.Mr. Gharem was not there to see it. He was at work on a Saudi military base and had no idea about the sale.\u201cAll of a sudden my cellphones \u2014 I had two \u2014 lit on fire, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said, recalling his friends calling and yelling, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d he said.During a recent evening at the studio, a half-dozen young artists filtered into the living room. The walls were lined with bookshelves and framed artworks, and musical instruments were scattered about on stands.While one young man watched a documentary about Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the South American independence hero, others worked on projects on computers in the office.In jeans, a faded blue T-shirt and gray wingtips with fluorescent green soles, Mr. Gharem floated among them, looking at their plans and commenting before ordering grilled chicken for everyone and slipping out to head home to his wife and two daughters.Restrictions on their work remain, he said. Male and female artists can be harassed for meeting in cafes, so they hang out in his studio.He has struggled to bring even Muslim artists into the country from abroad, so he tells those willing to visit to apply for pilgrimage visas. And he builds most of his projects outside the country for fear that Saudi customs agents will take offense and impound them.Some of the snags he has encountered sound like practical jokes, like the time he tried to ship a female mannequin from abroad but was told it could not enter Saudi Arabia. In the end, he chopped it into pieces and had friends smuggle them back so he could reassemble the model in Riyadh.His recent works have a darker edge, like a video that shows a young man with a map of the Arab world on his back. His skin is sliced with a razor and suction cups are applied to his skin, filling up with blood.He calls the project \u201cProsperity Without Growth\u201d and would like to show it in Vienna \u2014 near the headquarters of OPEC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the U.S. Ready for Post-Middle-Class Politics?", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "The Money IssueA particular vision of the American dream has shaped elections for decades. What happens when people stop believing in it?Supported byThe whole episode revealed a fundamental tension underlying this year\u2019s anomalous presidential contest. America\u2019s self-\u00adimage as a middle-\u00adclass nation is so deeply ingrained in the country\u2019s politics that we don\u2019t often stop to think what, precisely, that means: whether it defines a concrete socioeconomic identity \u2014 a country where most people are neither very rich nor very poor \u2014 or an aspiration, the notion that if you \u201cwork hard and play by the rules,\u201d as Clinton put it the first time she ran for president, you\u2019re entitled to at least a modest prosperity. \u201cEveryday Americans\u201d was an attempt to acknowledge that the gap between these two ideas has widened to the point that ignoring it seems out of touch. Yet in its reversal, the campaign inadvertently revealed just how ill \u00adequipped American politics is for a post-\u00admiddle-\u00adclass nation \u2014 how deeply the way the country speaks of itself is tied up with these aspirations, even as more and more of its citizens come to see them as out of reach.As the first election results and exit polls came in, Trump\u2019s voters seemed to be mostly high-\u00adschool-\u00adeducated white men, mostly making less than $50,000 a year. Perhaps more surprising, this description also fits, with some tailoring, the voters who have propelled the candidacy of Bernie Sanders. In mostly white New Hampshire, Sanders beat Clinton among voters making less than $50,000 a year by a staggering 33 percentage points \u2014 twice as big as his margin with voters who made more than that \u2014 and by 36 percentage points among voters without college degrees. In Michigan, whose suburban voters are one of the most-\u00adwatched barometers in American politics, the margins were narrower but still notable: Sanders won white voters without a college degree by 15 percentage points, and voters making less than $50,000 by 3 percentage points.These insurgent candidates are capturing one of the two demographic groups that converged in the great middle-\u00adclass experiment that began seven decades ago. When people spoke of the middle class in the years immediately after World War II, they were typically talking about the group identified by the sociologist C.Wright Mills in his 1951 book, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d: the usually college-\u00adeducated, deskbound employees of a newly technocratic, corporate economy. It was only a few years later that the definition was generally extended to include skilled blue-\u00adcollar workers, who were now earning solid incomes on account of a booming postwar industrial economy and of unions that made sure their members got an equitable piece of it.The confluence of these two groups \u2014 a vision of insurance salesmen and machine operators, mowing the lawns of adjoining split-\u00adlevel ranches and talking about Sunday\u2019s game \u2014 felt extraordinary even in its own time, seemingly incontrovertible proof that American capitalism worked. \u201cThe fact is that America\u2019s booming new middle-\u00adincome class consists, to a startling extent, of groups hitherto identified as proletarians,\u201d Fortune reported in 1954. Instead of overthrowing the bourgeoisie, the proletariat had joined it.The white- and blue-\u00adcollar middle classes each tended to vote Democratic, which made sense: The new middle class\u2019s good fortune was the combined product of the New Deal, postwar Keynesian economic policy, the G.I. Bill, organized labor and government-\u00adbacked mortgages. But in retrospect, the Democrats\u2019 hold on the white middle class was balanced precariously on the racial status quo \u2014 which, by the mid-\u00ad1960s, was breaking apart. George Wallace, the segregationist Democratic governor of Alabama who ran for president in 1964 in protest of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s turn toward civil rights, performed well not just in the South but also in white blue-\u00adcollar enclaves in the few Northern states where he was on the primary ballot. When he ran again as an independent in 1968, the members of the United Auto Workers Union local at the General Motors plant in Flint, Mich., voted to endorse him.In one sense, what had happened was obvious. The postwar suburbs in general had been a racial fortress, their homogeneity enforced by a web of government policies and unofficial restrictions making it difficult for nonwhites to own property in them, and few more so than Detroit\u2019s. The white ex-\u00adDemocrats whom Greenberg\u2019s team interviewed, he later wrote, \u201cexpressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics. Blacks constituted the explanation for their vulnerability and for almost everything that had gone wrong in their lives; not being black was what constituted being middle class.\u201dStill, Greenberg noted, Macomb voters had not defected en masse from the Democratic Party until after years of worsening economic circumstances \u2014 and until they perceived the Democrats as not only having taken up the banner of the urban poor and nonwhites but also having abandoned the white middle class. \u201cThese voters wondered why they weren\u2019t the central drama of the Democratic Party,\u201d Greenberg wrote. Greenberg suggested that Democrats offer a kind of grand bargain to the white middle-\u00adclass voters he called \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d: The Democrats would reinstate the middle class as the gravitational center of the party\u2019s economic policy if those voters accepted an expanded definition of who was included in the middle class.The aspirational idea of the middle class spoke to the notion that even if Americans were in various stages of prosperity, they were all understood to be heading in the same general direction. But what happens when that\u2019s no longer true? On one end of the \u201cmiddle class\u201d spectrum is a dream inexorably receding from view; on the other is a pair of socioeconomic blinders obscuring the harsher economic realities of those further down the scale. \u201cThe upper middle class are surprised by the rise of Trump,\u201d Reeves told me. \u201cThe actual middle class are surprised we\u2019re surprised.\u201dCharles Homans is the politics editor for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Borrowing Directly From the Wealthy Can Be a Lifeline for Some", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersJohn Blosser bought a medical device company, changed its products and increased sales to $5 million last year from $300,000 in 2013. It was great that sales went up so quickly, he said. But it became increasingly challenging to manage the time delay between when an order was filled and when it was paid, 60 to 90 days later.John-Anthony Gargiulo had a different cash problem. He had entered an agreement to buy a building for a brewery in Beacon, N.Y., and found experienced brewmasters to run it. He secured a $500,000 development grant from New York State. But the project stalled as he tried to get a loan to close on the building, renovate it and buy the brewing equipment.What saved both men was a relatively new twist on peer-to-peer lending \u2014 borrowing from affluent individuals who are putting up their own money.But that money came at high interest rates. Mr. Blosser borrowed $250,000 at nearly 20 percent, while Mr. Gargiulo paid almost 15 percent on $2.9 million.In an era when money is cheap \u2014 the rate on a Small Business Administration loan is under 4 percent \u2014 these entrepreneurs said they had little choice. They could receive no money from a bank or accept high-interest money from individuals.\u201cWhen you believe in your project, you do what you can,\u201d Mr. Gargiulo said. \u201cIf we had deep pockets, we wouldn\u2019t have to do this. I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to go down this path. But in the end we got what we wanted.\u201dBut one man\u2019s tough choice is another\u2019s remarkable return. In this rarefied niche of peer-to-peer lending, those with money to lend have a chance to earn a high return in a fixed-income-like investment and often have a say in how the money is used and the business is run.\u201cThe basic premise is banks can\u2019t really service any of these guys, but we can,\u201d said Billy Procida, a former general contractor and later a real estate developer in the New York area who presides over a $32 million fund made up mostly of his money. \u201cYou walk into my office and under five minutes you get a straight answer. We do due diligence, but it\u2019s me and my 35 years of experience.\u201dFor the last decade, peer-to-peer lenders like Prosper and Lending Club have offered a platform for individuals to make loans to other people for an array of uses, from paying off medical bills to building their businesses. And those companies continue to grow, benefiting from a combination of the sharing economy with returns reminiscent of the old Roman Empire. The top rate on a loan made through Prosper is 36 percent.Those companies allow small-time lenders to create a portfolio of loans to individuals and pool their risk. Affluent individuals, on the other hand, are making loans one at a time. This would seem to increase the risk, but the lenders say it allows them to know the individuals, monitor the businesses more closely and help the companies get to a point where they can borrow from a traditional bank.With rates that can top 20 percent, even for 12 months, the affluent lenders are filling a specific niche. They say one of their big attractions is the speed with which individuals or funds made up of individuals can approve loans.George Haviland Jr., director of the New Jersey Junior Titans, a hockey club, said he was trying to keep up with the demand for the ice hockey program he runs in Middletown, N.J. The club had bought a sports complex from the town in 2012 and built a 1,200-seat hockey arena with sky boxes.Last year, he said, he started the process to build an additional skating center to keep up with demand but spent over six months trying to get bank financing for it.In January, he said, he was able to borrow $300,000 for eight months from a group of individual lenders to start construction on a rink he hopes to have ready by Labor Day. It took him about three weeks.\u201cThe process for the conventional funding was much longer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allowed me to start my process without tapping into my own money.\u201dAs building gets underway, he has continued the process with a bank to replace the short-term financing. Until then, the group of lenders, Assure Funding, allows Mr. Haviland to make weekly payments.For these lenders, getting paid back quickly is part of the game and an attraction to the borrowers.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some people who used our financing for capital outlays, then they turned around and found S.B.A. financing and bought out the loan,\u201d said Michael Sinensky, who owns several restaurants in New York and is the founder of Assure Funding. \u201cThey needed to do a deal, and later on they got a much lower rate and we provided the capital to get the deal done.\u201dThese lenders also look at projects that banks might struggle with. That was the case with the brewery in Beacon. Mr. Gargiulo said banks that looked at the project thought it was simply too much money to invest. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t understand the difference between a factory and a restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said, \u2018We\u2019re a factory. We\u2019re a wholesaler.\u2019 That was the challenge.\u201dMr. Procida said he mostly lends to people he thinks have the right skills and instincts. And he said he liked that Mr. Gargiulo was well known and well liked in the area.\u201cYou only came to us because a bank wouldn\u2019t lend to you \u2014 you had a credit problem or a challenge a bank couldn\u2019t lend to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cost more than a bank. But we\u2019re a lot cheaper than a partner. Our borrowers use our money for a short period of time, six months to two years.\u201dIf Mr. Procida\u2019s hunch is wrong, though, his money is secured by the real estate. He said he has only taken property a couple of times when someone defaulted. He attributed that to being able to offer advice from the careers that made him wealthy.(Mr. Sinensky of Assure put the default rate with this kind of lending at around 7 to 8 percent.)On a project in Philadelphia, the renovation of the Divine Lorraine Hotel, Mr. Procida arranged a $34 million loan for the developer, Eric Blumenfeld, but he also worked with him to secure $7 million in city and state subsidies.On that deal, Mr. Procida said, he sold $24 million of the loan to a bank, which he expects will provide long-term financing when the hotel is finished.Despite having been a developer in Philadelphia for years, Mr. Blumenfeld said he could not get a bank to finance the renovation. He was grateful for the money, he said, even at an interest rate of around 13 percent.\u201cBilly was the one guy who saw this the way that I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we get done, he gets taken out, and I\u2019ve probably created $10 million of value just by building it.\u201dMost of the loans made by wealthy individuals are to small businesses, particularly to companies younger than two years. \u201cThere are so many healthy businesses that can\u2019t get loans but are a year old,\u201d said Mr. Sinensky of Assure Funding.When these lenders \u2014 big or small \u2014 step in, they stand to make a substantial return. The borrowers get money they wouldn\u2019t get otherwise, and perhaps a push from the high rate to pay it back quickly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Enclave Seen as a Fault Line of East-West Tensions", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byBut this year, said Svetlana G. Sivkova, the founding director of Kaliningrad\u2019s Museum of the World Ocean, regular participants from neighboring Lithuania and Poland threatened to stay home.\u201cThey said they could not come to us because Poles and Lithuanians are being beaten on the streets of Kaliningrad,\u201d said Ms. Sivkova, appalled at what she called an abrupt and unwarranted change in mood.\u201cThese are intelligent, educated people,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible propaganda. We had to explain that it\u2019s not true, that we are an open people.\u201dKaliningrad \u2014 the city and surrounding province share the name \u2014 was once the heart of East Prussia and a German redoubt for 500 years before the Red Army captured it from the Third Reich in 1945. In the first 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow worked hard to bury Kaliningrad\u2019s reputation as an armed garrison closed to foreigners.These days, the Kremlin seems determined to do the opposite, and senior Western military officials and other experts now regard the Baltic region as a main fault line in revived East-West tensions.In another episode on Thursday, a Russian warplane intercepted an American reconnaissance plane at an unsafe distance over the Baltic Sea, CNN reported, citing Capt. Danny Hernandez, a spokesman for the United States European Command.In the immediate post-Soviet era, Moscow tried to reinvent Kaliningrad, which is more than 200 miles from mainland Russia, as its own duty-free Hong Kong. Factories producing cars, electronics and furniture blossomed. After the provincial government negotiated visa-less travel to Polish border areas, the Ikea outlet in nearby Gdansk became a Russian colony.In recent years, however, Moscow has heavily armed Kaliningrad, analysts say, equipping secretive bases with the advanced, long-range S-400 antiaircraft missile system and mobile, medium-range Bastion anti-ship missiles. Russia has also held maneuvers here deploying Iskanders, a short-range ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.During congressional testimony in February, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the NATO commander, described Kaliningrad as a \u201cvery militarized piece of property\u201d and a \u201ccomplete bubble\u201d capable of repelling attacks by air, land or sea.With recent Russian military adventures in Crimea, eastern Ukraine and Syria, President Vladimir V. Putin has left the world guessing \u2014 as he so relishes \u2014 when or where he might intervene next.Given his stated policy of safeguarding ethnic Russians who were severed from the motherland after the Soviet Union disintegrated, some fear the next target might be the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three former Soviet republics are now members of the European Union and NATO.An attack on them would trigger NATO\u2019s mutual defense treaty. Any attempt to defend them would have to get past Kaliningrad, wedged between Poland and Lithuania.In the few conflicts where NATO has intervened, it has always displayed overwhelming force, experts said, but Kaliningrad would be different.Russians here tend to agree, although they mainly scoff at the idea of such a war. At Baltiysk, home to the Baltic Fleet and Russia\u2019s most western outpost, grizzled fishermen lined the sea wall, barely glancing up at the modern corvettes steaming out to sea.Any NATO forces attacking Kaliningrad \u201cwill get their teeth broken,\u201d one gruff angler said. A navy veteran, he stood beneath a symbol of Russia\u2019s might and glory: a hulking equestrian statue of the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna facing the West.Kaliningrad residents, watching NATO forces edge ever closer to Russia in recent years, generally seem to support buttressing the military.\u201cIf you are my neighbor and you sit there with an ax, I will get an ax, too,\u201d said Ms. Sivkova, the museum director. \u201cIt is foolish, but people say that weapons have been moved to Russia\u2019s borders, so there has to be some parity.\u201dYet people here find being cast as a Russian fortress disorienting. In downtown Kaliningrad, the Vorota Cafe and gallery fills the neo-Gothic Sackheim Gate, a leftover from the 17th-century city walls. Parts of the city still resemble Germany, including some suburbs of red-tiled, Gr\u00fcnderzeit villas.The cafe\u2019s young founders wanted an art space like those in Amsterdam or Berlin, and they were surprised by a question about life on the new East-West fault line.\u201cIt is a strange question, because we look at ourselves as being a bridge, not a fault line,\u201d said Eugene Makarkhin, 26, a computer engineer.Yet fallout from the deteriorating relations between Russia and the West rains down on Kaliningrad.BMW, one of the province\u2019s largest employers, recently shelved expansion plans in the face of a 40 percent decline in Russian car sales. Decades of Swedish development aid are coming to a close. Cultural exchanges have been sharply curtailed.Until the Ukraine crisis, the most dangerous flotilla dispatched from Kaliningrad toward Sweden was raw sewage dumped into the Baltic.\u201cKaliningrad is really one of the last big hot spots,\u201d said Anna Tufvesson, the regional environmental project coordinator for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.Kaliningrad, home to almost half the province\u2019s one million people, was the last major Baltic city without a modern water treatment plant. Sweden has helped build about 30 in the southern Baltic region since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kaliningrad\u2019s German system, built around 1928 and still in use, basically filtered out old bicycles, dead dogs and not much else, Ms. Tufvesson said.The modern Kaliningrad sewage plant, delayed for years, should be operating by the end of this year. Ms. Tufvesson expects all Swedish aid to be terminated by 2018.The aid is another victim of the economic penalties imposed because of the Ukraine conflict. Sanctions cut off European bank loans for development here.\u201cCooperation with European countries was a good source of cheap loans, and now we don\u2019t have that possibility,\u201d said Alexander N. Ivaschenko, who runs the Kaliningrad city waterworks. \u201cDue to the sanctions, future projects are frozen.\u201dConfrontation is eclipsing cooperation. Mr. Putin has fed Western concerns about a possible Baltic conflict by ordering snap military exercises in northwestern Russia and deliberate violations of NATO airspace. While military officials and other experts on both sides say war is unlikely, contingency planning proceeds. Sweden and Finland, Russian neighbors that once professed neutrality, are considering the once unthinkable prospect of joining NATO.Russia, too weak to confront NATO directly, relies on two methods to punch above its weight, military analysts say. In Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin conducted \u201chybrid warfare,\u201d deploying anonymous Special Forces soldiers nicknamed \u201clittle green men,\u201d nationalistic local militias and a news media blitz to seize territory without provoking a large, conventional military response.Kaliningrad embodies the other method, a concentration of highly effective conventional weapons lethal enough to thwart any invader.There is also the Baltic Fleet. In the post-Soviet years, it shrank to 190 ships from 450 and to two submarines from 42, before the decline was reversed and some new corvettes were delivered in recent years, according to the London institute. The fleet remains strong enough, analysts say, to turn the Baltic into a deadly caldron.\u201cThis is the same question posed about the Baltic States,\u201d Mr. Trenin said. \u201cWhether the United States would risk a military conflict with Russia for the sake of the Baltic States, knowing full well that Russia is still a nuclear power and when push comes to shove, nuclear will be on the table.\u201dKaliningrad residents worry far less about war than about an economy battered by low oil prices, sanctions and a weak ruble. \u201cA passing Mercedes has always proved stronger than the birch trees,\u201d said Solomon I. Ginzburg, an opposition deputy in the local Parliament, meaning that economic aspirations trump nationalism here.The fact that the \u201cfree economic zone\u201d expired on April 1 causes far more consternation than a renewed Cold War. \u201cNobody knows what will happen,\u201d said Ivan A. Vlasov, the publisher of the Kaliningrad edition of the national RBC website.The collapsed ruble means Russians have scaled way back on shopping in Poland or attending concerts in Lithuania. They also feel less welcome.Poles still cross the border for cheap gasoline, cigarettes and vodka, but a certain unease prevails on both sides.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a place for development anymore,\u201d said Mr. Shumanov, the anticorruption activist. \u201cI think that it is a place for militarization. There is no investment, no money, no real federal interest in the region itself and bad relations with the neighbors.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Kaliningrad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Path to Greece Closed, Economy of Smugglers and Others Suffers in Turkey", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byIzmir JournalIZMIR, Turkey \u2014 For more than a year, the Sinbad restaurant in Basmane Square was packed every day with hundreds of migrants from Syria anxiously conferring with brokers to negotiate fees to reach Europe through the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece.But this week it was mostly empty. Six of its employees had been laid off and those who remained said they had taken a 50 percent pay cut.\u201cAll our clients were Syrian and we lived off their tips,\u201d said Mohammed Hajji, 22, a waiter at the cafe. \u201cThis place used to be so packed you couldn\u2019t find a spot to put your feet. Now look \u2026\u201d His voice trailed off as he pointed to a row of empty tables and chairs.\u201cEvery business in this square profited from the refugees, and now they\u2019ve suddenly gone,\u201d said Kadir Akinci, the manager of a taxi company in the Basmane neighborhood. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a 70 percent cut in profits. Those passengers were our livelihood.\u201dSmugglers, once inundated with requests from desperate migrants, meandered through cafes and teahouses looking for the stray refugee. Clothing stores still displayed mannequins donning life vests and inner tubes, but sales were sparse.Taxi drivers, who had transferred thousands of passengers to isolated departure points, hung around the square looking morose. Hotels that had been booked for months by smugglers now sat empty, and Arabic signs erected to appeal to Syrians had mostly been removed from shop windows.Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said on Tuesday that by dissuading people from undertaking the dangerous crossing, the arrangement would prevent the Aegean Sea from turning into \u201ca cemetery for migrants.\u201d But rights groups have questioned the legality of the pact.Since the deal went into effect on March 20, the influx of migrants into Greece has fallen drastically, from thousands of daily arrivals to a couple hundred. Even as smugglers continue to try to trick passengers into leaving, the recent crackdown against them by the Turkish authorities has pushed operations underground.\u201cThe biggest problem is that when the Syrians came here, the Turks moved away,\u201d said Mr. Akinci, the manager at the cab company. \u201cAnd even if they now come back, it won\u2019t compare to the business of the boats. The well has dried up.\u201dStill, even as migrants abandon Izmir in search of alternative routes, the flow into Greece has not ended entirely. Smugglers have lowered their fares from $700 to $550 and continue to push Syrian refugees into undertaking the journey.Smugglers say it now takes them three days to load a boat with 35 to 40 passengers, whereas before they had trouble finding enough boats to accommodate the legions of migrants.The courtyard of a mosque across from the square here used to be packed with migrants waiting to depart for Greece. On this day only one Syrian woman stood there, with her three young brothers, trying to decide whether to chance the passage.\u201cWe tried to leave twice, but we were stopped, detained and then released again,\u201d said Abir Mustafa, 26, the Syrian woman outside the mosque. \u201cWe will try again today. My husband is in Greece, and Syrians are not being sent back.\u201dThat is only partly true. But it has become a talking point for smugglers, who are trying to capitalize on the indisputable fact that most of the first to be deported from Greece have largely been Pakistanis and Afghans. But like the others, Syrians, too, face deportation, unless they can prove they are not economic migrants.After being informed that Syrians were also being processed for deportation, Ms. Mustafa broke down in tears and asked for advice. Just then, a smuggler approached her and called out in Arabic, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dShe hesitated, taking one step forward and then one step back, as the three children clenching bags of food looked up at her for direction.\u201cAre Syrians being sent back?\u201d she asked the smuggler.\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just Afghans at the moment,\u201d he said, urging her to hurry up.She grabbed her suitcase again as if to leave, her face riddled with anxiety. Frustrated by her indecisiveness, the smuggler walked away.\u201cI still want to go. What\u2019s the worst that can happen? They\u2019ll send me back to a refugee camp,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s O.K. I\u2019ve been waiting for a container in a Turkish camp for over two years.\u201dKaram Shoumali contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Meets With Pope Francis", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Supported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 For a while, Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s Roman holiday seemed less than it was cracked up to be.Immediately after his campaign announced that he would leave the United States for a \u201chigh-level meeting\u201d at the Vatican, questions arose about the wisdom of the trip. The critical New York primary was just days away. One official of the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which hosted the conference Mr. Sanders would attend, even suggested he had fished for the invitation.Most critically, there seemed to be little chance that Mr. Sanders would meet the Vatican resident whose name he frequently invokes. Pope Francis, it turned out, would not be visiting the conference of the academy, an in-house think tank of the Vatican.Politically, a trip to Rome without a meeting with Francis would have been a blunder, Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Fordham University who is teaching at Yale, had said on Friday. \u201cThe point is to make sure you are going to get an audience with the pope,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything short of an actual visit will probably be a mistake.\u201dMr. Sanders continued to hold out hope. \u201cI certainly would be delighted and proud if I had the opportunity to meet with him,\u201d he said before leaving New York.13 Photos\u201cSo it won\u2019t be difficult to find the pope,\u201d the bishop said last week, seeming to hint at something.On Thursday, the day before the conference, a Vatican spokesman appeared to end all speculation, saying, \u201cThere won\u2019t be a meeting with the Holy Father.\u201dBishop S\u00e1nchez Sorondo dismissed the statement as \u201cRoman gossip.\u201dBut final word, it seemed, came Friday afternoon in the form of a handwritten letter from the pope apologizing to conference attendees for his absence.\u201cI will keep them all in my prayers and good wishes, and send them my heartfelt thanks for their participation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMay the Lord bless you. Fraternally, Franciscus.\u201dAround 5:30 p.m. Friday, the conference\u2019s business ended and Mr. Sanders made an appointment for dinner at the Casa Santa Marta with his foreign policy adviser, Jeffrey D. Sachs, the economist and a fellow conference participant.Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, sat with Mr. Sachs and his wife, Sonia, for a soup and buffet dinner, where they were joined by Bishop S\u00e1nchez Sorondo and Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga of Honduras, the pope\u2019s right-hand man and one of the Vatican\u2019s top power players.\u201cIt was a wide-ranging conversation,\u201d Mr. Sachs said. \u201cIt was about issues of the church and its history, about Honduras and foreign policy.\u201dAhead of the state\u2019s April 19 primary, three presidential candidates have been working to highlight their New York-iness to voters. We had Matt Flegenheimer, a Times campaign reporter, assess their attributes.But the most important words occurred in the middle of dinner, when a personal secretary for Francis arrived with the news Mr. Sanders had been hoping for, Mr. Sachs said.If Mr. Sanders were in the foyer of the Casa Santa Marta at 6 a.m. the next day, he would be able to speak briefly with Francis as the pope headed to the airport for his Saturday trip to Greece, where the pope would be addressing the migrant crisis.So early Saturday morning, Mr. Sanders stood in the marble foyer, which looks out onto a large cobblestone drive just inside the Vatican walls. Joining him were his wife, Mr. Sachs and his wife and Bishop S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, the senator\u2019s de facto Vatican fixer.The pope, speaking to reporters on his plane later in the day, described the meeting. \u201cThis morning when I was leaving, Senator Sanders was there,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHe knew I was leaving at that time, and he had the courtesy to greet me.\u201dNo photos of the encounter were permitted, but Mr. Sachs said the senator was delighted all the same. He was beaming as he left the guesthouse, and celebrated the informal audience with a victory lap of sorts in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica along with Mr. Sachs and the bishop, passing Bernini\u2019s Baldacchino, a monumental bronze canopy over the papal altar, and Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0.Aware that his every statement is parsed for deeper meaning, Francis said he was simply being polite, not political.\u201cI shook his hand and nothing more,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone thinks that greeting someone means getting involved in politics,\u201d he added, laughing, \u201cI recommend that he find a psychiatrist!\u201dBut the candidate was excited to talk about his coveted souvenir.\u201cI conveyed to him my great admiration for the extraordinary work that he is doing all over the world in demanding that morality be part of our economy,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters aboard the plane as it rushed him back to the campaign in New York.Jim Yardley contributed reporting from Mytilene, Greece.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s Path to the Future Is Shrouded in Secrecy", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byEditorialCuba\u2019s ruling Communist Party is expected to announce a series of economic and political reforms next week that it hopes to put in place as the country prepares for the end of the Castros\u2019 rule in 2018.The proposals will be announced at the party\u2019s seventh conference, which starts on Sunday. But their content and scope remain a mystery to all but a few senior leaders of the party. While the policy review that preceded the last party conference, in 2011, included broad debate by rank-and-file party members, this time top officials have not shared information with them or solicited their views.This surreptitious approach is shortsighted at a time of change and rising discontent. Ordinary Cubans, including those who are critical of the Communist Party, should have a say in how the country will be run and by whom, without fear of reprisal and persecution.For many Cubans, the island\u2019s languishing economy is the most pressing issue. In 2011, party leaders promised to overhaul the centrally planned economy, but they have moved too slowly in opening up the country to foreign investment and allowing a private sector to take root. The main obstacle has been the Cuban military, which has long exercised monopoly control over large segments of the economy, creating an oligarchy in uniform that is reluctant to spread the wealth.\u201cIf the state monopoly is not dismantled, nothing they do will work,\u201d Pavel Vidal, a prominent Cuban economist who is now based in Colombia, said in an interview. \u201cCuba\u2019s greatest asset is a well-educated population, but it must do more to reap the benefits of that.\u201dThe type of transformative changes many Cubans yearn for will require a visionary leader. But it remains unclear who will lead the country when Ra\u00fal Castro \u2014 who became president after his brother Fidel became ill in 2008 \u2014 steps down in 2018. Also uncertain is whether ordinary Cubans will have a say in the new government.The probable successor, Vice President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, has offered few clues about how he would govern. His relatively low profile has led to speculation that he would be a far less powerful president than either of the Castro brothers. Cuba analysts think it is likely that Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s son, Alejandro Castro, who was the main contact in secret talks with the Obama administration that led to normalization of relations with the United States, will continue to wield considerable power behind the scenes.\u201cIf they embrace true economic reforms and start a process that improves the situation of civil and political rights, many Cubans would be willing to forget the harm they have caused to date and the historical judgment will be much less severe,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, the largest dissident group on the island, said in an email.If reforms continue at a glacial pace, young Cubans will keep fleeing the island in droves, fueling a exodus that has become a referendum of sorts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Warns Britain on Trade if It Leaves European Union", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 President Obama on Friday bluntly urged Britain to vote to remain inside the European Union in a referendum scheduled for June 23, and warned that a Britain outside the bloc could not count on maintaining its current economic relationship with the United States.Taking an unusually direct position on another country\u2019s internal politics, Mr. Obama asserted that Britain\u2019s membership in the bloc did not limit British influence but \u201cmagnifies it.\u201dSpeaking alongside Prime Minister David Cameron at a news conference, he also directly addressed the potential consequences of a vote by Britain to leave. The president said that to do so would send Britain to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for a trade deal with the United States, challenging those who have argued that Britain could quickly replicate the same favorable terms it enjoys as a European Union member.Mr. Cameron is leading the campaign to remain part of Europe, but the issue has deeply divided his Conservative Party and polls suggest that the outcome could be close, making the forcefulness of Mr. Obama\u2019s statements especially striking.Mr. Obama was stating his view of American national interests, while also clearly trying to support Mr. Cameron. But the arguments here are fierce and increasingly bitter, and Mr. Obama was attacked as a hypocrite and worse by those who favor a British exit, or Brexit.Mr. Obama defended the right of a close friend to give an opinion on a matter of mutual interest. \u201cPart of being friends is being honest, and, speaking honestly, the outcome of that referendum is a matter of deep interest to the United States, because it affects our interests as well,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama sidestepped a question on whether the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Washington and London would be damaged if Britain voted to leave the European Union.Mr. Obama said he saw another bust of Churchill every day in the White House residence.\u201cI love the guy,\u201d he said. But as the first African-American president, he said, he \u201cthought it appropriate\u201d to have a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Oval Office.Mr. Cameron, for his part, smiled thinly and said that \u201cquestions for Boris are questions for Boris and not questions for me.\u201dThe prime minister praised Mr. Obama for his friendship and \u201csage advice,\u201d and said that Britain was made stronger through its continued membership in the European Union and that \u201cthe stronger we are, the stronger that special relationship\u201d with the United States will be. Mr. Cameron noted that \u201cit was hard to find any country that wishes Britain well that wants us to leave the E.U.,\u201d and that Britons should listen to their friends and then vote as they choose.Strong historical, emotional, cultural and security ties with Britain would continue no matter the vote, Mr. Obama said. But the United States, he said, was convinced that Britain made a shaky Europe stronger and more stable by its membership and that the bloc \u201cenhances\u201d Britain\u2019s \u201cinfluence and power and economy.\u201dHe argued that the United States accepted constraints on its sovereignty, too, in multilateral institutions like NATO, the United Nations Security Council, the Group of 7 and Group of 20, and did so for the common good, which also was in America\u2019s interests.Earlier on Friday, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, traveled by helicopter to Windsor Castle for lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, who turned 90 on Thursday, and her husband, Prince Philip, 94.The Obamas also had a private dinner Friday night with Prince William and his wife, Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry at Kensington Palace in London.The president\u2019s decision to wade into the issue during his two-day visit prompted objections from many supporters of the campaign to leave the European Union. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, said that Mr. Obama should \u201cbutt out.\u201dOne of the most polarizing responses came from Mr. Johnson, who was born in Manhattan and retains his American passport as a dual citizen. Mr. Johnson, who is also a member of Parliament and has ambitions to replace Mr. Cameron as prime minister, has argued that the United States is a traditional nation-state that would never transfer some of its sovereignty to any European Union-like organization.\u201cIt is incoherent. It is inconsistent, and yes it is downright hypocritical,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.On Twitter, Nicholas Soames, a Conservative member of Parliament and a grandson of Churchill, condemned Mr. Johnson\u2019s essay, calling it \u201can appalling article\u201d that is \u201ctotally wrong on almost everything.\u201d It was \u201cinconceivable,\u201d Mr. Soames said, that his grandfather would \u201cnot have welcomed\u201d the president\u2019s views on Britain\u2019s role in Europe.A former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Menzies Campbell, said that \u201cmany people will find Boris Johnson\u2019s loaded attack on President Obama\u2019s sincerity deeply offensive,\u201d and Diane Abbott, a Labour Party lawmaker, said that \u201cBoris dismissing President Obama as \u2018half-Kenyan\u2019 reflects the worst Tea Party rhetoric.\u201dAmerican officials suggested that there was an internal debate about the wisdom of the straightforward opinion editorial Mr. Obama wrote in The Telegraph, but decided that it was better to be upfront about the president\u2019s views as he arrived in Britain and not pretend to be coy.Mr. Cameron clearly favored a strong message from the American president, whose position is shared by the leaders of Britain\u2019s main European allies, France and Germany.Britain and France are the two strongest military powers in Europe, and Britain is the second-largest economy in the European Union and fifth largest in the world.The economic risks of Britain\u2019s exit from the union are important to British voters, but so are immigration and the inability of Britain to limit the number of European Union citizens who want to live and work here. While studies show that the immigrants contribute considerably more to the British budget in taxes than they receive in benefits, there are worries that the immigrants are taking jobs away from Britons.These arguments are likely to be more important than those about Britain\u2019s standing in the world or the country\u2019s relationship with the United States.Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TV as New York Growth Industry: \u2018Quantico\u2019 Is Coming to Town", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byJust as he was hitting his stride as a television writer in 2002, Joshua Safran had to move to Los Angeles to work on a network show that was all about his hometown, New York City. Now, he is moving a different hit show with a New York theme to New York.Mr. Safran, the executive producer of \u201cQuantico\u201d on ABC, said the show\u2019s relocation for its second season was the latest evidence that Hollywood is no longer the irresistible magnet it had long been for the entertainment industry\u2019s talent. New York is playing an increasingly important role as a home base for television shows at a time when the demand for video content is soaring.\u201cThere\u2019s a resurgence here,\u201d Mr. Safran said from his office in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. \u201cMore production brings more jobs, brings more money, brings more happiness.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Friday that \u201cQuantico,\u201d which had been written and produced in Brooklyn but shot on location in Montreal, will cross the border and bring more than 200 jobs with it. When it begins filming in New York in July, \u201cQuantico\u201d will be able to take full advantage of the tax credit that the state offers to film and TV productions.\u201cNew York State knows no creative bounds, and provides an unrivaled opportunity to work with the very best in the industry,\u201d he said.Mr. Safran said the credit of up to 30 percent of many of the costs incurred in production, including salaries paid to crew members, was not the deciding factor in the decision to relocate. The reason was largely creative. But he said the move would help to offset the higher cost of shooting in New York.Officials said 46 episodic shows were now being produced in the city, up from 29 just over a year ago. But they are not all on traditional networks. Shows in the Marvel Defenders series that can be viewed on Netflix are being produced in Brooklyn. The Netflix sitcom \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d and Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d series, which won a Golden Globe, are also filmed in the city.Julie Menin, commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, said the growth of TV production in the city had been \u201cexplosive\u201d and had created thousands of high-paying jobs that support small businesses.As an example, she cited Caf\u00e9 Grumpy, a coffeehouse across the street from the Broadway Stages studios in Greenpoint, which has added five locations. Ms. Menin, in her second month as commissioner, said she had been encouraging producers to shoot in more locations in boroughs other than Manhattan and to patronize local businesses when they do.\u201cYou can actually be a person who works in the film community in New York and not have to take a waiting job,\u201d said Tim Nolan, a partner at the consulting firm, who oversaw the study. \u201cThat\u2019s different today than it was 16 years ago.\u201dMr. Nolan said he had no doubt that the state tax credit paid for itself in jobs and spending. But some economic analysts would disagree.Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, co-wrote a report in 2013 that concluded the credit amounted to an overly generous subsidy to entertainment producers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify distorting a tax system so that it favors one industry over another,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re not getting when you do that.\u201dWhether or not the tax credit is good policy, there is no dispute about its popularity. Since Mr. Cuomo became governor, the state has received nearly 1,200 applications for credits for production and postproduction spending. (Postproduction includes the editing and scoring of a film or video after it is recorded.) The state projects that the applications will yield almost $2.8 billion in credits.The credit for postproduction costs had been just 10 percent, but in 2012, it was raised to match the production credit of 30 percent. For postproduction work done upstate, the credit is higher, at 35 percent.The credits are intended to apply only to local spending and wages. They exclude the salaries of many of the highest paid members of a production team, including actors, directors and writers.\u201cThe program\u2019s consistent growth has brought substantial benefits to local economies in both spending and employment,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cGiven the impact it is having, I am proud to be part of the industry\u2019s resurgence in New York.\u201dDefending the wisdom of the credits, state and city officials point to the expansion of the city\u2019s studios. Steiner Studios has added to its presence in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Silvercup Studios said last summer that it would build a new studio in the Bronx, and Broadway Stages said it would add a location on Staten Island.\u201cWe want neighborhoods that have not seen a lot of production to benefit economically from this industry as well,\u201d Ms. Menin said.She added that Warner Brothers spent $45 million filming the movie \u201cThe Intern\u201d across 17 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and that she would encourage other production companies to follow a less-beaten path.Ms. Menin also noted the shift from the days when companies saved money by shooting films and shows in other cities even though they were set in New York. These days, she said, several shows, including \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d and \u201cThe Americans\u201d are being produced in New York even though they are set elsewhere.When it came to the second season of \u201cQuantico,\u201d Mr. Safran said, he did not want to take that tack. The first season depicted a group of fledgling agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with sites in Montreal passing for Virginia.But the next set of episodes will focus much more on New York, and Mr. Safran, who grew up in Manhattan and attended film school at New York University, said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to fake New York.\u201dHe recalled that when he was hired as a writer and consulting producer on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d \u2014 a show about Manhattan society \u2014 he had to relocate to Los Angeles, where the producers were based. Now, he said, he would not leave New York again.He said the pilot for \u201cQuantico\u201d revolved around a terrorist attack at Grand Central Terminal. \u201cIn Season 1, we sort of destroyed New York locations,\u201d he said. \u201cSeason 2 is going to be very much more a New York story.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a studio in Greenpoint. It is Broadway Stages, not Brooklyn Stages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is This Thing Called Populism?", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byThe ConversationWhile we\u2019re waiting for our Cheesehead friends to have their say, I wonder if we can back up a little and think about the broader phenomenon of populism in American politics. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s broadly driving both Trumpism and Sandersism. What do you think?The result is almost always an uptick in political populism, either right wing (\u201cRaise the drawbridge\u201d) or left wing (\u201cOff with their heads\u201d) or both. Now, these forces aren\u2019t necessarily overwhelming: Trump and Sanders are getting roughly equal portions of their parties\u2019 total primary votes, and neither is getting a majority. But it certainly does torque the political system for a while.If you\u2019re someone who feels comfortable in a multicultural world, it\u2019s easy to underestimate the sense of displacement some people feel. I was watching a very old movie the other night and I suddenly noticed \u2014 wow, everybody\u2019s a white guy. The girlfriend made several appearances and some black prisoners sang a spiritual through the window, but otherwise, white guys from screen to shining screen running every single aspect of the day-to-day world. I don\u2019t mean to say there aren\u2019t other things at work, but I think this post-Tea Party rebellion is fueled by resentment of the Obama presidency, followed by Trump\u2019s campaign against immigrants.Another area of similarity is the revulsion for the so-called elites. Is the talk of \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cthe establishment\u201d just a fad? Or is there some permanent change afoot?One very simple answer would be to increase the taxes on the top income earners and use the money to create new, good-paying jobs in bridge and road construction. What say you?But my point is not anti-stimulus per se. It\u2019s that certain kinds of stimulus work better than others. Trying to create jobs in construction that way didn\u2019t work well for the administration because it assumed there were thousands of people ready to work on roads. In general, people with trade skills (who are in relatively short supply) weren\u2019t all sitting around \u2014 so the stimulus created bottlenecks in infrastructure and drove up wages for previously employed people. This mismatch between skills and needs is a key problem.But anyway, you were saying?I\u2019ll make you a deal. I\u2019ll be very open to more efficient ways of using government money for needed projects. In return, are you O.K. with getting the funds by raising taxes on the rich?Personally, I think entitlement reform is the only way we release significant revenue while protecting national solvency and reinvigorating the economy. If we paired it with real tax reform that broadened the base instead of just spiking marginal rates, we could set ourselves up for two decades of strong growth.Raising the age at which people qualify for the benefits, a favorite conservative solution, is a terrible idea. The people who need Social Security most are more and more likely to be the same people who are forced to retire at an early age.A bigger and harder problem is Medicare, which without changes will eat all our lunches in the coming decades. But all this leads me to shake my head over the fact that entitlements, which are a huge and looming problem no matter what your politics, are not even part of the political conversation right now.After Wisconsin, you New Yorkers finally get your turn, right?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss City Is \u2018the Silicon Valley of Sports\u2019", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byLAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 The Olympic rings decorate everything here, from the train station to the police uniforms, flaunting this city\u2019s identity as the capital of international sports.Their world has been largely independent \u2014 lightly taxed, exempt from Swiss anticorruption laws and boasting its own arbitration court, based in a chateau here. It also generates serious money: Sports organizations bring more than a billion dollars to Switzerland annually, according to a six-year study published in 2015.Lausanne and the Swiss canton, or state, of Vaud are actively recruiting federations to move here \u2014 offering to pay their rent for two years, to help employees house-hunt and to coordinate visa applications \u2014 having committed to filling a new office building by 2018.\u201cWe\u2019re the Silicon Valley of sports,\u201d said Sabrina Attias, delegate for international sport for the city of Lausanne. \u201cFor a long time, we didn\u2019t have to do anything to attract them. Then we realized the opportunities and decided to be proactive.\u201dTen years ago, the city, together with the state and the I.O.C., built an office complex called the Maison du Sport International, a sort of corporate Olympic Village that houses dozens of governing bodies \u2014 archery, boxing and weight lifting share a building \u2014 as well as other important organizations, like the World Anti-Doping Agency.The venture has been so successful, with a waiting list for office space, that a four-story fourth building is under construction. With two years until it opens, the government has promised developers that it will fill 80 percent of the new offices, causing city workers like Ms. Attias to hustle to woo more tenants.\u201cIt\u2019s a risk, but we\u2019re going to succeed,\u201d she said, pointing proudly to the complex\u2019s amenities: colorful common areas evoking Google\u2019s headquarters; a gym and adjacent soccer fields and tennis courts; and a carnotzet, or traditional Swiss-French wine cellar with the air of a speakeasy.Officials are confident that a new law criminalizing bribery and corruption in sports federations, which were previously immune from investigation unless they requested it, will not dull the appeal of Switzerland once it takes effect in July.Beyond the magnetism of the I.O.C., sports organizations have long been attracted to Switzerland for its political neutrality, geographic centrality, favorable tax structure and friendliness to private arbitration, said Lucien W. Valloni, a sports lawyer in Zurich.But Lausanne and the canton government have sweetened the pot with more incentives yet: Any federation that relocates to the city, as a tenant in the Maison du Sport or elsewhere, receives two years of free rent, permanent exemption from taxes and help from Ms. Attias and her team with tasks like finding places for employees to live and securing permits to work in Switzerland.Some organizations have followed the path of the Sailing Federation, which in 2014 opened an office in Lausanne while maintaining its headquarters in Southampton, England. Others, like the International Basketball Federation, moved to the region from other parts of Switzerland.Lausanne, now a city of roughly 140,000 people, has seen its population grow along the way, by about 10 percent in the last decade.More than a dozen other federations, including cash-flush FIFA, have their headquarters elsewhere in the country, making for roughly 65 sports organizations in Switzerland.The organizations are particularly beneficial to the Swiss economy, Mr. Stricker said, because they make the vast majority of their revenue outside Switzerland while spending a significant amount within the country and inspiring further spending. For every Swiss franc a sports organization spends in Switzerland, Mr. Stricker\u2019s study found, the local economy sees an impact of 1.55 francs.But recognizing that the number of federations to recruit is not limitless, the Swiss have also set their sights on regional associations \u2014 European sports confederations, for instance \u2014 and other sports associations or businesses, like the International World Games Association, which opened an office last year.Even after successfully attracting organizations to the region, the government is increasingly focused on making sure they stay. Ms. Attias invoked a roster of events: seminars, ballet outings, ski trips in the Alps and an annual dinner for top sports federation officials and Swiss government officials, including the country\u2019s president, to socialize.Roland Rino B\u00fcchel, a member of the Swiss Parliament who spearheaded the recent legislation in Switzerland, called such coziness dangerous. \u201cCan you imagine if the same police raid that happened at FIFA happened at the I.O.C.?\u201d he said. \u201cA policeman with the I.O.C. logo on his sleeve has to search the I.O.C.\u201dMr. B\u00fcchel said that before the new law passed, he feared that sports organizations could damage the reputation of Switzerland. \u201cPeople think of FIFA on the same level as the banks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut come July, this nice life will be over for federations.\u201dSwitzerland has also newly classified sports officials as so-called politically exposed persons, recognizing them as prominent public figures at greater risk for bribery and corruption. That new standing subjects sports officials and their friends and relatives to financial scrutiny and corruption investigations.Even in the face of such new measures, Mr. Valloni, the Swiss lawyer, said he thought it impossible for sports associations to operate so flexibly elsewhere. \u201cSwiss law is very, very liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other place that would be so favorable.\u201dIf such a place did exist, Mr. B\u00fcchel said, \u201cGood luck to the country that says to the sports federations: \u2018Leave Switzerland because you can\u2019t be corrupt there anymore.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

They say that leaving the European Union is the only way to curb immigration.The assessment from the I.M.F. gave Mr. Cameron an avenue to return the focus to an issue that he wants to make central to the referendum.The statement was supported by Mr. Cameron and by the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who described the report as the \u201cclearest independent warning of the taste of bad things to come.\u201dCampaigners for withdrawal are also angry about the government\u2019s distribution, at a cost of 9 million pounds, or about $12.8 million, of a pamphlet to every household arguing that a vote to leave \u201cwould create years of uncertainty and potential economic disruption.\u201dImmigration is among the leading issues for those who oppose membership in the bloc. European Union citizens have a right to live and work in other member nations, and the report released on Wednesday from the Migration Observatory at Oxford University reflected those concerns.Backers of the effort to leave the bloc have said that the growing number of migrants is straining Britain\u2019s resources.The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, is scheduled to deliver a speech on Europe on Thursday and is expected to call for Britain to remain in the bloc.

{"Headline": "Selling Luxury in Iran", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byBypassed for decades by the luxury industry, Iran and its explosive market growth potential have recaptured the attention of global luxury heavyweights in the last 12 months.After more than 30 years of isolation and austerity, the country re-entered the global economy when economic sanctions were lifted in January, something Morgan Stanley described as the biggest thing for the global economy since the fall of the Berlin Wall.Now, with an educated, surging middle-income population of almost 80 million \u2014 many of whom possess a budding appetite for high-end consumer goods and mobile phones \u2014 Western brands are sizing up the opportunities, and risks, of setting up shop in Iran.\u201cIran as a prospect had interested us for some time, but once the sanctions went, we accelerated the process of setting up our boutique inside its borders,\u201d said Renato Semerari, chief executive of Roberto Cavalli, the first sizable luxury brand to enter the market with the opening in February of its two-story boutique in Tehran\u2019s upmarket neighborhood of Zafaraniye.Branded cosmetics, with their accessible price points, are often perceived as gateway products to luxury spending. So news that Sephora, the LVMH-owned cosmetics chain, was widely expected to open seven stores later this year hardly raised eyebrows.Yet expansion into Iran is not without its challenges. For a sector obsessed with controlling brand image, the country\u2019s lack of infrastructure, from trained staff to a shortage of quality real estate, remains the biggest obstacle. Only a handful of premium shopping malls exist, although there are plans to build more in the next two to three years.Tourism also is limited \u2014 vacation spending being a key sales contributor for most brands \u2014 and Iran\u2019s political relationships with the West, while thawing, still remain complex, to say the least. As a result, Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a senior partner at Bain based in Milan, said the country was more suited to some labels than others.\u201cI think we will see some more mid-sized Italian players go in next, especially men\u2019s wear groups like Zegna or Brioni, as well as watch and jewelry brands, as a taste for the latter tends to develop very rapidly in emerging markets,\u201d she said. Historically, the larger clothing and accessories houses have been cautious about finding the right local distributors and partners, so it is likely they will take longer to establish a presence, she added.Despite the recent flush of enthusiasm, plenty of Western luxury-branded products have been making their way into the country for some time. When the banking sanctions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program were in place, investment coming and going from the country was essentially blocked, making it very difficult for foreign companies to get their profits out. But local third-party businesses always have imported goods into Iran by nonofficial channels, selling them at sky-high markups either in independent boutiques or in private sales behind closed doors.Now, with more Iranians online, learning about Western luxury brands and hungry for reasonably priced goods, entrepreneurs both at home and abroad are racing to fill the vacuum.Milad Monshipour and Hooman Damirchi are two Iranian entrepreneurs who have spent much of their professional lives working overseas before returning home to look at consumer- focused opportunities. Their luxury e-commerce site Madeleine Moda, which they say they hope to be Iran\u2019s version of Net-a-Porter, is expected to begin business soon.\u201cWhen we conducted market research among Iranian luxury goods consumers, we found that over 60 percent of our respondents said accessing the clothing and shoes they wanted continued to be very difficult due to supply limitations,\u201d said Mr. Monshipour, formerly a consultant at the Boston Consulting Group who holds an M.B.A. from HEC Paris. \u201cThey know what they want, they just struggle to get it.\u201cThe tech-savvy consumer here is just as hungry for immediate gratification as their Western counterparts,\u201d he noted.Almost all Iranians have debit cards, and online players like Digikala (an Amazon-style consumer goods website) and e-Sam (an Iranian equivalent of eBay) have made millions of Iranians comfortable with shopping online. So Mr. Damirchi is as bullish as his partner about their short-term, online-focused venture, as well as the longer-term growth potential of large Western brands to establish bricks-and-mortar presences.\u201cThis is a country where for thousands of years a sizable portion of the population has had a culture around and deep appreciation of design, art and fine things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe winners and losers today will be those who define the notion of luxury, and know how to really appeal to the 21st century consumer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Southern Cities Split With States on Social Issues", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byJACKSON, Miss. \u2014 It was not that long ago that Victoria Fortenberry figured she would mark her 18th birthday by getting on a bus and getting out of Mississippi. But here she was, blue-haired, tattooed and 19 years old, singing at a party for a new line of craft beer to a crowd that included her girlfriend.Ms. Fortenberry came here to attend a Christian college and found a place where she could be unashamedly Southern and openly gay in a way not possible in her conservative suburban hometown, or even in the Jackson of a decade ago. And so: \u201cAt some point,\u201d she said, \u201cI decided I won\u2019t just leave.\u201dJackson may not register nationally as an outpost of bohemianism or urbane liberalism. But its city government, which is majority black and Democratic, refuses to fly the Confederate-themed state flag at municipal buildings, and this month voted unanimously to oppose a new state law that creates special legal protections for opponents of same-sex marriage. And it has a place for blue-haired singers \u2014 and their girlfriends.Jackson is among a group of Southern cities from Dallas to Durham, N.C., where the digital commons, economic growth and a rising cohort of millennials have helped remake the culture. Many of these cities have found themselves increasingly at odds with their states, and here in a region that remains the most conservative in the country, the conflicts are growing more frequent and particularly pitched.The potential consequences of these boycotts point up the complications, though: In a South dominated by the politics of rural and suburban conservatives, a canceled rock concert or technology project is likely to punish the places that oppose the legislation, and have little effect on the areas that support it.\u201cWe\u2019ve got this divide,\u201d said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cThe divide between the cultural conservatism of older suburbs and older rural areas, and these new, thriving, modern economy, diverse cities.\u201dThe skirmishes over gay rights are only part of the growing rift between Southern cities, with their mostly Democratic municipal governments, and Southern state legislatures, which have come to be dominated by Republicans.Lawmakers in Alabama recently blocked cities from setting their own minimum wages, while Charlotte and Jackson have fought with the states over control of their airports. North Carolina\u2019s Republican legislature has redrawn city council districts and tried to stop municipalities from becoming \u201csanctuary cities\u201d for immigrants. The Arkansas and Tennessee legislatures have passed laws that, like North Carolina\u2019s, ban local anti-discrimination ordinances that differ from state law.This version of a civil war even extends to the Civil War. Alabama is considering a law that would prevent local jurisdictions from removing Confederate symbols without state approval. Similar efforts were proposed but have so far failed in Virginia and Louisiana.But Southern cities have pushed back with vigor. Birmingham tried to go forward with a minimum wage law even after the state made it clear it would be overruled. Several cities in Arkansas passed anti-discrimination ordinances despite the state law that was meant to ban them. Across Mississippi, cities, counties and public institutions have responded to the Legislature\u2019s unwillingness to take the Confederate battle cross out of the state flag by refusing to fly the flag altogether.For decades, the cultural gap between Southern cities and cities on the East and West Coasts has been narrowing to the point where the cultural riches of a place like Oxford, Miss. \u2014 with its literary scene and high end regional cuisine \u2014 are almost taken for granted.But commerce and the Internet have pushed global sophistication into new frontiers. In Starkville, Miss., an unassuming college town that Oxford sophisticates deride with the ironic nickname \u201cStarkVegas,\u201d a coffee bar called Nine-twentynine serves an affogato prepared with espresso from Intelligentsia, the vaunted artisanal coffee brand.With these cultural markers have come expressions of unblushing liberalism that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. In January, Bernie Sanders drew thousands to a rally in Birmingham, Ala. Last June, after the Supreme Court affirmed the right to same-sex marriage, the city government in Knoxville, Tenn., lit up a bridge in rainbow colors.The result has been a kind of overlapping series of secessions, with states trying to safeguard themselves from national cultural trends and federal mandates, and cities increasingly trying to carve out their own places within the states.All of this exasperates conservative lawmakers like State Senator Bart Hester, an Arkansas Republican, who says he is constantly playing defense against a rapidly changing culture.\u201cTen years ago, no one would have ever imagined someone would have deserved protections under civil rights because they didn\u2019t know what gender they were,\u201d he said. His biggest frustrations, he continued, are dealing with municipalities, on everything from gay rights to taxes. \u201cIt just shocks me every day how different our opinions and basic core values are,\u201d he said.Mr. Guillory, at the University of North Carolina, noted that the companies fueling the booms are often national or global, and cannot afford to brook sentiments that even begin to smack of bigotry.\u201cIt isn\u2019t that these cities are elevating New Deal liberalism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more of a cultural political liberalism. It\u2019s a different kind of mixture.\u201dAt a rally on Wednesday at the Mississippi state Capitol, thousands came in on church buses from around the state to hear the Rev. Franklin Graham, the evangelist, inveigh against same-sex marriage and secularism.Greg Smith, 64, who had come to the rally from Tylertown, did not see any fundamental change in the fact that many Mississippians, even some Republican mayors, had come out against the new law. They just feared losing out on the almighty dollar, he said.\u201cI think the state\u2019s basically conservative, but we\u2019ve let money become our god,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Melvin Priester Jr., a member of the Jackson City Council, did not agree. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different world,\u201d he said, recalling how he returned home several years ago to find artists and musicians not all that different from friends in his adopted San Francisco. \u201cTechnology has ended the isolation.\u201dMr. Priester, who is black, also described how gay communities in Deep South cities have steadily gained allies among urban black leaders, many of whom had traditionally been skeptical of the gay rights movement.In Greensboro, N.C., Sharon Hightower, an African-American council member, joined in an 8-to-1 vote recently for a resolution condemning the state law limiting bathroom access.\u201cWe know what it\u2019s like to be discriminated against,\u201d she said.Still, many evangelical blacks remain hesitant to support the gamut of socially liberal causes. And indeed even some of the trendiest Southern cities have a strong traditionalist streak.The city of Chattanooga, a hub of tech activity, handily rejected an ordinance establishing domestic partner benefits in 2014; Houston voted three times for an openly gay mayor, and then last fall voted overwhelmingly against a broad anti-discrimination ordinance.But with liberals still outnumbered in most parts of the South, some worry that the boycotts and concert cancellations by opponents of certain state laws will end up doing the most economic harm to those who despise those laws.On Monday afternoon in Raleigh, Carla Merritt, a transgender woman who has felt happy and accepted in this city, watched as hundreds of evangelicals \u2014 whom she called \u201cthe real country folk\u201d \u2014 staged a boisterous rally on the Capitol lawn in favor of the new law that includes the provision limiting transgender bathroom access.Two days later, Ms. Merritt, over lunch at a downtown cafe, said she regretted using the words \u201ccountry folk.\u201d \u201cThat sounded bigoted,\u201d she said, \u201cand I certainly didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201dThat evening, the Currins were in front of the residence of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, directing protesters who were blowing air horns to object to the new law. The Currins called it their \u201cAir Horn Orchestra\u201d \u2014 a piercing clamor of defiance that doubled, they said, as a homage to the avant-garde composers they love.An article on Saturday about a split on social issues between urban and rural parts of the South misstated the number of times that Houston has elected an openly gay mayor. It is three times, not two.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s President Is Squeezed by Opposition Leader\u2019s Demand for a Trial", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 An opposition leader long under house arrest has written a letter to President Hassan Rouhani demanding a public trial, putting the president in a difficult spot and highlighting a deepening rift in Iran\u2019s reformist wing.In the letter, published Sunday on a foreign-based Persian-language website, Saham News, the opposition leader, Mehdi Karroubi, does not ask the president to grant him his release, \u201csince this is not in your power.\u201dYet even asking for a trial presents a problem for Mr. Rouhani, a moderate who in the past has promised to end house arrest for Mr. Karroubi and two other leaders of the so-called Green Movement, Mir Hussein Moussavi and his wife, Zahra Raghnavard. Either he grants Mr. Karroubi\u2019s request \u2014 risking confrontation with Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his hard-line supporters \u2014 or he denies it and looks weak.So Mr. Rouhani has chosen to ignore the letter and instead allow his infuriated supporters to respond to Mr. Karroubi.\u201cThis man is good for nothing,\u201d said one of those, Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst with close ties to the Rouhani government. \u201cHis words mean nothing. We, the mainstream reformists, do not want to distract public opinion from supporting President Rouhani.\u201dThe chilly reception, analysts say, reflects a divide in the reformist movement between the older-style reformists like Mr. Karroubi, who are willing to aggressively challenge the system, and the mainstream moderates now in ascendancy.The moderates want to concentrate on reviving Iran\u2019s moribund economy, which is the primary concern of average Iranians. They want to avoid political challenges to the hard-liners and Ayatollah Khamenei, believing that would open them to accusations of undermining the Islamic republic. They say they prefer to work within the system, biding their time until a new, possibly more liberal Parliament is sworn in this summer.Mr. Karroubi, 78, is a cleric who, during his career, occupied several top positions in the Islamic republic, including Parliament leader. He has been under house arrest since 2011 for supporting the Green Movement, which helped lead the widespread antigovernment protests that grew out of the 2009 presidential election, regarded by many Iranians as fixed.In his letter, Mr. Karroubi, who with Mr. Moussavi was a candidate for president in 2009, contended that Iran\u2019s Constitution provided that people charged with political offenses must be tried in open court.He was prepared, he said, to go to jail, writing, \u201cI emphasize that I will accept the sentence given in this trial with my soul and heart, and will welcome it forgoing the right for appeal.\u201dThat did little to mollify supporters of Mr. Rouhani, who won office in 2013 on a promise of reaching a deal with world powers over Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear activities, lifting Western economic sanctions and ending the country\u2019s isolation, but also of bringing Iranians more personal freedom.Mr. Rouhani has managed the first three but has made little or no progress in the personal freedoms sphere. That failure is becoming a political liability that reformists would rather not highlight with demands like Mr. Karroubi\u2019s.The three opposition leaders were once the face of the Green Movement, which was ultimately suppressed by the security forces, with hundreds of activists, journalists and politicians arrested and three people executed. They supported Mr. Rouhani in the 2013 elections and called upon Iranians to vote for the reformist-moderate coalition in the February parliamentary elections. Iranians supported the coalition in great numbers.In turn, Mr. Rouhani promised to bring an end to the house arrests, but lately has been silent on the matter. Many reformists, as a result, have narrowed their aspirations, giving up on politics and trying to do what they can to improve their lives.\u201cPriorities have changed,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist close to the reformist camp. \u201cFor now, everything is about making ends meet economically, and not about the house arrest. Also, generally, people have forgotten about the opposition leaders.\u201dWhile Mr. Rouhani is focused on reviving the economy, he still calls occasionally for more freedom, whether opening Iran\u2019s restricted Internet or granting greater rights to women. But these rhetorical flourishes are not followed up with concrete proposals.\u201cWe must allay worries from hard-liners and convince supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei that President Rouhani\u2019s government is in line with his thoughts and policies,\u201d Mr. Ghorbanpour said. \u201cOtherwise, we will face resistance.\u201dIn his letter, Mr. Karroubi also indirectly speaks out against the ayatollah for supporting the winner of the disputed 2009 election, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whom he called \u201ca trickster and a liar who was forced upon the nation and the country.\u201dSuch words lead only to alienation, said Hossein Ghayoumi, a cleric and self-described moderate reformist.Mr. Karroubi\u2019s letter raises several complaints, notably what he describes as the rampant corruption, mismanagement and blind political ambition in the establishment. In more veiled criticism of Mr. Rouhani, he portrays himself as a man who has spoken out, where others fear to. \u201cLet\u2019s not doubt that the delay and shortcoming of elites of today will cost dearly for the country and the people in the future,\u201d Mr. Karroubi concludes.Over the past decade Iran\u2019s reformist movement has morphed into an establishment faction, analysts say. Those favoring confrontation have been marginalized.All political choices have consequences, Ali Reza Behesti, a former aide to Mr. Moussavi, warned with carefully chosen words in the reformist Shargh newspaper on Tuesday.\u201cIf a movement stops listening to its supporters once it achieves power, it forgets its previous demands,\u201d said Mr. Behesti, who was himself imprisoned after the 2009 elections. \u201cIn fact, its leaders might end up diluting or even standing against those demands,\u201d he warned. \u201cThis is a pest that has infested most social movements.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Map for America", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byOpinionTHESE days, in the thick of the American presidential primaries, it\u2019s easy to see how the 50 states continue to drive the political system. But increasingly, that\u2019s all they drive \u2014 socially and economically, America is reorganizing itself around regional infrastructure lines and metropolitan clusters that ignore state and even national borders. The problem is, the political system hasn\u2019t caught up.America faces a two-part problem. It\u2019s no secret that the country has fallen behind on infrastructure spending. But it\u2019s not just a matter of how much is spent on catching up, but how and where it is spent. Advanced economies in Western Europe and Asia are reorienting themselves around robust urban clusters of advanced industry. Unfortunately, American policy making remains wedded to an antiquated political structure of 50 distinct states.To an extent, America is already headed toward a metropolis-first arrangement. The states aren\u2019t about to go away, but economically and socially, the country is drifting toward looser metropolitan and regional formations, anchored by the great cities and urban archipelagos that already lead global economic circuits.The Northeastern megalopolis, stretching from Boston to Washington, contains more than 50 million people and represents 20 percent of America\u2019s gross domestic product. Greater Los Angeles accounts for more than 10 percent of G.D.P. These city-states matter far more than most American states \u2014 and connectivity to these urban clusters determines Americans\u2019 long-term economic viability far more than which state they reside in.This reshuffling has profound economic consequences. America is increasingly divided not between red states and blue states, but between connected hubs and disconnected backwaters. Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution has pointed out that of America\u2019s 350 major metro areas, the cities with more than three million people have rebounded far better from the financial crisis. Meanwhile, smaller cities like Dayton, Ohio, already floundering, have been falling further behind, as have countless disconnected small towns across the country.The problem is that while the economic reality goes one way, the 50-state model means that federal and state resources are concentrated in a state capital \u2014 often a small, isolated city itself \u2014 and allocated with little sense of the larger whole. Not only does this keep back our largest cities, but smaller American cities are increasingly cut off from the national agenda, destined to become low-cost immigrant and retirement colonies, or simply to be abandoned.Congress was once a world leader in regional planning. The Louisiana Purchase, the Pacific Railroad Act (which financed railway expansion from Iowa to San Francisco with government bonds) and the Interstate System of highways are all examples of the federal government\u2019s thinking about economic development at continental scale. The Tennessee Valley Authority was an agent of post-Depression infrastructure renewal, job creation and industrial modernization cutting across six states.What is needed, in some ways, is a return to this more flexible, broader way of thinking. Already, efforts to coordinate metropolitan and regional planning and investment are underway, whether they are quasi-government entities like the Western High Speed Rail Alliance, which aims to link Phoenix, Denver and Salt Lake City with next-generation trains, or industry-driven groups like CG/LA Inc., which promotes public-private investment in a new national infrastructure blueprint. Ironically, even some states are warming to the idea: Regional cooperation and planning is a top item at the National Governors Association.These are the groups that are pushing America deeper into the global economy by rethinking how the national economy functions. But they have to go it alone, because Congress still thinks in terms of states. America needs a new map.We don\u2019t have to create these regions; they already exist, on two levels. First, there are now seven distinct super-regions, defined by common economics and demographics, like the Pacific Coast and the Great Lakes. Within these, in addition to America\u2019s main metro hubs, we find new urban archipelagos, including the Arizona Sun Corridor, from Phoenix to Tucson; the Front Range, from Salt Lake City to Denver to Albuquerque; the Cascadia belt, from Vancouver to Seattle; and the Piedmont Atlantic cluster, from Atlanta to Charlotte, N.C.Federal policy should refocus on helping these nascent archipelagos prosper, and helping others emerge, in places like Minneapolis and Memphis, collectively forming a lattice of productive metro-regions efficiently connected through better highways, railways and fiber-optic cables: a United City-States of America.Similar shifts can be found around the world. Despite millenniums of cultivated cultural and linguistic provinces, China is transcending its traditional internal boundaries to become an empire of 26 megacity clusters with populations of up to 100 million each, centered around hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing-Chengdu. Over time these clusters, whose borders fluctuate based on population and economic growth, will be the cores around which the central government allocates subsidies, designs supply chains and builds connections to the rest of the world.Western countries are following suit. As of 2015, Italy\u2019s most important political players are no longer its dozens of laconic provinces, but 14 \u201cMetropolitan Cities,\u201d like Rome, Turin, Milan and Florence, each of which has been legislatively merged with its surrounding municipalities into larger and more economically viable subregions.Britain is also in the midst of an internal reorganization, with the government of Prime Minister David Cameron driving investment toward a new corridor stretching from Leeds to Liverpool known as the \u201cNorthern Powerhouse\u201d that can become an additional economic anchor beyond London and Scotland.What would this approach look like in America? It would start by focusing not on state lines but on existing lines of infrastructure, supply chains and telecommunications, routes that stay remarkably true to the borders of the emergent super-regions, and are most robust within the new urban archipelagos.Connectivity isn\u2019t just about infrastructure; it\u2019s about strategy. It\u2019s not just about more roads, rail lines and telecommunications \u2014 as well as manufacturing plants and data centers \u2014 but where those are placed. Getting that right is critical to getting the most out of public investment. But too often, decisions about infrastructure investment are made at the state (or even county) level, and end at the state border.Consider the Gulf Coast arc from Houston to Tampa, an area growing on the back of the shale energy industry and agricultural exports. The ports of Corpus Christi and Tampa both received federal foreign trade zone status in the early 1980s and have been raising bridges and expanding terminals to prepare for larger ships coming through the Panama Canal \u2014 and their modernization also means accelerated export of food, oil and cars from America\u2019s heartland. Their fates are more intertwined than Tampa\u2019s is with Tallahassee or Corpus Christi\u2019s is with Austin, even though they\u2019re in the same state \u2014 and yet building out their infrastructure depends largely on the political whims of their respective state capitals. As a result, the region\u2019s ports have built redundant facilities rather than strengthening those best suited to capitalize on new economic connections.Nor is it just about federal policy. States need to work across borders, too. For example, instead of waging a 1980s Asian-style race to the bottom to attract low-wage auto jobs at Nissan, Honda or Toyota plants, Tennessee and Kentucky should join forces to become an advanced manufacturing hub for the global auto industry, with better cross-border infrastructure. They may end up with fewer plants, but they would be more competitive ones, especially if they could coordinate research and development through the states\u2019 public and private universities.Where possible, such planning should even jump over international borders. While Detroit\u2019s population has fallen below a million, the Detroit-Windsor region is the largest United States-Canada cross-border area, with nearly six million people (and one of the largest border populations in the world). Both sides are deeply interdependent because of their automobile and steel industries and would benefit from scaling together rather than bickering over who pays for a new bridge between them. Detroit\u2019s destiny seems almost obvious if we are brave enough to build it: a midpoint of the Chicago-Toronto corridor in an emerging North American Union.TO make these things happen requires thinking beyond states. Washington currently provides minimal support for regional economic efforts and strategies; it needs to go much further, even at the risk of upsetting established federal-state political balances. A national infrastructure bank, if it ever gets off the ground, should have as part of its charter an obligation to ignore state lines when weighing projects to support.Consider how parts of the Rust Belt could benefit from this approach. A Midwestern high-speed rail network that ran from Southern Illinois to Southern Michigan would not just link wealthy investment hubs like Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio; by tying in high-unemployment cities like Dayton, it would make it easier for workers to commute to where the jobs are.Such networks would just as easily help poor and rural areas, like Appalachia. Upgraded transportation corridors between New York, Washington and Atlanta could finally lift Appalachia\u2019s isolated and stagnant towns stretching from New York to Alabama by facilitating investment in farms and vineyards, food processing and eco-tourism.States will continue to have an important political and regulatory function to fill. But the next president has to move beyond platitudes and implement a serious policy of leveraging new infrastructure investment from home and abroad and backing the shift toward a new urban political economy built around transportation engineering, alternative energy, digital technology and other advanced sectors.The 21st century will not be a competition over territory, but over connectivity \u2014 and only connecting American cities will enable the United States to win the tug of war over global trade volumes, investment flows and supply chains. More than America\u2019s military grand strategy, such an economic master plan would determine if America remained the world\u2019s leading superpower.An earlier version of this article said that Congress provided support for the construction of the Erie Canal. Rather, the canal was funded by New York State.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Graft Cases in Chile Multiply, a \u2018Gag Law\u2019 Angers Journalists", "Date": "2016-04-07", "News": "Supported byThe revelations, reported by an emboldened news media and fueled by the leaking of names and documents, prompted the Senate this week to approve a bill that would, among other things, punish anyone who makes public information about current judicial investigations, with up to 541 days in prison.Journalists are calling it a \u201cgag law\u201d that would restrict the public\u2019s freedom of information at a time when the country\u2019s ruling elite are being shamed.\u201cWhy was this never discussed before, when reporters got hold of legal files related to other types of criminals?\u201d said Javiera Olivares, the president of the Journalists Association in Chile. \u201cThese people\u2019s rights are also affected, but this law is approved when it is the powerful who are under scrutiny.\u201dThis led to related inquiries into the mining giant SQM, which controls most of Chile\u2019s lithium production. SQM was privatized during the rule of Augusto Pinochet, whose dictatorship of Chile lasted from 1973 to 1990, and sold to the dictator\u2019s former son-in-law, Julio Ponce Lerou, who has run the company ever since. Investigators found that for years SQM has financed the campaigns of presidential candidates from parties across the political spectrum, including most in the center-left New Majority coalition now in power.So far, Mr. Ponce, the SQM chief, has avoided prosecution. But leaked emails from 2010 between a former SQM general manager, Patricio Contesse, and Pablo Longueira, then a senator for the U.D.I. Party, show them discussing changes to a mining royalty bill, and how Mr. Contesse drafted modifications that benefited the company that were later introduced by Mr. Longueira. The law was passed when Mr. Longueira was minister of economy.Mr. Longueira resigned from his party last month, denying wrongdoing and complaining that the news media had already condemned him without a trial. He and Mr. Contesse are expected to be charged with bribery on June 1, prosecutors said.There are also inquiries into the misuse of public funds by the military, collusion by major paper producers and tax fraud and money laundering involving the former leader of Chile\u2019s soccer federation, Sergio Jadue, who is now cooperating with American officials in the FIFA corruption scandal.Also under investigation is a former congresswoman, Marta Isasi, who is accused of receiving more than 27 million pesos in 2009 from one of Chile\u2019s largest fishing companies, Corpesca, as Congress debated new fishing legislation.\u201cThe depth of corruption is enormous,\u201d said Carlos Huneeus, a law professor at the University of Chile and the author of the book \u201cThe Semi-Sovereign Democracy: Chile After Pinochet.\u201d \u201cPublic interest has been subordinated to private interests, and when there is no clear distinction between them, it opens the door to endless opportunities for corruption.\u201dSeveral high-profile Chileans were among the clients of Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm whose leaked documents were published on Sunday by a consortium of newspapers. Chile\u2019s Internal Revenue Service announced it would carry out an \u201cexhaustive\u201d inquiry.The details of these far-reaching scandals, and their ramifications, which emerge almost daily, have become a trending topic in Chile, increasing doubts about the political system and the country\u2019s leaders.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that those of us in decision-making positions are being severely questioned and have lost legitimacy, starting with the executive,\u201d the president of the Senate, Ricardo Lagos Weber, said last week. \u201cBut we are not indolent. We have taken action.\u201dLast year, Ms. Bachelet appointed an advisory council to propose limits to campaign spending, controls on political parties and banning corporate donations, measures that would first apply to municipal elections in October.\u201cThese new regulations will make the coming elections radically different, but they won\u2019t change public perception that politicians are corrupt,\u201d said Claudio Fuentes, the director of the school of political science at Diego Portales University, and a former member of the advisory council.\u201cWhat we\u2019ll see in the next elections is a repetition of the same political cycle of the past 25 years, with very few new actors,\u201d Mr. Fuentes said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Orangutans Suffer as Fires Rage and Businesses Grow", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported by9 PhotosNYARU MENTENG, Indonesia \u2014 Katty, a docile, orange-haired preschooler, fell from a tree with a thump. Her teacher quickly picked her up, dusted off her bottom, refastened her white disposable diaper and placed her back on a branch more than seven feet off the ground.They also killed at least nine orangutans, the endangered apes native to the rain forests of Borneo and Sumatra. More than 100, trapped by the loss of habitat or found wandering near villages, had to be relocated. Seven orphans, including five infants, were rescued and taken to rehabilitation centers here.\u201cThis is the biggest in the world for primate rehabilitation, not just orangutans, but we\u2019re not proud of it,\u201d said Denny Kurniawan, the program director of the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rehabilitation Center, who oversees the care of 480 orangutans at seven sites in Central Kalimantan Province on the island of Borneo. \u201cThe number of orangutans here is an indicator of the mass forest destruction due to lack of law enforcement and the local government giving out palm oil concessions.\u201dThe suffering of the wildlife is part of a larger story of corporate expansion in a developing economy crashing into environmental issues in an era of climate change.Multinational palm oil companies, pulp and paper businesses, the plantations that sell to them, farmers and even day laborers all contribute to the problem. Groups like Greenpeace and the Indonesian Forum for the Environment put most of the blame for the blazes on the large plantations, which clear the most land.While it is against Indonesian law to clear plantations by burning, enforcement is lax. The authorities have opened criminal investigations against at least eight companies in connection with last year\u2019s fires, but there has yet to be a single high-profile case to get to court.The government in Jakarta, the capital, has recently banned the draining and clearing of all peatland for agricultural use, and it has ordered provincial governments to adopt better fire suppression methods. But it has not publicly responded to calls for better prevention, such as cracking down on slash-and-burn operations by large palm oil companies.\u201cInvestment is good, but so is the environment,\u201d said Eman Supriyadi, the director of a satellite rehabilitation center where two orphaned orangutans \u2014 6-month-old Oka and 3-year-old Otong \u2014 are bottle-fed human infant formula and sleep in bamboo cribs. \u201cThere has to be a balance.\u201dThe government has admitted that it made a \u201cmistake\u201d in granting large strips of land to big corporate palm oil and pulp and paper companies over the past 10 years, said Luhut B. Pandjaitan, Indonesia\u2019s coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs.\u201cThe Indonesian government has taken serious measures to freeze any new land rights or concessions for those giant industries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are encouraging them to be more efficient, so productivity can grow without adding more land.\u201dHowever, he said the main cause of the 2015 fires was the previous environmental destruction combined with the El Ni\u00f1o climate cycle.Katty, the roughly 9-month-old orangutan, was found in a charred forest by villagers in Central Kalimantan last October and eventually brought to the Nyaru Menteng center, which was established by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation in 1999.She now lives with 20 other infants in an old, one-story wooden house that was converted into an orangutan nursery, where they sleep side-by-side in colored plastic laundry baskets stuffed with leaves.They will spend the next seven or more years learning from their human minders how to climb trees, make a nest of leaves, spot edible forest fruits and avoid snakes and other predators, before being released back into the wild as young adults.At 7 a.m. each day, they are carted by wheelbarrow, three or four per load, to a fenced-off forest area more than 300 feet away for survival classes. They subsist on fruit, mainly bananas and rambutan, and on human infant formula.The minders take pains not to be overly affectionate with their adorable charges: The orangutans need to learn to avoid humans and not be accustomed to their presence, in preparation for their return to the jungle.Most of the center\u2019s older orangutans are also orphans, found alone and rescued by conservationists or local villagers, or confiscated from people illegally keeping them as pets.The center aims to release 68 young-adult animals per year. Each returned animal is tracked by a computer chip implanted near the base of the neck that sends signals to the center for about two years.The release program has also been jeopardized by the fires, which have drastically reduced the potential orangutan habitat.Over the years, thousands of square miles have been cleared for plantations, a majority in lowland areas that are the prime habitat for orangutans. The fires last year destroyed more than 1,650 square miles of forest in Central Kalimantan alone, or 16 percent of its total.\u201cOur challenge for now is, if we have information that orangutans should be rescued, we don\u2019t know where we will relocate them because in Central Kalimantan there is no forest left,\u201d Mr. Denny said. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s estimated that we\u2019re losing forests the size of a football field, and that\u2019s orangutan habitat.\u201dSince 2012, his rehabilitation center has returned 158 orangutans into a 124-square-mile protected forest known as Batikap. But Batikap has reached its maximum recommended orangutan population, Mr. Denny said.He said the center was negotiating with the federal government to establish a 288-square-mile preserve in Bukit Baka-Bukit Raya National Park, in Central Kalimantan and West Kalimantan Provinces, for future releases.Last year\u2019s fires caused such an outcry that the provincial government and local district chiefs in Central Kalimantan have approved no new palm oil concessions this year.But with dry conditions again this year, new fires have broken out. Last month, the governor of Riau Province in Sumatra declared a state of emergency because of fires, and the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency issued a warning about the increased risk of fire in Sumatra and Borneo through the end of April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Has Investment Experts Advising Caution in Europe", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byThe British are going! Maybe.A referendum to determine whether Britain will leave the European Union has been set for June 23. Until voters decide whether they would rather be in or out, investors will have to decide whether to be in or out of assets in Britain and other parts of Europe.Neither decision will be easy. The referendum outcome is a tossup in polls, and analysts are divided on whether the country would be better off in or out of the 28-nation bloc.As for the markets, British stocks have fallen in the last year, like those in many countries, and the currency, the pound, has declined against the dollar and euro. But both have been stable since Prime Minister David Cameron announced the referendum date in late February.The European Union probably could carry on without Greece, as some members of European officialdom made clear to the Greeks during negotiations on their debt. Whether the union would do as well without Britain is more questionable.It\u2019s difficult for investors in international stocks and bonds to prepare for the referendum because professionals have diverging opinions on the economic and political fallout of a pro-Brexit vote. Mr. Muldoon foresees a long, fairly benign aftermath in which \u201cthe E.U. and U.K. would negotiate favorable trade deals.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018out\u2019 people say there would be a smooth transition,\u201d he said, \u201cbut despite a lot of history together, I could see a difficult situation with pain and losses on both sides.\u201dA report by the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicted that a Brexit would take 0.5 percent to 1 percent a year off British economic growth for 10 years and result in an annual drop in exports of 2.5 percent. Britain\u2019s economy grew 2.2 percent last year.\u201cIt would be in the mutual interest of the U.K. and the rest of the E.U. to strike a reasonable second-best solution which would maintain access to much of the single market,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut one should not forget the need to renegotiate the U.K.\u2019s trade relationships with the major non-European countries, as well, in particular the U.S. and China. That could be a long and painful process, with the balance of power being tilted against the U.K.\u201dThat prospect has made a further decline in the pound a rare Brexit forecast that is nearly universally held. A vote in favor of leaving the European Union would drive the pound below $1.30, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale predicted, compared with $1.44 on March 31. It also would propel a decline in the euro to less than $1 from about $1.14, the bank said.A soft pound would depress the dollar value of British assets, but it may be possible to more than recoup the losses in certain types of stocks. Mr. Muldoon predicted that the falling pound \u201cwould act as a stabilizer to any economic deterioration.\u201d Industries like tourism would improve as the weak currency drew visitors to Britain who otherwise might have traveled to the Continent, he said.Mr. Maxwell, though wary, pointed out that companies in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index derive 75 percent or more of their earnings from outside Britain. That would cushion the blow from a plunging pound. Shares of companies that could benefit from it by producing goods at home and selling them abroad might be worth an investment.\u201cOwning things with U.K. costs and foreign revenues is good, but there are not many of those,\u201d he said, offering the beverage maker Diageo as one example.For all their concerns about the British economy, the strategists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have a positive outlook over all for British stocks thanks to the expected further declines in the currency. Yet they caution that British banks would be especially hard-hit in a Brexit because competing financial centers on the Continent would take over many of their activities.Whatever their commercial prospects, Mr. Muldoon finds bank stocks worth a bet. They have been sold heavily, taking their prices to low multiples of earnings, he said.Another casualty of a Brexit, in the view of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, would be British bonds; their yields, the bank predicts, would rise relative to those of core European countries like Germany. Not that it would be much consolation to owners of British bonds, but Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale envisions yield spreads widening even further for bonds in the Continental European periphery, places like Italy and Spain with persistently shaky economies.The potential fragility of much of Europe recalls that apocryphal weather report from the 1930s: \u201cFog in channel, Continent cut off.\u201d The rest of Europe may need Britain more than Britain needs it.\u201cPeople would have more confidence in the U.K. doing the right thing in the medium term than Italy or Spain\u201d if the European Union began to fracture, Mr. Muldoon said. \u201cThe great thing about the U.K. is that it\u2019s a proper economy, with diversified sources of industry. The market structure is very strong, and corporations are very shareholder-friendly. For all of Europe, the U.K. is closest to the American model of capitalism.\u201dBritain may decide that it needs the European Union enough to want to stay put. If the vote goes that way, \u201cWe\u2019d expect markets to calm down quite quickly,\u201d Mr. Zahn said. \u201cWe\u2019d also expect investments that had sold off could subsequently rally, and there could likely be some good opportunities to realize value.\u201dWith so much riding on an outcome so much in doubt, any investment decision involving Britain, Europe and even points beyond should be made with great care. If the British do decide that they\u2019re going, \u201cthis will be negative for growth around the world,\u201d Mr. Muldoon warned, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to have volatility leading up to June 23. Given the uncertainty, you might want to invest elsewhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robber Baron Recessions", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byBut why doesn\u2019t Verizon want to invest? Probably because it doesn\u2019t have to: many customers have no place else to go, so the company can treat its broadband business as a cash cow, with no need to spend money on providing better service (or, speaking from personal experience, on maintaining existing service).The argument begins with a seeming paradox about overall corporate behavior. You see, profits are at near-record highs, thanks to a substantial decline in the percentage of G.D.P. going to workers. You might think that these high profits imply high rates of return to investment. But corporations themselves clearly don\u2019t see it that way: their investment in plant, equipment, and technology (as opposed to mergers and acquisitions) hasn\u2019t taken off, even though they can raise money, whether by issuing bonds or by selling stocks, more cheaply than ever before.How can this paradox be resolved? Well, suppose that those high corporate profits don\u2019t represent returns on investment, but instead mainly reflect growing monopoly power. In that case many corporations would be in the position I just described: able to milk their businesses for cash, but with little reason to spend money on expanding capacity or improving service. The result would be what we see: an economy with high profits but low investment, even in the face of very low interest rates and high stock prices.The obvious next question is why competition has declined. The answer can be summed up in two words: Ronald Reagan.True, there was a limited revival of anti-monopoly efforts during the Clinton years, but these went away again under George W. Bush. The result was an economy with far too much concentration of economic power. And the Obama administration \u2014 preoccupied with the aftermath of financial crisis and the struggle with bitterly hostile Republicans \u2014 has only recently been in a position to grapple with competition policy.For we aren\u2019t just living in a second Gilded Age, we\u2019re also living in a second robber baron era. And only one party seems bothered by either of those observations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Interview With a Fed Dissident: The Sole Vote to Raise Interest Rates", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyEsther George is a dissident, at least by the standards of the Federal Reserve. Since becoming president of the Kansas City Fed in 2011, she has repeatedly cautioned that the central bank is trying too hard to stimulate growth, and that its policies may cause lasting economic distortions instead. Last month, at the most recent meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, she cast the sole vote in favor of raising interest rates. It was her 10th time voting on policy, and the eighth time she has opposed the consensus of her colleagues.Yet Ms. George\u2019s disagreements are modest, matters of degree. In an interview earlier this week, she said she just wants the Fed to do a little less, to retreat just a little faster. \u201cThis is not a time to try to cool an overheated economy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to fight inflation. For me it is really beginning to move slowly and on a path that allows this economy to adjust.\u201dMs. George, whose district includes a swath of America\u2019s oil and gas fields, said she had been surprised by the pain caused by lower oil prices. Yet she remains more optimistic than some of her colleagues about the short-term prospects for economic growth even as she worries more than they do that the Fed\u2019s efforts to spur growth will eventually prove counterproductive.Ms. George, who worked for years as a banking regulator, also talked about her frustration that the government \u2013 including the Fed \u2014 had not yet taken the necessary steps to ensure large banks could be safely dismantled.We spoke on the top floor of the Kansas City Fed\u2019s 14-story headquarters, the newest in the Fed system, opened just before the 2008 crisis. The interview is edited for clarity (and we cut some stuff because your time is valuable).As I look historically at when policy has gotten off track, I think it is that desire, which I absolutely understand, to wait for more certainty. You want to see that the economy is on as stable a footing as it can be. But historically those waits can be costly. And I think we should not forget what costs they bring. And that\u2019s really my point. I don\u2019t want to derail a recovery by any means, and I\u2019m not looking for high interest rates in this country, but I also don\u2019t want to ignore the cost of moving quickly or of waiting until you\u2019re trying to play catch-up.I think about how we thought about subprime mortgages, how we did our best to try to add up that relative to a big market \u2014 and we kind of missed the point. There were other things going on there.I tend to focus more on what are the conditions that you can put in place that allow those kinds of things to happen. I think today we have some of those conditions, which are super-low rates and a desire to try to overcome those either with returns or allocating your resources.And we should be honest: There were decisions made along the way that may have been perfectly justifiable. People had reasons to think that was the right thing to do. But when you think about what perceptions were created, I think we have to care about that and think about that. That\u2019s the role you play when you\u2019re in the business, like the Federal Reserve is, of relying on the public\u2019s trust and confidence in it. It\u2019s not just the letter of the law, it\u2019s thinking about things like perceptions and how will the public see what may be a well-intentioned action. I think the fact that the economy lost 10 million jobs, people don\u2019t forget that easily. When they look to say, \u201cAm I back to where I was before?\u201d I think they probably still have questions. Should it all be aimed at the Fed? No. Have we played a very prominent role? Yeah. So understandable to some extent.We want to acknowledge our accountability, and I think we want to preserve our independence. I don\u2019t want bodies that are charged with spending our taxpayer money to also be involved in this decision [about making monetary policy] and so I think it\u2019s incumbent on us to say we\u2019ll do whatever we can to try to describe this \u2014 short of handing over those reins.Concentrating decision-making in a smaller group has never been in this country the path to public trust and people feeling like institutions are working for them.The Fed can\u2019t be counterstructural. We can be countercyclical in trying to push against an economic downturn, but there are many other aspects of our economy.I\u2019ll give you an example. We\u2019re now in our third year of farm incomes coming off dramatically from their highs, 50 percent drops. Land values have come off a little bit, but they\u2019re holding up pretty well, and again I think that\u2019s low interest rates. When you look at what drives farm value, it\u2019s income and interest rates. Will they continue to hold up as we continue to move along here? I suspect there will be some adjustment. There will be. I would like that to be as smooth and uneventful as possible, but given all we\u2019ve done, I expect it could be bumpy as we move through this. And that will be the challenge for my colleagues and I.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking for Signs of Life in Emerging Markets", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byFor years, many investors have been pining for a rebound in emerging-market stocks, only to be frustrated by the slide in commodity prices, which still drive many developing economies.The situation appeared to improve in the first quarter.After surviving another scare in January, crude oil prices rebounded about 40 percent, pulling up other commodities and emerging-market equities. Since Jan. 20, shares of companies based in rapidly growing economies like Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand have soared more than 20 percent, double the gains of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index of domestic equities during that time.Is the bear market in commodities and emerging-market stocks coming to an end?Not quite.Most economists say it could take years before a commodity \u201csupercycle,\u201d like the one that drove emerging-market stocks in the early 2000s, kicks in. Even if China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of industrial commodities, were to regain momentum \u2014 a big if \u2014 the global economy would still require years to work through excess capacity, many market strategists say.Although commodities continue to be a drag, there are signs of subtle changes that make emerging-market stocks more appealing \u2014 at least more so than a year ago.\u201cComing into the year, there was this attitude: \u2018Why take on additional volatility with emerging-market stocks when you can get better returns for less volatility in the developed world?\u2019\u201d said Laurence Taylor, a portfolio specialist who works with global equities at T. Rowe Price.As it turned out, concerns about the slowing economy hit the developed markets harder than the developing world, as European stock funds lost 3.4 percent in the quarter versus a 4 percent average gain for diversified emerging market funds.\u201cThat, perhaps, would be a catalyst for people to reassess their emerging-world thesis,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.So too would the surprising advances seen in many of the most worrisome economies \u2014 the so-called fragile five nations of Turkey, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil \u2014 which have improved their budget deficits, balance of trade and inflation outlook, he added.And the Federal Reserve\u2019s less aggressive stance on interest rates this year may reduce a major headwind for the emerging markets. At the end of last year, expectations were that the Fed would lift short-term interest rates four times in 2016, even as central banks abroad were still trying to stimulate growth.Because higher rates curb risk-taking and strengthen the dollar, this was expected to have a negative effect on emerging-market shares.\u201cThe change in tone represents more synchronicity with central banks in Japan, Europe and around the world,\u201d said Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets fund.That could represent an opportunity in the developing world, money managers say, though this risky asset would merit caution.Even assuming that emerging-market stocks will go back to being one of the best-performing asset classes, as was the case a decade ago, the countries that led the past rally might not lead a resurgence.Consider that the so-called BRIC countries \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China, which dominated emerging market funds a decade ago \u2014 gained more than 770 percent from 1999 through 2007. That\u2019s more than double the returns for other emerging-market stocks. Yet since the financial crisis of 2008, BRIC stocks have lost a third of their value while the rest of the emerging markets have held their ground.Then there is a valuation problem. \u201cYou can put emerging-markets stocks into a couple of buckets,\u201d said Jonas M. Krumplys, co-manager of the Ivy Emerging Markets Equity fund. In one bucket are the commodity-driven economies of Latin America and Russia. In the other bucket are stocks based in economies that are increasingly being driven by domestic growth and rising consumer spending. This includes markets like India, Indonesia, Mexico and the Philippines.The problem is, stocks in the latter bucket \u2014 which investors favor \u2014 are trading at price-to-earnings ratios that are typically 50 percent or greater than shares based in the commodity bucket.\u201cIn the aggregate, the emerging markets look cheap relative to history,\u201d said Scott Crawshaw, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Portfolio fund. \u201cBut higher-quality areas of the market are trading at very different valuations to those stocks that are more caught up in the commodities downdraft.\u201dSome money managers say they are being very selective.Within that domestic growth-oriented bucket, for instance, \u201cyou\u2019re trying to find the gems left behind,\u201d said Charles Wilson, co-manager of the Thornburg Developing World fund.An example, he said, is Kweichow Moutai, a leading spirits maker, which produces a major brand of baijiu, a distilled Chinese liquor.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most well-known brands in general in China,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. He notes that the company trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 15, based on this year\u2019s estimated profits. \u201cThat\u2019s five or six points cheaper compared to its European liquor peers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it has a 2.5 percent dividend yield.\u201dMr. Kass at Baron has also been looking for companies with domestic growth potential that are trading at attractive prices.He said he had been focusing on growth companies that were affected by \u2014 but not directly participating in \u2014 the commodities business.These are companies like BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian stock and derivatives exchange. Because equity-trading volumes are affected by the health of Brazil\u2019s commodity-driven economy, shares sank nearly 18 percent from November to January. But Mr. Kass said the company has a good balance sheet and attractive long-term growth prospects.And since late January, the stock has soared more than 50 percent.Arjun Divecha, who oversees emerging market equities at the asset management firm GMO, notes that even within faster-growing sectors in the developing world, like technology, there are still pockets of attractively priced stocks.\u201cChinese tech is all the Internet stuff, which is expensive,\u201d Mr. Divecha said. \u201cTaiwanese tech is filled with middlemen \u2014 suppliers who make parts and are cheaper.\u201dAn example is Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which manufactures component parts for information technology and wireless communications companies. Earnings per share at the company, based in Taipei, have climbed 15 percent a year for the last four years. Yet the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9, based on forecast profits.Yet another strategy is to seek out overlooked countries \u2014 and companies benefiting from domestic growth, rather than exports.For example, investors have identified plenty of economies helped by low commodity prices because those nations are net buyers of raw materials. This includes places like India and the Philippines.Yet also in that group is Thailand, which has been plagued by political instability, enduring a dozen coups since 1932 \u2014 the most recent one in 2014.\u201cWhen you think of a place like Thailand, you think, \u2018Oh man, another military coup,\u2019\u201d said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Amana Developing World fund. \u201cBut the fact is, the country has been pretty well managed from a macro perspective.\u201dOne of his fund\u2019s top holdings is Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, which operates hospitals in Thailand. Mr. Klimo said that roughly 75 percent of the company\u2019s business was done with Thai residents, which means it reflects the health of the Thai economy, not global trade.At the same time, he said, \u201cHousehold spending on health care is a fraction of what it is in other economies.\u201d Such spending will increase as more families enter the middle class.Ultimately, that kind of demographic advantage has been fueling the developing-market theme for decades. And strategists say it will support an eventual rebound in emerging-market stocks, whenever that comes to pass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s Tax Cuts, Boon for Middle Class, Come With Risk", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 It has become a phenomenon as common in Albany as Monday night fund-raisers or legislators under indictment: a new year, and a new round of tax cuts from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.That trend continued when Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, announced a deal on March 31 to reduce the personal income taxes of an estimated five million New Yorkers who earn $300,000 or less a year. The first phase of those cuts will take effect in 2018 \u2014 when Mr. Cuomo is up for re-election \u2014 but could be felt long after he leaves office.Indeed, while initially described as a \u201cbillion-dollar tax cut,\u201d the plan will save taxpayers \u2014 or deprive tax rolls, depending on one\u2019s point of view \u2014 some $4.2 billion in 2025, when it is fully enacted. All told, the cuts are projected by the state to amount to more than $20 billion by that year.And while that largess is likely to be celebrated by many of New York\u2019s taxpayers, it could also leave the state open to pitfalls, both financial and political. Indeed, one of the underlying assumptions of the cuts is the continued growth of the economy, which has been on a seven-year rebound since the national recession officially ended, in June 2009.David J. Friedfel, the director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan good-government group in New York, noted that the state was already projecting service gaps of $1.2 billion, $3 billion and $3.4 billion in the 2018, 2019 and 2020 state fiscal years, as costs of health care and education continue to rise.And further reducing revenues could cause those gaps to widen over the years, Mr. Friedfel said, potentially \u201cnecessitating tax increases or service cuts.\u201d Worse yet, he said, those gaps could become unmanageable if revenues do not continue to grow or if the state falls into another recession.\u201cWe know it\u2019s not going to last forever,\u201d Mr. Friedfel said of the recovery, noting that the governor\u2019s current projection of rising revenue \u2014 through 2020 \u2014 would make for an exceptionally long period of growth.\u201cIt\u2019s the duration\u201d of such predictions, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s concerning.\u201dState budget officials, however, say that their projection of roughly 3 percent annual growth is conservative, and that the rate \u2014 coupled with the governor\u2019s oft-stated fiscal policy of keeping state spending to 2 percent \u2014 makes the tax cut possible.\u201cWe feel now we can afford to return some of that to the taxpayers while leaving in a significant cushion, as long as we stay within the 2 percent,\u201d Robert Mujica, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s budget director, said. \u201cAnd the governor has stayed within the 2 percent for six consecutive years.\u201dMoreover, officials say that the gaps that Mr. Friedfel warns about will be avoided by finding savings and efficiencies in other parts of government, just as they have in other years. \u201cEvery year we have been able to manage the budget and bring it in,\u201d Mr. Mujica said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll do it again.\u201dThe tax deal \u2014 which was favored and promoted by Republicans in the State Senate, where they hold a slim majority \u2014 may also have political effects. Even before the budget\u2019s formal passage, the speaker of the Assembly, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, said that the cut was likely to be a focus of next year\u2019s budget negotiations, particularly as he continues to push a proposal for a so-called millionaire\u2019s tax.\u201cWe were looking at, and will continue to look at, having the highest earners in the state of New York contribute more,\u201d Mr. Heastie said at a recent news conference at the State Capitol. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to become a vital discussion, because that is a loss of revenue that we are going to see with this middle-class income-tax cut.\u201dBut Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan makes even deeper cuts phased in over time, with rates dropping to levels unseen since just after World War II, according to the governor.According to the governor\u2019s budget office, the average tax cut in the state by 2025 would be nearly $700 a year, with about a third of those taxpayers in New York City.At the same time he won the tax plan, Mr. Cuomo celebrated two other victories in passing the budget: an increase in the minimum wage and the establishment of a paid-family-leave program.In selling his minimum-wage proposal to skeptical Republicans in the State Senate, Mr. Cuomo was willing to add a so-called safety valve to the plan that would allow the state to slow or stop annual increases of the minimum wage in the event of bad economic times. (The plan also does not guarantee a timetable for a $15 wage anywhere except New York City \u2014 where the wage will be in effect in 2018 \u2014 and Long Island and Westchester County, which will wait until the end of 2021.)The tax-cut plan, however, has no such shut-off mechanism, and the possibility that the state\u2019s long recovery will end soon worries some economists.\u201cPredicting the turn in the economy from expansion to recession is the hardest thing for an economist to do,\u201d Mr. Friedfel said.The new tax rates may also affect the debate on a surcharge that the state has levied on those earning more than $1 million, which will expire at the end of next year. Budget-office projections of the new tax rates\u2019 effects are based on the phasing out of that surcharge; an extension, however, or the replacement of it with the Assembly\u2019s proposal, would mean more income for New York. Republicans have said that this high earners\u2019 surcharge \u2014 which dates to Gov. David Paterson\u2019s administration \u2014 undercuts Mr. Cuomo\u2019s assertion that he is an anti-tax Democrat.Ed Cox, the state\u2019s Republican Party chairman, said that although any cut was good, cutting middle-class rates \u2014 which will drop to 5.5 percent for those earning less than $150,000 \u2014 would give less relief than he would like, noting that New York is still known as one of the highest taxed states.The cut, Mr. Cox added, enabled Mr. Cuomo to go \u201cfor the rhetoric, not the substance.\u201d\u201cFor the middle brackets, we\u2019ve kept it pretty much flat for a long time, so you can do a little cut,\u201d Mr. Cox said, \u201cand say, \u2018Look what I did!\u2019\u201dFor his part, Mr. Cuomo seems to be already convinced of the success of his tax plan and that of the spending plan that included it.\u201cIt really was,\u201d he said on NY1, \u201ca great budget over all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Islamic State of Molenbeek", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 There are military trucks parked in Molenbeek, and soldiers with submachine guns patrol the jittery streets of the Brussels district that has been the epicenter of European terrorism in recent months. On the Place Communale idle youths loiter, shooting glances at the police. This is where the Paris and Brussels attacks, with their 162 dead, overlap.Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving direct participant in the Paris attacks, hid in Molenbeek before his arrest on March 18. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected chief planner of the Paris attacks, lived in Molenbeek. In all, at least 14 people tied to both attacks were either Belgian or lived in Brussels.One of them is Mohamed Abrini, a Belgian of Moroccan origin who grew up in Molenbeek and was arrested in Brussels on Friday. He has told the police he is \u201cthe man in the hat\u201d caught on surveillance cameras leaving Brussels airport after two accomplices blew themselves up on March 22. Cameras also placed him in Paris last November with the Paris attackers.Sleepy Brussels: goodbye to that image. Yet even today there\u2019s something soporific about this French-speaking city marooned within Flemish-speaking Flanders, beset by administrative and linguistic divisions and the lethargy that stems from them, home to a poorly integrated immigrant population of mainly Moroccan and Turkish descent (41 percent of the population of Molenbeek is Muslim), and housing the major institutions of a fraying European Union.It is hard to resist the symbolism of the Islamic State establishing a base for its murderous designs in the so-called capital of Europe at a time when the European idea is weaker than at any time since the 1950s. A jihadi loves a vacuum, as Syria demonstrates. Belgium as a state, and Belgium as the heart of the European Union are as close to a vacuum as Europe offers these days.Belgium \u2014 a hodgepodge of three regions (Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia and Brussels), three linguistic communities (Flemish, French and German) and a weak federal government \u2014 is dysfunctional. That dysfunction finds its most powerful expression in the capital, where Flemish geography and French culture do not align. The administrative breakdown assumes critical proportions in Molenbeek, the second-poorest commune in the country, with 36 percent of people younger than 25 unemployed.This is an outrage. Splintered Belgium had lost control of Molenbeek. A heavily Muslim district of Brussels had in effect seceded. If this were the extent of the problem, it would be grave. But Molenbeek is just the most acute manifestation of a European failure.The large-scale immigration from Turkey and North Africa that began a half-century ago at a time of economic boom has \u2014 at a time of economic stagnation \u2014 led to near-ghettos in or around many European cities where the jobless descendants of those migrants are sometimes radicalized by Wahhabi clerics. As the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, warned recently, an extremist minority is \u201cwinning the ideological and cultural battle\u201d within French Islam.The fact that the jihadis, often Syrian-trained, are a minority, and that many Muslims who immigrate to Europe are leading successful and integrated lives, is little consolation. After the carnage in Paris and Brussels, the laissez-faire approach that had allowed those clerics to proselytize, private Muslim schools to multiply in France, prisons to serve as incubators of jihadism, youths to drift to ISIS land in Syria and back, and districts like Molenbeek or Schaerbeek to drift into a void of negligence, has to cease. Improved intelligence is not enough. There is an ideological battle going on; it has to be waged on that level, where it has been lost up to now. The moderate Muslim communities of Europe need to do much more.Europe, of which Brussels is a symbol, presents an alarming picture today. The Dutch, susceptible to propaganda from Russia, have just voted in a referendum against a trade agreement with Ukraine for which more than 100 Ukrainians died in an uprising in 2014. The British are set to vote in June on whether to leave the Union. The euro has sapped economies insufficiently integrated for a common currency. A huge refugee flow has raised questions about a borderless Europe. President Putin plots daily to do his worst for the European Union.There is a vacuum. Vacuums are dangerous. The answer is a reformed, reinvigorated and stronger Europe, not the kind of division that produced Molenbeek \u2014 a microcosm of what fragmentation can bring.My two older children were born in Schaerbeek. My daughter, now a doctor in New Mexico, took some of her first steps at Brussels airport. This is not the Europe I imagined for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Generalist, \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 May Be Too Tricky to Judge", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byDealBookAbout two years ago, I was speaking with an executive at MetLife who floated the idea that the company should sue the government to overturn its designation as a firm that was too big to fail. The company believed that it was being unfairly labeled, and that the regulations that came with the designation were hindering its business.My initial reaction, I distinctly remember, was to say: \u201cThat\u2019s a terribly risky idea. The government always wins.\u201dBoy was I wrong.A judge determined that the government\u2019s process for designating MetLife a systemically important institution was not just \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d but seemingly purposely so. \u201cEvery possible effect of MetLife\u2019s imminent insolvency was summarily deemed grave enough to damage the economy,\u201d Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her opinion.Not surprisingly, Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, took great umbrage. \u201cIn overturning the conclusions of experienced financial regulators, the court imposed new requirements that Congress never enacted, and contradicted key policy lessons from the financial crisis,\u201d he said.I have no idea if MetLife is too big to fail. I\u2019ve read hundreds of pages of legal briefs from both sides, and talked to company and government officials and outside experts, and I\u2019m still not sure. I\u2019ve tried to make sense of it, but it is a highly complicated puzzle and to make such a determination with any degree of certainty requires mathematically projecting how money will flow between hundreds of institutions around the globe.Which raises this question: How can any judge with anything short of a doctorate in statistics and economic modeling be tasked with effectively overseeing the decisions of a group like the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the leaders of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the list goes on.Judge Collyer smartly chose not to comment on whether MetLife was actually too big to fail, and she left open the possibility that the company could someday merit that designation. In her opinion, she said more narrowly that the process of determining that status in the case of MetLife was problematic.The judge has a long history as a thoughtful lawyer and jurist. She\u2019s also a member of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and once worked as the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. In other words, she\u2019s a legal rock star.But her job in the case was, in effect, to approve or reject the approach the oversight council took in its analysis.Judges, of course, are often asked to weigh in on complicated matters that are beyond their area of expertise. The judge in the case of the F.B.I.\u2019s effort to unlock an Apple phone was not an engineer or a computer scientist. And our legal system regularly asks jurors with no background in a particular subject to decide difficult cases.But in certain instances, like the case involving MetLife and the oversight council, should there be a special court, perhaps with an area of expertise?Many of the lawyers I spoke with scoffed at the idea of a specialized tribunal to deal with issues related to the oversight council, saying that it is a judge\u2019s job to determine whether government agencies provide appropriate regulation.Still, Joshua D. Wright, a former commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, co-wrote a 2011 study that determined in antitrust cases, a judge\u2019s expertise had a significant impact on the validity of the ruling. \u201cDecisions of judges trained in basic economics are significantly less likely to be appealed than are decisions by their untrained counterparts,\u201d the study says. \u201cOur analysis supports the hypothesis that some antitrust cases are too complicated for generalist judges.\u201dNow, with the ruling by Judge Collyer in the MetLife case, many analysts are expecting that other companies, including potentially General Electric and Prudential, will sue to have their designation lifted too. That puts the decision not to a committee of ostensibly qualified experts, but to a panel of judges with limited experience.Judge Collyer\u2019s decision may well be entirely valid, but at least in certain places she appears off base. For example, she said the government \u201cnever projected what the losses would be, which financial institutions would have to actively manage their balance sheets or how the market would destabilize as a result.\u201dWell, the government appears to have done much of that in its report, but you\u2019d need a pretty sophisticated understanding of finance to understand exactly how their numbers were calculated.Judge Collyer either decided to ignore those numbers or decided they were chosen arbitrarily.The conundrum in the case of the oversight council is that determining which companies pose a systemic risk can\u2019t be done with a straight formula. The nature of financial crises means that, as a regulator, you\u2019re playing against a 100-year storm that you can\u2019t fully foresee.That\u2019s not to say the government didn\u2019t mess up in its process of designating MetLife. It now seems as if the government, in some instances, didn\u2019t even follow its own guidelines. It may get another shot, though, with the chance to go back and remake its case that MetLife should be designated too big to fail.For now, we are left with a ruling that has damaged the government\u2019s ability to regulate an institution that at least some pretty smart people who study these things thought required an extra level of scrutiny. They may or may not have been right, but ultimately it should be left to experts to decide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Senate Allows Payment to Bondholders", "Date": "2016-03-31", "News": "Supported byArgentina\u2019s Senate has approved measures that will allow the government to pay billions of dollars to American hedge funds, a critical step toward settling a legal battle that is more than a decade old.The vote, 54-16 in favor, took place just past midnight on Thursday after more than a dozen hours of emotional speeches.It was the last hurdle that Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, had to clear inside Argentina to settle with the holders of debt that his country defaulted on in 2001. The lower house approved the measures this month.The country\u2019s Senate voted to allow the government to sell up to $12.5 billion in bonds to pay for the agreements with all the creditors who did not participate in Argentina\u2019s two earlier debt restructurings.In February, the Macri administration reached a series of agreements with investors including Paul E. Singer\u2019s NML Capital, Montreux Partners, Dart Management and a group of Italian investors, totaling more than $10 billion in payments.The Senate also revoked laws passed during previous administrations that prevented a new offer from being made, including one that barred the government from making a more attractive offer to the holdouts than the ones that investors accepted in two debt swaps, in 2005 and 2010.The lifting of these laws was a condition set by Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the United States District Court in Manhattan on Feb. 19, when he lifted his injunction that had blocked Argentina from paying bondholders who had agreed to the two debt exchanges. The two sides agreed on a deadline of April 14 to pay the settlement.Argentina is expected to go on a road show in April to court foreign investors.In February, the country\u2019s minister of economy, Alfonso Prat-Gay, a former JPMorgan Chase banker, said that the country would seek to sell up to $15 billion in bonds to pay for the February agreements. Next week, he will attend the Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s annual conference in the Bahamas.Mr. Macri is in Washington this week attending a nuclear security summit meeting. President Obama visited Argentina this month, the first time a United States president made such a trip since 2005.The Senate vote included many supporters of the previous presidents, the late Nestor Kirchner and his successor and wife, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who form the largest block in the chamber. Those who supported the measure said in their speeches that they did so largely because they felt they had no choice.Still, one senator from the Kirchner bloc, Juan Manuel Abal Medina, voted against the measure on grounds that it was inequitable, contending that \u201cPaul Singer is receiving different treatment\u201d than all the other bondholders did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Pacific Ends Bid for Norfolk Southern", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byAfter five months of pressure, three merger offers and one rejection from regulators, Canadian Pacific Railway said on Monday that it had abandoned efforts to combine with its American railroad counterpart Norfolk Southern.\u201cWe have long recognized that consolidation is necessary for the North American rail industry to meet the demands of a growing economy,\u201d Canadian Pacific\u2019s chief executive, E. Hunter Harrison, said in the statement. \u201cBut with no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long term value for C.P. shareholders.\u201dThe terminated offer is the latest black eye for the hedge fund activist William A. Ackman, who is among Canadian Pacific\u2019s largest shareholders and an outspoken proponent of the merger. Mr. Ackman won a proxy battle for control of Canadian Pacific in 2012 and installed Mr. Harrison as chief executive. They have spoken at great lengths on conference calls about the need for consolidation among railroad operators.The Surface Transportation Board, a division in the Department of Transportation, must approve mergers in the railroad industry. This agency requires that a deal be in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in addition to enhancing competition. Canadian Pacific suggested putting its own shares in a voting trust to quickly integrate the companies during the regulatory approval process.To ease Norfolk Southern\u2019s concerns, Canadian Pacific sought a declaratory order last month from the transportation board to rule on its voting trust plan.Norfolk Southern eventually said it would engage in talks if Canadian Pacific received a declaratory order and could offer a suitable price. In response, Canadian Pacific filed a proxy statement for Norfolk Southern\u2019s shareholders to vote on whether their board should pursue discussions with Canadian Pacific.The Canadian railroad operator said it believed that the combination of the two companies would be in the best interest of the industry because it would create a more efficient system.\u201cPoliticians, shippers and others are calling for a strong, healthy and high performing rail system, yet no one has the stomach to challenge the status quo,\u201d Mr. Harrison said in a white paper on April 7. \u201cClearly, moving goods reliably and efficiently is top of mind for everyone in the industry; we believe precision railroading and a C.P.-N.S. combination addresses those challenges.\u201dCanadian Pacific\u2019s hopes dimmed on Friday, though, when the Justice Department officially opposed its voting-trust structure. The regulator said that the tactic would \u201ccompromise Norfolk Southern\u2019s independence\u201d by integrating the two companies before the Surface Transportation Board could complete its review. The Justice Department does not have the authority to approve or reject railroad mergers; that responsibility lies with the transportation board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Aims to Appease Congress With New Debt Proposal", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byPuerto Rico proposed a new plan on Monday to restructure its debt, offering some creditors better terms than an earlier plan but falling well short of winning broad support.If the threat of a debt payment moratorium was Puerto Rico\u2019s stick, the restructuring offer on Monday appears to be a carrot. Puerto Rico said it had found a way to make debt payments of $1.85 billion a year, compared with the $1.7 billion a year it had offered before.\u201cThe commonwealth is in crisis, and the fact is that we will only be able to address these issues by working together,\u201d Victor A. Suarez, Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of state, said in a statement. \u201cOur commitment to this is underscored by our willingness to listen to our different creditors and work to meet their needs.\u201dThe new restructuring plan covers $49.3 billion of Puerto Rico\u2019s total debt, most of which is in the form of municipal bonds. It calls for creditors to accept $32.6 billion to $37.4 billion up front by exchanging existing bonds for two new classes of bonds. The offer is up from a previous offer of $26.5 billion.Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank, a crucial part of the local economy, risks defaulting on $422 million in debt payments due May 1, and the island faces $2 billion in payments on debt in July. Lawmakers both in San Juan and Washington have been working to prevent a disorderly collapse of the island\u2019s finances. Congress is working on a revised proposal to help Puerto Rico restructure under the supervision of a federal oversight panel.The Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday, said, \u201cThere are still some open issues.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of details, but when you get down to the bottom line the question to us is: Does that restructuring authority work? It has to work or it\u2019s not going to be acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be something that you put a label on but in the marketplace it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He did not comment on Puerto Rico\u2019s new proposal.Puerto Rico began presenting its first restructuring proposal to creditors in January. A number of them said they considered it unacceptable; some have tried with little success to interest Puerto Rico in counteroffers.Particular resistance has come from creditors who hold bonds backed by Puerto Rico\u2019s most ironclad pledges. General obligation bonds, for example, are specifically guaranteed by the island\u2019s constitution, and some holders argue that anything less than full, timely repayment would be unconstitutional.Puerto Rico has taken the position that all types of creditors must sacrifice, however. The new offer announced on Monday reflects that position. General obligation bonds held by investors who do not live on the island would get a recovery rate of 74 percent under the new proposal. Holders of sales-tax-backed bonds would get 57 percent; and holders of bonds issued by the Government Development Bank would get just 36 percent.Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis, and the solutions sought by Washington, could reverberate throughout municipal finance. A potential sticking point is that Puerto Rico\u2019s other long-term commitments, such as the pensions of retired government workers, would not be reduced under the new restructuring plan. Pensions do not currently have top legal priority in the order of creditors seeking payment, and some lawmakers think that switching around credit priorities for Puerto Rico would send a shock through the capital markets, making it harder for other states and cities to borrow.The new proposal calls for current bondholders to trade in their holdings for two new types of bonds. Bondholders would get more or less of each type, depending on the priority of the bonds they now hold. Those with the highest-priority bonds would get more of the first type, which offer less monetary value but greater certainty of repayment.The first type would be a \u201cbase bond\u201d with a total face value ranging from $32.6 billion to $37.4 billion, depending on whether bondholders in Puerto Rico opted in or took advantage of the special offer available to them alone.The new base bonds would start out paying 1.1 percent interest for the coming fiscal year. (Under Puerto Rico\u2019s previous offer, interest payments would not have started until a year later.) The interest rate would then rise gradually to 5 percent in 2021, the same year principal repayments would start.Bondholders living in Puerto Rico would, however, have the chance to recover more of their initial investment if they were willing to wait. Instead of trading in their holdings for the regular base bonds, they could opt for \u201clocal holder base bonds,\u201d which would have a value equal to the face amount of the bonds being handed over. The local holder base bonds would pay a fixed, 2 percent rate of interest over a longer period of time.A summary of the proposal noted that Puerto Rico was seeking to \u201cprovide relief to those Puerto Ricans who live day-to-day off their interest payments,\u201d and the government was also looking at other ways of helping them.For investors not living in Puerto Rico, there would be only a chance of getting a full recovery. In addition to their base bonds, they would get a second type, called \u201ccapital appreciation bonds,\u201d which would not offer any cash payments until after the base bonds had been fully repaid and it was clear how much of a loss each type of bondholder had suffered.At that point, this second type of bond would start paying investors enough to make up for their losses over a long time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Urges Britain to Remain in the E.U.", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 President Obama has called on the British people not to vote for an exit from the European Union, writing in an opinion article published upon his arrival in London late Thursday night that \u201cthe European Union doesn\u2019t moderate British influence \u2014 it magnifies it.\u201dIn the article, Mr. Obama responded directly to that criticism, asserting that the challenges facing Europe are not different from the ones facing the United States.\u201cAnd in today\u2019s world, even as we all cherish our sovereignty, the nations who wield their influence most effectively are the nations that do it through the collective action that today\u2019s challenges demand,\u201d the president wrote.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut he arrives with a grim warning that he will deliver in a series of meetings with several political leaders: Europe is in danger of being pulled apart by threats to its security and economy that can be overcome only by greater cooperation and a unity that appears increasingly elusive.In the article, Mr. Obama praised the creation of what he called \u201cinternational institutions and initiatives\u201d to promote peace and democracy, including the European Union and NATO.\u201cToday, we face tests to this order \u2014 terrorism and aggression; migration and economic headwinds \u2014 challenges that can only be met if the United States and the United Kingdom can rely on one another, on our special relationship, and on the partnerships that lead to progress,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote.Terrorist attacks like the ones in Brussels and Paris have exposed shortcomings in the gathering and sharing of intelligence that have left Europe vulnerable and scared. War in Syria, where the most recent cease-fire appears to be failing, has produced a flood of migrants that is causing political and economic turmoil in Europe.The Russian-backed aggression in Ukraine has raised new questions about the effectiveness of the NATO alliance. And the vote in June threatens to cleave Britain from the European Union, potentially stalling one of the world\u2019s most successful economic powerhouses.\u201cBecause of a host of issues \u2014 from migration to sluggish economic growth to the terrorist threat \u2014 the European Union today faces challenges from populism and other threats to its well-being,\u201d said Charles Kupchan, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama for European issues. \u201cThe E.U. is one of the great accomplishments of the post-World War II era. It has succeeded in helping remove war from Europe, and we are concerned about the health and vitality of that experiment.\u201dMr. Obama traveled to Britain after a series of meetings in Saudi Arabia, where he said Thursday that the United States would continue to enhance security cooperation with its allies in the Persian Gulf, while encouraging them to carry out domestic reforms and bolster their ability to defend themselves.During those meetings, he discussed a variety of issues with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman \u2014 including the civil wars in Yemen, Syria and Libya, military and economic cooperation, and the fight against terrorist groups like the Islamic State. But Mr. Obama left without announcing any concrete plans or initiatives on any of those matters.In a meeting planned for Friday afternoon with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, Mr. Obama will urge his counterpart to increase intelligence sharing and cooperation among European countries so that they can better counter terrorist threats, including attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, aides to the president said.On Sunday, Mr. Obama will discuss the Syrian migration crisis with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said Mr. Obama would applaud Ms. Merkel for her efforts to absorb Syrian refugees, even at great political cost. And he will pledge United States support for the recent deal that the European Union made with Turkey to accept Syrian migrants.Then on Monday, the president will meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Among the messages for the group will be his contention that they must take more responsibility for their own security.That will be a familiar refrain to Mr. Obama\u2019s colleagues, who will recall that he made a similar \u2014 if more blunt \u2014 observation in a recent article in The Atlantic in which he accused some European allies of being \u201cfree riders\u201d who rely on help from the United States instead of investing in their own militaries.\u201cThere\u2019s this greater sense of unraveling, if you will, of the European project,\u201d said Heather Conley, a former State Department official and the senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.That concern is likely to be set aside during Mr. Obama\u2019s visit with the queen, and during his dinner on Friday night with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Philadelphia, a Brash Ex-Mayor Draws Comparisons to Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byA former police officer who was nicknamed Big Bambino, Mr. Rizzo rose to power during the city\u2019s crime-ridden 1960s and \u201970s, cracking down on lawlessness with a legendary bellicosity.After becoming police commissioner, he rounded up homosexuals late at night, forced the Black Panthers to strip down in the streets and once appeared with a nightstick stuffed in the cummerbund of his tuxedo. As mayor, he threatened to \u201cbreak the heads\u201d of criminals and boasted that his Police Department was strong enough to invade Cuba.While Mr. Trump has yet to wield such power, his tone as a candidate has been seen as similarly provocative, stoking a comparable zeal among supporters. And Mr. Trump, given his comments on immigrants and Muslims, has stirred similar unease over what he might do in office.For many in Philadelphia who remember the Rizzo era \u2014 some with horror, others nostalgically \u2014 Mr. Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, is a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201cFrank was outspoken, and Trump is certainly outspoken,\u201d said Michael Cibik, a Republican who ran for City Council while Mr. Rizzo was running for re-election in the 1980s. \u201cImagewise, they are both a little bigger than life, and they touched on hot-button issues at the time.\u201dDespite Mr. Rizzo\u2019s harsh tone, even those who clashed with him could not deny his natural political talent. Edward G. Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor and Pennsylvania governor, said that Mr. Rizzo, like Mr. Trump, could be endearing when he wanted and was loyal to his allies.\u201cBoth are magnetic personalities, could literally fill a room and had a great deal of personal charm,\u201d said Mr. Rendell, who was running against Mr. Rizzo at the time of Mr. Rizzo\u2019s death.That charm could not always carry Mr. Rizzo as the city\u2019s electorate changed, even with his efforts to soften his tone later in life. W. Wilson Goode, who was Philadelphia\u2019s first black mayor and twice defeated Mr. Rizzo \u2014 once in a Democratic primary and once in the general election \u2014 recalled that while Mr. Rizzo tended to have the most passionate supporters, he struggled to broaden his base in the 1980s beyond white voters who wanted a crime-fighting mayor.\u201cHe did have a kind of passionate fringe of people that could be readily identified,\u201d Mr. Goode said of Mr. Rizzo. \u201cIt was law-and-order folks, people who were against crime, people who were emotionally racist.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhite males were the people who supported Frank Rizzo.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign has also been buttressed by white male voters, including many who feel disaffected by politics or left behind by a changing economy. Polls show Mr. Trump poised to do well in Pennsylvania\u2019s primary election on Tuesday, and the remnants of the Rizzo coalition could back him in Philadelphia.\u201cPeople call saying, \u2018I want to register so I can vote for Trump,\u2019\u201d said Joe DeFelice, chairman of the Philadelphia Republican Party, who said he had recently seen many working-class people come in to change their party affiliations. \u201cHe speaks his mind and doesn\u2019t care about the backlash. That pretty much sums up a lot of Rizzo.\u201dDespite the similarities between the two men, many who remembered Mr. Rizzo mused that the parallels stopped at politics, and some suggested that Mr. Rizzo\u2019s actions might have made even Mr. Trump blush.Timothy J. Lombardo, a historian with a forthcoming book on Mr. Rizzo, noted that Mr. Rizzo grew up in a hardscrabble part of South Philadelphia and followed his father into law enforcement, while Mr. Trump was the son of a millionaire developer, was raised in an upper-class part of Queens and attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cThe difference between Rizzo and Trump is that Rizzo was the real deal,\u201d Mr. Lombardo said. \u201cRizzo has the authenticity, but Trump is really good at playing that role.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I\u2019m Supporting Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNO decision we make as Americans more dramatically affects the direction of our country than our choice for president. He or she is more than the manager of the executive branch, commander in chief or appointer of judges. The president reflects, but also helps define, our national values, priorities and direction.After considering the biggest challenges facing our nation and the future I want for my children and our country, I have decided to become the first member of the Senate to support my colleague Bernie Sanders for president.I grew up in working-class Oregon. On a single income, my parents could buy a home, take a vacation and help pay for college. My father worked with his hands as a millwright and built a middle-class life for us.My parents believed in education and they believed in the United States. When I was young, my father took me to the grade school and told me that if I went through those doors, and worked hard, I could do just about anything because we lived in America. My dad was right.Years later, my family and I still live in the same working-class community I grew up in. But America has gone off track, and the outlook for the kids growing up there is a lot gloomier today than 40 years ago.Many middle-class Americans are working longer for less income than decades ago, even while big-ticket expenses like housing, health care and college have relentlessly pushed higher.It is not that America is less wealthy than 40 years ago \u2014 quite the contrary. The problem is that our economy, both by accident and design, has become rigged to make a fortunate few very well off while leaving most Americans struggling to keep up.And as economic power has become more concentrated, so too has political power. Special interests, aided by their political and judicial allies, have exercised an ever-tighter grip on our political system, from the rise of unlimited, secret campaign spending to a voter suppression movement.Under President Obama\u2019s leadership, our country is fairer and more prosperous for all than it was seven years ago. But as we look toward the next administration, there is far more work to do. We need urgency. We need big ideas. We need to rethink the status quo.Unlike the Republican primary circus, Democrats have a choice between two candidates with lifelong track records of fighting for economic opportunity and who are committed to America\u2019s being a force for peace and stability and who are eager to meet today\u2019s challenges and move our country forward for all its citizens, together.From her time advocating for children as a young lawyer to her work as first lady of Arkansas and the United States, and as a senator and secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a remarkable record. She would be a strong and capable president.But Bernie Sanders is boldly and fiercely addressing the biggest challenges facing our country.He has opposed trade deals with nations that pay their workers as little as a dollar an hour. Such deals have caused good jobs to move overseas and undermined the leverage of American workers to bargain for a fair share of the wealth they create in our remaining factories.He has passionately advocated for pivoting from fossil fuels to renewable energy to save our planet from global warming \u2014 the greatest threat facing humanity. He recognizes that to accomplish this we must keep the vast bulk of the world\u2019s fossil fuels in the ground.Bernie is a determined leader in taking on the concentration of campaign cash from the mega-wealthy that is corrupting the vision of opportunity embedded in our Constitution.And he has been unflinching in taking on predatory lending, as well as the threats to our economy from high-risk strategies at our biggest banks.It has been noted that Bernie has an uphill battle ahead of him to win the Democratic nomination. But his leadership on these issues and his willingness to fearlessly stand up to the powers that be have galvanized a grass-roots movement. People know that we don\u2019t just need better policies, we need a wholesale rethinking of how our economy and our politics work, and for whom they work.The first three words of the Constitution, in bold script, are \u201cWe the People.\u201d The American story is a journey of continuous striving to more fully realize our founding principles of hope and opportunity for all.It is time to recommit ourselves to that vision of a country that measures our nation\u2019s success not at the boardroom table, but at kitchen tables across America. Bernie Sanders stands for that America, and so I stand with Bernie Sanders for president.Jeff Merkley is a Democratic senator from Oregon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egyptian Police Official Files Complaint Against Reuters", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 An Egyptian police official filed a criminal complaint against Reuters after the news agency published an article last week connecting the police to the disappearance of an Italian student, Giulio Regeni, prosecutors said on Saturday.The complaint, filed Friday, accused Reuters and its Cairo bureau chief of spreading false news and harming Egypt\u2019s image, raising new alarms about a crackdown on journalists in Egypt.Prosecutors said on Saturday that they were investigating the complaint.It was the most prominent legal action against a foreign media organization since the prosecution in 2014 of three journalists working for Al Jazeera English. But while that case was inflected with political tensions between Egypt and Qatar, which owns Al Jazeera, the move against Reuters seemed driven by the agency\u2019s reporting on a topic of considerable sensitivity to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Mr. Regeni\u2019s case has unnerved the government, focusing unwanted international attention on abuse by Egypt\u2019s security services and straining the country\u2019s relations with Italy, a close ally and trading partner. This month, Italy recalled its ambassador to Egypt to protest what the Italian government said was a lack of Egyptian cooperation in a joint investigation into Mr. Regeni\u2019s death.The scrutiny of the case comes as Mr. Sisi faces growing criticism at home, including rare protests, over his handling of the economy and other issues.Mr. Regeni, 28, disappeared on Jan. 25 in Cairo, when the city was blanketed by security agents trying to prevent protests on the anniversary of the 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Regeni\u2019s body, beaten and burned, was discovered outside Cairo on Feb. 3, the authorities said. His injuries included cigarette burns and signs he had been beaten on his feet \u2014 telltale signs of abuse by the security services, according to Egyptian human rights workers.The authorities have denied reports that Mr. Regeni was in state custody but have not provided a credible alternate theory for the crime. On Thursday, Reuters published an article citing six unnamed intelligence and police officials who said that Mr. Regeni was detained by plainclothes police officers on the day he disappeared.The officials told Reuters that Mr. Regeni was taken to the Izbakiya police station, near downtown Cairo, and held for half an hour before he was transferred to a facility run by Egypt\u2019s homeland security agency.The officials quoted in the Reuters article said they did not know what happened to Mr. Regeni after he was detained.In a statement issued on Saturday, a Reuters spokesman, David Crundwell, said the article \u201cdid not state who is responsible for his death, and is consistent with Reuters\u2019 commitment to accurate and independent journalism.\u201dThe Interior Ministry, which supervises the police, denied the allegations in the Reuters article and said the government reserved the right to take legal action. Then on Friday, Maj. Mohamed Reda, the chief detective at the Izbakiya police station, filed an official complaint against Reuters.Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Houses From Canada Find a Home in Washington State", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byFRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. \u2014 Here in the San Juan Islands of northwest Washington State, where a severe shortage of affordable housing threatens the economy and the community, a small nonprofit group has found an unlikely way to help anchor families that are struggling to stay \u2014 by lifting up unloved houses in Canada, hoisting them onto barges and hauling them to where they are needed.The houses are small by modern standards and old, built in the early to mid-20th century in a booming suburb of Victoria, British Columbia, where eager buyers are now clearing the land to make way for new construction. But the structures had what builders call good bones, and the group, the San Juan Community HomeTrust, discovered that the cost of transporting them across the Haro Strait from Canada and restoring them here was comparable to the cost of building from scratch.The project met a rapidly growing need: A surge of tourism and vacation home buyers in San Juan County \u2014 an archipelago of islands about 70 miles from Seattle, reachable only by air, boat or ferry \u2014 has gone hand-in-hand in recent years with a decline in fishing, shipping and agriculture jobs that once supported a middle-class island life. The number of people living in poverty in the county has risen about 17 percent since the end of the recession in 2009, according to census figures, even as the economic recovery in Washington and around the nation gained steam.National housing experts said the house relocation project here and another on a nearby island might be the first of their kind. But examples of the innovation that inspired the effort, they said, are easy to find \u2014 fueled in many spots around the nation by desperation as homelessness has risen and working-class families have struggled with rising prices and rents, or an inability to find homes at all.Stricter environmental rules now in effect in British Columbia are also making imported homes more appealing and affordable.Now, Mr. Connelly said, the province requires hazardous material reports and abatement, and the sorting of materials from metal to drywall for possible reuse. That has driven up the cost of tearing down an old house, he said, from 3,000 or so Canadian dollars in the 1990s to upward of $40,000 now (about $31,200 in American dollars).The older houses, which will stand within a development of 14 new homes, all suffered varying degrees of trauma in transit. Basements were left behind when the houses were shaved off their foundations. Chimneys were abandoned as well, because old masonry was too fragile and risky to move. In some cases roofs or exterior walls had to be carved away to allow a building to fit under or around obstacles like underpasses or trees.For the moment, the homes sit on steel I-beams and wooden blocks while concrete foundations are poured. In the way of all old houses, they are imperfect and uneven, with parts that have settled and sagged or were never built to exact specifications. Placing them on a level platform, Mr. Kilpatrick said, has exposed all of their quirks.\u201cThe house wasn\u2019t level where it came from,\u201d he said, pointing to a door that probably opened and closed easily on the old foundation, but now hangs askew and is in need of repair.Housing experts and board members at the San Juan Community HomeTrust said that beyond cost effectiveness, another appeal of the project was more subtle, but no less crucial: The trust\u2019s financial donors have responded well to the idea that old houses of character are being rescued, along with local families. A Pacific Northwest environmental ethos to reuse and recycle has become part of the fund-raising appeal, they said.\u201cYou have to create a buzz,\u201d said Sam Buck, the board\u2019s vice president. \u201cAnd this has gotten people here excited, more than we ever anticipated.\u201dFew people could be more excited than Kat Sherman, 36, and her fianc\u00e9, Adam D\u2019Errico, 37, who qualified to buy one of the houses. Both work at a hardware store, she in accounting while he manages the paint department. To make ends meet, both have second jobs stocking shelves at a grocery store.\u201cThe saying here is that you either own three homes or you have three jobs,\u201d Ms. Sherman said.The hard work will continue, she and Mr. D\u2019Errico said in an interview at the hardware store, but a home of their own will provide stability and permanence in a place they love.\u201cThis program is great in allowing people \u2014 the worker bees of the island \u2014 to be able to afford a home, to able to stay,\u201d Ms. Sherman said.An earlier version of this article switched the ages and last names of a couple who qualified to buy one of the recycled houses in Friday Harbor, Wash. He is Adam D\u2019Errico, 37, and she is Kat Sherman, 36.slide showAdvertisement"}

Roofs are leaking. And the children are not getting, by any stretch of the imagination, the education they need.\u201dThe Vermont senator took a break from the campaign trail before the New York primary on Tuesday to attend a conference hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a group that examines social, economic and environmental issues and is housed within a 16th-century villa inside Vatican City.Mr. Sanders spent most of the day sitting in an ornate room with marble floors, a large gold cross and a quaint bust that overlooked the conference.And even though the pope sent his regrets about not being able to attend, Mr. Sanders seized on the opportunity to praise Francis\u2019 \u201ctransformative role\u201d and to take his own denunciations of greed to a global stage. And though he remains an underdog in his quest for the White House, for at least one day Mr. Sanders was able to present himself as a representative of the United States.Mr. Sanders flew to Rome on a seven-hour charter flight right after the debate. On the plane he put the finishing touches on a 15-minute speech, changed his clothes and prepared for a long day at the Vatican. His wife, Jane, their children and several grandchildren came along.Soon after landing, Mr. Sanders and several advisers hustled into waiting vehicles and sped past ancient Italian buildings toward Vatican City, sirens blaring as the motorcade navigated narrow streets.Once he arrived, Mr. Sanders was quickly driven past a dozen or so Americans cheering at the Vatican gates, many holding handmade signs that read \u201cEx-Pats 4 Bernie,\u201d \u201cRome for Bernie,\u201d and \u201cRome is Berning.\u201dKatie Scarpone, 52, moved from the United States to Italy four years ago and waited outside the Vatican gates to catch a glimpse of Mr. Sanders. She said she had she voted for him in the primary held by Democrats abroad in March. \u201cI wanted to experience the enthusiasm that I see on TV,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s touching the hearts of the people.\u201dAhead of the state\u2019s April 19 primary, three presidential candidates have been working to highlight their New York-iness to voters. We had Matt Flegenheimer, a Times campaign reporter, assess their attributes.Mr. Sanders\u2019s speech to the conference hit familiar themes, including railing against the \u201ctop 1 percent.\u201d\u201cAt a time when so few have so much, and so many have so little, we must reject the foundations of this contemporary economy as immoral and unsustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cOur very soul as a nation has suffered as the public lost faith in political and social institutions.\u201dThe senator also cast Francis as an inspiring leader and said the pope\u2019s focus on treating people and the planet better should be a model followed by world leaders. \u201cPope Francis has given the most powerful name to the predicament of modern society,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cHe calls it the globalization of indifference.\u201dSoon after the speech, Mr. Sanders walked just outside a Vatican gate and shook hands with waiting supporters. As Italian journalists mobbed him and elbowed one another to get closer, he answered a few questions about why he had taken time off from the campaign trail, saying the invitation was one he \u201ccould just simply not refuse.\u201dWhen asked whether he had taken the trip to shore up support among New York\u2019s Catholic voters, Mr. Sanders quickly said, \u201cNo,\u201d threw up his right hand and walked back into the conference.Mr. Sanders planned to return to New York on Saturday. Though an actual meeting with the pope during his visit was always unlikely, the campaign held out hope until Pope Francis sent a handwritten note to Msgr. Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, a senior papal official and the academy\u2019s chancellor. The pope wrote that while he had wanted to stop by the conference, it conflicted with a planned trip to the Greek island of Lesbos to address the migrant crisis.\u201cYesterday I realized that today was going to be very complicated because of my trip to Lesbos,\u201d the pope wrote. \u201cToday I confirm this situation and would like to apologize for not being able to attend. I kindly ask you to greet the speakers and participants, requesting their understanding for this situation. I will keep them all in my prayers and good wishes, and send them my heartfelt thanks for their participation. May the Lord bless you. Fraternally, Franciscus.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said most Gaza fishermen used GPS equipment to measure their distance from shore.Ismail al-Shrafi, 62, a fisherman, said Sunday that he was unable to join his friends who were preparing their boats because the Israelis had confiscated his boat five months ago and taken it to the Israeli port of Ashdod. Mr. Shrafi said that his boat had been fired on and impounded within four nautical miles of Gaza\u2019s coast and that his son, fishing with him, had been injured by the Israeli fire.Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military, had no comment on the case involving Mr. Shrafi. Colonel Lerner denied that naval forces had fired at boats within the permitted fishing zone. But he said, \u201cAnybody who breaches the limit is stopped or arrested, and those who don\u2019t comply with the navy forces\u2019 calls to turn back \u2014 then, yes, their boats can be impounded.\u201dOver the weekend, the Israeli Navy sank a suspected smuggling boat that was approaching Gaza from Egypt. Naval forces fired warning shots, and the boat\u2019s crew threw \u201csuspicious cargo overboard\u201d and jumped into the sea before the vessel was sunk, the military said.Under the Oslo peace accords, the fishing zone was supposed to extend to 20 nautical miles, but it has shrunk over the years as Israel has imposed greater restrictions, citing security concerns. In the years before 2006, fishermen could go out 10 to 12 nautical miles, but from 2006 until 2012 the zone was limited to three nautical miles.Israeli officials said the Israeli Navy and the office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, known as Cogat, the Israeli agency that serves as a liaison with the Palestinians on civilian affairs, had decided on Sunday\u2019s expansion to coincide with the opening of the fishing season.The expansion of the fishing zone is expected to add 400,000 shekels, or nearly $106,000, to the 6 million shekels in annual revenue generated by Gaza\u2019s fishing industry, according to Cogat. The waters farther out offer greater quantities of fish and different varieties.Cogat officials said the expansion was part of a policy of loosening restrictions on the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza to improve the economy and foster stability.Majd Al Waheidi reported from Gaza, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}

His efforts to rebuild the U.S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were being hit from left, right and center. And yet, by his own assessment, those efforts were vastly underappreciated. \u201cI actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.\u201dIt was a notably grand claim, especially given the tenor in which presidential candidates of both parties had taken to criticizing the state of the American economy \u2014 \u201cMany are still barely getting by,\u201d Hillary Clinton said, while Donald Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re a third-world nation.\u201d Asked if he was frustrated by all the criticism, Obama insisted that he wasn\u2019t, at least not personally. \u201cIt has frustrated me only insofar as it has shaped the political debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were moving so fast early on that we couldn\u2019t take victory laps. We couldn\u2019t explain everything we were doing. I mean, one day we\u2019re saving the banks; the next day we\u2019re saving the auto industry; the next day we\u2019re trying to see whether we can have some impact on the housing market.\u201dThe result, he said, was that he lacked the political capital to do more. As his presidency nears its end, this has become an increasingly common refrain from Obama, who, despite his prodigious skills as an orator, has come to seem more confident about his achievements than about his ability to promote them. \u201cI mean, the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we might have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate.\u201dThe president had come to this factory, built by Saft America for the manufacture of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, for a kind of belated victory lap. One of Obama\u2019s first major acts as president was to sign the American Recovery and Re\u00adinvestment Act, and some of the money in that bill went to Saft. Now batteries were rolling off the line, and Obama had stopped by to shine the national spotlight on how far we had come since the financial crisis.But the president did seem frustrated. As he tried to sum up his economic legacy in Florida, our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned, seemingly to the consternation of the Secret Service. When we got back on Air Force One, he sent an aide to ask if we could continue the conversation; when I joined him again, he looked as if he\u2019d been stewing over something. He quickly returned to the topic of public perception. \u201cIf you ask the average person on the streets, \u2018Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?\u2019 probably 70 percent would say they\u2019ve gone up,\u201d Obama said, with some justifiable exasperation \u2014 the deficit has in fact declined (by roughly three-quarters) since he took office, and polls do show that a large majority of Americans believe the opposite.Obama is animated by a sense that, looking at the world around him, the U.S. economy is in much better shape than the public appreciates, especially when measured against the depths of the financial crisis and the possibility \u2014 now rarely even considered \u2014 that things could have been much, much worse. Over a series of conversations in the Oval Office, on Air Force One and in Florida, Obama analyzed, sometimes with startling frankness, nearly every element of his economic agenda since he came into office. His economy has certainly come further than most people recognize. The private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months \u2014 some 14.4 million new jobs in all \u2014 the longest period of sustained job growth on record. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent the year Obama took office, the highest it had been since 1983, under Ronald Reagan, is now 5 percent, lower than when Reagan left office. The budget deficit has fallen by roughly $1 trillion during his two terms. And overall U.S. economic growth has significantly outpaced that of every other advanced nation.Gene Sperling, the former director of the National Economic Council who spent hours inside the Oval Office debating and devising the president\u2019s economic strategy, told me, \u201cIf we were back in early 2009 \u2014 when we were coming to work every morning with clenched stomachs, with the economy losing 800,000 jobs a month and the Dow under 7,000 \u2014 and someone said that by your last year in office, unemployment would be 5 percent, the deficit would be under 3 percent, AIG would have turned a profit and we made all our money back on the banks, that would\u2019ve been beyond anybody\u2019s wildest expectations.\u201dThere are, of course, many reasons so few Americans seem to be celebrating. \u201cHow people feel about the economy,\u201d Obama told me, giving one part of his own theory, is influenced by \u201cwhat they hear.\u201d He went on: \u201cAnd if you have a political party \u2014 in this case, the Republicans \u2014 that denies any progress and is constantly channeling to their base, which is sizable, say, 40 percent of the population, that things are terrible all the time, then people will start absorbing that.\u201dBut as Obama also acknowledged, the public anger about the economy is not without empirical basis. A large swath of the nation has dropped out of the labor force completely, and the reality for the average American family is that its household income is $4,000 less than it was when Bill Clinton left office. Economic inequality, meanwhile, has only grown worse, with the top 1 percent of American households taking in more than half of the recent gains in income growth. \u201cMillions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it to save their lives,\u201d Clinton himself said of Obama\u2019s economy in March, while on the campaign trail for his wife. \u201cPeople are upset, frankly; they\u2019re anxiety-ridden, they\u2019re disoriented, because they don\u2019t see themselves in that picture.\u201dIt is this disconnect that haunts Obama. He has, by his own lights, managed the recovery as well as any president ever could, with results that in many cases exceeded his own best hopes. But despite the gains of the past seven years, many Americans have been left behind. Something has changed, and as he prepares to leave office, Obama seems to understand that his economic legacy might be judged not just by what he has done, but by how the results compare to a bygone era of middle-class opportunity, one that perhaps no president, faced with the sweeping changes transforming the global economy, could ever bring back.The next day Obama found himself in the Cabinet Room just down the hall from the Oval Office, along with McCain and congressional leaders from both parties. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, was developing a bank bailout by which the Treasury would buy up to $700 billion in shaky mortgage-backed securities \u2014 \u201ctroubled assets\u201d \u2014 a plan that eventually became the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. He needed votes, and Republicans weren\u2019t going for it. Nobody wanted to be seen as a friend of the banks.\u201cWe\u2019re sitting around a table, McCain is on one side, I\u2019m on the other, Bernanke and Paulson and President Bush,\u201d Obama recalled. \u201cPaulson says, \u2018If we don\u2019t take action now, we could go into a free fall.\u2019 And given how bad the politics were, it was still very tempting for Nancy and Harry\u201d \u2014 that is, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid \u2014 \u201cto let the Republicans do what they needed to do.\u201dMany within Bush\u2019s own party were supporting an alternative bill that was focused on mortgage-\u00adasset insurance and tax cuts. But Obama, convinced that anything short of a major bailout could lead to economic catastrophe, said Democrats should back Paulson\u2019s plan. They did.It was a rare moment of bipartisanship, with long-term political consequences. To Obama, this was a necessary alliance with Wall Street and a Republican president. To many others, it looked like a sweetheart deal for the same people who created the mess; some critics wondered why he was not equally quick to help aggrieved homeowners through an aggressive mortgage-relief or forgiveness program. \u201cThe whole thing about financial crises is the tools that work are the ones that will make you look like you\u2019re in bed with the banks,\u201d said Timothy Geithner, an architect of TARP whom Obama made his Treasury secretary.The strange hot-cold relationship with Wall Street made the next part of Obama\u2019s program extremely complicated. When Obama took office, he turned immediately to trying to pass a stimulus package. If TARP was meant to keep the economy out of free fall, the stimulus was meant to help it get back into good shape. The crucial questions was: How much money was needed?Many argue today that Obama\u2019s $800 billion plan, the one that eventually became law, was not enough. With a bigger boost, the economy would have recovered much more quickly and years of needless suffering could have been allayed. In truth, of course, the political headwinds against stimulus were extraordinary. Republicans dismissed it as an irresponsible shopping spree that would leave the country in even greater debt. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader in the House, physically threw the bill on the ground, arguing that it was \u201cnothing more than spending, spending and more spending.\u201d But Democrats, led by the \u201cdeficit hawk\u201d wing of the party, also fought against anything too ambitious, and Obama, still in the first month of his presidency, was left in the position of negotiating with his own party, such that he was just barely able to get the $800 billion on a straight party-line vote.At first, the results of the stimulus were just as feeble as a stalwart Keynesian might predict. The economy needed a big injection, but it got only a medium-size one, so it continued to falter. A January 2009 report from the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers projected that the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent. Instead, it climbed to 10 percent in 2009 and only fell back below 8 percent in 2012, leading to criticism that the stimulus was ineffective. Obama\u2019s critics regularly trot out the talking point that Obama\u2019s economy is \u201cthe worst recovery since World War II.\u201d Judged solely by the growth of gross domestic product, that is accurate. But Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and co-author of \u201cThis Time Is Different,\u201d a well-regarded history of financial crises, scoffed when I mentioned the \u201cworst recovery\u201d epithet. \u201cWell, have we had a systemic financial crisis since World War II?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cI mean this was like nothing we\u2019ve experienced since World War II. The 1982 Volcker recession was nothing compared to this, and so you have to look at the nature of the shock.\u201dObama, though, was unable or unwilling to rhetorically underscore the severity of the crisis as it unfolded, so perhaps what should have been seen as successes were seen as failures. \u201cIt was a delicate balance throughout 2009 and 2010 to be straight with the American people about the depths of the problem, how close we were to disaster, without scaring the heck out of them,\u201d Obama said.Beyond the messaging challenge, Obama faced a practical bind as well: Just as he was trying to reinflate the economy, he was also being forced to cut government jobs, under pressure from Republicans who contended that government bloat and the cost of it could create our next financial crisis. Call it an anti-stimulus. \u201cThis is the first recovery where you actually saw the government work force decline, and that created this massive fiscal drag throughout the recovery,\u201d Obama said.Despite all this, over the course of his presidency, Obama has actually been able to oversee a much larger stimulus than has been typically reported. If you add up all of his administration\u2019s classic stimulus measures, including the many tax breaks the administration extended, you get $1.4 trillion, a figure that is nearly twice the original figure. The anti-stimulus, then, was counteracted by a stealth stimulus.\u201cProgressives don\u2019t fully appreciate the degree to which the 2011 budget deal not only averted a potential default but actually limited the potential damage of a newly emboldened Congress in imposing austerity on a still-fragile recovery,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd by me winning in 2012 and getting the Bush tax cuts for the upper 2 percent repealed, we ended up getting a grand bargain. It\u2019s just we got it sequentially instead of all at once.\u201dWhen I asked Barney Frank about how history will judge the recovery, he was simultaneously rueful and amused. As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Frank was one of the major legislative architects of Obama\u2019s economic program. \u201cYou get no credit for disaster averted or damage minimized,\u201d Frank said. By way of illustration, he described a bumper sticker that a friend made him in 2010, with a slogan that could have worked just as well for Obama: \u201cThings would have sucked worse without me.\u201d Frank, with a halfhearted laugh, added, \u201cThat\u2019s not a very salable message.\u201dIn December 2009, Obama was not reluctant to chastise bankers. \u201cI did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street,\u201d he told Steve Kroft on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cThe people on Wall Street still don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t get it. They\u2019re still puzzled, \u2018Why is it that people are mad at the banks?\u2019\u2009\u201dGiven the national mood at the time, Obama\u2019s words shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to the business leaders. But the financial sector had buoyed Obama\u2019s campaign, giving him $16 million in political support, nearly twice what McCain received from it, and some executives responded to his new populism in emotional terms. \u201cIt\u2019s a war,\u201d Stephen Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone Group, the giant private-equity firm, said of Obama in 2010 and his effort to close a tax loophole that benefited the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.\u201d (Schwarzman later apologized.) Others seemed more concerned with the language itself. In 2011, Leon Cooperman, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, wrote a public letter to Obama, saying: \u201cThe divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them. It is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents.\u201dWhen I asked him about these reactions, Obama laughed. The criticism he leveled at Wall Street \u201cwas extraordinarily mild,\u201d he said, but \u201cit hurt their feelings. I would have some of them say to me, \u2018You know, my son came home and asked me, \u2018Am I a fat cat?\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed again.Obama\u2019s rhetoric does seem mild, at least compared with the withering contempt of, say, Franklin Roosevelt, who, laying out the objectives for the second stage of the New Deal in 1936, said that reckless bankers and speculators are \u201cunanimous in their hate for me \u2014 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d Obama, to the contrary, seems to find their hatred irritating. \u201cOne of the constants that I\u2019ve had to deal with over the last few years is folks on Wall Street complaining even as the stock market went from in the 6,000s to 16,000 or 17,000,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be constantly complaining about our economic policies. That\u2019s not rooted in anything they\u2019re experiencing; it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes.\u201dWall Street\u2019s biggest fight with Obama was over the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Obama signed into law in the summer of 2010. The legislation, which runs to 2,223 pages, limited Wall Street\u2019s riskiest trading schemes, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and created a system to wind down failing banks without taxpayer-funded bailouts and break up banks that don\u2019t comply. Like the stimulus, Dodd-Frank has been seen as both going too far and not far enough.Some economists have suggested that the reform package, combined with the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to force the banks to hold more capital, most likely slowed lending and potentially economic growth in the short term. The new rules may have been sensible in the aftermath of the crisis, but they did take an economic toll. \u201cGrowth requires access to capital to finance investments in plant, equipment, technology, and workers,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now runs American Action Forum, a right-leaning research group. \u201cDodd-Frank made capital scarcer and more expensive at a time when the weak economy desperately needed a boost to growth.\u201d Holtz-Eakin estimated in 2015 that the regulations would shave $895 billion off gross domestic product over the next decade.Obama sees the legislation in more complicated terms. He said that he liked the film \u201cThe Big Short\u201d \u2014 a vivid portrayal of the 2008 crisis with a special emphasis on the avarice of its main architects \u2014 but not its ending. It suggests, wrongly, he said, that nothing has changed on Wall Street. The financial sector \u201cis bigger, absorbs more resources and maybe most importantly, more talent than I would like to see. I would like folks who are really good at math to be going into engineering and the sciences more than they\u2019re going into trying to build algorithms to beat the market and to work arbitrage,\u201d he said.\u201cBut there is no doubt that the financial system is substantially more stable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that we have not dismantled the financial system, and in that sense, Bernie Sanders\u2019s critique is correct\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Vermont senator and presidential aspirant who regularly calls to break up America\u2019s biggest banks. \u201cBut one of the things that I\u2019ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction. It\u2019s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences.\u201d\u201cThe reason I\u2019m here today is because Saft is telling a story about the amazing work that people all across this country have done to bring America back from one of the worst financial crises in our history,\u201d Obama said, surveying the crowd.He added: \u201cAnybody who says we are not absolutely better off today than we were just seven years ago, they\u2019re not leveling with you. They\u2019re not telling the truth.\u201dThe story Obama told was one of American ingenuity and growth since the financial crisis. Unemployment in Florida peaked at 11.2 percent in 2009, higher than the national average, and the state was a center for home foreclosures. Saft America was an example not of the government\u2019s effort just to reduce unemployment right now, which it has, but also to spur investment in the next-generation green technologies, like lithium-ion batteries, that will help the economy expand for decades to come.In a way, though, the plant was inadvertently telling a more complicated story, about globalization and the changing nature of commerce. Saft America is a unit of Saft Groupe, a French company with holdings around the world. Sales of lithium-ion batteries have been considerably slower than anticipated, and the factory has yet to turn a profit. The French parent doesn\u2019t expect profitability for another two or three years and has already written down part of its investment on the factory.Here was a factory built, in part, with U.S. government dollars for the benefit of the local and national economy. Yet the factory, its technology and its patents are all owned by a foreign corporation. Its French chief executive is almost completely detached from the community here in Jacksonville; he did not even attend Obama\u2019s speech. And the factory\u2019s profits, to the extent they ever come, may very well be sent abroad instead of being reinvested here.The factory visit might also tell a more complicated story about the presidency. It has always been the case that voters credit or, more often, blame the president for the nation\u2019s economic performance. But it is also the case that the president generally has considerably less sway to move the economy than even he might like to acknowledge. And as the economy continues to disperse, that sway may be diminishing further. A president has less power than ever, in either a hard- power (legal/regulatory) or soft-power (cultural) sense, over American chief executives, let alone over the chief executives of multinationals based in France or China or other places where many U.S. employers make their headquarters.In the assembly room after the speech, Obama acknowledged as much. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about inversions,\u201d Obama said, referring to the practice whereby American companies effectively move overseas, \u201cor you\u2019re talking about C.E.O. perks or the gap between what the assembly-line worker is making compared to what the C.E.O. is making, all those things used to be constrained by the fact that you live in the city, you\u2019re going to church in that city, your kids might be going to the same school as the guy who is working on the assembly line because public schools actually were invested in,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd all those constraining factors have been greatly reduced or, in some cases, eliminated entirely. And that contributes to the trends toward inequality. That contributes to, I think, a divergence between how the people who run these companies and economic elites think about their responsibilities and the policies that they promote with political leaders. And that\u2019s had, I think, a damaging effect on the economy overall.\u201dLeaning forward in his chair, Obama described the profound structural shifts in the economy over the past two decades that voters often don\u2019t appreciate or acknowledge. \u201cIf you are a blue-collar worker, you saw manufacturing head out to China,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a town, the plant closes. But \u2014 in part because of the housing bubble \u2014 a whole bunch of blue-collar manufacturing workers could suddenly shift into construction.\u201dThe underlying economic decay was covered up by cheap credit, as homeowners made up for the shortfall in wage growth with low-interest second mortgages and unprecedented loads of credit-card debt. And that \u201cmeant that people felt pretty good in terms of their purchasing power even though their underlying situations hadn\u2019t improved appreciably,\u201d Obama said. Then the bubble bursts, \u201cand suddenly they get washed away.\u201d Those construction jobs have returned slowly, and many of those manufacturing jobs never came back at all.\u201cThey\u2019d be much worse off had we not taken the steps that we took,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut they have a sense that it\u2019s a little more of a struggle for them than it might have been for their parents or for their grandparents.\u201dObama considered the problem from a political perspective. \u201cIn some ways,\u201d he said, \u201cengaging in those hard changes that we need to make to create a more nimble, dynamic economy doesn\u2019t yield immediate benefits and can seem like a distraction or an effort to undermine a bygone era that doesn\u2019t exist. And that then feeds, both on the left and the right, a temptation to say, \u2018If we could just go back to an era in which our borders were closed,\u2019 or \u2018If we could just go back to a time when everybody had a defined-benefit plan,\u2019 or \u2018We could just go back to a time when there wasn\u2019t any immigrant that was taking my job, things would be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d He didn\u2019t mention Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders by name, but the implications were obvious.It was Obama\u2019s boldest piece of legislation and the one that will most likely define him. It has been largely viewed as a social program, a way to provide health insurance to tens of millions of uncovered citizens. But the bill, which affected not just insurance companies but doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, also had an immediate and growing impact on the economy as a whole. The health care industry accounts for 17.5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, and health care spending accounts for 8 percent of the average household budget. Of course, the largest economic challenge most Americans ever confront comes in the form of a sudden health crisis. \u201cIn the long term,\u201d Sperling told me, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act will actually be seen as one of the great economic accomplishments, not just health care, economic. Because it actually is closing a key part of the insecurity gap.\u201dIn closing that gap, though, Obama has been confronted with a knotty economic and political paradox. The legislation was designed to slow the growth of health care costs, even as it extended coverage. Slowing the growth of an industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of the U.S. economy is inevitably going to mean slowing the growth of the economy as a whole. The legislation was also designed to exert a more subtle economic influence. For most of the postwar era, most Americans received health insurance from their employers, in the form of benefits. If they quit their jobs or were fired, they could lose those benefits, and if they had a pre-existing condition, they could have a hard time getting them back, even if they got a new job with good benefits elsewhere. That meant they would be much less likely to leave a job, and that meant employers could be a little less worried about raising wages, because they had a somewhat captive work force. In the age of the gig economy, more portable insurance could transform the way we work and potentially have a real effect on wages in some sectors.In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that the Affordable Care Act would \u201creduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024\u201d \u2014 a seemingly disastrous outcome for the economy. But, the director of the office, Doug Elmendorf, later wrote, \u201cThe reason for the reduction in the supply of labor is that the provisions of the A.C.A. reduce the incentive to work for certain subsets of the population.\u201d In other words, a lot of people worked because they had to, in order to keep their insurance. Now they could quit, even if they were sick; a positive development for them, but with a perverse effect on the economy.And for all of that, Americans do not yet seem to be feeling the benefits of the new program, in part because the benefits remain uncertain. \u201cIf your health care premiums go up by 6 percent, you\u2019re still irritated,\u201d Obama said, \u201ceven though the trend lines have been those premiums are going up 15 percent.\u201dRepublicans were unanimously opposed to the bill, and Obama could pass only so much major legislation before the congressional election that many expected to flip House control from the Democrats to the Republicans, as it indeed did. That meant that he had to choose the A.C.A. over any number of other high-priority agenda items, including another stimulus, perhaps in the form of a massive infrastructure bill, which would have given the economy an unambiguous boost. \u201cIf you went back a few years, you might say, \u2018Well, he should\u2019ve focused even more on pushing through a bigger fiscal stimulus, which he could have if he wasn\u2019t going for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Rogoff said. \u201cThat was a trade-off he made, and it cost him.\u201dObama knows it. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, is that our failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project \u2014 it was the perfect time to do it; low interest rates, construction industry is still on its heels, massive need \u2014 the fact that we failed to do that, for example, cost us time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery.\u201dAfter 2010, all that was available to Obama was executive action: The ascendant G.O.P. made anything else nearly impossible. So the president turned more and more to regulatory rule changes and executive orders. He raised the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10; he overhauled immigration policy to protect some illegal immigrants from deportation (the Supreme Court just heard a case to overrule the action); he signed an order calling on government agencies with oversight of industry to find ways to make them more competitive, like pressing cable companies to let customers use cable boxes made by rivals. But without Congress, the big legislative moves, the ones that would really change history, seemed past.\u201cI can probably tick off three or four common-sense things we could have done where we\u2019d be growing a percentage or two faster each year,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe could have brought down the unemployment rate lower, faster. We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did. And those things keep me up at night sometimes.\u201dIt was a scene that underscored a challenge facing the U.S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality: We\u2019re not only losing jobs to overseas competition, we\u2019re losing them to technology. Obama noted the robots, too. \u201cWe just saw here those robots were pretty impressive, but also pointed to the direction the economy is going,\u201d he said.He clearly recognizes the problem \u2014 he said he spends a lot of time thinking about it \u2014 but he also knows the solutions will come only when he is long out of office. Many citizens, he said, back on Air Force One, \u201chave to worry about retraining at some point in their careers, because they can\u2019t anticipate being in one place for 30 years. The occupational mix in the economy places greater demands on people because it\u2019s changing more rapidly. And all of this makes people feel that they don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner.\u201d For whatever sense of \u201cuncertainty\u201d business leaders lament, this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that I pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d he said, bringing up the free-trade pact that, uniquely, has divided both parties, \u201cnot because I\u2019m not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence of globalization, but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the nature of global supply chains, and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas, or try to export our environmental standards overseas so that we have more of a level playing field.\u201dWhether a president can truly improve, or damage, an economy remains an open question. The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Economists credit the Fed\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down. At the same time, the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality, swelling the price of real estate and corporate profits, even as savers and retirees dependent on fixed-income assets have suffered.That can cut either way in terms of a president\u2019s economic legacy. Critics of Obama, including the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, credit Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Janet Yellen, the current chairwoman, for whatever recovery we\u2019ve had since the crisis, contending it happened in spite of the president. \u201cI think the Federal Reserve has done more,\u201d Ryan said at a January news conference. Frank, for his part, almost jumped through the phone when I mentioned that argument during an interview. \u201cAnd Bernanke and Yellen were appointed by whom? Neither Bernanke or Yellen would have been able to do what they were doing without his full backing.\u201dUltimately, however, Obama said the lessons of his time in office are being misunderstood in the election campaigns. \u201cIf you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don\u2019t simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSlashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they\u2019ll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible.\u201dHe continued: \u201cIf we can\u2019t puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that\u2019s been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in interest-rate policy \u2014 if we can\u2019t describe that effectively, then we\u2019re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin is a financial columnist for The New York Times, founder and editor at large of DealBook and co-anchor of CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It became the first South Korean governing party in 16 years without a parliamentary majority, leaving Ms. Park to face the prospect of being an early lame duck. The main opposition Minjoo Party won 123 seats, replacing Saenuri as the top political group in Parliament even though it, too, lacks a majority.The vote has been widely billed as a referendum on Ms. Park and a bellwether for the presidential election in late 2017. Pollsters had predicted an easy majority for her party. \u201cWe failed to read the minds of the people, even when they were disappointed and reproached us,\u201d said An Kyeong-hwan, a spokesman for the governing party.The centrist People\u2019s Party, a group recently spun off from the opposition Minjoo Party, won 38 on Wednesday. The rest of the seats were taken by a small progressive party and independent candidates.With political power and policy-making authority concentrated in the presidency, no immediate change in the nation\u2019s foreign policy was expected. But the progressive opposition will now be more likely to press Ms. Park to amend her hard-line North Korea policy, which is focused on enforcing sanctions, in favor of more dialogue with the North.Ms. Park, a daughter of Park Chung-hee, South Korea\u2019s military dictator from 1961 to 1979, has emerged as a highly divisive leader. The vote\u2019s outcome appeared to be a rejection of her style of governance, analysts said. Since taking office in early 2013, she has branded herself a tough-minded leader dedicated to national security. Her approval ratings hovered above 40 percent.They hailed her uncompromising stance against North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons development, exemplified by her recent decision to shut down a factory park the South had jointly run with the North. But many South Koreans also view her as a leader who suppresses freedom of speech and dissent within her government.Ms. Park had appealed for a decisive majority in Parliament to help her deal with challenges like rising household debt, high youth unemployment and soaring welfare costs for a rapidly aging population.She has blamed gridlock in Parliament for her failure to spur economic growth and create jobs by introducing deregulation, labor and other reform bills before her five-year term ends in early 2018.\u201cWho could have predicted this surprise outcome?\u201d the political commentator Hwang Tae-soon said on Yonhap News Television. \u201cThe government party should have explained why its policies haven\u2019t worked as well as expected, and offered a vision. Instead, it blamed everything on a lack of cooperation from the opposition.\u201dTension with North Korea at election time usually helps the conservative party during elections. The North\u2019s recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launching have dominated headlines, dwarfing criticism of Ms. Park\u2019s other policies. But South Koreans watched her party with a cold eye as it slid into internal squabbling ahead of the elections.The results appeared to revive the presidential ambitions of Moon Jae-in, a Minjoo Party leader who had lost the 2012 presidential election to Ms. Park. Another winner was Ahn Cheol-soo, who quit the Minjoo Party in December to found the People\u2019s Party. Mr. Ahn, a former technology entrepreneur who is expected to run for president, seeks to woo voters disenchanted with the political establishment.Advertisement"}

The proposal would let the governor slow the incremental increases if the economy and state budget faltered in specific ways during the phase-in period, including six months of job losses and an annual decline in sales tax receipts.Just hours after the California vote, New York lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that they had reached a new budget agreement to raise the minimum wage in New York City to $15 by the end of 2018 and by the end of 2019 for city businesses with 10 or fewer employees. In suburban Long Island and Westchester County, the minimum will reach $15 by the end of 2021. In upstate New York, north of Westchester, all workers are assured only of reaching $12.50 by the end of 2020. After that, the plan is to move toward $15 on a schedule to be determined by the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget experts based on their analysis of the economic and budget impact of the higher wage.To his credit, Mr. Cuomo fought for a $15 minimum upstate, but could not prevail over the Republican-controlled Senate, which has, in effect, forced upstate workers to wait indefinitely for a minimally decent wage. The question now is whether low-wage voters upstate will vote their wallets by ousting lawmakers who have failed to represent their economic interests. According to living-wage data prepared by the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, even single workers in Buffalo, Syracuse and the North Country will require at least $15 an hour by 2021 to cover basic expenses.Caveats and concerns aside, both Mr. Cuomo and Gov.

{"Headline": "Say No to Fight Club, New York", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAFTER last month\u2019s vote by the State Assembly to approve mixed martial arts fighting, the bill only awaits signature by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for New York State to join the rest of the country in permitting this form of professional combat.The governor should veto it.New York has long been a pioneer in protecting citizens\u2019 health and safety. If the state now must be a holdout in order to keep vulnerable people safe, so be it.Event sponsors have long wanted to hold matches in Madison Square Garden and other marquee venues in New York. When they passed bills to permit that, Albany lawmakers argued that if the sport were legalized, fights would be regulated, reducing harm. They are also keen to see economic gains from the sport, potentially including millions of dollars in tax revenue.But Albany has discounted a risk that no one should wish to make a reality. Legalizing mixed martial arts fighting will cause more traumatic brain injuries among vulnerable young people. Some of these injuries will result in lifetime disabilities.The research is still in an early stage, but it is becoming clear enough: People who are repeatedly punched and kicked in the head run a disproportionate risk of permanent brain damage.Since we are still learning about the dangers of football, for example, it is neither prudent nor moral to expose more athletes to an unknown degree of risk. This is especially true when professional fighters do not have the protection of an organization like the N.F.L. Players Association. Mixed martial arts fighters are \u201cgig economy\u201d workers with little recourse should they find themselves unable to work through injury. Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, who voted against the bill, said she found it very painful to think of \u201cyoungsters who may think this is a way to gain notoriety.\u201dThe economic rationale for legalizing mixed martial arts is also misleading. As New Yorkers participating in mixed martial arts end up suffering traumatic brain injury and permanent disability, the state will most likely end up footing part of the bill to support them. The argument is a miserable one: Has the Empire State fallen so low that it cannot find work for its young people without purposely putting them in harm\u2019s way?To the lawmakers who said they hated to see people leave New York to see a mixed martial arts match elsewhere, the answer is, \u201cLet them go.\u201d Just because there are people willing to pay prostitutes or purchase street heroin does not mean the state should be obliged to legalize these harmful trades.Is the Empire State no longer an enlightened standard setter but so desperate a laggard that it will allow citizens to suffer repeated concussions because it\u2019s eager for the money and the jobs? The state cannot stop violence as entertainment elsewhere, but the governor can remind the rest of the country that it\u2019s not a New York value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian Parliament Cancels Cash Subsidies to 24 Million People", "Date": "2016-04-13", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s lame-duck Parliament approved a bill on Wednesday canceling cash subsidies to 24 million Iranians, angering the government of President Hassan Rouhani, local news outlets reported.Analysts said the action was a stick in the eye for Mr. Rouhani from the conservative-dominated Parliament, forcing him to figure out how to put the unpopular measure into effect.However, with sagging oil prices cutting Iran\u2019s national income, the International Monetary Fund and other groups have warned that Tehran will have to cut back the system of giving monthly cash payments to nearly all of its 80 million citizens or risk running huge deficits.As such, the Parliament\u2019s action places Mr. Rouhani in a difficult position, economists say. Canceling the subsidies is a critical part of any economic overhaul, something that Mr. Rouhani has promised to undertake. But the measure is likely to add to growing complaints over his handling of the economy.\u201cNo politician likes to be unpopular,\u201d Mohammad Sadegh Jahanisefad, an economist, said. \u201cEspecially since we have elections in two years time.\u201dAccording to new criteria outlined by the Parliament, the government will have to cancel monthly cash payments of around $12 a person for many civil servants, members of the armed forces, paramilitary volunteers and large groups who already receive social welfare, the Iranian Students News Agency reported on Tuesday.Iranians have been receiving the payments since 2010, after cutbacks in a state subsidy system that had become unsustainable. At the time, the Iranian government was subsidizing everything from bread to cars. Prices were increased, and people received the cash disbursements as compensation.Most urban Iranians say they do not need the payments, which are meager compared with the cost of living. But many people feel the monthly stipend is their fair share of the nation\u2019s wealth. Many others, including state employees, rely on the money.\u201cThis move is unfair and will create problems for most of the people,\u201d a government spokesman, Mohammad Bagher Nowbakht, told reporters.Another government official suggested an alternative way of determining who loses the payments that might be more equitable. \u201cCar ownership, real estate transactions, places of residence can also influence their ranking,\u201d Ahmad Meydari, a deputy minister of social welfare, was quoted as saying by the website Asr-e Iran.The government seems to already be doing something like what Mr. Meydari suggested.One middle-class merchant, Khosro Saadat, 58, said that his cash subsidies were canceled automatically when he bought a car worth $7,000, but that he had not felt the loss. \u201cBasically, the money they gave us was worth four meals in a fast-food restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cEating less is good for us.\u201dOutside the larger urban areas, where life is much cheaper, the subsidies often help support entire families. Mr. Nowbakht said the government would do its best to make sure such groups would not be affected.Advertisement"}

It would certainly blunt the argument made by those who say Washington should not make ambitious climate commitments because China is the world\u2019s main climate villain.But determining if China\u2019s carbon emissions have peaked and are declining is difficult. Scientists measure emissions by extrapolating from official energy data and can provide only rough estimates for emissions from individual countries. Conclusions about whether a country\u2019s emissions have peaked are definitive only in hindsight, years after the fact. Even then, economic changes could result years later in a resurgence in emissions.\u201cIt is quite possible that emissions will fall modestly from now on, implying that 2014 was the peak,\u201d they wrote.A set of data revisions scheduled to be released this fall could show that emissions from China dropped by 1 to 1.5 percent last year, Mr. Yang said.But there is also a strong case for less optimism.Another question is energy use. Electricity demand in China is expected to continue growing, and the easiest way to meet it will be through coal-burning power plants rather than alternative energy sources.Oil and natural gas use is also rising in China \u2014 from people driving cars, for example \u2014 and the growth of carbon emissions from that could exceed the drop in emissions from coal use.\u201cI think the total of China\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions will rise again in coming years,\u201d said Jiang Kejun, a senior researcher at the Energy Research Institute of China\u2019s main economic planning agency.Other skeptics note that Chinese cities are still growing. More than 55 percent of the population lives in cities now, but the government has set a goal of 60 percent by 2020. Urbanization means more construction and reliance on heavy industry, not to mention increased traffic.Chai Qimin, a senior director at China\u2019s National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said the experience of other nations suggested that emissions would continue to rise because China\u2019s economy was still developing.Most countries see carbon emissions fall when per capita gross domestic product climbs to between $20,000 to $40,000, but China\u2019s is still below $10,000, he said. \u201cChina has more industrialization and urbanization to do, which needs energy,\u201d he said.Some researchers say China could be in a period in which emissions fluctuate for several years before a sustained decline, as they did in the United States before 2007.\u201cI would be more confident to say that China has reached a plateau or period of low growth,\u201d said Glen Peters, a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo. \u201cI think to say \u2018peak\u2019 is a little bold.\u201dWhether or not emissions from China are already falling, most researchers agree they will reach a peak no later than 2025, five years ahead of Beijing\u2019s pledge.But officials and researchers now say that a 50 percent cut by 2020 is possible, and that the government may revise its target to make it more ambitious.\u201cIf China can revise this, then I\u2019d be very happy,\u201d Mr. Yang of the Natural Resources Defense Council said. \u201cChina would be playing a leadership role in climate change.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the Memo From China article on April 4, about the difficulty of determining whether carbon dioxide emissions in China are declining, misidentified the city in which the Natural Resources Defense Council has its headquarters.

The private financing round suggests that the company is now valued at about $60 billion \u2014 or more than $10 billion over the market value of PayPal Holdings, its closest analogue.It is also one of the most prominent symbols of strength in China\u2019s private sector, particularly in the field of online payments. Slow-moving state-run banks and an initial absence of regulation have allowed privately run companies to weave themselves into everyday life.Ant Financial now encompasses not only online payments, but also low-risk money market funds and a wallet app that enables easy payment from smartphones around China.Chinese consumers use Alipay to shop online, transfer money to one another, hail taxis, buy movie tickets and even invest their spare change. A money-market fund affiliated with Ant Financial was once one of the world\u2019s largest. According to the announcement on Tuesday, Alipay has more than 450 million users, or more than double the number PayPal has.Such is the power of the company that its latest financing was led by some of China\u2019s biggest state-controlled banks, including arms of the China Construction Bank and China Life Insurance. That indicates the level of government support that the company enjoys in a country where much of the economy is still state-directed.Ant Financial\u2019s previous fund-raising round, which was held last year, included China\u2019s national social security fund and an arm of the China Development Bank.In its statement on Tuesday, Ant Financial said it would use the money it had raised to support its global expansion and would also continue its work to connect people in rural China with its payment, loan and banking services.Ant Financial and Alipay face intense competition from Tencent Holdings, a Chinese rival that owns the WeChat mobile messaging system. Tencent has integrated e-commerce and financial services into recent versions of WeChat, encouraging use by a wide range of businesses, including department stores, municipal water and electricity departments, neighborhood bicycle repair shops and noodle stands.As a result, investors did not get a share of that business in 2014, when Alibaba listed its stock publicly in the United States. At the time, many pointed to Ant Financial as being in charge of some of the more innovative ideas that Alibaba had recently developed.Advertisement"}

As the scandal built, she resigned on Tuesday as parliamentary private secretary to John McDonnell, the party\u2019s spokesman on the economy.But another Labour legislator, Lisa Nandy, called on the party to suspend Ms. Shah pending an investigation. \u201cThere is a real problem for the Labour Party if we don\u2019t look like we are taking these things seriously,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cBut this is not just about the impact on the Labour Party, there is also the question here about what is the right thing to do.\u201dIn Parliament later in the day, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that Ms. Shah was still a full member of Labour\u2019s parliamentary party and also urged suspension. \u201cAnti-Semitism is effectively racism and we should call it out and fight it whenever we see it,\u201d he said.Labour said later that a suspension was agreed upon mutually by Mr. Corbyn and Ms. Shah while the party\u2019s national executive committee investigates.In 2014, before being elected, Ms. Shah endorsed a Facebook post displaying a graphic that showed Israel\u2019s outline superimposed on a map of the United States. The map was under the headline, \u201cSolution for Israel-Palestine conflict \u2014 relocate Israel into United States,\u201d with the comment, \u201cProblem solved.\u201dThe post suggested the United States had \u201cplenty of land\u201d to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to \u201cget their life and their land back.\u201d It said Israelis would be welcome and safe in America, while the \u201ctransportation cost\u201d would be less than three years\u2019 worth of Washington\u2019s support for Israeli defense spending.Ms. Shah added a note suggesting the plan might \u201csave them some pocket money.\u201dIn a statement, Ms. Shah said: \u201cI made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.

But proponents of exit are also now confronting the challenge of convincing the country that any freedom it gains from divorcing the Continent would not be offset by the risks to Britain\u2019s prosperity.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, framed the stakes recently, saying the prospect of British exit is \u201cthe biggest domestic risk to financial stability because, in part, of the issues around uncertainty.\u201dMr. Carney was immediately attacked by \u201cleave\u201d proponents for playing politics and defending the position of Prime Minister David Cameron, who is leading the campaign for Britain to stay.

And he has contempt for those who try to frighten Britons into thinking that a vote to quit the European Union will be disastrous for British trade and jobs.\u201cTrade has been going on for 5,000 years, and it\u2019s impossible to stop,\u201d he said.Having sold his Suffolk-made products all over the globe, Mr. Atkin said being inside the single-market, free-trade zone of the European Union was not a crucial factor for success. \u201cCustoms duties are completely irrelevant compared to the fluctuations of currency,\u201d he said.If Britons vote to leave, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty will come into force, giving the remaining 27 nations of the bloc up to two years to unwind their 43-year marriage to Britain and negotiate a new arrangement.Boris Johnson, London\u2019s mayor and a prominent advocate of Brexit, insists that leaving the European Union would be \u201cwin-win for all of us,\u201d that the bloc is an anachronism that \u201ccosts us a huge amount of money and subverts our democracy,\u201d and that voters are like prisoners who are afraid to step outside \u201cinto the sunlit uplands.\u201dBut very few economists think that way; most believe that Brexit would create havoc with the pound, cut growth, damage the financial center of the City of London and provoke a lengthy period of uncertainty, with no guarantee that Britain could quickly negotiate free-trade agreements.Within 10 or 15 years, some of these economists think, Britain would recover from a decision to leave. But the loss of economic growth in that transition period would be very hard to recapture. And the budget gain, quite small compared with the loss of gross domestic product, would be even smaller because some of the money that goes to Brussels would have to be paid directly to Britons anyway, replacing European programs with domestic versions of farm subsidies and research grants.One of the few pro-Brexit economists, Andrew Lilico, the executive director of the consulting firm Europe Economics, says the cost of leaving would be real, but would \u201croughly net out by around 2030.\u201dOthers see harsher consequences. A deal that preserved free trade with the European Union would almost certainly require \u2014 as the bloc does with Norway and Switzerland, part of what is known as the European Free Trade Association \u2014 acceptance of freedom of movement and labor and a sizable, if smaller, contribution to the European Union budget in any case.In the case of Brexit, many economists think that the Norway model would be the least bad for Britain\u2019s economy. But according to Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, Britain would be worse off, being subject to E.U. rules without participating in their formation.Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s minister of economy and finances, said the referendum was risky given the unhappy mood all over the Continent in the wake of the last economic downturn and its lingering effects.\u201cThe Brexit story is the sophisticated U.K. version of the general dissatisfaction in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe E.U. is not delivering growth and jobs 10 years later. People don\u2019t like the machine.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cBrexit is bad economically for both Britain and for the European Union,\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no vacuum, no withdrawal from the international system without pain.\u201d But worse would be the political impact, he said, because it could \u201calso show that one can \u2018undo\u2019 membership, which is dangerous.\u201dBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThere is a lot of scaremongering, with some supporters of remaining in the bloc talking of the loss of five million jobs if Britain votes to leave. (Mr. Cameron talks of three million jobs dependent on E.U. membership, plus higher costs for ordinary goods and mortgages.)The stakes are especially high for Britain\u2019s prominent service sector, which makes up more than 75 percent of economic output, and in particular financial services.Multinational banks like HSBC and Goldman Sachs have warned that Brexit would mean the export of jobs and headquarters to other European countries, because London-based companies would no longer have \u201cpassporting rights\u201d for their services in the European Union.That is a case also made by Leszek Balcerowicz, a former Polish deputy prime minister. To deter populists across Europe who might want to push their countries to follow Britain out the door, he said, the European Union, even against its own economic interests, would punish Britain.Lately, Mr. Johnson, the London mayor, has been saying that Britain is too important to be treated like small Norway and points to the \u201cCanadian model.\u201d Canada, with a population a bit more than half that of Britain, has negotiated a free-trade deal with the European Union.But that deal took four years to negotiate, and while completed in 2014 is still not ratified because of various European Union country complaints. And it is weak on financial services, a key issue for Britain and London itself, and international firms using London to sell services around Europe would have to open new bases inside the bloc, eventually, economists argue, leaching significant staff and investment away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Renewable Energy Stumbles Toward the Future", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byIt was just last summer that SunEdison was a Wall Street darling, the very air around the fast-growing company seeming to shimmer with potential.There is a timeless element to SunEdison\u2019s swift demise: an executive with an Icarus complex chasing a fast-growing market embarks on an aggressive strategy fueled by cheap debt. Soar. Crash. Burn. Repeat.Yet the collapse raises a bigger question: Can renewable-energy companies be profitable? Can green make green?The answer, of course, is yes. Just as soon as they cross over a fundamental hurdle: finding a strategy that actually works.\u201cWe haven\u2019t totally figured out exactly what the business models are going to look like, for who wins and who loses,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Significantly, though, the sudden decline in oil prices isn\u2019t largely to blame. The difficulties run much deeper, echoing industrial collapses of earlier eras \u2014 the telecom-industry boom and bust of the 1990s and early 2000s, and disruptive cycles before that.On the surface, the various green-energy companies all seem to be pursuing different strategies. But there is a unifying problem they have yet to overcome: Finding enough customers to support the costly infrastructure they must first build.SunEdison is far from being the only troubled green-energy business.What\u2019s remarkable is that these leading energy companies are struggling at a time when regulatory, public and investor support for the renewable-energy industry has arguably never been greater.Moreover, investors around the world sank hundreds of billions of dollars into clean-energy technologies last year even as the prices of competing fossil fuels \u2014 oil and natural gas \u2014 tumbled.Though development in renewable energy climbed in the last 15 years, the industry is still widely considered to be in its early stages. Nonetheless, there has been a race among companies to develop, commercialize and eventually prosper from what many see as one of the largest tectonic economic shifts in decades.And in the United States, the federal government recently approved a major new transmission line to move wind-generated electricity east from the Great Plains.But all good bubbles burst. What is happening in renewable energy now has similarities to the telecommunications bubble of the 1990s. Led by hard-charging executives seeking big paydays, giants like WorldCom, Global Crossing and Adelphia started far-reaching acquisition and capital-expenditure programs \u2014 burning through billions of dollars \u2014 to buy cable companies or bury long-haul fiber-optic cable under land and sea. They were all chasing expected high demand and soaring revenues from the dawn of the Internet.But the infrastructure they created lived on. Last weekend, when you binge-watched the fourth season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or streamed your own cooking show on Facebook Live, chances are better than not that your data zoomed through at least some of those networks.In that case, it turned out that if you build it, they will indeed come. But as many renewable energy companies are learning, building it costs dearly.Even before SunEdison, the landscape of green energy companies was littered with failed strategies.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Part of the conundrum for these companies is that the most effective way to cut costs has been to grow, to take advantage of economies of scale, certain forms of financing and generous subsidies that were set to expire.But with all that growth has come debt, and an inability to show a profit, even if the companies are creating value.\u201cClearly in a market that has had a lot of growth, you are going to have some companies \u2014 and in this case many companies \u2014 that try to do too much, too fast,\u201d said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, which invests in solar power. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to see a shakeout.\u201dBut it is especially the case at SunEdison, where its chief executive, Ahmad R. Chatila, set about expanding, seemingly in all directions at once.\u201dThis is going to be a big industry globally, but we\u2019re stumbling and bumbling to get there,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t trying to beat each other to the next rooftop they wouldn\u2019t be needing to do this financial engineering.\u201dStill, industry analysts and executives say that despite the fall of SunEdison, the future for renewable energy is bright.Indeed, there are a few stalwarts in the renewable-energy race.Take First Solar. The company, which supplies solar panels and develops solar farms, has had its share of troubles. It has been the target of shareholder lawsuits claiming it hid big problems and misrepresented its prospects. Its stock, at $62 a share, is a far cry from its bubble-peak of $311 in the spring of 2008.But by adopting a slower-growth strategy and reducing debt, First Solar is a rarity in the green-energy industry. It is profitable. Last year, the company made $546 million on $3.6 billion in revenue.For now, First Solar may be an anomaly, particularly amid uncertainty around the presidential election and the policy stances of candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump on renewable energy sources. Some warn that a lull could settle over the industry in the short term.\u201cThe Secretary Clinton perspective on lots of distributed clean energy couldn\u2019t be more different than the Trump view,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat could mean hugely different things for the growth of the industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abu Sayyaf Militants Thriving as Hostage-Takers in Philippines", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byMANILA \u2014 After the militant group Abu Sayyaf kidnapped a group of foreign citizens and killed six soldiers in the southern Philippines in late 2014, President Benigno S. Aquino III vowed to wipe the terrorists out.\u201cWe have several battalions,\u201d he said, not only line infantry but \u201csome of our most elite forces.\u201d Those troops had been ordered into \u201call of these mountain lairs and very heavily wooded jungle and dense areas to precisely deprive them of safe havens.\u201dInstead, Abu Sayyaf has kidnapped several more foreign citizens in the nearly year and a half since, bringing the total to at least 19, and its heightened campaign of high-profile abductions has attracted growing international attention.Abu Sayyaf has conducted kidnappings, bombings and battles with soldiers for more than 20 years in the southern Philippines, where many members of the impoverished local population regard it as an ally. Since 2002, the United States has periodically advised the Philippine military on combating the group.With an estimated strength of fewer than 500 fighters, the group was once linked to Al Qaeda but has more recently produced videos vowing allegiance to the Islamic State. There is little evidence beyond the videos, however, that it has received any substantive financial or technical assistance from the terrorist network.Abu Sayyaf\u2019s stated goal is to establish an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, but the military says it is at bottom a profit-driven criminal organization.Some analysts and political leaders have begun to question whether the armed forces are capable of carrying out Mr. Aquino\u2019s order to defeat the group.Vice President Jejomar Binay, who is a presidential candidate in an election set for May 9, is among those who have called for more efforts to eliminate kidnap-for-ransom groups operating on the island of Mindanao.\u201cThese groups are bandits, not rebels, and should be dealt with immediately and decisively,\u201d he said.Though the military vastly outnumbers Abu Sayyaf and has better training and more sophisticated weaponry, the soldiers face formidable obstacles fighting in the dense jungles where the group operates, said Col. Restituto Padilla Jr., a spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\u201cAt the tactical level, the bandits have the edge on mastery of the terrain,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have clearly mapped the whole area and know every nook and cranny.\u201dIn the last two decades, the group has kidnapped dozens of foreign citizens, receiving millions of dollars in ransom money, and some of that has been distributed to the local population, Colonel Padilla said. In addition, many of the Abu Sayyaf fighters have relatives and traditional clan ties to residents, all of which puts them at odds with government troops.\u201cThey have become local Robin Hoods, sought and revered by quite a lot of the locals,\u201d the colonel said.Matt Williams, country director in the Philippines for Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a risk management and security company, agreed with the military\u2019s assessment of a hostile theater of operations.\u201cThe area where the Abu Sayyaf operate is a nexus of crime, clan rivalries and endemic corruption,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who has been involved in hostage negotiations with the group. \u201cRansoms paid for the release of foreign hostages pump millions of dollars into an underground economy that is shared by armed clans, corrupt officials and intermediaries promising fast solutions to victims\u2019 families.\u201dIn the areas where the group operates, nearly two-thirds of the population lives below the national poverty line, Mr. Williams said. There are also high levels of mistrust of the government and the military in those areas, and many young men see collaboration with Abu Sayyaf as prestigious and lucrative, he said.\u201cThe Philippine military has the technical capability to contain and erode the Abu Sayyaf\u2019s operational capacity,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cWhat is lacking is the political will to resolve this growing security concern. President Aquino\u2019s government does not appear to have a workable military solution to eradicate the Abu Sayyaf.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "IPhone Sales Drop, and Apple\u2019s 13-Year Surge Ebbs", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, Apple created more than a decade\u2019s worth of new gadgets to fuel its historic growth.But the technology company\u2019s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday \u2014 a casualty of Apple\u2019s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers.Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries. Rival smartphone makers using Google\u2019s Android operating system continue to challenge the company with powerful, less expensive devices.Over all, Apple sold 16 percent fewer iPhones in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s best days are behind it,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. \u201cThe company grew at astronomical rates, and it\u2019s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201dApple\u2019s disappointing quarter is the latest in a string of bad reports from the biggest technology companies. While the reasons vary \u2014 including the long slump in personal computer sales and slipping prices for online ads \u2014 a common theme has been that as these companies have grown into giants, it has become harder and harder to keep up the momentum.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, described the decline as a \u201cpause,\u201d not a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business.\u201cThis, too, shall pass,\u201d he said in a call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright.\u201dApple\u2019s forecast for the current quarter did not make Wall Street more confident. The company projected revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion. That is much worse than Wall Street had been predicting.Amit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that Apple may be entering a period of slowing replacement sales, similar to what happened in the personal computer market a decade ago.Mr. Daryanani also noted that many companies had been hurt by the strong dollar, which makes American products more expensive overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s a common theme across technology companies,\u201d he said.Mr. Cook portrayed the slowdown as part of the normal two-year product cycle of Apple\u2019s iPhone. The company\u2019s larger iPhone 6 line, introduced in 2014, led to a surge in sales last year as customers upgraded, sending Apple\u2019s stock to a record high.\u201cIf you look at our installed base of iPhones today versus two years ago, it\u2019s increased 80 percent,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s newest phone, the four-inch iPhone SE, went on sale March 31 \u2014 too late to affect the second quarter\u2019s results \u2014 and Mr. Cook said that there was more demand for it than Apple could currently fill.Apple has high hopes for some of its consumer-oriented services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, as well as for its nascent Watch accessory, but those have yet to turn into giant businesses. Apple said first-year sales of the Watch exceeded first-year sales of the original iPhone, but declined to provide specific figures.The iPad tablet, once a powerful revenue generator for the company, has had disappointing sales in recent years, despite new, larger professional versions. But Mr. Cook said iPad sales would improve in the current quarter.Apple still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year. And the company said Tuesday that it would pass along more of that money to its shareholders. Apple said it would raise its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 57 cents a share and increase the amount of stock it buys back to $175 billion.Apple\u2019s services segment was one bright spot in the quarter, with revenue up 20 percent. The company ended the quarter with $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\u201cWhen we look at the dynamics of the iPhone business, we feel very good,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Although unit sales were down 16 percent, \u201cwe continue to draw millions of people that are buying their first smartphone to iPhone.\u201dDenny Fish, a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, said Tuesday that the fund sold some of its position in Apple in the first quarter, citing the company\u2019s growth challenges and worries about its position in China.Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to introduce other iPhones this year, which could give sales a jolt.Advertisement"}

Banks in India and elsewhere are pressing Mr. Mallya to get their money back. Authorities accuse him of money laundering, bribing bank officials, defaulting on loans and other misdeeds.Last weekend Indian authorities canceled Mr. Mallya\u2019s passport, nearly a week after a court in Mumbai issued a warrant for his arrest. On Thursday, India\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it would ask Britain \u2014 where authorities believe he is staying \u2014 to deport him.\u201cWe hide the sickness and ultimately it\u2019s the poor who suffer,\u201d said K. C. Chakrabarty, a former deputy governor of India\u2019s central bank. \u201cWe are addressing Vijay Mallya. He\u2019s not the problem. He\u2019s the symptom of the problem.\u201dMr. Mallya, who left India last month, disputes accusations by Indian lawmakers and lenders that he fled the country to avoid bad debts. \u201cI am an international businessman,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cI travel to and from India frequently. I did not flee from India and neither am I an absconder. Rubbish.\u201dCredit Suisse estimated that bad loans in the final months of last year totaled nearly $128 billion, making up more than 11 percent of outstanding loans, and said India\u2019s banking system had still more \u201cunrecognized stress.\u201dThe pain has rippled outside the country. Standard Chartered, a British bank, said in February that its India unit lost nearly $1 billion last year. The bank says it is selling problem loans.Diageo, the British spirits maker, has also been hit, after guaranteeing a $135 million loan last year from Standard Chartered to a company affiliated with Mr. Mallya. Diageo says it is pursuing the matter.The sour loans are raising questions about whether India\u2019s financial system could deal with the sort of debt crisis that hit the United States and Europe in 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re coming so late into the too-big-to-fail issue,\u201d said Susan Thomas, assistant professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research in Mumbai and a member of the country\u2019s bankruptcy law reform committee.When the post-2008 lending binge hit, Mr. Mallya saw a chance to help one of his newer businesses: airlines. His Kingfisher Airlines was initially modeled on the low-cost American carrier JetBlue, with an all-economy configuration that included seat-back TVs, unheard of on Indian domestic flights.Mr. Mallya quickly added a lavish business class to Kingfisher. Roomy seats came with champagne glasses filled with cider, since India forbids alcohol on domestic flights. The airline was a pet project of Mr. Mallya\u2019s; he examined the in-flight napkins and interviewed some of the prospective flight attendants himself.But Kingfisher Airlines suffered from an inefficient mix of planes and tough competition, which increased when it started flying internationally. Capitalizing on the looser lending practices, the airline persuaded its lenders to restructure its debt. Two years later, in 2012, Kingfisher stopped flying in the face of high fuel prices and a global slowdown.Kingfisher owed at least $1.4 billion in loans, much of it to state-controlled banks, as well as back pay to former employees and other bills. Because Mr. Mallya and his United Breweries Holdings backed some of the loans, creditors began pressing them for repayment. The dispute began to wind its way through the courts. Banks tried to seize Mr. Mallya\u2019s assets, including his estate in Goa.Late last year authorities raided Mr. Mallya\u2019s homes and offices in Mumbai, Bangalore and Goa.

{"Headline": "Chinese Phrase Adds Mystery to Anbang\u2019s About-Face on Starwood", "Date": "2016-04-01", "News": "Supported byThe phrase allows insurance companies to make overseas investments, provided the total does not exceed 15 percent of their assets. But the rule does not specify how to calculate the value of the foreign investments.For example, it does not indicate whether to use historical prices or market prices, nor which exchange rate to use. The rule does not even specify how to determine an insurer\u2019s assets, except to say that they shall be calculated at the end of the previous year.So regulators have a lot of wiggle room. If the China Insurance Regulatory Commission made an unfavorable calculation, it might have raised the uncertainty for Anbang, compelling the company and its partner to withdraw the bid.The derailed deal reflects the changing fortunes in China.But such overseas investments are coming under increased scrutiny as the Chinese economy slows.Overseas acquisitions account for a significant source of capital outflows. And those outflows, which have weighed on the currency and the markets, have become a major point of concern for the Chinese authorities.Anbang has been one of the most acquisitive Chinese insurers.\u201cIt would be good for everybody in China to see that the rules are being applied more uniformly than people would have anticipated,\u201d said David Zweig, the director of the Center on China\u2019s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.Financing, too, may have been an issue.Starwood was not comfortable with Anbang\u2019s ability to finance the latest bid of $14 billion, according to people briefed on the matter. An earlier bid by Marriott, just $700 million lower, appeared to meet Starwood\u2019s expectations.The 15 percent rule appears in Chinese insurance regulations as early as 2012. But it really became relevant only a year and a half ago, when the Chinese government started encouraging insurance companies to invest overseas. Even now, the Chinese insurance industry remains overwhelmingly domestic; only 1.5 percent of its assets were invested overseas as of last summer.Anbang is one of the few insurers that have made a big overseas push, so the company has been viewed as a test case of how the 15 percent rule would be enforced. But Anbang is a particularly complicated corporate group to analyze for calculating asset ratios.For example, Anbang bought a 35 percent stake in the Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank in 2011 for nearly $1 billion. But Anbang is closely held. And the limited publicly available data on the insurer does not make clear whether it has included a portion of the bank\u2019s assets in figures for its total domestic assets.Leslie Picker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egyptians Denounce President Sisi in Biggest Rally in 2 Years", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 More than a thousand people gathered in downtown Cairo on Friday, chanting slogans denouncing President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and protesting his decision to transfer sovereignty of two islands in the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia.The demonstration was the largest in at least two years in Egypt. And it was the most significant public challenge to Mr. Sisi by antigovernment activists who have been all but forced into the shadows by a state crackdown on dissent.By venturing into the streets in defiance of a strictly enforced ban on political protest \u2014 testing the authorities\u2019 often reflexive use of force \u2014 the activists appeared emboldened by recent criticism of Mr. Sisi, including from once resolute government loyalists.In a speech last week, Mr. Sisi insisted that Egypt had not given up a \u201cgrain of sand,\u201d and chastised the public for an apparent lack of faith in the country\u2019s leadership, including the intelligence agencies and the military. \u201cThe army has no patriots, and they are all willing to sell their country?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\u201cPlease let us not talk about this matter again,\u201d he added, saying that the Parliament would take up the question of the islands, \u201cand form a committee, or two, and do whatever it wants.\u201dThe protests on Friday were smaller than the overwhelming street demonstrations in 2011 that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, and the protests two years later that ushered out his elected successor, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Friday\u2019s protests were easily contained by the security services, which detained dozens of people in Cairo, Alexandria and other parts of the country.Even so, they appeared to represent a symbolic milestone for government opponents battered over the last few years by increasing repression, who said that the demonstrations reflected their mounting anger.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the islands,\u201d said Khaled Dawoud, the spokesman for a coalition of opposition political parties. \u201cIt\u2019s about the overall performance of President Sisi, the way he treats us, the unilateral decisions, the arrests of young men and women.\u201dMembers of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which has faced the brunt of the government crackdown, also marched at some of Friday\u2019s rallies.At the demonstration in downtown Cairo \u2014 near the spot where the first protest started against Mr. Mubarak on Jan. 25, 2011 \u2014 the strong turnout signified a breakthrough for activists, said Mr. Dawoud, whose brother was among those detained. Left-leaning activists who formed the majority of the crowd revived chants that are rarely heard in public these days, including \u201cthe people want the fall of the regime.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fintech\u2019 Loses Some of Its Attraction for Investors", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byWhen Elevate Credit sought an initial public offering of stock in January, its pitch went like this: Elevate uses big technology to approve nonprime borrowers for loans quickly.The word \u201ctechnology\u201d was plastered all over its marketing documents, appearing 122 times in its 200-page prospectus. Elevate would operate solely online, the prospectus showed. Its proprietary software and analytics would replace the hordes of people who in the past were required to approve loans for those with credit scores below 700. The company was even backed by Sequoia Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures, two of the most prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firms.So Elevate, based in Fort Worth, wanted I.P.O. investors to pay up for its stock, with a valuation more in line with that of a technology company \u2014 higher than one for a conventional subprime lender.But investors did not bite.One day before Elevate was to have its debut, the company withdrew its offering, citing \u201cmarket volatility.\u201d True, the market was inhospitable to new issues at that time. Behind the scenes, though, investors did not think Elevate warranted such a high valuation.Another online mortgage lender, LoanDepot, faced similar investor sentiment, pulling its own I.P.O. two months earlier.Just as slapping \u201c.com\u201d at the end of any corporate name in the early 2000s increased the amount investors were willing to pay, the term \u201cfintech,\u201d or financial technology, has had the same power.Investments from venture capital, hedge funds, private equity and mutual funds have poured into fintech start-ups. In 2015, $19.1 billion was invested in the industry, almost eight times the amount invested in 2011, according to data compiled by CB Insights, a research firm. Where the money went, the start-ups followed, with about 4,000 businesses now labeled fintech, by CB Insights\u2019 categorization.\u201cThe word fintech is a bit overused,\u201d said R.A. Farrokhnia, a professor at Columbia Business School and Columbia\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science. \u201cSaying something\u2019s driven by tech is akin to saying fire is driven by oxygen.\u201dThese days, public investors have become much more scrupulous about the sector \u2014 which has expanded to cover things as varied as lending, payments, currency and investment management. Their challenge has been to distinguish those that deserve the fintech premium from others that are simply putting lipstick on a lender.One problem for Elevate is that its technology does not truly overcome a crucial hurdle faced by subprime lenders: high default rates. The company\u2019s documents show that a large proportion of the loans it underwrites are likely to never be repaid. So-called net charge-offs represent about half of its annual revenue \u2014 a big price tag for an already unprofitable company.Elevate said net charge-offs have not made its margins worse over time. For the first nine months of 2015, Elevate\u2019s operating margin was negative 1 percent, compared with negative 29 percent during the same period in 2014.\u201cWe have delivered strong margin expansion at this target loss rate as our loan portfolio has matured,\u201d Ken Rees, the chief executive of Elevate, said by e-mail. \u201cAs we continue to improve our underwriting, our goal is not to drive down losses as a percentage of revenue but to drive down the average interest rate to our customers.\u201dWho gets a membership to the fintech club is still somewhat unclear. Even industry leaders are divided over what separates a fintech company from a plain old financial services company that uses technology.Matt Burton, the chief executive of Orchard Platform, which sells technology services to online lenders, said real fintech companies should have more than half of their employees in engineering or coding roles. Mr. Burton estimated that only about 30 percent of companies that are said to be fintech companies actually are.On the other hand, Ravi Viswanathan, a general partner at New Enterprise Associates and one of the earliest venture investors in fintech, said his firm defined fintech much more broadly. \u201cWe don\u2019t really use technology as a lens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use disruption.\u201dJon Stein, the chief executive of Betterment, said fintech was also about using technology to make finance better for individuals. That\u2019s the mission of his company, he said; it uses software to customize investment portfolios with automated rebalancing aimed at each customer\u2019s goal.Over time, though, the public-market investors will decide which companies should be awarded the technology multiples.\u201cThe term fintech has gotten broader and broader every year,\u201d Mr. Burton of Orchard said. \u201cInvestors are going to start to differentiate technology companies that are in finance from financial services companies that are using technology.\u201dSome of that will stem from what is in their public filings. Technology companies are often characterized by having simple balance sheets, fast revenue growth and high operating margins. Words like \u201cnet interest margin\u201d and \u201csecuritization\u201d describe banks \u2014 typically not technology businesses.The discrepancy between the valuations fintech companies have received privately and what public-market investors are willing to pay has already narrowed.Shares of LendingClub, which is viewed as one of the more tech-like companies in fintech, have plummeted over the last few months, trading at half their I.P.O. price from December 2014. As opposed to a traditional lender, LendingClub uses a marketplace model, meaning it connects lenders with borrowers without taking on much of the risk.Square, an online payments provider and small-business lender, priced its November initial offering well below the valuation it achieved in the private markets.That has not stopped banks from trying to look more like fintech companies. The financial crisis turned \u201cbank\u201d into a dirty word. As traditional banks were skewered for their lending practices and blamed for the decline of the broader economy, new models were popping up. This was also the time that fintech became a greater part of the vernacular. BankSimple, founded during the trough of the crisis, soon changed its name to just Simple.No matter how much technology is incorporated into finance, the companies will always have to deal with regulatory risk \u2014 something that can often weigh on a valuation. Fintech companies must grapple with current regulation and the potential for more, since they are dealing with the finances of consumers and businesses.Additionally, many of these companies have yet to withstand a downturn in the economic cycle, since they had their starts after the latest recession. Companies will need more history behind them before investors can truly price and categorize fintech.\u201cThe defining attribute of fintech is you are helping the financial services industry reduce costs and boost returns in a very regulated environment,\u201d said Rory Eakin, the founder and chief operating officer of CircleUp, a start-up that helps investors take a stake in small consumer businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from other types of V.C. investing.\u201dAn article in the DealBook special section on April 7, about financial technology start-ups, rendered incorrectly the original name of the online bank Simple. It was BankSimple, not SimpleBank. The error was only recently called to The Times\u2019s attention.Advertisement"}
