{"Headline": "For Indian Start-Ups, Tenacity Beats High Tech", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 On a hot afternoon in a two-story house here, as dogs barked and auto-rickshaws sputtered outside, a venture capitalist grilled three entrepreneurs.Their start-up, DriveU, provides on-demand drivers for people with cars, differing from Uber or Olacabs, an Indian variant, which offer on-demand taxi services. The three parried questions about the business in a cramped conference room with doors and shutters painted in DriveU\u2019s company colors \u2014 shamrock green.\u201cWhat will it take for someone to come in and replicate this?\u201d asked Srikrishna Ramamoorthy, a partner for Unitus Seed, a venture capital fund started out of Seattle that invests in Indian companies. \u201cCouldn\u2019t the Ola guys come in and do this?\u201d\u201cEssentially they could,\u201d said Ashok Shastry, 25, a co-founder of DriveU, who with his long shorts and spiky hair looked as if he would be more at home in Palo Alto, Calif., than Bangalore. \u201cBut it would be taking away from their focus.\u201d The models for Uber and Ola, he said, are built on the premise that customers do not use their own cars.The venture capitalist persisted. If Uber and Ola were to enter the market, \u201cWhat would your response be?\u201d he asked.Amulmeet Chadha, another founder of DriveU, said, \u201cIt\u2019s about being a cockroach and surviving.\u201dThat kind of tenacity is what attracted Mr. Ramamoorthy to the DriveU team. And it illustrates that until now the Indian start-up market has been more about great execution than cutting-edge technology.\u201cIn Silicon Valley, the general investment thesis for a technology investor tends to be around how strong a company\u2019s underlying technology is and how defensible it will be over time,\u201d Will Poole, Unitus Seed\u2019s co-founder, explained later. \u201cVery rarely does a venture capital investor invest in an operating business that does not have an intellectual property moat.\u201dIn emerging markets like India, however, \u201cyou can build very large and profitable businesses on an operating basis without having a fundamental or long-term technological advantage because you are building in greenfield areas with little or no competition,\u201d he said.Last year was a heady one for venture investing in India; investments rose 61 percent, to $1.9 billion, from $1.2 billion in 2014, according to Venture Intelligence, a Chennai-based company that tracks Indian venture activity. About $95 million of the total represented investments and co-investments in the social impact space by traditional V.C.s and specialist firms like Unitus Seed.Most of the capital flowing into India comes from offshoots of American venture firms. This has led to a generation of homegrown versions of United States companies like Flipkart, the Amazon of India, getting funded.But that may be changing. Speaking in Bangalore last summer, Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder of the Palo Alto-based venture fund now known as Social Capital, said he would like \u201cto put a billion dollars to work in the next 10 years here, plus or minus.\u201dYet he told the crowd of entrepreneurs that the kinds of start-ups he would be investing in were companies that were \u201cso unique and unexplainable in a Harvard Business case to a bunch of Americans.\u201dFor its part, Unitus Seed has found that the plethora of have-nots in India means there are lucrative opportunities to put money into Indian companies that offer a much-needed service at a low price point.Among venture capital investors in India, Unitus Seed, with $23 million in capital, is a speck. It is eclipsed by far larger players like Sequoia Capital, SAIF Partners, Accel Partners, SoftBank of Japan, Alibaba of China and Lee Fixel of the investment firm Tiger Global.But what Unitus Seed lacks in firepower, it makes up for in star power.Its investors include Bill Gates; the billionaire investor Vinod Khosla; the ex-Infosys manager Mohandas Pai; and Diego Piacentini, a top Amazon executive. The drug maker Pfizer and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation are also investors in Unitus Seed.Broadly speaking, Unitus Seed\u2019s portfolio companies fall into two categories. One is composed of companies that offer affordable products and services in areas like health care, education and financial services to India\u2019s masses, giving them access to services that are otherwise too costly or simply unavailable.Examples in this category are investments in UE LifeSciences, which offers breast scanning for a couple of dollars through its portable iBreastExam device; Welcare Health Systems, which delivers low-cost eye screening; and Hippocampus Learning Centers, which provide affordable kindergarten and after-school facilities.A second category of companies includes those that offer \u201clabor as a service,\u201d thus moving labor from chaotic, more disorganized sectors to more formal employment, and increasing financial and other benefits to low-income workers.DriveU fits into that category, giving its best full-time chauffeurs health insurance, something that is nearly unheard-of in India.In assessing start-ups like DriveU, Unitus Seed first asks if the management team has \u201cwhat it takes to persevere in the world\u2019s most competitive market,\u201d Mr. Poole said.\u201cIf you have a great idea, you have to be able to run really hard and fast,\u201d he added, in order to compete with someone who is as good at the same thing.The approach could pay off soon.The fund has \u201cclosed one transaction for a partial exit \u2014 a very profitable exit for us \u2014 and we have another transaction which is in the final negotiations for a complete exit,\u201d said Mr. Poole, who declined to name the companies.For months, Unitus Seed\u2019s investment team had been wrestling with the threat that Uber and Ola presented to DriveU. Ultimately, it was something Mr. Shastry\u2019s father Ramprasad, who goes by Rahm, said that convinced Unitus Seed\u2019s Mr. Poole and the team that the threat was manageable.Rahm Shastry, who is the company\u2019s chief executive, explained that Uber and Ola drivers have high fixed costs (their cars) and the possibility of earning a higher hourly wage. If Ola and Uber offered on-demand chauffeurs, the drivers would still have high fixed costs but would then earn a lower wage. DriveU chauffeurs earn less than Ola and Uber drivers.DriveU was \u201cgoing to operate in a place that is painful for its competition to copy its business model,\u201d Mr. Poole said. \u201cThat is the fundamental argument of why Ola and Uber are not going to do this right away.\u201dWhen DriveU started in July 2015, it met with some of the bigger venture capital firms like Sequoia and Matrix Partners.Rahm Shastry had become well known after selling a company he had invested in, TaxiForSure, to Olacabs for about $200 million last year.He was also an experienced operator. Until recently, he worked in Silicon Valley, rotating in and out of a succession of technology companies as their chief executive. His specialty was start-ups and turning around companies. (Most entrepreneurs that venture funds encounter in India are starting companies for the first time.)In 2015, after more than three decades in America, Mr. Shastry and his wife, Glenda, a Midwesterner, moved to India at the prodding of Ashok, who had an idea for a start-up: Parking on Demand.One path to fast growth is to drop prices, but Rahm Shastry is adamant about keeping the cost of the ride at 99 rupees an hour (less than $1.50), rather than dropping it to 49 rupees, which was suggested by potential investors. \u201cThe extra 10,000 rupees a month our driver earns he can send his daughter to a better school,\u201d he said, defending his decision.Last month, Unitus Seed announced that it was investing in DriveU.Though it did not disclose the amount, people with knowledge of the matter say DriveU has received $1 million from Unitus Seed and other Silicon Valley angel investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Agrees to Give 4 Board Seats to Starboard Value", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For over a year and a half, Yahoo has been tormented by a prominent activist investor who has criticized virtually everything about the company, from its business strategy to its efforts to sell major assets.Now that hedge fund, Starboard Value, is finally getting a seat at the embattled Internet company\u2019s table, heading off a potentially distracting fight and perhaps easing the way for a potential sale of its core business.\u201cWe look forward to getting started right away and working closely with management and our fellow board members with the common goal of maximizing value for all shareholders,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement.The move may let Yahoo focus more on its sales efforts while also quieting one of the company\u2019s biggest and most persistent gadflies, since Starboard must now refrain from public criticism. The company had engaged two sets of bankers over the last several months: some to run defense against Starboard, others to supervise the auction.Giving those seats to Starboard may also remove some additional doubts about the seriousness of Yahoo\u2019s intent in exploring a sale, a process that several people involved have described as messy and confusing. The hedge fund had latched on to those concerns as part of its activism campaign.As part of the settlement, two existing directors will step down, leaving the board at 11 members. Coupled with the two new directors appointed by Yahoo last month, more than half of the company\u2019s board will be new this year.The other new additions to the board are Tor R. Braham, a former technology investment banker at Deutsche Bank; Eddy W. Hartenstein, a director of Tribune Publishing and former chief executive of The Los Angeles Times; and Richard S. Hill, chairman of Tessera Technologies.At the same time that a settlement has been reached, Yahoo and its board are still combing through the preliminary bids received last week. Among them were proposals from Verizon Communications, seen as the early leader in the sales process, and from investment firms like TPG Capital, Silver Lake and a consortium led by Bain Capital and Vista Equity Partners.Removing Starboard\u2019s threat of a board fight might mean that Yahoo no longer feels compelled to complete its sales process before its next annual shareholder meeting. The agreement with Starboard says Yahoo must hold its meeting by June 30. Still, company executives have expressed confidence in the speed of the process, and Mr. Smith is likely to keep pressing for a timely conclusion.Hopes for a deal have helped lift Yahoo\u2019s stock price more than 11 percent so far this year. But investors largely shrugged off the agreement on Wednesday, and shares closed down 0.43 percent.For investors, little matters more now than whether Yahoo can find a buyer for its core Internet business, including its huge sports, finance and mail arms. A weak quarterly earnings report last week, in which sales fell 11 percent, underscored the continuing troubles that have plagued the company.Despite its huge presence in the early days of the web, Yahoo has steadily lost ground to newer competitors like Google and Facebook, leaving it to grasp for solutions to turn around its business. A succession of chief executives, the latest being the Google veteran Marissa Mayer, have failed to find an effective answer.That has drawn a number of activist investors over the years that have sought to shake up the company. Before Starboard it was Third Point, the firm run by the billionaire Daniel S. Loeb, who successfully ousted Ms. Mayer\u2019s predecessor and called for the hiring of the Google engineer.But Ms. Mayer\u2019s various initiatives have not panned out. In September 2014, Starboard \u2014 a roughly five-year-old firm with a growing reputation as a successful activist investor \u2014 emerged, leading with criticism of the company\u2019s strategy.Starboard and Mr. Smith later added criticism of how Yahoo planned to sell its remaining stake in the Alibaba Group of China and, eventually, Ms. Mayer\u2019s overall performance, to their complaints.Little love has been lost between the two sides in the last year and a half, with Ms. Mayer believing Starboard to be a nuisance and disrespectful and Mr. Smith publicly calling for the ouster of Yahoo\u2019s board. The relationship took a further hit last month when Yahoo filled two board seats hours before the company was set to sit down with Starboard.But both sides continued to work on reaching a settlement, which has become more and more common in corporate America as companies and activists alike seek to avoid the expense and uncertainty of running a full-blown proxy fight.While corporate boards initially viewed such rabble-rousers as threats to be fought, they have increasingly opened up and offered director seats to end hostilities.Starboard won seats on Wednesday not only at Yahoo but also at Marvell Technologies, a chip maker that the hedge fund had fought against for only a few months. At Marvell, the activist investor won four board seats and will have a say in the selection of the company\u2019s next chief executive.Some on the receiving end of Starboard\u2019s campaigns have eventually formed cordial relationships with the hedge fund. One of the new Yahoo directors who had been proposed by Starboard, Mr. Hill, was on Tessera\u2019s board when that company battled against the activist investor three years ago.The alternative could be far worse. Starboard, for instance, ousted the entire board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden chain, after rallying fellow investors unhappy with the company\u2019s financial performance.\u201cThis constructive resolution will allow management and the board to keep our focus on our extremely important objectives,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cManagement is looking forward to working with the entire board, including the new directors, to maximize shareholder value.\u201dGiving activist investors a role in the boardroom also helps to silence them, since such settlements \u2014 like the one at Yahoo \u2014 include nondisparagement clauses that prohibit these firms from publicly criticizing their companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built,\u2019 by Duncan Clark", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The personal-computer and Internet revolution that began in the late 20th century eventually took over most of the world, but its most prominent players \u2014 Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, Microsoft \u2014 were distinctly American. In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China\u2019s ascension as a global economic power, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him.We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as \u201cAlibaba,\u201d Duncan Clark\u2019s engaging biography explains, Ma\u2019s humble origins gave no clue to his future \u2014 then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies \u2014 beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping \u2014 seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea.If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma\u2019s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. \u201cI was treated like a con man for three years,\u201d Ma said.Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late \u201990s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma\u2019s \u201cChina Pages\u201d and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma\u2019s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government\u2019s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc.

{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Suitors Uncover Few Financial Details", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Yahoo prepares to accept first-round bids for its core Internet business on Monday, potential buyers have found themselves facing one big problem: How do you value a company with a declining business when the company appears reluctant to share vital financial details?But several big companies are expected to place bids for Yahoo anyway, according to people briefed on the matter. Verizon Communications, which has publicly expressed interest in buying Yahoo\u2019s core Internet business and merging it with its AOL division, plans to press forward with a bid, some of these people said.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, said publicly that it had considered joining with potential investors, including one or more private equity firm, for a bid. And the private equity firm TPG plans to make a bid in the first round on its own, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yet other huge companies plan to sit out the bidding. Google, which competes with Yahoo on search and display advertising and has a search partnership with the company, considered making an offer, but is unlikely to proceed because it fears any deal would draw stiff antitrust scrutiny, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s thinking.Other notable businesses, including AT&T, CBS and the investment firms Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, are unlikely to bid, according to others briefed on their plans. And SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications giant that controls Yahoo Japan, does not plan to bid despite press reports to the contrary.A 90-slide presentation shown to potential Yahoo bidders is dense with figures, but even people familiar with the company\u2019s operations have struggled to make sense of them. At the same time, Yahoo devoted just a couple of slides to important strategies, like its costly Hail Mary project to create an entirely new mobile search experience to leapfrog competitors like Google, Apple and Amazon.Representatives of Verizon, Google, AT&T and CBS declined to comment. A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment on the sales process.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, is expected to face questions about the bidding on Tuesday, when the company reports its latest quarterly earnings. The report should offer a window into how Yahoo is weathering the upheaval caused by the layoff of 15 percent of its work force announced in February. The total value of Yahoo shares is now about $35 billion.The company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate, which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $1 billion to $3 billion.One reason for Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share information may be that the business is worse than the company has publicly disclosed. That has added to confusion regarding the intentions of a board of directors that, just a few months ago, publicly said it had no intention of selling.Ms. Mayer has often said she wants to make Yahoo services a \u201cdaily habit\u201d for Internet users. But after nearly four years of effort, only about 10 percent of the one billion monthly visitors to Yahoo sites return every day, suggesting little attachment to the brand, according to people who have seen confidential internal data. At Facebook, by comparison, 65 percent of users visit daily.Yahoo is in a difficult position. Ms. Mayer\u2019s four-year turnaround effort has failed to deliver significant improvements at a company that has been in decline for a decade. Ms. Mayer argues that she is turning the tide with new investments in areas like video and native advertising.Activist investors, led by the Starboard Value hedge fund, have run out of patience and are pressing the board to sell the core business, separating it from the company\u2019s far more valuable investment stakes in Alibaba, China\u2019s leading e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, a separate, publicly traded company.Yahoo\u2019s board, which spent more than a year working on other plans to separate the investment stakes, reluctantly agreed to explore a sale of all or parts of the company and hired three investment banking firms to run the process. Starboard has formally threatened a proxy fight to replace the entire board at the next shareholder meeting if the directors do not follow through on a sale.Ms. Mayer has publicly laid out a path for an independent Yahoo and made the case to potential bidders that they should retain her as chief to carry out the plan.Abandoning previous forays into video and digital magazines, Ms. Mayer, who formerly headed search at Google, is now focused on returning Yahoo to its glory days as a search engine. Although comScore says that Yahoo is currently the No. 3 player in desktop searches, behind Google and Microsoft, Ms. Mayer argues that Yahoo can leap ahead through a \u201ccomplete reimagination of mobile search.\u201dMs. Mayer has assigned about 1,000 people to search products, or about 10 percent of the company\u2019s staff, according to people briefed on the business. The mobile effort, code-named Project Index, has officially been underway for two years and aims to create a search tool similar to Google Now on Android phones, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Amazon\u2019s Alexa.But the team has little to show for its work, and many at Yahoo wonder whether it is a hopeless quest. Industry experts as well as Yahoo insiders say that without the location and personal data that Apple and Google have, Yahoo will have a difficult time predicting what people want with enough accuracy to get them to switch from other services.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cThere is a massive opportunity for mobile search,\u201d said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, who invests in search start-ups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Yahoo has the core assets or skills you would need to succeed or thrive right now.\u201dA Yahoo spokesman said that the company was exploring many search ideas, including the use of software bots that would fetch information on behalf of users.Ms. Mayer\u2019s vague plans for reversing Yahoo\u2019s decline, along with the lack of disclosure about the company\u2019s finances, have made prospective bidders nervous.Though several private equity firms have been looking at the company, people involved in the bidding process said that they were unlikely to prevail against a determined corporate buyer.Verizon is viewed by analysts as the leading bidder for Yahoo, but its likely offer comes despite trepidation among its executives, according to the people briefed on the bidding.Verizon is still struggling to digest its $4.4 billion acquisition last year of AOL, and some executives worry that buying Yahoo would simply be doubling down on integration troubles.Verizon could certainly combine the content properties and ad products and networks run by Yahoo and AOL.The company, with more than 112 million cellphone customers on top of its landline Internet subscribers, would have the ability to preinstall Yahoo services and distribute them widely.However, the contracts governing Apple iPhones and phones running Google\u2019s Android operating system generally restrict what phone carriers can do to promote alternatives for major services like search and email. So Yahoo would still need to build products good enough to persuade people to switch.Wall Street is hoping for a quick sale, to anybody, at any reasonable price.\u201cWe continue to believe that one of the greatest risks in the stock is the core being a \u2018melting ice cube,\u2019 as a prolonged sale process draws on, creating questions for employees, advertisers and partners,\u201d wrote Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, on Wednesday.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Yahoo\u2019s reluctance to share financial details with prospective buyers misstated the amount the company hoped to raise by selling patents and real estate. The amount is $1 billion to $3 billion, not $1 billion to $35 billion.Conor Dougherty contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Emily Steel from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byFor years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government\u2019s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWe hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement.China\u2019s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\u201cThey are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China \u201cis strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.\u201dAfter the shutdown of Apple\u2019s services, President Xi Jinping of China, who has led a crackdown on Western ideology, conducted a meeting on Tuesday in Beijing on China\u2019s restrictive Internet policies. China\u2019s top tech leaders, including Jack Ma, chairman of the e-commerce company Alibaba, and Ren Zhengfei, head of Huawei, were present at the meeting.\u201cChina must improve management of cyberspace and work to ensure high-quality content with positive voices creating a healthy, positive culture that is a force for good,\u201d a report by the state-run news service Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.Since the Snowden leaks, China\u2019s state media identified eight American companies that it has labeled guardian warriors and that it has said were too deeply established in the country\u2019s core industries such as energy, communications, education and military.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time.There have been some signs of trouble ahead. Mr. Xi has presided over a deep freeze on the Internet, increasing censorship and taking aim at online tools used to circumvent China\u2019s system of online filters, known as the Great Firewall. He has also added new policy tools to keep tabs on electronic communications. Mr. Xi heads a committee of top leaders set up to streamline tech and Internet policy and turn the country into a \u201ccyberpower.\u201dIn addition, the Chinese government proposed an antiterrorism law two years ago that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys \u2014 the codes that enable otherwise-scrambled information to be viewed \u2014 for security reasons. Though the language was ultimately dropped, analysts said the government wants to have access to all communications within China.The two Apple services that Chinese regulators shut down, iTunes Movies and the iBooks Store, compete directly with Chinese Internet companies\u2019 products. Beijing has recently added initiatives to support a sputtering economy with new emphasis on industries that require higher skills and command better profit margins, like the Internet.That push may eventually trickle down to other Apple services. Apple Pay, for example, competes with mobile payments systems from some of China\u2019s largest Internet companies: Alibaba and Tencent.In the longer term, China\u2019s tough line on foreign tech companies like Apple could have heavy consequences for the Chinese economy, Mr. Rosen said.\u201cAs surely as the tremendous welfare gains for China and its people from deepening links to global tech production, disassembling those connections is likely to entail a heavy economic loss,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Or maybe the head, with its tight helmet of dark hair, was something you had already admired and were planning to revisit.Either way, you\u2019re out of luck: The head is gone.Christie\u2019s took the sculpture out of the show this week so it could sell the piece, for an estimated $800,000 to $1.2 million, at its special themed auction on May 8.The move is unorthodox (auction houses generally sell things after a show has closed), and it could seem opportunistic, as if Christie\u2019s were capitalizing on the show\u2019s strong reviews.It would also seem to be especially disruptive for an exhibition in which Mr. Hammons carefully selected each piece as well as its placement. Indeed, the artist at the last minute substituted a 2006 head for a 1997 head \u2014 which was featured in the show\u2019s catalog \u2014 because he felt it fit better.But business is business, and the rock head\u2019s owner, J. Michael Evans, president of the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba, was apparently ready to sell. Mr. Hammons hasn\u2019t complained (he doesn\u2019t give interviews), the Mnuchin Gallery declined to comment (it has replaced the rock head with another from 2004), and Loic Gouzer, Christie\u2019s deputy chairman, postwar and contemporary art, who secured the head, said this was \u201cnothing very unusual, the Mnuchin show is a commercial show.\u201dMr. Gouzer was also busy landing bigger fish for the themed auction \u2014 based on Bruce Nauman\u2019s sculpture, \u201cHenry Moore Bound to Fail\u201d \u2014 namely two pieces that his boss, Brett Gorvy, had called \u201ciconic\u201d in an interview: Jeff Koons\u2019s floating basketball (expected to sell for about $12 million) and Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s kneeling statue of Hitler (estimated at $10 million to $15 million).The basketball, consigned by Peter Brant, is \u201cperhaps one of the most important art objects since the Duchamp urinal,\u201d Mr. Gouzer said. \u201cIt became viral because it was taken from everyday life and put on a pedestal.\u201dThe Cattelan, which came from David Ganek, is controversial. Who, after all, wants to keep a life-size Hitler in the house? (The sculpture prompted outrage when it was placed at the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto in 2012.) In fact, the collector Stefan Edlis, a Holocaust survivor, owned an edition of the sculpture called \u201cHim.\u201dMr. Gorvy likened it to Francis Bacon\u2019s 1953 \u201c\u2018Study After Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Portrait of Pope Innocent X,\u201d commonly known as the \u201cScreaming Pope\u201d in that it captured \u201ca man of power at his most humble.\u201d\u201cIs he praying for redemption or is this showing the man behind the evil?\u201d Mr. Gorvy said.\u201cHe\u2019s creating layers of meaning,\u201d he added referring to Mr. Cattelan. \u201cYou bring to it your own interpretation.\u201dSpeaking of Mr. Cattelan, for Frieze New York 2016 (which starts May 5) he will be restaging his 1994 installation \u201cEnter at Your Own Risk \u2014 Do Not Touch, Do Not Feed, No Smoking, No Photographs, No Dogs, Thank You,\u201d which features a live donkey, illuminated by a crystal chandelier.Those who did not study 17th-century Italian art may not be familiar with Guido Cagnacci, who was only rediscovered in the 1950s.But if you do know him, you\u2019ll know that his early 1660s canvas \u201cThe Repentant Magdalene\u201d \u2014 depicting a prostrate, largely bare Mary Magdalene \u2014 is widely considered a masterpiece.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the absolute top 17th-century Italian paintings in America,\u201d said Xavier F. Salomon, the chief curator at the Frick Collection, where it will be on view from Oct. 25 through Jan. 22.Mr. Salomon chose the painting as part of the Frick\u2019s exchange program with the Norton Simon Art Foundation in Pasadena, Calif. \u201cThe Cagnacci, the Guercino at the Met and the Gentileschi that the Getty bought the \u2018Danae,\u2019\u201d Mr. Salomon said. \u201cThey are the three top Baroque pictures in America.\u201dCagnacci took some time to catch on, in part because he was an eccentric artist, whose work \u2014 while religious in content \u2014 had an eroticism that alienated his contemporaries.\u201cHis paintings have this incredibly sensuous aspect, almost a 19th-century quality to them, so strange and unsettling,\u201d Mr. Salomon said. \u201cBecause of that, people did not really appreciate the artist until fairly modern times, when Fellini was strong.\u201dIn Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s 1982 work \u201cMoses and the Egyptians\u201d he wove in phrases like \u201cstaff into serpent trick\u201d and \u201cwater into blood.\u201dThe piece, on loan from the Guggenheim Bilbao, will be among the 25 works highlighting Basquiat\u2019s frequent use of language in painting at Nahmad Contemporary from May 2 to June 11.Curated by Dieter Buchhart, who organized the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s recent show on Basquiat\u2019s notebooks, the exhibition focuses on the artist\u2019s combination of the \u201ccutup\u201d style of the Beat writer William S. Burroughs with the sampling techniques of early rappers.\u201cWhat does the word mean in the painting?\u201d Mr. Buchhart said. \u201cLanguage was like a weapon for Basquiat.\u201dThe Los Angeles gallery Regen Projects is now representing Theaster Gates, the multidisciplinary artist who turned a closed housing project in a Chicago neighborhood into an art center. He will have a solo show, of all new work, at the gallery in January.\u201cThe community outreach he\u2019s done almost becomes like a medium,\u201d said Shaun Caley Regen, the gallery\u2019s president, \u201ca radical creativity that engages social practice as much as it does art.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When It Comes to Luxury, China Still Leads", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byAlthough China\u2019s slower economic growth, crackdown on gifting and weaker currency have ended the days of breakneck growth for the country\u2019s luxury market, the global brands invested there are not panicking. They say China, as the world\u2019s largest market, still looks likely to continue to make up for weaker demand elsewhere.A younger and more sophisticated generation of shoppers with markedly different tastes, aspirations and consumption habits is reshaping the landscape of luxury in China. Educated, well-traveled and tech-savvy, they are emerging as the new target market.A decade ago, when most Chinese only knew of two kinds of wine (red and white) and demand for luxury products was just beginning, skeptics voiced doubts that shoppers, wealthy or not, would forgo the ubiquitous counterfeit goods found in Shanghai\u2019s Xiangyang Market or Silk Alley in Beijing. Others said that the Chinese would just choose the biggest brands.They were wrong, of course. Today, Chinese shoppers account for nearly half of the global luxury market, providing invaluable demand to brands in every segment.\u201cIn the past, luxury goods were seen as a symbol of wealth and status for Chinese consumers,\u201d said Dr. Tina Zhou of the Shanghai-based Fortune Character Institute, a luxury research consultancy. \u201cNow they buy luxury goods for their own enjoyment.\u201dEstimates of the size of China\u2019s luxury market vary depending on which items analysts consider to be luxury goods. Data from Fortune Character Institute has China\u2019s luxury spending in 2015 at $16.8 billion, up 9 percent, year on year.Bain & Company\u2019s 2015 China Luxury Market Study put the value of the Chinese luxury market last year at $17.3 billion, which it calculated to be a drop of 2 percent.Regardless of how luxury is defined, there are some visible trends that are shaping the direction of luxury consumption in China. A shift away from visibly branded goods to a focus on quality has hurt sales of many brands with strong name recognition, while strengthening other players.\u201cOur research found that 39 percent of wealthy Chinese think the logo is no longer the priority,\u201d Dr. Zhou said. \u201cNiche high-end brands as well as bespoke products, as a result, are becoming new drivers of luxury consumption.\u201dAnd this focal shift to younger shoppers who have absorbed luxury marketing since childhood \u2014 and are seeking something different from the LV-emblazoned bags and Burberry plaids of their parents\u2019 generation \u2014 has profound implications, at least in the short term, for established brands.\u201cThe Chinese customer is becoming a lot more global,\u201d said Andrew Keith, president of Lane Crawford, the high-end fashion retailer headquartered in Hong Kong. \u201cThere\u2019s a real thirst for newness.\u201dMr. Keith described today\u2019s typical Lane Crawford customer as female, between the ages of 25 and 35 and interested in ready-to-wear. Women\u2019s wear is the fastest-growing portion of the company\u2019s mainland China business, accounting for 50 percent of sales, he said.\u201cToday our customers are more confident, and they have much more of an understanding of lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Keith said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about purchasing, it\u2019s about the experience.\u201dA big part of the experience is shopping while traveling. Not long ago, Hong Kong was a preferred destination for luxury shopping, he said, but today Tokyo and Europe are more important. Currency exchange rates play into this, as does the trend toward foreign travel.Although its bricks-and-mortar presence is limited to Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong and Shanghai, Lane Crawford has a broader reach among the new Chinese luxury shoppers with an omnichannel approach that integrates store and online experiences. Customers who shop both in stores and online tend to spend five times as much and shop five times as often as other Lane Crawford customers, he said.\u201cWe have always approached online as part of the store experience \u2014 the sweet spot for us is how we use our omnichannel experience to increase loyalty,\u201d Mr. Keith said. \u201cWe can penetrate the market fairly effectively in second- and third-tier cities where we don\u2019t have a physical presence.\u201dThe rise of new global Chinese shoppers also has been a boon for Lane Crawford\u2019s online business, he said, with Chinese customers accounting for 40 percent to 50 percent of transactions outside of Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau.But not all Chinese luxury purchases abroad involve travel. The fact that a luxury item in China can cost as much as 80 percent more than the identical item in Europe \u2014 the result of exchange rates, taxes and duties \u2014 has continued to help the daigou, or proxy purchase, services. These traders traditionally have taken orders \u2014 and continue to do so now from online sites \u2014 for purchases in Europe and then ship the goods to China, saving the end customer a significant amount, compared with prices in Chinese stores.In an industry report released last June, researchers at the Geneva-based Exane BNP Paribas said that prices in China and Europe would have to converge as the Chinese luxury market matured. \u201cChinese luxury demand seems to have been dramatically impacted by foreign exchange rates and the widening price differences between China and the rest of the world,\u201d said Luca Solca, managing director and sector head, global luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. \u201cA larger portion of Chinese consumers spend their luxury dollars abroad \u2014 either directly as tourists or indirectly through daigou websites.\u201dMore recently, the Chinese government has tried to recapture part of this business, Mr. Solca said, in an effort to increase tax revenues and stem capital outflows.\u201cStricter border controls have been introduced to curb daigou activities and renewed pressure has piled up on European luxury players to reduce the price gap against the Chinese,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than ever, we expect prices to continue to converge in fiscal year 2016.\u201dDescribing the daigou effect as \u201crather disruptive,\u201d Mr. Keith said that the price gap is a liability for brands. \u201cUltimately, it undermines the trust of the customer in your product.\u201dThe digital space is likely to continue to disrupt the Chinese market. Fan Chen, the Beijing-based managing director at the marketing consultancy Simon-Kucher & Partners, said she expected more brands to engage Chinese consumers directly online, noting that Burberry opened a store in late 2014 on tmall.com, the business-to-consumer site operated by the Chinese online giant Alibaba.Cartier introduced its online shopping site in October, and other brands have made similar moves.\u201cThe rapid development of China\u2019s mobile e-commerce can certainly, to some extent, promote sales of luxury goods, but more from a marketing perspective,\u201d Ms. Chen said. Looking forward, the clout of Chinese brands is likely to grow, she said.\u201cThe current market share of local luxury brands is still relatively small, but it is developing,\u201d she said, noting the foundation laid by Chinese brands including Shanghai Tang and Chow Tai Fook, two large Hong Kong-based labels in fashion and jewelry, respectively. \u201cThere is still much room for growth for Chinese brands.\u201dLane Crawford also sees potential in Chinese brands. Its \u201cCreated in China\u201d program has served as an incubator and showcase for emerging Chinese fashion brands. The program now features the work of 20 Chinese designers.\u201cOur Chinese customers are inspired by the new generation of Chinese talent,\u201d Mr. Keith said, naming the labels Ms. Min and Comme Moi as top performers. \u201cChina for us is really a long-term play.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Growing Ardor for Overseas Shopping", "Date": "2016-04-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNelson Peltz sat on the board of Legg Mason, the $3.7 billion asset management company, for five years while his hedge fund, Trian Partners, scooped up 10 percent of the company\u2019s stock.Mr. Peltz shook things up as he always does. He ousted the chief executive and got Legg to cut costs and return billions of dollars to shareholders. When it came time to exit the investment, Mr. Peltz sold his shares to the Shanda Group.Wait, what? You heard right. Shanda is a Chinese investment company that started out as an interactive-gaming company but now \u201cseeks global opportunities that offer business growth or unique breakthrough potential.\u201d On Tuesday, it spent $340 million to buy Mr. Peltz\u2019s stake in Legg, which got its start selling stocks out of a back office in the Baltimore Stock Exchange in 1899.The logic of this deal is hard to follow \u2013 not least because Shanda paid a premium to the market price for the Legg shares, something that almost nobody ever does for a passive minority stake. Yet such situations are hardly unique at a moment when Chinese companies and investors are going wild for assets of pretty much any color or stripe in the world\u2019s developed economies.Indeed, the Chinese ardor for overseas shopping has become so fervent that there\u2019s a new mantra making the rounds of Wall Street bankers who have an asset to sell anywhere in the world: \u201cWho\u2019s the Chinese buyer we\u2019ve never heard of?\u201dThe biggest advisory companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs routinely fly China specialists across the ocean when they pitch companies for the mandate to help sell a business.The surge in Chinese buyers, many of them unknown in the West \u2013 sometimes even in Hong Kong \u2014 requires a new level of due diligence and heightened vigilance, from banks, lawyers and accountants. As the curious case of Anbang Insurance\u2019s aborted \u2013 and inexplicable from the start \u2013 $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels suggests, it\u2019s harder for investment banks to really understand their Chinese clients\u2019 motivations.The examples cross nearly every industry and region. Though head-scratchers abound, not all of them are as hard to fathom as Shanda\u2019s Legg investment. Some reflect the overarching ambitions of Chinese Communist Party leaders. Some, like Alibaba\u2019s purchase of Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post, look like vanity plays. Others just take a creative stretch of industrial logic to justify. Underpinning them all seems to be a lack of confidence about prospects in the People\u2019s Republic.The China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s $43 billion takeover of the agrochemicals giant Syngenta falls squarely into the first category. The state-owned enterprise was set up by the country\u2019s former Ministry of Chemical Industry. Its chairman, Ren Jianxin, undoubtedly has a red phone linking his desk to the Communist Party\u2019s top brass in Beijing.The Syngenta deal looks like it is intended to satisfy China\u2019s goals to bolster food production in the world\u2019s largest agricultural market. Syngenta\u2019s chemicals and patent-protected seeds are a strategic asset for a nation that has a population of 1.4 billion. This deal, China\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition, is a relatively logical pairing.The same cannot be said of Shandong Ruyi\u2019s surprise $1.2 billion purchase last month of SMCP, the operator of the second-tier European fashion chains Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot. It\u2019s hard to argue, as Shandong Ruyi does on its website, that \u201cbeing involved in rabbit-hair spinning, textile & clothing, cotton textile, cotton printing and dyeing, knitting, fiber, jeans and real estate\u201d has made it a \u201cwell-known textile-related pluralism group.\u201d Still, kudos to the enterprising banker who alerted the firm to the willingness of the owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to part with the French retailer.At least Shandong Ruyi has a website. In the auction of Dah Sing Financial\u2019s insurance business, more than two dozen suitors showed up for the first round of bids, half of them from the mainland, and some so obscure that bankers involved in the process had never heard of them.That\u2019s not unusual. When the private equity firm EQT was selling a German company that generates energy from waste matter, eight interested parties from the mainland showed up. And unlike banks or insurers interested in Dah Sing, they weren\u2019t highly regulated entities. In the end, the business sold for 1.43 billion euros to Beijing Enterprises Holding, a conglomerate listed in Hong Kong with three business lines: gas, beer and sewage treatment.China\u2019s lunge for foreign assets has hit $92 billion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters, nearly reaching last year\u2019s $103 billion record with eight and a half months to spare.At that pace, it won\u2019t be long before Mandarin solidly displaces money as the language of opportunity on Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Digital Paper in China Covers Contentious Issues, Now in English", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The Paper is a new media success story in a fast-changing marketplace for news. It covers contentious issues \u2014 such as official corruption and a recent scandal involving improperly stored vaccines \u2014 with a clutch of digital bells and whistles. Its smartphone app, it says, has been downloaded about 10 million times.Some government pressure is inescapable, says Wei Xing, its editor and the former deputy editor in chief of The Paper. \u201cThere are two paths you can choose,\u201d he said. One is to simply complain, he said, but \u201cwe want to be part of the conversation, both global and domestic.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to say things about the party that are really critical,\u201d he said.Mr. Wei argues that Sixth Tone will have an easier time. While all Chinese media outlets are to some degree state-controlled, it lacks a politics-saturated bureaucracy because it is a start-up, he said.In traditional English-language Chinese media, \u201csome reports could appear because of government promotion. I don\u2019t think we have this so-called task. We just tell the stories with a more human factor,\u201d Mr. Wei said.Still, Mr. Wei recognizes the limits. \u201cMaybe sometimes when reports are published there may be some comments from certain government departments,\u201d he said. Asked for examples at The Paper, he said, \u201cfor me, it\u2019s difficult to specify one case.\u201dThe Paper generally appeals to China\u2019s educated and its millennials, known as the \u201cpost-90s\u201d generation in China.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few news organizations here that still have some original, quality content,\u201d said Feng Jingya, 24, a financial analyst in Beijing and a reader of The Paper. \u201cI feel like many newspapers or news portals just copy each other.\u201dThe Communist Party\u2019s flagship media are also trying to tap the trend. Last week the People\u2019s Daily Online joined Shanghai United Media Group to announce a new app called Wuli, or \u201cMine.\u201dChina\u2019s traditional propaganda arms, like newspapers around the world, have struggled to catch up. Profitability in the newspaper and book publishing business has been dropping since the middle of last year, according to government statistics compiled by CEIC, a data provider, though experts say reliable data can be hard to get.\u201cTraditional media is in a major crisis as advertising falls,\u201d said Zhong Xin, a professor of journalism at Renmin University of China. \u201cReaders are leaving for online. Far fewer people are watching TV.\u201dThe Paper has long presented itself as different from China\u2019s stuffy media. Eager to embrace a zippy start-up culture sweeping China, editors ordered the internal walls of an old newspaper office torn down when they introduced the all-digital site in 2014, so journalists could communicate more easily. \u201cTraditional Chinese media has small offices with walls,\u201d Mr. Wei said.In addition to 22 Chinese and eight non-Chinese staff, Sixth Tone will use the resources of The Paper, which include a network of about 400 text and multimedia journalists \u2014 and a drone. \u201cWe are all digital. We are born to be digital. We want to do data journalism, video journalism, graphics, multimedia reports, panorama videos, virtual reality,\u201d Mr. Wei said.Mr. Wei hopes the website\u2019s name reflects how they want to meet it: Mandarin Chinese has five tones, including a lesser-known fifth, \u201cno-tone\u201d tone. \u201cWe want to be the sixth one. We want to be fresh and different,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the role of Wei Xing in the international expansion of a Chinese news outlet. He is the editor of Sixth Tone, the English-language version of The Paper; he is not the editor of The Paper.Vanessa Piao in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo\u2019s Troubles Mount, and Revenue Shrinks, as It Vets Suitors", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byMarissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, said during a webcast to discuss the financial results that a review of potential suitors was proceeding at the \u201cfastest responsible pace,\u201d but she declined to be more specific.\u201cLet me be unequivocal: Our board, our management team and I have made the strategic alternative process a top priority,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been responsive and engaging, having personally answered hundreds of questions and requests for information.\u201dBain Capital and Vista Equity Partners have submitted a joint bid, with Ross Levinsohn, Yahoo\u2019s former interim chief executive, playing a major role, according to a person involved in the bidding process, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the bids were confidential. Other bidders included the private equity firm TPG.A special committee of Yahoo\u2019s board is now expected to sort through the preliminary offers to decide which to pursue. The company did disclose that it paid its outside advisers $9 million during the quarter.Ms. Mayer hinted that Yahoo would prefer a buyer like Verizon that could achieve \u201cstrategic synergies,\u201d as opposed to a purely financial buyer like a private equity firm.Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said revenue fell 11 percent to $1.09 billion, and its net loss was $99 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to revenue of $1.23 billion and net income of $21 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.After deducting payments Yahoo made to advertising partners for traffic, its revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Profits after adjusting for certain items also narrowly beat projections, although shareholders are much more focused on the potential sale of the company than quarterly financial results.Yahoo shares were up slightly in early after-hours trading.Analysts were unimpressed with the results, but said that the company\u2019s exact financial results did not matter.As Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, put it in a note to clients, there was \u201crelatively little commentary on the transaction news that so many are waiting on, and relatively more commentary on the current state of the business and management\u2019s plans, which likely won\u2019t matter for very long.\u201dYahoo, a leading content portal in the early days of the web, missed the shift to mobile devices and has been struggling to compete against Google, Facebook and specialty apps for advertising dollars and user loyalty.Ms. Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive since 2012, has failed to turn around the company. Restive shareholders are pressing the board to sell the Internet businesses and unlock Yahoo\u2019s large stakes in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce company, and Yahoo Japan, an independently traded company.Together, those two investments have a face value of about $40 billion \u2014 more than the $35 billion stock market value of all of Yahoo, based on Tuesday\u2019s stock prices.While the sales process has advanced, Yahoo\u2019s management team, led by Ms. Mayer, has continued to run the business as if nothing were going to change. Yahoo said it again increased mobile revenue in the quarter, but declines in search and display advertising revenue more than offset that growth.Yahoo noted that it ended the quarter with 9,400 employees, down 21 percent from the previous year, as it eliminated many of its digital magazines, closed overseas offices and made cuts in other parts of the business.Kenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was continuing to explore the sale of real estate.Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said, \u201cThis was same old, same old at Yahoo,\u201d adding, \u201cThe overall trends remained relatively soft.\u201dJeffrey Smith, the chief executive of the Starboard Value hedge fund, said on Tuesday that he intended to keep the pressure on Yahoo. Starboard has proposed an alternative slate of nine directors to replace Yahoo\u2019s entire board at the company\u2019s next annual shareholder meeting, expected in June or July.\u201cIf we get to the end, and they haven\u2019t been successful as it relates to getting the company sold \u2014 the core business sold \u2014 well, we\u2019re going to need to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Wall Street Banking, a New Wave of Fintech Investors", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byFinance is where they built their careers. Now some of banking\u2019s former stars are pouring millions of dollars \u2014 and in some cases staking their careers \u2014 into new technologies that are shaking up everything from lending to payments to investing.They are part of a wave of investors who sank $17.8 billion into financial technology, or fintech, in the first nine months of 2015, an 88 percent increase from the same period in 2014, according to a new report by Accenture. The three top technologies were cloud, mobile and analytics, the report said.A separate analysis by Citigroup put total fintech investing for all of last year at $19 billion, up from $1.8 billion in 2010.In many ways, the investors are filling a void where the financial industry left off. Traditionally banks have invested heavily in technology, but that activity fluctuates with the fortunes of the industry.Bank tech investing dropped off immediately after the 2008 financial crisis because the banks had to focus on other issues. Regulatory changes since then have forced banks to cut back on riskier ventures, such as trading, as well as the technology investments, like data analytics and electronic systems, that go with those activities. That opened the door to start-up development and the creation of products and services that threaten to upend the way traditional banks work.Former finance executives say that they are bringing their experience to start-ups to steer them on the right path.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to ruin the banking system,\u201d said Mr. Morris, the former Visa chief and ex-Citi executive, who is now a managing partner at the fintech investment firm Nyca Partners and a board member of Lending Club, Payoneer and CardWorks. \u201cWe help some of the new tech companies understand exactly what the opportunities are and what they aren\u2019t.\u201dToday\u2019s generation of fintech companies are different in that many of the start-ups aren\u2019t developing technology to sell to the financial services industry \u2014 as has been the pattern in past fintech booms \u2014 they are taking their products directly to consumers through easy-to-use mobile apps.The public, particularly younger Americans, has taken to these technologies after the financial crisis eroded its trust in the traditional banking system, says Bruce Wallace, chief digital officer at Silicon Valley Bank. Millennials, especially, are \u201cmore receptive to buying a financial product or service directly from a tech company.\u201dOne concept that has captured a lot of attention is peer-to-peer lending, popularized by online sites like Prosper and Lending Club, which connect ordinary people who want to borrow money with ordinary people who are willing to lend it to them, cutting banks out of the process. The lending sites flourished as banks curtailed unsecured and riskier lending.SoFi brought in Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank co-chief executive, as a board adviser this year and Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, last year.The firm also invests in Simpl, which makes technology to ease the checkout process for online shoppers, and Two Tap, another online shopping tool that allows users to buy items outside a retailer\u2019s website, by tapping twice on an image of the product on their device.Silicon Valley\u2019s edgy appeal also attracted the former Morgan Stanley finance chief Ruth Porat, now chief financial officer of Alphabet (formerly known as Google). The former Goldman executive J. Michael Evans joined the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba in 2014, and a fellow former Goldman banker, Anthony Noto, became finance chief of Twitter earlier that year.More recently, the former JPMorgan Chase commodities head Blythe Masters went to the blockchain technology firm Digital Asset Holdings, which just announced a $50 million investment from Goldman, JPMorgan and other banks. And the former card company executives Amit Parikh (Discover) and Gail Hodges (HSBC) joined Apple Pay.Traditional banking isn\u2019t likely to be completely displaced by fintech disrupters, however, said Mr. Wallace of Silicon Valley Bank; the industry is large enough to have room for more firms. \u201cThere can be multiple winners,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Financial Affiliate Raises $4.5 Billion", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byThe Alibaba Group of China has become a colossus in the global Internet world, with a market value of nearly $200 billion.Now its online payment affiliate is aiming for a similarly lofty financial goal: becoming one of the most valuable privately held technology companies in the world.The affiliate, known as the Ant Financial Services Group, said on Tuesday that it had raised $4.5 billion from investors. The private financing round suggests that the company is now valued at about $60 billion \u2014 or more than $10 billion over the market value of PayPal Holdings, its closest analogue.It is also one of the most prominent symbols of strength in China\u2019s private sector, particularly in the field of online payments. Slow-moving state-run banks and an initial absence of regulation have allowed privately run companies to weave themselves into everyday life.Ant Financial now encompasses not only online payments, but also low-risk money market funds and a wallet app that enables easy payment from smartphones around China.Chinese consumers use Alipay to shop online, transfer money to one another, hail taxis, buy movie tickets and even invest their spare change. A money-market fund affiliated with Ant Financial was once one of the world\u2019s largest. According to the announcement on Tuesday, Alipay has more than 450 million users, or more than double the number PayPal has.Such is the power of the company that its latest financing was led by some of China\u2019s biggest state-controlled banks, including arms of the China Construction Bank and China Life Insurance. That indicates the level of government support that the company enjoys in a country where much of the economy is still state-directed.Ant Financial\u2019s previous fund-raising round, which was held last year, included China\u2019s national social security fund and an arm of the China Development Bank.In its statement on Tuesday, Ant Financial said it would use the money it had raised to support its global expansion and would also continue its work to connect people in rural China with its payment, loan and banking services.Ant Financial and Alipay face intense competition from Tencent Holdings, a Chinese rival that owns the WeChat mobile messaging system. Tencent has integrated e-commerce and financial services into recent versions of WeChat, encouraging use by a wide range of businesses, including department stores, municipal water and electricity departments, neighborhood bicycle repair shops and noodle stands.As a result, investors did not get a share of that business in 2014, when Alibaba listed its stock publicly in the United States. At the time, many pointed to Ant Financial as being in charge of some of the more innovative ideas that Alibaba had recently developed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Be Forgotten Online Without Google? Forget It.", "Date": "2016-04-19", "News": "Supported byBitsWhile we were worrying about banks that are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d lest they endanger the rest of the financial system, something similar may have happened with Google.Mark\u2019s story is about how the European Union\u2019s so-called right to be forgotten law has worked out in practice. For almost two years, European Union citizens have been able to apply to have links to certain web search results taken down. As over 90 percent of Europe\u2019s search market belongs to Google, this is primarily a law about what Google can track and link the public to.So who is deciding the merits of applications to be \u201cforgotten\u201d? More than anyone else, Google. How do they decide whether the application is warranted? Google won\u2019t say.European Union officials appear to think Google is acting fairly, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question of why Google should be policing itself. The answer to that appears to be that no one else has the money and know-how to effectively do the job.As the Internet gets to be a bigger part of everyone\u2019s lives, it may increasingly be that only the biggest Internet companies can do Internet-scale tasks. Google already appears to have the world\u2019s largest commercial network of computers.To some extent, it\u2019s the same for Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. It would be interesting to see whether Alibaba and Baidu have more computational and data power than the Chinese government.Much the way it curates much of what happens on the Internet, Google has spent years scanning books to create its searchable corpus. For better or worse, few people would want those things destroyed, or made inaccessible. The price we are paying, however, is a near-essential private entity that has done things no government seems able to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ant Financial\u2019s Different Breed of Unicorn", "Date": "2016-04-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe $60 billion implied valuation of the Chinese financial technology group Ant Financial sounds like a case of disruption on steroids.That price tag, implied by a funding round the company disclosed Tuesday, easily tops the $48 billion market capitalization of the United States payments giant PayPal. But look under a metaphorical microscope, and it\u2019s clear that these are different species. The pumped-up Ant Financial rests on uniquely Chinese characteristics.Ant Financial is best known as the financial affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba and the owner of China\u2019s dominant online payment engine, Alipay. A planned initial public offering of stock would therefore be a good way for investors to get their tentacles into a rapidly growing, and slowly liberalizing, market for consumer finance in China. Its $4.5 billion funding round suggests Ant Financial is already following a similar route as its former parent Alibaba, whose valuation rose as it edged toward an I.P.O. in 2014.Though the injection of funds into Ant Financial doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the whole is really worth $60 billion, it\u2019s possible to rationalize that kind of valuation. PayPal has fewer than half the users of Alipay, and it processed $282 billion of transactions in 2015. By 2018, Credit Suisse reckons, Ant Financial will be handling $1.7 trillion.Then again, there are no public numbers to help understand exactly how Alipay makes money, or whether the rest of Ant Financial is a solid finance business or a collection of potentially bad Chinese loans.One thing is clear, though. The group\u2019s fortunes look to be tied more closely to the vagaries of Chinese state capitalism than to private-sector disruption. The backers in Ant Financial\u2019s latest funding round are Chinese state-backed vehicles, not Silicon Valley capitalists. Both Ant Financial and Alibaba exist because Beijing lets them.Ultimately, Ant Financial\u2019s returns and value will depend on many things that outsiders cannot yet see, like how its relationships with Alibaba and the government pan out. This ant is destined for bigger things, but it would be unwise to confuse it with the standard variety tech-industry unicorn.Advertisement"}
