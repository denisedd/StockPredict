{"Headline": "Ex-Goldman Sachs Banker Revamps 401(k) Accounts in New Job", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byKANSAS CITY \u2014 Greg Smith was making his pitch, just as he did back in the day when he was a striving young sales trader at Goldman Sachs.While Mr. Smith\u2019s earnest, somewhat preachy demeanor has not changed much, what and to whom he sells certainly has. No longer does he travel the world, promoting complex derivative bets to some of the sharpest investors around.Instead, here he was in this city trying to persuade a skeptical audience of middle managers at a credit union to hand over the keys to their 401(k) plans to Blooom, the financial start-up he joined a year ago.Over the span of your working life, you could save more than $100,000 by paying less in fees, Mr. Smith promised, striding back and forth in the sun-filled conference hall at the corporate headquarters of Mazuma Credit Union, which serves five counties in Kansas and Missouri.\u201cIt\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith is far from the only person from an entrenched Wall Street firm to flee to the Wild West of new financial technology companies.But few have left with as much theatrical flair as Mr. Smith. Having known him before he made his big splash, I was curious about how he was managing his post-Goldman life and went to this city to see for myself.In his spiel to Mazuma, Mr. Smith did not say that mutual fund companies were treating 401(k) savers like muppets, but he might as well have.After all, the essence of Mr. Smith\u2019s original complaint was that Goldman Sachs, in pursuit of quick and easy profits, had come to regard its everyday client as a ready mark. An idiot and fool to be manipulated by someone else, was how Mr. Smith described the sentiment in the book he subsequently wrote, \u201cWhy I Left Goldman Sachs.\u201dOn Goldman\u2019s trading floor in London, where Mr. Smith worked when he resigned in 2012, these unsuspecting clients were frequently referred to as muppets, Mr. Smith claimed.And with that revelation, he turned an obscure bit of trader slang into a global symbol for the many who believed that Goldman was putting the company\u2019s financial interests ahead of its partners in business.Goldman Sachs rejected the notion. But even among the many who believed that the company had become short-term greedy, there were those who viewed Mr. Smith\u2019s critique as bitter and self-serving.Indeed, when the book came out, reviewers sniffed, and sales were mediocre at best.Soon, people had stopped talking about muppets and Greg Smith altogether.For a while, in 2013 and 2014, Mr. Smith was not sure what to do next.\u201cMy parents wanted me to get a job,\u201d Mr. Smith said as he drank a beer at a hotel bar here.He spent some time in Washington, advising the Democratic Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon on regulatory issues connected to Dodd-Frank legislation.And he hit the paid speech circuit, although it became clear that a career as a public advocate for proper financial and fiduciary practices was not going to happen.Then Mr. Smith came upon the notion of championing the rights of the 90 million Americans who have around $7 trillion saved in 401(k) retirement plans through their companies.The pool of money was huge, but with the average plan size about $91,000, Mr. Smith saw these savers as getting short shrift from the mutual fund giants and the companies that sponsored the plans.That these mostly unsophisticated savers ended up in higher-fee or higher-risk funds without knowing any better galled him, he said.In 2014, he met Chris Costello, a former investment adviser based here who had just co-founded Blooom, a financial technology start-up that uses an algorithm to guide 401(k) savers into the cheapest, most appropriate funds available to them.Mr. Smith was impressed and soon joined as president overseeing marketing and business development. He also came in as an investor, and just a few months ago, he pulled up stakes in New York and moved here.Mr. Smith, 37, grew up in Johannesburg, went to Stanford and spent 12 years working for Goldman in New York and London.But there is something unjaded, if not cornfed, about him that makes him a perfect fit for Kansas.At Blooom\u2019s office on the city\u2019s outskirts, rock tunes fill the air, quants \u2014 the math wizards wearing Royals baseball caps \u2014 pound away at their computer keyboards and a beer tap and Ping-Pong table stand at the ready.Sitting in a conference room, Mr. Smith cites a striking statistic while explaining why he is convinced that Blooom, whose assets have grown to $225 million from $54 million over the last year, can hit it big.Of the 90 million people who have 401(k) plans, more than 83 million will simply guess randomly when it comes to selecting the funds that a Vanguard or a Fidelity offers them, he pointed out.\u201cThe difference between picking a high- or low-fee fund could add two to three years to your retirement,\u201d Mr. Smith said.When I told him that I counted myself in the camp of 401(k) guessers and was curious to see what Blooom could do for my sad little retirement plan, he responded enthusiastically.\u201cGreat idea! Let\u2019s do it, man,\u201d he said.So I did what 2,300 clients have done before me: I handed over the password to my Vanguard retirement account, paid Blooom a Netflix-style fee of $15 a month and got out of the way.Mr. Smith gave me the news with a sympathetic shake of his head: 28 percent of my portfolio was earning next to zero in a pricey bond fund, and I had no international exposure.Moreover, the funds that I blindly selected when I signed up for my plan 15 years ago charged me 0.51 percent in fees.Within minutes, the algorithm had done its work, putting 98 percent of my portfolio into a mix of globally diversified stock funds, with the rest going to bonds.But what really got Mr. Smith going were the savings coming my way.\u201cLook, man,\u201d he said, pointing his finger excitedly at the flower in full bloom on my computer screen. \u201cYour fees are now 0.20 \u2014 that is an annual savings of $775 a year.\u201dIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether these kinds of robo-investing operations will serve investors well over the long term, or whether Blooom will survive in the harshly competitive world of finance.But this much is also true: When I left Blooom that day, no one could say I was a muppet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virgin America Fans Ask if Alaska Airlines Takeover Will Mean Loss of Cool", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byFor younger business travelers like Nicole Bansal, Virgin America\u2019s mood lighting, customer service and technology have filled a niche not found on legacy airlines.Ms. Bansal, 29, flies Virgin America nearly monthly for her job as a Silicon Valley marketing manager and has become one of the airline\u2019s legion of fiercely loyal fans. But now, with a $4 billion takeover by Alaska Airlines in the works, Ms. Bansal worries she will lose the unique touches that helped her click with Virgin America.\u201cI like Alaska, I don\u2019t love Alaska. But I love Virgin,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of it as a young, hip airline. Alaska is more of a friendly aunt.\u201dTravelers like Ms. Bansal are wondering what to expect from Virgin America under its new parent company: skinny jeans and stilettos, or sweatshirts and sneakers. After all, Alaska started in 1932 with a single three-seat plane owned by an Anchorage furrier, while Virgin America was founded by a flashy British billionaire less than a decade ago with a goal of restoring glamour to flying.With the purchase making its way through the monthslong regulatory process, Bobbie Egan, an Alaska spokeswoman, said the airline did not yet know which Virgin characteristics would be retained in the new company. But she acknowledged that Alaska realizes Virgin fans are serious about the brand. \u201cWe want to take some time over the next few months and home in on what it is their customers love,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe want this integration to be very successful.\u201dAlaska and Virgin have been ranked first and second in operational performance in a top industry list for two straight years, and Virgin America is a mainstay atop Travel & Leisure and Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\u2019s readers\u2019 choice rankings of the top domestic airlines.\u201cThe important thing now,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to ensure that once Alaska witnesses firsthand the power of the brand and the love of Virgin America customers for our product and guest experience, they, too, will be converts, and the U.S. traveling public will continue to benefit from all that we have started.\u201dTwitter users have peppered the social network with messages ranging from resignation to outright dread about Alaska\u2019s plans for Virgin. Some have reflected the conflict between cool and reliable.It is not just d\u00e9cor that has attracted Virgin travelers\u2019 loyalty. The airline\u2019s planes include electrical outlets in the seats and streaming Netflix on touch-screen seatback monitors. Ms. Bansal noted that the touch screens also allow her to send drinks to other passengers.Those accouterments are important touches, said the travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, and Alaska Airlines would be smart to keep them in mind as it folds Virgin into its fleet.\u201cVirgin has been very successful at creating this passionate fan base,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. The merger \u201cis like giving up your sexy imported sports car for a reliable but unsexy sedan.\u201dIt was not the mood lighting and touch screens that made Virgin\u2019s independence unsustainable, he said. The airline failed to capitalize on its San Francisco hub or to build on its early innovations, Mr. Harteveldt said.\u201cVirgin had every opportunity to come in guns ablazing, and they acted in the most timid way possible,\u201d he said. \u201cVirgin just stood still and did nothing.\u201dThe airline compensated for its financial losses by cutting flights in recent years, even as it added routes to Hawaii and elsewhere. While passengers may love the ambience of a Virgin flight, they love the ability to get where they are going more.As a frequent business traveler between San Francisco and Los Angeles, one of the airline\u2019s main routes, Will Matthews often flies on Virgin America. But while he prefers to avoid \u201ccookie-cutter airlines,\u201d Virgin\u2019s limited options have sometimes frustrated him.\u201cI would always prefer to fly Virgin,\u201d said Mr. Matthews, a public affairs director for a social justice nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif. \u201cIt just seems like there are more flights at better times with Southwest.\u201cIf there were just as many flights available, I can\u2019t imagine someone like Virgin couldn\u2019t give Southwest a run for its money.\u201dThe combination of hip and practical could give the new company a competitive advantage, Mr. Harteveldt said. The smartest thing Alaska could do, he said, would be to combine the characteristics that have made each airline popular.\u201cMy hope is that Alaska goes in with an open mind and that they learn some things,\u201d he said, adding that Alaska is probably a better fit for Virgin than most legacy airlines. \u201cIt\u2019s not hip, it\u2019s not sexy, but Alaska has a lot going for it.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s got guns, trucks and cheap beer. Like many tunes, \u201cThe Ranch\u201d sounds formulaic at first \u2014 and mostly, it is. But then it hits you with the hook: a note of raw, acoustic emotion that cuts through the slick studio production.\u201cThe Ranch\u201d is a prodigal-son story, complete with fatted calves. Colt Bennett (Ashton Kutcher), having washed up as a semipro quarterback in Canada, slinks back to Garrison, Colo. (pop. 512), where he was a high-school hero. His father, Beau (the western veteran Sam Elliott), puts Colt to work grudgingly alongside his dutiful but immature other son, Rooster (Danny Masterson, Mr. Kutcher\u2019s onetime \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d co-star).The show comes from Don Reo and Jim Patterson, the showrunners of \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d Think of it as \u201cOne and Two Half-Men,\u201d with the crotchety Beau riding herd on his two man-children. Beau\u2019s wife, Maggie (Debra Winger), happily lives separated from him, running the local bar. (\u201cGive me a whiskey the size you\u2019d need if you were still living with Dad,\u201d Colt asks her. She hands him two bottles.)Like Netflix\u2019s \u201cFuller House,\u201d \u201cThe Ranch\u201d is reviving a defunct style of multicamera comedy, in this case the kind of rural sitcom that used to be common before networks started chasing the upscale Ross-and-Rachel demographic.But it\u2019s updated with the risqu\u00e9 attitude of \u201cMen\u201d \u2014 on which Mr. Kutcher appeared as Charlie Sheen\u2019s amiable replacement \u2014 and some not-for-prime-time content. It\u2019s a little disorienting to hear a studio audience, a broadcast TV staple, laughing at punch lines that include a strong obscenity, or to catch a flash of Colt\u2019s bare backside.\u201cThe Ranch\u201d is only a middling comedy, loaded up with corny and broad gags. (Colt spends a chunk of the premiere with his arm up a cow\u2019s birth canal, and there\u2019s a long, painful running joke that emasculates him for wearing UGG boots.) But for a few minutes every episode, it\u2019s a surprisingly decent drama.As Beau and Colt butt heads, it becomes clear they\u2019re each fighting a version of their own stubborn selves. Mr. Kutcher\u2019s Colt is essentially a 34-year-old version of his dim, cheerful Kelso from \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s like a big, horny golden retriever \u2014 weighted with the knowledge that his best days happened half his lifetime ago.Amid all this U.S.D.A.-prime masculinity, the female roles are secondary but strong. Ms. Winger wears Maggie like a lived-in pair of jeans; she and Beau have a d\u00e9tente \u2014 with occasional hookups \u2014 that suggests a long, complex history. Elisha Cuthbert (\u201c24\u201d) is engaging as Abby, Colt\u2019s woulda-coulda-shoulda former love, about to settle down \u2014 or just settle, period \u2014 with her stable, boring boyfriend.Garrison is a long way from Andy Griffith\u2019s Mayberry. It\u2019s a hard-living, hard-drinking, nostalgic place where Colt\u2019s not the only one who feels his best days are past. The show\u2019s raunchy-but-wistful prairie populism feels especially relevant in this election year, when the news media and political parties are confronting their blind spots for working-class concerns.Not that \u201cThe Ranch\u201d is overtly political. (Mostly, its politics are about spoofing Beau\u2019s character; when he goes on the warpath, Rooster says, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him that mad since Obama released the birth certificate.\u201d) But it takes characters normally written off or romanticized and treats them as full, flawed people. The cowboy term for that would be \u201crespect,\u201d and \u201cThe Ranch\u201d both gives and earns it.A review on Friday about \u201cThe Ranch,\u201d on Netflix, was mislabeled. It was a television review, not a film review.Advertisement"}

The show both mocks and celebrates the notion of the fabric of New York depending on eccentric outsiders.

And in the new season, it engages in some fairly sharp satire of Jacqueline\u2019s privileged world.

{"Headline": "Billing by Millionths of Pennies, Cloud Computing\u2019s Giants Take In Billions", "Date": "2016-04-10", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up.That is one way to think about what is going on at the world\u2019s biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny.When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used.\u201cThe scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,\u201d said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. \u201cWhen we get better economies of scale, we\u2019ll use that to our advantage.\u201dThis economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.Google charges pennies for search ads and spends $9.9 billion annually building out a global computing business. Given enough software, in the realm of millionths of pennies, it could do even better. Good luck to any new entrant without the scale of these tech giants, however, as customers come to expect that sort of cheap metering.Cloud-computing companies are not the only ones focused on the small. Banks, of course, have for years been content taking a sliver of big transactions, so long as there are many of them. Uber, which enables private cars to temporarily become taxis, can monitor drivers and riders to adjust prices and routes, changing the value of things throughout the day. An auto insurance company called Metromile charges customers based on how many miles they drive a year.As tech companies get better at measuring things, other businesses can pick up on the techniques, and the fine counting at the big clouds augurs for more precise measurements and pricing everywhere. Mitch Hedberg\u2019s joke about rice being a good meal when you are hungry for 2,000 of something may turn out to be a prophecy.A.W.S. was an early leader in public cloud computing, or renting access to computing equipment or software over an Internet connection. It started in 2006 as a barely noted fluke by Amazon. It now has over two million computer servers and a million customers, including Netflix, Shell and Brooks Brothers.The per-millionth pricing began last November, in the A.W.S. product Lambda. Lambda runs a customer\u2019s line of code in response to a request, like looking up a ZIP code when given an address. Customers never rent servers, but pay for the moments of computing.Microsoft last month announced that it would have its own \u201cserverless\u201d product. Google has something similar in early release, which is likely to be a product by the third quarter of this year.Microsoft is even trying to do A.W.S. one better by microslicing the cost to rent some of its software licenses into the minutes of actual use. \u201cWe\u2019re renting the sand and charging for the sun\u2019s UV rays that hit you,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, who runs Microsoft\u2019s cloud.For the big clouds, microslicing is also a way of coping with a tough task: Customers have to feel like they can rent all the computing they want, and the providers must always run at near full capacity. If someone is using cycles, and not whole machines, more people can be packed in.\u201cThe secret to cloud economics is utilization \u2014 every minute unsold is money you don\u2019t get back,\u201d said Greg DeMichillie, the head of product for Google\u2019s cloud. \u201cThere are very few of us who can work at this scale.\u201dLike any important new tech trend, the microsliced, serverless model is already attracting investors and start-ups eager to work in the new world \u2014 and in this case, wary of what the giants will do next.An Oakland, Calif., company called Serverless makes software that other engineers can use to develop products for computing in Lambda and its ilk. \u201cWe think this could be the focal point of A.W.S., even though I have no idea how they make money charging this little,\u201d said Austen Collins, the founder of Serverless.One way they make money is by adding on other products and servers. So does Mr. Collins think A.W.S. could thwart his business? \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think Amazon won\u2019t be in everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018What if Amazon does it?\u2019 We assume they will, and try to do something a little better and faster.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So Why Is He Running?", "Date": "2016-04-11", "News": "Supported byAnd yet there he was on a recent Monday afternoon, in a coffee shop on the city\u2019s north side, signing campaign fliers. He said he couldn\u2019t sleep last night and got up to dress long before the sun rose over Roland Park, the tony North Baltimore neighborhood where he lives with a childhood mentor (navy chinos, eggshell Oxford shirt and, of course, his trademark royal blue Patagonia puffer vest, now faded and fraying around the collar). He had been pulled here and there all day, doing interviews with Mashable and Mother Jones, taking calls from the Museum of Modern Art and journalists in Italy and Germany. He\u2019s exceptionally charming; all day, he fielded questions graciously, smiling and laughing, joking and gossiping. Through it all, he signed fliers. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m writing anymore,\u201d he said, scribbling.Baltimore\u2019s Democratic primaries \u2014 which, in a city with as many as 10 Democrats for every Republican, might as well be the general election \u2014 take place on April 26. But for a few reasons Mckesson is willing to admit (he took time to ask scores of people for advice, he couldn\u2019t find an available lawyer versed in Maryland election law) and a few he\u2019s not, he didn\u2019t officially file his papers until Feb. 3, leaving him the last of 13 Democratic candidates to throw a hat in the ring.Now he\u2019s asking voters to put him in charge of everything from Baltimore\u2019s police force to its potholes. His campaign is by far the highest-profile example of a Black Lives Matter protester running for public office, and it was initially greeted with nationwide excitement. Mckesson has already inspired thousands around the country to protest police brutality, but the viability of any civil rights movement lies in its ability to move from the street to the places where governance happens. The question was whether Mckesson could parlay his national following into local action. \u201cI get it,\u201d he says now. \u201cI get that that doesn\u2019t translate.\u201dThe first poll to include his candidacy, conducted by The Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and released in March, barely registered his presence. Catherine Pugh, a Maryland state senator, led with 26 percent. Sheila Dixon, Baltimore\u2019s mayor from 2007 to 2010, was two points behind. Smaller chunks of respondents favored David Warnock (a businessman and charter-school founder), Nick Mosby (of the City Council; his wife, Marilyn, is state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore), Elizabeth Embry (of the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office) and Carl Stokes (another city councilman). Mckesson and the six remaining candidates all came in at less than 1 percent. He says that the polls don\u2019t tell the whole story, that he was a late entry, that pollsters overrepresent voters with landlines \u2014 in other words, old people. But the typical profile of a voter in a Baltimore election is a black woman over age 50 (a category that happens to include both Pugh and Dixon).The notion that Mckesson ever had a shot gets a chuckle out of Anthony McCarthy, Pugh\u2019s communications director. \u201cI can say with a great deal of confidence that DeRay Mckesson is not going to be the next mayor of Baltimore,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as Mckesson contributing to the conversation, I think she appreciates him\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s about the limit of his role. \u201cBaltimore\u2019s a city you don\u2019t have much of a connection to, other than you were born here,\u201d he adds, referring to Mckesson. \u201cA lot of people were.\u201dQuixotic as his campaign might seem, Mckesson still possesses the same seemingly bottomless well of self-confidence that moved him to wake up one morning and drive 550 miles from Minneapolis to Ferguson, Mo., to protest after Michael Brown was shot to death in August 2014. He\u2019s a man who doesn\u2019t much know failure. So all day, in the Ubers he took around the city, between tweets and through interviews, he was personalizing fliers, signing his name in black marker right over the word \u201ceducation,\u201d covering up the mistake. Then, the plan went, he would pass out these fliers, and then something else would supposedly happen, and then DeRay Mckesson would be the next mayor of Baltimore.DeRay Mckesson will not be the next mayor of Baltimore.Mckesson, the child of two drug addicts, was raised here by his father and his great-grandmother. His dad eventually got clean and started working 16-hour days at a local seafood distributor, and when Mckesson was in sixth grade, the family moved out of the city to nearby Catonsville. Mckesson was elected to student government from sixth grade all the way through Catonsville High; at Bowdoin College, in Maine, he spent each year as class president, student government president or, in his senior year, both. He majored in government and legal studies but went into education, and soon moved back to Baltimore to work in the city\u2019s public-school system.By then, he says, he already had mayoral ambitions. \u201cI thought about it a long time ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I was No. 2 in human capital in the school system. And it was actually, like, that was the perfect role to get things done.\u201d In 2013, he was recruited to be the senior director of human capital for Minneapolis public schools, and his career path seemed all but mapped out.He had spent much of his life in Baltimore and his entire career in the system, but he was reborn, publicly, in Ferguson. He and Elzie emerged as powerful symbols, new faces of a leaderless movement. By March 2015, he had resigned from his job and become a full-time activist, the biggest star within a movement that had grown, since the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, to hold the nation\u2019s attention. Then, in April, Freddie Gray died of a spinal injury suffered in the custody of the Baltimore police, and the protests that followed brought Mckesson home. And in September, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that she wouldn\u2019t seek re-election in 2016.Mckesson had experienced power before, but Black Lives Matter was surely different. He was being invited to appear on network television, rubbing shoulders with Beyonc\u00e9 and President Obama. The movement gave him purpose and community but also influence and access. And if the goal of Black Lives Matter was, in part, to convince more Americans that police brutality existed at all, it was successful. With that success, the momentum began to shift and transform into something else. Mckesson was a protester, but there were fewer protests than before. And he couldn\u2019t protest indefinitely; he needed an income.In February, he announced his run. In the two months since, he has raised more than $265,000 from more than 5,400 supporters spanning all 50 states, with more local donors than all but two candidates. Money has rolled in from celebrities he counts as friends and others he doesn\u2019t. It has rolled in from tech executives like Reed Hastings of Netflix and Omid Kordestani of Twitter, which has embraced Mckesson as a kind of power-user brand ambassador. Jack\u2019d, the gay dating app, endorsed him via a push notification to its users. (Mckesson is gay.) The legendary Baltimorean John Waters endorsed him, too.But other candidates have been building their campaigns for years. They have TV ads, yard signs, bumper stickers. Warnock has spent almost $2 million on his campaign. Mckesson doesn\u2019t have these things; he has made an ad and other video clips but shares them only online. Instead, he is swimming in small contributions from an army of supporters, and maximum donations from influential people who don\u2019t much represent Baltimore. All that good will only further cements the narrative that the candidate, who was born and raised here, is a product of somewhere else.The front-runners in the race are experienced insiders; Dixon is so well connected that her stint as mayor ended with corruption charges. Mckesson doesn\u2019t know the various players in Baltimore, or even have many staff members who are locals. His campaign managers, Sharhonda Bossier and her deputy, Maria Griffin, are young Californians. The latter met Mckesson in February at an education meeting \u2014 \u201cBut I know him how you know him,\u201d she told me. \u201cFrom Twitter.\u201dLove admits that none of the other candidates inspire him. \u201cMost of them are different iterations of the same arrangements,\u201d he says. But local activists still bristle at Mckesson. Even Kwame Rose, a 21-year-old Baltimorean who protested alongside Mckesson, says he is voting for Pugh. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Superman,\u201d he tells me. Activists heckle Mckesson at mayoral forums around the city, and when Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle organized a forum of its own, it deferred to the poll results and didn\u2019t invite him.\u201cThe hardest thing about all this is that there are \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing as the movement,\u201d Mckesson says. \u201cPeople are not as imaginative as they think they are.\u201d He calls this lack of imagination the \u201cbelief gap\u201d \u2014 an inability to believe someone like him could become mayor. \u201cThe belief gap is just the hard thing. People are like, \u2018I want it to be different, but the election is just. ...\u2019 \u201d He trails off. \u201cAnd you\u2019re like, \u2018No, it\u2019s not.\u2019 It\u2019s not a sealed deal. The only poll that matters is on April 26.\u201dCharles Village is just around the corner from Johns Hopkins University. The S.U.V. pulled up to a block of brightly colored rowhouses. Priuses and Volkswagens dotted the curbs. This could be Mckesson\u2019s constituency, too: people who might have attended elite colleges, or who might gather news from Twitter or watch \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Mckesson knocked on one door and spoke to a woman briefly, but came back empty-handed. \u201cShe\u2019s a Pugh person.\u201dA man walking his dog turned the corner and was yanked down the sidewalk. \u201cHello!\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cMy name\u2019s DeRay, and I\u2019m running for mayor.\u201dThe man recognized the candidate. He was a Baltimore public defender, in jeans and a dark jacket to stave off the chill. He immediately wanted to know the last time Mckesson stayed in the city for a long period, and was surprised when Mckesson said he was raised and spent much of his adulthood here.\u201cWe have a close community,\u201d the public defender said. He told Mckesson about residents teaming up to shovel their way out after a blizzard, when city snow removal never arrived. For the rest of the evening, from Charles Village to an evening event at a bar in Canton, Mckesson would be asked about things like this. What could he do about trash pickup? What did he have to say about high water bills? Did he know the head of Under Armour, one of the city\u2019s largest employers? When he said he wanted to get more money for Baltimore\u2019s Red Line transit proposal, he was pressed: Did he have an in with the governor?There were questions about utilities and waste management, not so many about sweeping education reform or police brutality. These voters\u2019 ambitions are more modest. Maybe they don\u2019t believe Mckesson can save Baltimore, or that Baltimore can be saved at all. Either way, they\u2019ll need their streets plowed.Mckesson kept smiling. All told, he had spent the day greeting approximately 30 of the 30,000 people he hopes to win over in the coming month. On the other hand, his campaign event that night would be live-streamed to an international audience via Twitter\u2019s Periscope app. A Vice Media producer was following him around, shooting video, pitching a documentary series on his campaign. The next week, a new poll was released, with Mckesson still under 1 percent. When I contacted him with additional questions, I learned he wasn\u2019t in Baltimore at all: After a quick trip to the White House, he was headed out to San Francisco to raise funds from his network there.DeRay Mckesson will not be the next mayor of Baltimore. He will, most likely, have to get a job \u2014 a professorship, an administrative seat, a spot at Twitter. Regardless, he seems finished as a full-time protester.Greg Howard is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built,\u2019 by Duncan Clark", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The personal-computer and Internet revolution that began in the late 20th century eventually took over most of the world, but its most prominent players \u2014 Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, Microsoft \u2014 were distinctly American. In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale. Alibaba, the sprawling Chinese digital marketplace, is already by some measures larger than Amazon. Its payment tool Alipay alone accounts for one-third of the $2.5 trillion global online payments market. The dizzying rise of the company is a crucial part of China\u2019s ascension as a global economic power, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the company, rest assured that you will. When the Alibaba founder Jack Ma appeared onstage last year at a summit in Manila with Barack Obama, Obama interviewed him.We often think of successful tech C.E.O.s climbing from the nerdy ranks of tinkering programmers, like Bill Gates, but as \u201cAlibaba,\u201d Duncan Clark\u2019s engaging biography explains, Ma\u2019s humble origins gave no clue to his future \u2014 then again, in 1970s China, the very idea of a homegrown technology business executive was inconceivable. Born in 1964 to a photographer and a factory worker, Ma grew up a mediocre student in the city of Hangzhou. About the only thing that set Ma apart was learning English, which he would practice by speaking to tourists passing through his hometown. One of these tourists, a vacationing Australian Communist, became a generous benefactor who even helped buy a house for young Ma and his wife.After a stint teaching English, Ma began running a tiny translation business, focused on Chinese companies \u2014 beginning to flourish under Deng Xiaoping \u2014 seeking to do business with the West. During his first visit to the United States in the mid-90s, a friend in Seattle logged Ma onto the Internet, and it occurred to him that listing Chinese companies online might be a good idea.If you think early American web pioneers had a tough time persuading investors and consumers to embrace the scary new world of e-commerce, imagine the challenge Ma\u2019s start-up faced: Most of China had no Internet, so his early clients were handing him thousands of dollars to create web services they themselves could not see. \u201cI was treated like a con man for three years,\u201d Ma said.Soon enough, though, his clients answered their phones to find curious Western customers on the line. In the late \u201990s, as the Chinese government began a delicate program of encouraging Internet growth without giving up state control, Ma\u2019s \u201cChina Pages\u201d and several other Chinese start-ups began to attract the attention of outside investors. That money, some of which came from the Japanese billionaire Masayosha Son, was rocket fuel for what became Alibaba, which has a massive shipping-logistics arm on top of its e-commerce services. When Alibaba went public in 2014, the $25 billion it raised made it the largest I.P.O. in world history (the next two, incidentally, were Chinese state-controlled enterprises).Clark is a China-based investment adviser and onetime consultant to Alibaba; he notes that his failure to exercise stock options he was given as payment became a $30-million mistake. The access he got to the company pushes his breezy account more toward the business than to Ma\u2019s personality. Still, Ma emerges as an unpretentious, self-deprecating leader, fond of quoting martial arts novels and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d Yet he is clearly also shrewd and extremely driven. And his company has acquired enough wealth to begin to reshape the Western business world; he has announced a Netflix-style video streaming service and now has a movie division that invests in Hollywood blockbusters. The Chinese government\u2019s control over the Internet may still make political dissent difficult, but Ma and some others have demonstrated that there are few limits to building world-beating companies.James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc.

{"Headline": "What Do Millennials Want? Hotels Have Some Ideas", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byUpdateHotels are concluding that millennial travelers want three things: customized experiences, digital convenience and relevant information on social media.According to Phocuswright research, seven in 10 18- to 34-year-olds took at least one leisure trip in 2014, and while millennials spend slightly less annually ($3,217) than older travelers ($3,381), they do travel more on the fly. Almost a quarter of Gen Y travelers booked their last trip less than one week before departure, says Phocuswright.\u201cWe see millennial travelers more as explorers than tourists,\u201d said Brian McGuinness, global brand leader, Starwood\u2019s Specialty Select Brands. \u201cOur Aloft hotels are specifically designed with them in mind.\u201dThe pilot program is available at Aloft Manhattan Downtown, Aloft Liverpool and Aloft London Excel, and will go to Aloft properties in Asia next.On the menu are things like a hangover kit of Vitaminwater, Advil and bananas for $10; a phone charger for $25; a Surprise Me package of what the Aloft emoji room-service menu calls \u201cfun swag and cool stuff\u201d for $25, and more.\u201cIf I\u2019m traveling for work, and it\u2019s late, I want a hotel where the food is good, and the delivery is quick,\u201d said Sherrelle Banks, 28, a communications analyst for Fidelity Investments in Westlake, Tex. \u201cClean, nonsmoking rooms are a must.\u201dWhen it comes to leisure travel, Ms. Banks said that she takes photos of everything in the hotels where she stays \u2014 the lobby, the view from the room, and the room itself \u2014 along with vacation shots of activities to share with friends and family.\u201cI post almost everything on social media,\u201d Ms. Banks said. \u201cPeople who saw pictures of my trip to Costa Rica on Facebook said they want to go with me next time.\u201dTo grab the attention of millennials who regularly use social media, Marriott International has gone Hollywood by running its own studio to create short films, TV shows and webisodes that promote its various brands, said David Beebe, vice president for global creative and content marketing at Marriott International.Information on the company\u2019s 19 social media brand campaigns is monitored at its headquarters in Bethesda, Md., using a screen that tracks pop culture events and allows staff members to create real-time marketing opportunities, like its recent Super Bowl \u201cSuite Stadium Contest\u201d that gave a winner and three guests an overnight stay at Levi\u2019s Stadium the night before the Super Bowl in a converted guest room suite, along with tickets to the game.In December, for example, Hilton presented Neon Trees at the Washington Hilton in the District of Columbia for an exclusive performance for guests. Hilton HHonors members can redeem points to attend such concerts, or can make a gift of the experiences to others.\u201cIt\u2019s the concierge for the social age,\u201d said Mary Beth Parks, senior vice president for global marketing for Hilton Worldwide.The company, with brands including InterContinental, Kimpton, EVEN, Indigo and Crowne Plaza, is running a pilot program in IHG hotels in China that places beacons in the lobbies and restaurants that recognize rewards club members using the IHG app nearby.\u201cThese beacons then send information to the guest\u2019s smartphone, including personalized notifications and offers,\u201d said Heather Balsley, IHG senior vice president, Americas Brand Management.Exploring the world is a goal for Chris Tung, 25, the coordinator for the original film division of Netflix in Beverly Hills, who is starting to do research for a vacation in Japan next year.\u201cI try to stay in places that are authentic to an area, where locals hang out,\u201d Mr. Tung said. \u201cPrice is a big factor.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t You Forget About Me! The Formerly Irredeemable \u201980s Return", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported bySix nights and two afternoons a week, the synthesizers blare, the lights flash and the strains of Tears for Fears are heard over Broadway.In Los Angeles, both the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Getty are hosting major exhibitions of the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, the Ur-provocateur who shook the art world some three decades ago.What year is it, anyway?The 1980s, the more-is-more era, has never left us. It\u2019s been a touchstone for fashion, music and popular culture, remembered fondly but with a shudder, as the butt of jokes and youthful indiscretions with hairstyles and shoulder heights.But then, a strange thing has been happening. The formerly irredeemable 1980s, it seems, are creeping back to the fore.\u201cI do see that coming around again,\u201d said Duncan Sheik, who wrote the music and lyrics for \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d an \u201980s-set Broadway musical that opens Thursday, one that includes both original \u201980s-style compositions (written and scored using \u201980s synthesizers and equipment) and adaptations of decade hits by Tears for Fears, New Order and Phil Collins. It is likely the first Broadway musical in history whose bloody climax takes place to Huey Lewis and the News\u2019 \u201cHip to Be Square.\u201d\u201cI think for a long time people made fun of the \u201980s aesthetic, and it was something that was derided in Adam Sandler movies,\u201d Mr. Sheik said. \u201cBut in fact a lot of really cool stuff happened in the \u201980s. In some way, hopefully, \u2018American Psycho\u2019 does justice to the aesthetic of the era.\u201dIn the theater world, the arrival of \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d on Broadway has been much anticipated (and long in coming, after a well-received run in London), but its ripples have been felt outside of it, too.The men\u2019s fashion e-tailer Mr Porter signed up as the men\u2019s wardrobe partner for the Broadway production, and \u201980s period piece or not, provided clothing from its stock to costume the cast and complement the vintage and custom \u201980s suits \u2014 an easier task circa 2016 than may be initially imagined.In women\u2019s fashion, too, the \u201980s are making a return. When, at Paris Fashion Week this March, shoulders began climbing up and out, it was an early warning sign, of sorts.Hedi Slimane, among the most imitated designers in fashion at the moment, swerved dramatically from the scruffy nonchalance of his recent, best-selling Saint Laurent collections into a high-gloss, high-drama register that screamed 1980s. It would be his final collection for Saint Laurent; the house announced his departure a month later.The change was noticed, not always with pleasure.Mr. Slimane was not alone. Eighties styles bubbled up throughout Paris Fashion Week: in new-direction looks from Lanvin, Kenzo and Isabel Marant, to name a few.For Ms. Marant, whose name is nearly synonymous with Parisian bohemians, the move toward oversize, pin-cinched coats, screaming prints and New Wave mash-up styling seemed especially pronounced \u2014 even if Ms. Marant didn\u2019t see the shift as seismic as her audience did.\u201cThings that I love, I will always love them,\u201d she said by phone from Paris, describing how the collection came about as a reaction to the death of David Bowie and the horror of the Paris terror attacks: a way to return to an earlier, more innocent time of club-hopping and flea-marketing.She keeps a large archive she said, not only of her collections but also of her own clothes, which she visited regularly while designing the fall looks. She used to pin her own huge Harris tweed overcoat (bought for a song from a \u201ckilo shop,\u201d where vintage clothes were sold by weight), just as she did for the show.She disputed the notion that there was one \u201980s style. For her, she said, the joy of the \u201980s was the freedom to dabble in many: rockabilly one day, new wave the next. Think of 1980s icons who piled on vintage and secondhand looks with reckless abandon, women like Cyndi Lauper (who, by the way, is still touring the nation, with Boy George in tow).\u201cI think that there are very strong different points of view, like we had in the \u201980s,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that something of this spirit is coming back.\u201dThe Chelsea store closed in 1997, replaced by a Madison Avenue outpost. The Madison shop remains, but Barneys is back on Seventh Avenue. (A charity fashion show and auction of leather jackets, a callback to the 1986 original, was planned for the March opening, this time supporting White Columns gallery and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center; when the fashion show was scuppered because of space constraints, the auction was held online instead.)Look around, and the spirit crops up everywhere. You can take your \u201980s at the movies, whether sporting, as in Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cEverybody Wants Some!!\u201d or swooning, as in \u201cOnce\u201d director John Carney\u2019s \u201cSing Street,\u201d about would-be Dubliner rockers agog over Duran Duran.You can take it on TV (or whatever streaming device has replaced your TV): on CNN, a seven-part documentary series, \u201cThe Eighties,\u201d began on March 31; on Netflix, Winona Ryder (breakout star of \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d in 1988) stars in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a thriller billed as \u201ca love letter to the \u201980s classics that captivated a generation,\u201d which will debut July 15.In Mr. Trump, the 21st century may have its first ascendant politician who seems beamed in from the decade.\u201cEverything that drives his candidacy is in the \u2018Art of the Deal,\u2019\u201d said Mike Berland of Berland Strategy & Analytics, who is a political strategist and pollster, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s 1987 book.While still at the strategy firm Penn Schoen Berland, Mr. Berland advised Mr. Trump on various \u201980s-vintage projects, including the fabled Trump Shuttle airline. \u201cWhen he writes, \u2018I never get too attached to one deal or one approach,\u2019\u201d Mr. Berland said, \u201cand about the press\u2019s hunger for a good story, the more controversial the better: Those inform his core beliefs and way he operates. That\u2019s what I see in my social media conversation data \u2014 he has dominated coverage with so many ideas and controversial comments. Some good, some not as effective. That mentality, I think, comes from the \u201980s, a little bit more of a selfish, self-involved era.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the second-highest demographic of \u201980s listeners on the platform are men from 18 to 24, according to the company \u2014 \u201990s babies who missed the decade entirely. Even some in the highest demographic of listeners, men 25 to 34, would have missed the \u201980s or enjoyed it in their infancy.\u201cI was just a baby in the \u201980s,\u201d said Ms. Prentiss, whose book contains portions set in 1980. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know much about it apart from \u2018Kids Incorporated.\u2019\u201dShe had not initially expected to focus on the decade. \u201cIt ended up being an \u201980s book, even though it wasn\u2019t intended to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that it\u2019s sort of trending now, the late \u201970s, early \u201980s. I started the book seven years ago. I feel like it\u2019s lucky. People are interested in that right now.\u201dFenton Bailey, who, with his collaborator, Randy Barbato, directed \u201cMapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures,\u201d which premiered this month on HBO, agreed.\u201cYou could say, on the one hand, it\u2019s nostalgia,\u201d Mr. Bailey said in an interview. \u201cWhat is nostalgia other than a sufficient amount of time has passed that you can forget the reality of what it was like and romanticize it?\u201d (He cautioned against undue romance: His East Village, he said, \u201cwas shabby chic without the chic bit.\u201d)\u201cI think there\u2019s something more happening,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really need a generation before you can look back and put something in its proper context.\u201dThe generations have passed, though today\u2019s generation, Google-weaned, can quickly make a fetish of whatever decade the moment happens to favor. The \u201970s are never far from the popular imagination. The \u201990s are enjoying their own durable revival, too. (The O. J. Simpson case is once again a water-cooler obsession.)Then there are those classics that bridge the blurry \u201980s and \u201990s divide, like the treacle classic \u201cFull House\u201d (1987-95), reborn as \u201cFuller House,\u201d or Hulk Hogan, the wrestler, enjoying a very strange third act.But the \u201980s arrived again (not for the first nor, surely, the last time) with their own special victory, given the low esteem in which they are sometimes held.\u201cIt\u2019s a decade that gets harsh press,\u201d said Mr. Langmead, of Mr Porter, who looked back not entirely fondly on the styles of his own 1980s youth as a fashion student at Central Saint Martins in London.Nevertheless, there\u2019s a generation \u201cgrowing up looking back at it, and they\u2019ll think it\u2019s very cool and retro,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to look on it with rosy-tinted spectacles, which will help it be picked up again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Entire Netflix History of Us", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byModern LoveRob and I broke up on a Monday. It was the first warm day after an impossibly long winter, which made the whole thing feel that much more cruel. I was in line at Starbucks when I got a text that read, \u201cHey, you around? I think we need to talk.\u201dJust two short sentences, but they had the destructive force of a sudden summer storm.As I walked home, panic settled in my stomach like a swallowed stone. I went into my bedroom and closed the door, even though I live alone. Our conversation was brief, or so it seemed. I had no concept of time.I refrained from asking him why and therefore seeming desperate, a perception of collectedness that came at the expense of my gaining any real answers or closure.What I did manage to gather made me realize that as I had been floating along on a river of bliss, he had been mentally cataloging evidence of my flaws.Earlier that week, we had talked about stopping by the Tompkins Square dog run. We didn\u2019t have a dog, but we loved to sneak in \u2014 always one at a time to give the impression we had arranged to meet each other there. We\u2019d give the dogs funny voices, accents, back stories. Or maybe that was just me?I went to work early Tuesday to remove the pictures of us from my cubicle wall, redistributing the others in hopes that co-workers wouldn\u2019t notice and ask. I put the thumbtacks back in their little box, tucked the photos into a folder in the bottom of a drawer and went to the bathroom, where I cried in ugly, shallow breaths.\u201cYou have to go back to normal,\u201d my friends advised in the too-gentle voice one might use when speaking to a child or the mentally unstable. \u201cIt will help you feel better.\u201dI showed up at work the rest of the week, eyes rimmed with worn mascara and sleeplessness. I sat through meetings, turning my head when my name was called but requiring a moment to understand why.When the weekend finally came, I looked forward to the sweet reprieve of solitude and planned to stay inside with the blinds shut against the oppressive joy of late April. I picked up sushi in clothes unfit for public display, hurried home and turned on Netflix to embark on all 57 episodes of \u201cPortlandia.\u201dAnd there it was: my recently watched list, representing the entire history of our relationship.There was \u201cMad Men,\u201d which we watched again from the beginning during a snowstorm, my legs across his lap, the cat asleep on my stomach, Peggy Olson still vulnerable and meek.While making dinner later, I was humming along to a Billie Holiday song at the stove when he came up behind me, wrapped his arms around my waist and belted the chorus in a low vibrato.I collapsed into laughter, into him.\u201cThis is everything I want,\u201d he said, suddenly serious.\u201cTacos?\u201d I joked, but my throat tightened with a mixture of fear and hope.There was the Bill Burr comedy special we had barely started when he pulled me onto his lap and began kissing me. He tried to carry me to his bed, but his socks slipped a little on the wood floor, and we laughed, mouths still together, the moment made sweeter.We finished the show half-clothed, a picnic spread out on the bed. It was the first time in my life I had felt nostalgic for the exact moment I was in.There was the documentary about creatures from the ocean depths, with David Attenborough explaining how cuttlefish mate, as we talked about the career change I was contemplating.\u201cJust go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cLook how happy it makes you just talking about the possibility.\u201dAnd for one clear moment, I saw myself as he saw me. After he fell asleep, I listened to his deep and steady breathing as a giant squid died while protecting her eggs.Earlier that night, a friend had taken a picture of us sitting at a counter facing each other, his hands extended to me and mine over my mouth, our eyes disappearing into our smiles. Neither of us had noticed the camera pointed our way, or the crowd swelling around us, or Midtown carrying on just outside.Before I could think about it, I hit play on \u201cMad Men.\u201d On some subconscious level I must have been hoping that by replaying the episodes, I could replay the memories, too, and surrender completely to grief.I was tired of treading water, of trying to use errands and routine to will away the sadness that demanded to be felt. On screen, Don Draper struggled for the right Lucky Strike pitch while I let myself wallow in the hows and whys of heartbreak.My friends came over on Saturday night and forced me to shower and put on a bra. They took me out, propped me up on a barstool and tried to talk to me through my thousand-yard stare.\u201cThose guys over there are looking at you,\u201d my friend Hannah yelled in my ear. \u201cI think you should smile at them.\u201dI tried, but the synapses between brain and face muscles were dulled from underuse, and instead my mouth did a sort of bared-teeth grimace.The next night my friends tried again, this time at home with red wine. We even wore tiaras, because who can be sad in a tiara?Me, apparently. I was present for the conversation, and occasionally participated, but my mind was so far removed that my contributions mostly involved uttering some non sequitur about a topic they already had moved on from.After the conversation shifted from talk of the new ice cream shop to the merits of visiting the public library, I added, \u201cI wonder if they have dairy-free stuff.\u201dThey forgave my lapses the way people may forgive an old, flatulent dog.By the end of the weekend, my friends let me crawl back into my cave. I turned on the TV and was surprised to see something new in my queue: \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi.\u201dI stood up, mouth agape.It was communication from the void, like a song you love coming in over the radio with surprising clarity as you drive through rural towns. I thought of him watching it on the couch that his legs were too long for, feet hanging over the armrest, and something in my chest crumpled like a paper lily.I wanted to be angry that he was still using my login \u2014 that he could still take from me after leaving me with nothing. But I couldn\u2019t. This was my only connection to him, and changing my password would sever the last artery of this bleeding limb.I also thought: Maybe if he sees the same titles that I see, he, too, will replay the highlight reel of our happy memories and be warmed by them. And, who knows, that might lead him back to me?I turned it on, watched Jiro slice fish methodically, and soon fell into a deep, dreamless sleep for the first time in a week.The next day after work, I was watching a bowl of leftovers rotate in the microwave when a message buzzed on my phone.\u201cHey\u2026 how are you?\u201dMy face flushed with love and rage and longing and indignity.I opened a new message so he wouldn\u2019t see the typing bubbles appear, disappear and then reappear with indecision. I started and deleted messages as the microwave beeped from what seemed like miles away. Finally I typed, \u201cI\u2019m good \u2014 everything okay?\u201d Cool, collected, a bit detached.\u201cYeah, of course. Just wanted to say hi \u2026 make sure you were doing okay.\u201dSuddenly, the lobe of my brain that held all my pain plunged into darkness and the lobe that held my anger blazed with light. Did he expect me to be sitting at home in a stained tank top eating leftovers? I mean, I was, but \u2014 was the thought of me being fine without him so improbable that he felt the need to check on my stability?Another buzz from my phone: \u201cHave you seen \u2018Jiro Dreams of Sushi\u2019? I think you\u2019d like it because you love quirky old people.\u201dI sat down with my dinner and thought of several responses, some gentle, some fiery and profane. Eventually, I decided to say nothing. Instead, I changed my Netflix password.I worried that I may never again feel as completely safe and at ease as I did making funny voices for a French bulldog with him by my side, but you can\u2019t control how someone else feels. Better, in the end, to focus on those few things you can control.Like his Netflix access.Tonya Malinowski lives in Connecticut, where she is a producer for ESPN.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

I guess I wasn\u2019t ready for her emotionally.\u201dThey settled on being friends, which frustrated Ms. Balbirer, who is now 50 and a New York-based writer and actress. \u201cHowie always had a girlfriend,\u201d she said, but \u201cthat girlfriend was never me.\u201dThey spent the next few years honing their respective crafts \u2014 Mr. Morris eventually delved into playwriting \u2014 and bouncing around campus in Lower Manhattan, often enjoying lunch together. \u201cNancy was always nice enough to pay,\u201d Mr. Morris said, adding \u201cbecause I was always broke.\u201d\u201cHow would you feel about making out with Howard Morris, the lead actor in my play?\u201d Mr. Morris asked Ms. Balbirer. If only for a scripted New York minute, she was thrilled to become his leading lady. \u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goodness, I didn\u2019t have to do any acting when it came to making out with Howie.\u201dIn addition to what he called \u201cthe perfect kiss,\u201d Mr. Morris was soon reaping other benefits from his production. A director who had seen and enjoyed the play took it to the Manhattan Punchline Theater, which had a reputation for producing comedy writers.With his writing career on the rise, Mr. Morris married in May 1994, which became a bittersweet time for an old castmate, who was still single.\u201cWe clearly still had strong feelings for each other, but it was completely platonic,\u201d she said.\u201cThough I was happily married, I must admit to feeling a tinge of sadness that day,\u201d he said.By 2002, Mr. Morris, who had a 2-year-old son, was in the throes of a divorce. That same year, Ms. Balbirer, whose career focus had shifted to writing, moved back to New York with her husband. \u201cJust when I needed my best friend the most, she was leaving,\u201d Mr. Morris said. She became what he called \u201cmy email shoulder to lean on.\u201dIn March 2011, it was Mr. Morris\u2019s turn to lend a shoulder as Ms. Balbirer separated from her husband, with whom she had a 6-year-old daughter. \u201cWe were calling it a temporary separation at that time,\u201d she said. But by July, her separation became permanent. To make matters worse, her beloved dog, Ira, died shortly afterward.\u201cI was feeling numb and going through therapy, just trying to figure out what was going on in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like I was trapped in a bad dream.\u201dTwo months later, Mr. Morris went to New York to attend the wedding of a friend and visited Ms. Balbirer to both console her and profess his love for her, hoping that the stage had now been set for their long-awaited romance.But Ms. Balbirer flipped the script. \u201cI told Howie that I wasn\u2019t ready for him emotionally,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed time to heal and didn\u2019t want to simply fold myself into his life, nor did I want him to be, after all the years we shared as friends and everything he had meant to me, nothing more than a rebound.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that after all those years, I was finally hearing Howard Morris telling me that he loved me. And there I was, unable to do anything about it.\u201dRather than force the issue, Mr. Morris thought it best to back off a little, and simply told Ms. Balbirer to \u201ctrust your instincts.\u201dHe returned to Los Angeles, where he continued to monitor Ms. Balbirer\u2019s emotional health, as well as her dating status. \u201cHe would always check in to see if I was single or dating someone,\u201d Ms. Balbirer said with a chuckle.In the summer of 2014, Ms. Balbirer, who was now single and in a much better place emotionally, sent Mr. Morris a long, humorous email in which she wondered, among other things, how it was that they never became an item.Mr. Morris, who was still pining over her, read the email aloud to his writers, who were spellbound. One of them, Alexa Junge, said she turned to Mr. Morris and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t marry this woman, I will.\u201dWhen Mr. Morris confessed to his staff that he was still very much in love with Ms. Balbirer, Ms. Junge began devising a plan to get them together. Knowing that she would be in New York on business in April 2015, Ms. Junge reached out to Ms. Balbirer.\u201cShe was everything I hoped she would be, beautiful and smart,\u201d Ms. Junge said of Ms. Balbirer, whose divorce had been completed four months earlier.Late in the conversation, Ms. Balbirer blurted out: \u201cCan I just tell you? I\u2019ve been in love with Howard Morris for 30 years.\u201d\u201cIt was an incredible moment,\u201d Ms. Junge said. \u201cI remember catching my breath and saying, \u2018Well, I think it might be mutual.\u2019\u201dMs. Junge, who had written a play that was to open in June at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, convinced Ms. Balbirer to join her there, along with Mr. Morris and other members of his staff. Ms. Balbirer went along, and said that she and Mr. Morris had a great time. They flew back to California on a Sunday for their first-ever date, at a restaurant near his home in Santa Monica.During dinner, Ms. Balbirer experienced an awakening of sorts. \u201cI looked across the table and said to Howie, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s been you all along.\u2019\u201d\u201cI had always loved him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I was realizing that I could finally have him.\u201dLater that evening, Ms. Balbirer was preparing to head back to New York on a red-eye flight, but before leaving for the airport, she returned to Mr. Morris\u2019s home, where they started on a romance that almost began 32 years earlier.\u201cWe shared our first real kiss that night,\u201d Ms. Balbirer said. \u201cI never felt happier or more alive than I did at that moment.\u201dThey were married on March 25 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, in the company of Ms. Balbirer\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, Colette Zighelboim, who served as her maid of honor, and Mr. Morris\u2019s 16-year-old son, Dustin Morris, his best man. Their witness was Ms. Junge.Shortly after Alisa Fuentes, a staff member in the City Clerk\u2019s office, said, \u201cBy the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York, I now pronounce you married,\u201d Ms. Balbirer turned to Mr. Morris and said softly, \u201cYou were worth the wait.\u201dLater that evening, the couple celebrated with a dozen other family members and friends at one of their old haunts, the Odeon. \u201cWe love this place because it\u2019s been around since the 1980s, like us,\u201d Ms. Balbirer said. (\u201cBut now I pay,\u201d Mr. Morris joked.)Ms. Balbirer \u2014 who will move to California this summer so that her daughter can begin middle school there \u2014 noted that her wedding dinner also served as an anniversary celebration.\u201cIt was 30 years ago that Howie wrote \u2018Almost Romance,\u2019\u201d she said. To help celebrate it, Mr. Morris received a wedding ring from Ms. Balbirer with an inscription created by her daughter that read: \u201cN + H Almost Romance, March 25 2016,\u201d but the word \u2018Almost\u2019 had been crossed out by a thin line running through it.\u201cThe \u2018Almost\u2019 is gone,\u201d Ms. Balbirer said. \u201cThe \u2018Romance\u2019 is here to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What\u2019s the name of that sandy place in the south with the snakes? Oh, right, Dorne.The opening title sequence plays the very practical role of providing viewers the only guide through the physical landscape, not to mention the earworm so closely associated with the show. It\u2019s one of several title sequences in recent years designed to be a significant part of how you process and remember a program \u2014 in other words, something you don\u2019t want to fast-forward through.\u201cThey\u2019re really preparing you and giving you the feeling and tonality you need to enter that world,\u201d Ms. Landekic said.For \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the map concept grew out of the show\u2019s original idea of having a crow fly from King\u2019s Landing to Winterfell, two of the key locations.Anticipating that viewers would have trouble keeping up with the action, Mr. Wall and his team designed interstitial scenes for the pilot that would move viewers from one location in Westeros to the next, much like the style of what ended up being the opening credits. The idea was to help viewers place where each scene was happening in the big, confusing world.\u201cIt was awful, and it ended up disrupting the narrative rhythm,\u201d he said, explaining why the scenes never made it to air.But that highlighted viewers\u2019 need for some kind of legend to understand the layout of the world, to remind them this wasn\u2019t happening on Earth, Mr. Wall said.

Mr. Masterson is Rooster, the unsung older brother who replaced Colt 15 years earlier as the not-quite-golden son at home. Sam Elliott is their father, Beau, an anti-P.C. cowboy type who wields love like a weapon. And Debra Winger is their mother, Maggie, who shuttles between the Airstream behind her bar and the bed of her hardheaded spouse.\u201cDanny was one of my first friends out here, and we\u2019ve stayed closely connected over the years,\u201d said Mr. Kutcher, calling from Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife, Mila Kunis \u2014 another \u201c\u201970s Show\u201d alum \u2014 and their 18-month-old daughter, Wyatt Isabelle. \u201cEven our kids are friends. So it\u2019s a reunion for the public, but for us it\u2019s just another day.\u201d Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Q. Sorry about the bad connection, but I\u2019m on a boat.Tell us about Colt.Colt\u2019s a guy who had all the talent in the world and thought he had the cards lined up to be a success, but he didn\u2019t have the discipline and the work ethic to get there. In public he brandishes the confidence of a small-town hero. But he\u2019s had a 15-year failed football career and the regret that goes with it. Now he\u2019s come home. Why Danny and why a ranch?Danny and I have wanted to work together again, but our schedules never lined up until I came off \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d So we decided to focus on a small town in conservative, blue-collar, Middle America, and on a family trying to keep their ranch alive. And we put this kind of Archie Bunker character at the center of it. Rather than make fun of the views of that audience, we decided to speak to them and their belief in God and country. We also felt it would be really topical.Are things about \u201cThe Ranch\u201d similar to your upbringing in Iowa?I was raised in a town with a little more than 100 people, so I\u2019m pretty familiar with ranching and farming. I also know that the heartland isn\u2019t always represented correctly in the media, and nobody really makes content for them.Why, after a huge, network Chuck Lorre show, did you go with Netflix?We wanted to disrupt the sitcom. We wanted the characters to talk like real people, to use irreverent language, to have an edge. We wanted to shoot things outdoors and play country music \u2014 things that are unconventional for a sitcom. So we made the distinct choice to do this on Netflix, where we thought they\u2019d let us make the show we wanted to make.How did you get Sam Elliott on board?We wanted a father type with gravitas because it allows you to say whatever you want, to get dramatic and still make it funny. You know the feeling that no matter how old your dad gets, he can always whip your ass? Sam is that guy.Mr. Masterson says that at least one other \u201c\u201970s Show\u201d regular will appear. Mila?You\u2019ll have to wait and see.And will those Uggs, just like Tom Brady\u2019s, continue to have a starring role?Yes, the Uggs make another appearance \u2014 or two.

Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where \u201cfear and anxiety\u201d have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said.Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks \u2014 a first for their 10-year-old fund. \u201cGold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that\u2019s when we got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cGoldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10.\u201d The stock ended up being one of the fund\u2019s better-performing holdings in the first quarter.A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund\u2019s managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering \u201cskinnier bundles\u201d of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS\u2019s sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Content is king,\u2019 and we believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have good content, you\u2019ll be able to monetize it.\u201dThe Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500.The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone.\u201cA big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes.\u201dThe strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund \u2014 and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said.\u201cThink about Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cIt declared a dividend in 2012, so it\u2019s now in my world. It didn\u2019t score well in our model \u2014 the valuation was too rich \u2014 so it\u2019s not in the portfolio. But I\u2019m looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow.\u201cMicrosoft was the Apple of the \u201980s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow.\u201dThe SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter.Croci (pronounced \u201ccroaky\u201d) stands for \u201ccash return on capital invested,\u201d she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said.\u201cEarnings are based on accounting numbers,\u201d she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. \u201cWith Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,\u201d she said.The fund\u2019s managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks.\u201cWe start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,\u201d Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly.The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics.Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon\u2019s was 12. \u201cSo on the surface, Exxon was cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock.\u201d The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke\u2019s advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said.Coke was also among the fund\u2019s most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding.The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Parental Leave Policies Are Changing", "Date": "2016-04-06", "News": "Supported byHere, three reporters for The New York Times \u2014 Jodi Kantor, an enterprise reporter who has written about gender, politics and the workplace; Noam Scheiber, a labor reporter based in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief \u2014 discuss their views on new family leave laws in California, New York and corporate America and what they might augur in terms of national policy.First up, Jodi Kantor.Dear Noam and Thomas,Here\u2019s a mashup of what I used to hear, as a reporter and parent, about the prospects for ever having state-mandated parental leave in the United States:Paid family leave may be desperately needed, but it\u2019s a political pipe dream. Democrats are unwilling to fight for it. The business world will never go for it. The United States just has terminally shoddy parental leave policies. (Cue dirgelike music and new parents giving longing glances to countries like Sweden, which grants 480 days of paid leave.)But now \u2014 every day \u2014 the statements above are becoming a little less true.To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about the arms race in the corporate and technology worlds to provide deluxe doses of paid parental leave \u2014 like the whole year that white-collar workers receive at Netflix. Those are voluntary corporate policies. We\u2019re discussing laws that will cover far more people: if you\u2019re a supermarket checkout clerk in Albany, your employer will for the first time be legally required to give you paid leave.So why is this finally happening now, and so fast? The push for paid parental leave has no clear leader. Aside from some long-dedicated activists and White House support, there\u2019s barely an organized movement at all. This isn\u2019t like the gay marriage effort, with a well-planned multiyear strategy and deep-pocketed financiers.One answer is demographics. Nearly 70 percent of mothers with children under 18 now work, according to the Labor Department. More than three-quarters of single mothers are sole breadwinners. The need for paid leave is more urgent and desperate than ever before.Another reason: generally speaking, workers are going to pay for the leave themselves, through small paycheck deductions similar to those taken out for familiar government programs like Medicare and Social Security. Most of the new programs are funded by tiny contributions, a dollar or two a week, that will be collected by the employer and paid out to the employee when the leave is taken. This is why opposition is pretty low \u2014 the government isn\u2019t footing the bill, and aside from possibly hiring temporary help to fill in for employees on leave, neither are businesses. The San Francisco law is an exception, requiring larger employers to fill in workers\u2019 paychecks beyond what the state-run system contributes.So, for the first time in United States history, we can start to see what a system of state-mandated parental leave might look like, beyond postpartum disability pay. By Swedish standards, it would still look like a messy patchwork, with wild swings in coverage depending on where you live and work, and plenty of gaps and exclusions. But we\u2019ve never had much of a system at all, so this is still a huge shift \u2014 especially since every one of the new laws covers paternity leave for men.Dear Jodi,I completely agree: the quick succession of the New York and San Francisco measures suggests we\u2019re on the verge of something big here. And the \u201cwhy now?\u201d question really does loom large.In fairness, there have been some well-organized efforts to build political momentum around this issue over the years. The Working Families Party, which was founded in New York in 1998 to pull Democrats to the left on economics, has made a concerted effort to elevate the issue since 2007, and the party is now active in a dozen states. The community organizing that party leaders and activists did back then \u2014 and the polling they consulted \u2014 identified paid leave as a cause that would excite both low-income and middle-class workers, especially women.That said, the movement seems more dispersed, organic, and generally leaderless than the effort to advance marriage equality, as you point out. So we can\u2019t chalk it all up to a vast left-wing conspiracy.I\u2019d argue that economics is a big part of the story. In particular, and maybe a bit paradoxically, I think we\u2019re seeing the result of a tight labor market for those near the top, coupled with wage stagnation and downward mobility in the middle and at the bottom.And why were hourly workers so exercised about this? Again, economics. In the middle and bottom of the income spectrum, you have a generation\u2019s worth of stagnating and even declining real wages (except for a brief period in the mid-to-late 1990s), making it more and more necessary for middle- and working-class households to send two earners into the work force. But with two adults at work and the family dependent on both of their incomes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to take time off to care for a baby or a parent.As the Working Families Party likes to put it, the manufacturing worker who once made $20 or $30 an hour could support his whole family on that income, making it possible for his wife to raise the children or care for a parent.Now that he and his wife both have to work at Wal-Mart \u2014 and still bring home less money combined than he once did alone \u2014 they\u2019re out of luck when that baby arrives.Long story short, when workers who are struggling thanks in part to the lack of paid leave see more affluent workers getting heaping portions of it, it\u2019s no surprise that they start to demand something similar. Consider it a uniquely American form of consciousness-raising.And Thomas FullerDear Noam and Jodi,Greetings from San Francisco! I suppose it\u2019s not that surprising that this was the first city in the United States to roll out fully paid parental leave. San Francisco is so proudly liberal that the label \u201cRepublican\u201d is a throw-down-the-gloves insult to some here.The vote on Tuesday in the board of supervisors was unanimous, and one of the supervisors talked about putting the city \u201con the level of European social democracies that have more forward-thinking policies.\u201d So there you have it, America in 2016: a socialist is winning primaries in the presidential race, and San Francisco is talking about emulating European welfare states.There was opposition to the parental leave measure, but it seemed to me quite muted. The city\u2019s Small Business Commission opposed it during the drafting process but didn\u2019t seem very enthusiastic in speaking out against it. The commission\u2019s executive director didn\u2019t return my call or email.Outside City Hall on Tuesday, the sponsor of the parental leave measure, Supervisor Scott Wiener, had organized some speeches by supporters. But inside the beautiful wood-paneled board of supervisors meeting room, everything was businesslike. The ordinance passed in an almost matter-of-fact, procedural way. One of the supervisors, David Campos, said he was disappointed the measure wasn\u2019t going to take effect faster \u2014 it\u2019s being phased in according to how many employees a company has and will be fully in force in January, 2018.I was interested to learn how the measure came about: a member of Mr. Wiener\u2019s staff is having a baby and looked into parental leave provisions across the country\u2026and a few months later an ordinance was born.Readers, can you tell us how this model will benefit you, or would have benefited you had it existed in the past? Is it enough or do you want more?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Challenges Netflix by Opening Prime to Monthly Subscribers", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon is introducing new options to subscribe to its Prime membership service on a monthly basis, a change that could make the company\u2019s video service a tougher competitor to Netflix.Amazon Prime, by most accounts, has been a huge success for the company, but one of the biggest hurdles for anyone thinking about joining the service is that it has required customers to pay $99 up front for an annual membership. The new options do away with the need for an annual commitment to Prime, widening its appeal to people who are more comfortable joining it on a short-term basis.The new monthly options will not save people money, though. Customers who subscribe month-to-month for the full Prime service will pay $32.88 more a year than if they subscribe on an annual basis, while subscribers to the video service will pay $8.88 more a year while getting substantially fewer benefits, like free two-day shipping, than annual Prime members.Now, by broadening the monthly options for Prime to anyone and introducing a video-only service, the company is making it easier for people to compare the price of Prime to that of Netflix, the dominant subscription streaming provider, with more than 75 million subscribers globally.Netflix has long been available on a monthly basis, without an annual commitment, offering several plans ranging from $7.99 to $11.99 a month, depending on video quality and the number of screens to which customers can stream video at the same time.The company\u2019s decision to offer a video-only version of Prime reflects a growing confidence at the company in the quality of the service. Amazon got started in video streaming much later than Netflix, and its catalog of movies and television shows was initially anemic by comparison.For a time, Amazon\u2019s video service seemed like little more than a nice additional benefit to the main attraction of the Prime service, two-day free shipping.But Amazon has steadily chipped away at skepticism of its seriousness in video by expanding the amount of content available for streaming.It has nabbed rights to popular series like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d which are not available to stream on Netflix. Like Netflix, Amazon has poured money into producing original content, including award-winning shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She worried about moving the children again, but knew that the foster care system might move or separate them. She wrote:\nAs family, we know we will support them as long as we are alive.

I was 6 and ready to start first grade when my mother came back into the picture and the judge reunited us. I wish I could conclude that we all lived happy ever after when the judge reunited us with Mom. Sadly, the chaos of mental illness, alcoholism, physical and emotional abuse that was my reality that led to our placement into foster care never went away.Years ago I managed to reconnect with my foster mom. She told me that after my brother and I left they stopped fostering. Their hearts were broken after we left, she told me. I never realized the loss they must have felt until then.When I was 3 years old, my parents were incarcerated for running a prostitution service out of our home. Almost all the homes we had were full of hatred, except one. Her name was Jan and she desperately wanted me to call her mom. I never did, and I\u2019m sure that hurt her. The rest of the time was a blur of abuse and neglect until my mother got out of jail and got clean, and we went back to her. Ten years later, when I was 17, she relapsed and put herself into heart failure. She died six months later. She hurt me, again.Life is really hard sometimes. Reading this essay by Meghan Moravcik Walbert, I cried. I cried for her, but most importantly I cried for BlueJay, because life will always be harder for him. Foster care changes a person. I\u2019m 28 now and going into my third year of medical school. I\u2019ll be a physician soon. I have a 3-year-old son. Sometimes I look into his eyes and I see me, the day I went into foster care. I\u2019ve almost quit medical school multiple times in fear of putting him in day care. I can\u2019t explain in words how much this hurts.Joy DeLaere, West Dundee, Ill.Our first foster placement was a sibling group: a 13-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother. My then 3-year-old biological son and 4-year-old biological daughter instantly fell in love. It was supposed to be a short-term placement, possibly three to six months, and we wanted to love them as best we could for whatever time we had with them. Instead, it was three and a half years of emotional Ping-Pong. We were young, unexperienced parents and made mistakes. They were some of the hardest years of my life and some of the best at the same time.We had almost forgotten about our dream to adopt and the foster care license we had received a year earlier. It was a shock when the call came: Would we take in a 3-week-old baby that had survived withdrawal from heroin? We had to answer that same day as the call. My wife, Karla, our 6-year-old son, Leonardo, and I consulted with each other and came to a consensus: Yes. Baby Serenity arrived in our home within hours. Three days later another call came out of the blue: a relative had been found and Baby Serenity would be placed there that same day. The world of foster care is vast and complex, and seems to leave those who open their homes and hearts with little notice or resources for dealing with the unexpected and sudden changes that come along the way. Baby Serenity was our first call. One month later, in Dec. 2014, we received our second call. Would we take in a group of three siblings, ages 5, 6 and 7? Today, two of those children are now with us and we are hoping that things will change such that the third will be reunited with us soon.\u00c2\u00a0To foster is to be a character in another person\u2019s Homeric odyssey to find home.Nicole Pellegrino, Central New YorkI became a foster parent in the summer of 2015. I am single and had never been a parent. I became a parent overnight to a child with significant behavioral issues. Almost one year later he is a totally different child and we are working on reunification.I tried so hard to get attached enough to love him, but not so attached that it would hurt when it came time for him to leave, but now in the weeks (days? months?) until he goes home I realize that was a fool\u2019s errand all along. There is no way to not get attached to a child that you parent, no matter how much you believe you can avoid it.Sara Gable, Columbia, Mo.My husband and I were foster parents in Boone County, Mo., for about three years. We cared for only two children during that time, but one of the kids, a little girl who moved in at the age of 3, has profoundly changed my life. She came to live with us in May 2008. We were her fifth placement in a year\u2019s time. She stayed until August of 2009, when she moved into another foster home where one of her three brothers was living (they were all in care). The plan was to get the kids used to each other before reuniting with their mom.In Jan. 2010, the family was reunified. Shortly before, our little foster daughter\u2019s mom called our house and said, \u201cI want you to stay involved\u2026 she loves you and you love her and I want her to be happy.\u201d Since then, we\u2019ve seen the kids (some or all of them) just about every other Saturday. Our little former foster daughter turned 11 this past Tuesday. She\u2019s not so little anymore (and neither are her brothers). Our time together is filled with kid activities like playing at the neighborhood elementary school playground, riding bikes, swimming in our tiny neighborhood pool, watching Netflix, eating, eating and more eating, visiting the local parks, and the occasional \u201cspecial\u201d activities like eating at a restaurant of their choice the weekend before school starts, going to the movies, or our latest new activity: rollerskating.I wasn\u2019t able to have my own children. Plan B was international adoption and that simply didn\u2019t work out for us. Never in my wildest imagination did I envision this.This article brought up a lot of memories. I grew up in central Maine with my parents and two older biological brothers. When I was between the ages of about 8 and 15, my family took into our home over 70 foster children, most for short periods of time \u2014 a few days, weeks or months. A few lived with us for many years.I loved many of them as my brothers and sisters. I shared my bedroom, clothes, toys and parents with them. They all left eventually. Almost all went back to their biological families. As children ourselves, it was a difficult experience for me and my biological brothers. I was devastated by the loss of many of them, the ones that lived with us for years. I also resented some of them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the attention and care they required from my parents. They were all deeply needy children; by comparison my brothers and I were \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine\u00e2\u0080\u009d and less in need of attention. Over time, as I got into my teens, I learned to stop growing attached to these kids, bracing for the fact that they would leave eventually, never to be seen again.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Online Media Is Tested When Social Platforms Come to Town", "Date": "2016-04-21", "News": "Supported byBitsFacebook now hosts articles created by outside publishers, as well as videos and live broadcasts. Snapchat, with its Discover product, has created a sort of online media in miniature, with TV, newspaper and magazine companies angling to have a channel on the platform. And, of course, media companies publish constantly to Instagram and Twitter, amassing giant audiences.Mr. Hagiu spoke at length with The New York Times about what changes when a platform comes to town, and what it might mean for online media. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity.Would you define a publication as a multisided marketplace?Yes \u2014 we can say it\u2019s a two-sided platform, if we count the two sides as being the readers on one side and the advertisers on the other. Now, there\u2019s a separate question \u2014 we can talk about the \u201cthird side,\u201d which would be the writers.Something like a Tumblr or Medium \u2014 a place where people can just post? Yes, where there\u2019s clearly a direct interaction, and there\u2019s a lot more control by the two sides \u2014 it\u2019s truly on the platform, not a lot of control exerted by the publication as an aggregator.How would you then describe, in similar terms, what a company like Facebook is \u2014 or a company like Snapchat?Facebook, I always say it\u2019s at least a four-sided platform. They have users, they have advertisers, they have third-party application developers, and then finally they have websites that use the Facebook Connect system \u2014 which is to say that you can log in with your Facebook credentials.Where does a company that is producing professional video or journalism for Facebook \u2014 publishing those directly on Facebook and getting some kind of revenue \u2014 fit in?So, basically they\u2019re adding one extra side, which we can call \u201cpremium content publishers,\u201d broadly. It makes sense, and it\u2019s very similar to the transformation that YouTube has gone through. They went from having pretty much one side \u2014 when they started off, for the first few years, everyone was a user. As a user you could watch videos or post videos. But everyone was the same. Sometimes I watch, sometimes I post; some people just watch, some people just post. But they are all the same users. Now they\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated, with advertising and revenue sharing, and with professional video producers.If a publication-style business becomes a participant in a marketplace like Facebook, what has changed for it?This has been an ongoing concern. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an established company, and now there\u2019s a multisided platform in your business, what happens? And say you have to play on that multisided platform, because they\u2019re big and everyone else is playing, so you need to get on top of it. The concern is always commoditization. I think partly it\u2019s true \u2014 what a platform does, to some degree, is introduce a lowest common denominator. In particular, they make the substitution, or the switching cost, between the different players a lot lower. I think that\u2019s undeniable. It\u2019s much easier to switch between, say, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as a user, and as an advertiser by the way, if those are on top of Facebook.When Amazon emerged as the pre-eminent e-commerce platform, a lot of big companies said, we need to find a way to play with them \u2014 it seems like there\u2019s a lot of e-commerce going on there, and we can\u2019t ignore it, so we need to do something. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us struck a deal that turned out later to be not very advantageous. Initially, it was a good deal for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and it gave them access to Amazon\u2019s customers. But afterward what happened was Amazon found ways to take advantage of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, using the relationship, and its presence on their platform, to start a toy category on Amazon, to figure out how to sell toys on Amazon, and then to invite a lot of competing companies on the same platform to compete with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which made it a lot less attractive for them to be there.Essentially, they overlooked the possibility that Amazon would just use them as a way to start a category of toys \u2014 they somehow assumed it would be exclusive, without putting it in the contract. And, obviously, if I\u2019m a platform, of course I don\u2019t want to be exclusive with anyone, right? I mean, that\u2019s the point of a platform. I want to have as much competition between whatever participants as possible.So if we grant some sort of comparison between a publishing partner\u2019s relationship with a large distribution platform and a retailer\u2019s relationship with Amazon, that might sound alarming? How do pre-existing companies typically make the transition from being an independent participant in a particular category to being, basically, a platform constituent? That\u2019s a broad question, but \u2014 is there an industry that might have useful parallels to the media industry with something like a major social platform?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that transitioning from independence to life on a platform necessarily has to make things worse. One thing that I think a lot about \u2014 in conversations with venture capitalists and others \u2014 is the notion that platforms or marketplaces inherently commoditize. I think more likely what\u2019s happening is the following: I think platforms, or marketplaces, make it a lot easier for, say, the content providers or app developers that are very, very good to rise to the top, and pretty much commoditize everyone else. So if you\u2019re average, it\u2019s definitely going to be very bad. Life is going to be worse on a platform, because you\u2019re exposed to more competition. If you\u2019re very good, life on a platform is a lot better.It\u2019s a little bit like, if you ask drivers how they rate their driving ability, you know, 80 percent say they\u2019re above average. The important qualifier to what I said earlier, about how the best rise to the top, is that, inherently, the platforms force a lot more specialization than before. Previously, in the independent world, players were able to afford to be a little bit broader. I think the problem is, now, you really have to think very deeply, a lot more carefully \u2014 what, exactly, are the one or two things we\u2019re really good at, and focus on those. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of forced specialization, because on a platform, competition will be vertical by vertical.In a case like Facebook, the content was largely there before \u2014 in the form of links.It makes perfect sense, right, to bring more of that content inside, because they can increase engagement.Things load faster, it\u2019s a better experience, and posts and videos are created with Facebook in mind, which means they might feel better inside the platform.Yes, and they want to do as much as possible \u2014 ideally, for them, they want to get as much content as they can to increase readership. There\u2019s probably a function between the well-being of the platform and the quality of the content that they have.This is harder \u2014 for video games, right now, the large game developers are nonexclusive. They used to be more exclusive, and I think this has decreased over time \u2014 it\u2019s become very hard to convince, say, Electronic Arts to give up the Xbox One market to work with the PlayStation. So that has definitely played against the platforms. Game platforms always try to buy or produce their own games for differentiation, but it\u2019s very hard.A different example, the other way, is online video \u2014 Netflix and Amazon. The problem there is very similar. Everyone has, basically, the same movies by now. So this has pushed Netflix and Amazon to start producing their own content. If I\u2019m one of the original providers \u2014 studios, I guess \u2014 then I\u2019m not happy, because now you have this high-quality production from Netflix and Amazon, who are stealing viewers from you.You take this down to the level of articles and shorter videos, and you have different considerations, no? Especially around exclusivity. I\u2019m trying to imagine any sort of leverage.Well, let\u2019s say the content in question requires a lot less investment. First of all, there\u2019s going to be a lot more competition. It\u2019s very hard to compete with the video game Call of Duty. It\u2019s a lot easier to come up with close substitutes for something that requires a lot less investment. The substitution concern on a platform is a lot higher.The most profound piece of this \u2014 the trend that I find fascinating \u2014 is that every year, people look at this and say, these are the products and services that are right now being transacted on these multisided platforms, but there\u2019s a limit. There\u2019s always higher-level, higher-value products and services that are extremely out of reach. Now we\u2019re saying, oh, there are all these on-demand economy platforms like Taskrabbit, but, surely, this is limited to low-skill labor or things that very easily contractable. The reality is, there will be platforms for pretty much everything \u2014 pretty much any product or service that we can imagine. It\u2019s going to happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DreamWorks Deal Would Serve Comcast\u2019s Entertainment Strategy", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byA year ago, Comcast was licking its wounds.Until now.The acquisition of DreamWorks Animation would fit squarely into the entertainment strategy, allowing Comcast to build on an already successful part of the company.\u201cIt has been very clear that they can\u2019t do many deals within cable, so their focus is on organic growth and operational excellence,\u201d said Amy Yong, an analyst with the Macquarie Group.\u201cDreamWorks would be big in the context of the studio business, Ms. Yong said.During a conference call Wednesday morning, Comcast executives declined to comment on the speculated deal activity. In response to a question about the relative values of the distribution and content businesses, Brian L. Roberts, the chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said that the company was stronger because of its position in both.\u201cThese things go up and down, and the relationship between the two in terms of carriage disputes and other things,\u201d he said. \u201cAt any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we\u2019re bringing great experiences to consumers in either content, in innovative distribution technologies, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re running our company.\u201dComcast\u2019s cable business reported revenue growth of 6.7 percent for the quarter, adding 53,000 video customers and 438,000 high-speed-Internet customers.Revenues increased 3.9 percent in the NBCUniversal group, driven by an uptick in revenues in its cable television and theme park businesses.In some ways, DreamWorks Animation is a why-not acquisition for Comcast. The price would be small. To put it in perspective, a deal for DreamWorks Animation would be about one-fifteenth the size of Comcast\u2019s failed bid for Time Warner Cable and about a tenth the size of its $30 billion acquisition of the entertainment group NBCUniversal, which closed five years ago.Also, very few content companies, particularly in family entertainment, are available to purchase.DreamWorks Animation would give Comcast\u2019s entertainment business an immediate lift, with its established animation studio and a growing television business. It also has a grasp on the elusive millennial market with its part ownership of AwesomenessTV, the producer and distributor of programming aimed primarily at teenage girls.At the same time, it would give Comcast a gateway to international growth. DreamWorks Animation has aggressively courted Chinese regulators and audiences, building an animation studio in Shanghai called Oriental DreamWorks.DreamWorks Animation is perhaps most valuable to Comcast as a way to compete with the Walt Disney Company in the theme park business. Since buying NBCUniversal, Comcast has poured billions into its Universal resorts.But Universal does not own many family movie franchises, the kind that can be turned into popular theme park rides and fill hotel rooms, and has instead had to pay steep fees to rent characters, including its most popular draw, Harry Potter, which belongs to Warner Bros.DreamWorks Animation would provide Comcast with the rights to \u201cShrek,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d and \u201cMadagascar.\u201d Comcast is also building a $3.3 billion theme park in Beijing. Unfettered access to \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d could assist that effort, analysts said.During the conference call on Wednesday, Stephen B. Burke, NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive and senior vice president of Comcast, said that focusing on building film franchises had been an explicit strategy for the company. He noted that Comcast had only one franchise five years ago in \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d action films, and it now has eight and is trying to build more. He said the company reviewed its five-year plan for the film group on Tuesday and spent half the time talking about \u201chow to take care of franchises.\u201dThe deal would require that Comcast executives return to Washington to, once again, lobby for approval.\u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t present as big of a regulatory issue,\u201d Ms. Yong said, \u201cbut it could present a conflict of interest because of DreamWorks\u2019 agreement with Netflix and the ownership of AwesomenessTV.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Special Correspondents\u2019 Stars a Fumbling Ricky Gervais", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "Supported byHe may have been starting out at a disadvantage \u2014 the new film, an uneasy combination of rom-com and bromance, is an adaptation of the 2009 feature \u201cEnvoy\u00e9s Tr\u00e9s Sp\u00e9ciaux,\u201d and \u201cbased on a French comedy\u201d are not the most auspicious words in the English language. He stars as Ian Finch, a milquetoast sound engineer for a radio network, alongside Eric Bana as Frank Bonneville, a swaggering reporter.It doesn\u2019t help that Mr. Gervais\u2019s ideas about journalism and celebrity seem either radically outdated or simply wrongheaded, beginning with the idea that there\u2019s such a thing as a swaggering radio reporter. Frank is the type of imaginary journalist who gets to crime scenes by monitoring the police scanner kept for him under the bar at his local pub and then talks his way in by pretending to be a detective. When trouble breaks out in Ecuador, Frank and Ian are dispatched, but Ian accidentally throws away their plane tickets, passports and cash.High jinks ensue, of a variety that indicate that Mr. Gervais would like to enter the Preston Sturges phase of his career. Rather than confess to their ineptitude, the pair set up camp in the attic of the restaurant across the street from the radio network\u2019s headquarters and pretend to report from Ecuador, complete with jungle and war sound effects courtesy of Ian. The charade escalates, of course, until the film completely undercuts its original premise and morphs into a mildly offensive south-of-the-border road comedy.There\u2019s nothing wrong with the type of movie \u201cSpecial Correspondents\u201d wants to be. The problem is that Mr. Gervais doesn\u2019t appear capable of making a good version of it. He shows no talent for writing the kind of light, piquant dialogue the form calls for, and his direction does nothing to perk things up. The scene of Ian\u2019s tossing the documents doesn\u2019t register; a visual gag involving flutes of champagne, which is predictable but promises to be amusing, is flubbed in the editing.The attractive cast, including Mr. Bana and Vera Farmiga as Ian\u2019s celebrity-craving wife, is also poorly served. The one performer who manages to make an impression is America Ferrera, as one of the proprietors of the restaurant where Ian and Frank hide out. Unfortunately, but not all that surprisingly, she does it by playing the hell out of a dimwit with a funny foreign accent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast Is Said to Be in Talks to Acquire DreamWorks Animation", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 After years of on-and-off flirtations, Comcast is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation, the boutique studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg that has struggled to move past the boom-and-bust cycle driven by its sporadic film releases.If a deal goes through \u2014 still an if, especially given DreamWorks Animation\u2019s checkered history with potential sales and mergers \u2014 Comcast would combine the company with its own animation division, Illumination Entertainment, according to these people.Christopher Meledandri, the chief executive of Illumination, which has found success in low-cost smash hits like \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d would most likely run the operation.That would almost certainly mean the departure of Mr. Katzenberg and layoffs at DreamWorks Animation, which is based in Glendale, Calif.A spokesman for DreamWorks Animation, home to the \u201cShrek,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d and \u201cMadagascar\u201d movie series, declined to comment. Representatives for Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, could not immediately be reached. A spokeswoman for Universal Pictures declined to comment.DreamWorks Animation, which was spun off from Steven Spielberg\u2019s privately held DreamWorks Studios in 2004, probably drew Comcast\u2019s interest as an owner of intellectual property.Along with its signature movie franchises, some of which are dormant (like \u201cShrek\u201d), DreamWorks Animation owns a library of older cartoon characters like Casper the Friendly Ghost though its DreamWorks Classics division.DreamWorks Animation also supplies television cartoons to buyers like Netflix and is part owner of AwesomenessTV, a booming online producer and distributor of programming aimed primarily at teenage girls.In recent years, as the film business has become more franchise-oriented and as more nimble competitors, notably Illumination, have emerged in the animation field, Mr. Katzenberg has pursued various strategies to put his studio on stronger footing.In 2014, there was a failed acquisition offer from SoftBank, the telecommunications and Internet giant. A couple of months later, Hasbro and DreamWorks Animation explored a merger, but that effort collapsed after Hasbro\u2019s stock price plummeted and a big Hasbro client, the Walt Disney Company, privately expressed displeasure.Mr. Katzenberg, who had over the years explored similar arrangements with various entertainment companies, including with Comcast, then decided to go it alone.In January 2015, he laid off roughly 500 employees, or 19 percent of his staff, and renewed a personal focus on moviemaking.So far the results have been mixed.\u201cKung Fu Panda 3,\u201d released in January, received positive reviews and took in $504.4 million worldwide. But analysts expected stronger ticket sales; \u201cKung Fu Panda 2\u201d took in $665.7 million in 2011. (DreamWorks Animation pays 20th Century Fox a fee to release its films.)Last week, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a research note that he was concerned about forthcoming DreamWorks Animation movies, including \u201cThe Boss Baby,\u201d which is scheduled for next year.\u201cWe think that being the 4th- or 5th- or 6th-best animated studio (behind Disney Feature Animation, Pixar, Illumination, and arguably Blue Sky and/or Warner Bros.) is not a good place to be,\u201d Mr. Creutz wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Carlock on \u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u2019 Identity Politics and Big Biscotti", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byAsk a Showrunner\u201cIt\u2019s a classic story,\u201d Mr. Carlock said. \u201cWe used to describe it as \u2018Elf\u2019 meets \u2018Silence of the Lambs.\u2019\u201dMs. Fey and Mr. Carlock met as writers on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d teaming up on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d before Mr. Carlock moved on to write for shows like \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cJoey.\u201d They reunited to create \u201c30 Rock,\u201d the madcap backstage satire that won three consecutive Emmys for best comedy.Below, Mr. Carlock discusses Big Biscotti, Ellie Kemper\u2019s paradoxical gifts and the show\u2019s adventures in identity politics. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.The show was originally developed for NBC but you knew Season 2 would be on Netflix. Did you approach it differently as a result?We knew Netflix wanted the episodes to be longer \u2014 they like the shows to be around 26 minutes, is what they told us, as opposed to 21:15 on network. That meant that while this is still Kimmy\u2019s show, we didn\u2019t always have to wait for our spots to start telling meatier stories with the other actors. We could be following Kimmy\u2019s big journey into the world and her dealing with her demons, but also at the same time let Titus have a real relationship, for example. Last year you couldn\u2019t have had an episode where both of those things were happening. We ended up telling fuller, richer stories for all of the characters, which was a goal going into the year.It does allow us to think of the 13 episodes as a whole. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t do the broadcast thing of having story endings within episodes, just because we find that more satisfying. We realized we could play with time a bit more because people could catch up to a mystery. We flashback three months in the first episode and then spent eight episodes catching up to that first scene \u2014 I\u2019m not sure we would\u2019ve done that in broadcast. We weren\u2019t super daring but we definitely did some small things, including calling back jokes between episodes. I think three times we had jokes about biscotti being inedible \u2014 traditionally all three of those jokes would have to be in one episode. But three episodes after the first biscotti joke, we found ourselves at an Italian family dinner and thought, let\u2019s take another shot. Let\u2019s take down Big Biscotti!Obviously content-wise, you could do almost anything. But we had written a show about a woman who was in many ways childlike and inexperienced, and it didn\u2019t make a ton of sense to change what was working, or for that character to suddenly start swearing and having people take their pants off. I think in one of the fake American Songbook songs Titus sings, there is an s-word. I think that was the only time we said a word that you couldn\u2019t say on broadcast.One of the things you run up against in broadcast are not standards issues, but sales issues. We tend to write a lot of jokes \u2014 and we did on \u201c30 Rock\u201d as well \u2014 that reference brands and people in the real world, and that can be a conflict in the broadcast business model. It\u2019s nice not to have to deal with that in streaming.Were there any jokes you had to spike at \u201c30 Rock\u201d that you still regret?What I remember are the ones we got away with. At one point we mentioned that Jack Donaghy and his ex-wife co-owned an Arby\u2019s franchise, and there was a little pushback on that. Then we\u2019d push back against these poor people who are just trying to protect their client relations. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be Arby\u2019s! It sounds funnier!\u201d We wore them down.I always get a lot of joy out of giving lots of jokes to a guest star \u2014 the manager of the theater, or the doctor. I like the feeling of \u201cOh, these people aren\u2019t just there to move the story along; they\u2019re their own weirdos.\u201d That\u2019s partly what leads to these overstuffed, five-jokes-a-page things, but I never like the traditional way, when the person comes in, gives the information and raises an eyebrow at your character\u2019s jokes. I like these incidental characters that you\u2019ve never seen before to live in a consistent world with your other characters.\u201c30 Rock\u201d had that same fast-paced, silly-sharp style of comedy. Where did that approach come from?Tina and I once tried to answer that question for ourselves. We determined that we like well-intentioned people who think they have solutions to everything but are, like most people, wrong. Titus, Kimmy, Jacqueline and Lillian all have different visions of what they think the world should be, which are all centered around themselves. So you get that conflict, and when you have characters with strong points of view and strong beliefs, these well-intentioned dummies, they talk a lot. So we end up with these characters who are constantly jabbering at each other, and you look at it and say, \u201cThis is boring \u2014 how do we make it funny?\u201d And then it gets jam-packed with jokes.I don\u2019t know if it was explicitly that. We like writing about those things. A lot of our writers are in the middle of that conversation, and Tina and I for years have written about where we rub against each other \u2014 that sounded wrong. I mean where people have friction in their opinions, and that means writing about that stuff. We think a comedy show can be part of the conversation in a variety of ways. And our show did become part of that conversation \u2014 not always in the way that we wanted, but perhaps that was worth writing about. It\u2019s in the air even beyond the show, the ideas about appropriation and identity. We find all that really interesting, and I know it\u2019s often hard to look at a comedy show talking about that stuff and not think the conversation itself is being diminished. But that\u2019s not our intention.We\u2019re certainly conscious of things we weren\u2019t conscious of 20 years ago, writing on \u201cS.N.L.\u201d I think all that\u2019s good. It\u2019s good that there are more voices. It\u2019s good that the trend is toward sensitivity and inclusiveness. Our belief is that inclusiveness includes being part of the joke.As opposed to being the butt of the joke?As opposed to being up on a pedestal, you know? If certain things can\u2019t be part of a comedy show, then where\u2019s the inclusiveness?One of the many reasons we love living and working in New York is people are not in their bubble of car-office-home. You run into many kinds of people and, again, that\u2019s where we think comedy comes from, when different kinds of people are butting heads. How conscious are we about it? Only in that we want this to look like New York and, in part, this is a show about people who are on the margins \u2014 the disenfranchised, the striving, the liminal. And that\u2019s a diverse bunch of people. Now, when you\u2019re at Jacqueline\u2019s gala, it should be striking that the background does not look like New York. You should be aware of that, and that\u2019s intentional.How early in the development of the show did you bring in Ellie Kemper?We built this premise around her. Physically she\u2019s very funny, and she communicates strength and at the same time she\u2019s got this great Midwestern open face. She plays these two paradoxical things on camera: strength and na\u00efvet\u00e9. So we played around with a variety of ways to exploit that. It called for [a character] who hasn\u2019t experienced the typical path through our information-saturated age. We ended up in an extreme place, but that extreme place fed into many things that interest us in terms of the way women are treated, and the way the media treats these kinds of stories. There\u2019s no show without Ellie\u2019s ability to pull off that dichotomy of someone who is tempered steel on one hand, and kind of open and sometimes clueless about the world on the other.Were there other scenarios you considered?We talked about a woman coming out of a coma. We talked about prison at one point, but \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d has that. We talked about a nunnery. We ended up in a dark place, but we really like how that dark stuff kind of underlines a lot of things in the show.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Asperger\u2019s Are Us Offers Comedy for All", "Date": "2016-04-28", "News": "The four members of Asperger\u2019s Are Us decided a long time ago that\u00c2\u00a0their\u00c2\u00a0main goal would be to amuse themselves.But after nearly a decade of laughing and writing punch lines together, Asperger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Are Us, which is probably the only comedy troupe made up of people on the autism spectrum, is on the cusp of comedic success.A documentary about the group premiered at the SXSW conference in Austin in March and was recently sold to Netflix. The troupe is also preparing for its first national tour this summer.Comedy might be a surprising choice for someone with Asperger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syndrome, since stereotypically, people with autism are generally regarded as socially awkward loners. But the four men in the group bonded at summer camp 11 years ago, when one was a counselor and the other three were campers, and are clearly great friends.Talking recently via Skype, Noah Britton, the former counselor, settles giant black rabbit ears onto his head. Jack Hanke, another member of the troupe, dons his favorite sombrero \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0the black one he took with him to Oxford University during his recent junior year abroad \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0accessorized with a red sombrero on top.They slip into their usual banter when asked what they thought of the film, named for the group, which will be shown publicly for the first time on Friday at the Somerville Theater outside of Boston.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI liked the four weird guys in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Britton said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was better than \u2018Jaws 2,\u2019 but not as good as \u2018Jaws 3,\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hanke insisted.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI found it kind of annoying myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Ethan Finlan, another member of the group.The fourth member, who changed his first name to New Michael to distinguish himself from his father, Michael Ingemi, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to join the call.The filmmaker, Alex Lehmann, said he had planned to make a short documentary until he realized he had a powerful coming-of-age story to tell about these men and their relationships that goes well beyond their autism. The final film runs about two hours.Like many people on the autism spectrum, which is characterized by impaired social skills, communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors, each of the troupe members can get overwhelmed by sounds, sights or smells. When one gets stressed out or acts particularly \u00e2\u0080\u009caspie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d another \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0usually Mr. Britton \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0steps in to restore calm.Their obsessive interests \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including a passion for Elton John\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 are often the starting point of their sketches. Mr. Finlan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preoccupation with trains becomes another of the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths: He always knows when they need to end rehearsals to catch their trains home.The men have also grown up with one another. Mr. Britton, 33, a musician and adjunct professor of psychology at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston, recently moved in with his girlfriend. The others, now 23, are done or nearly done with college. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better be your last semester,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Britton told Mr. Hanke.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cA year ago it was your last semester, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is my last semester three,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hanke responded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast year I tried to get three semesters in two. It did not work out well. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making up a couple of classes now.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Britton couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist playing on his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should only take real classes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admonished.Underneath the jokes there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly a real admiration for one another, and an emotional connection that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for all of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are like two people in the world who make me feel as myself as these guys do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Britton, who often acts as the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spokesman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not around, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be what I want to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAll four are putting everything else on hold this summer as they launch into comedy full time.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHopefully it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a lot of good new stuff, but maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a lot of bad new stuff. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be great, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Britton said.Mr. Lehmann said he got interested in the troupe when he read an article about them that \u00e2\u0080\u009cchanged everything that I had assumed about Asperger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHappy to have made a film he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passionate about, rather than shooting horror flicks to pay the bills as he did earlier in his career, Mr. Lehmann said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proud to have played a role in the troupe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success.He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confident other people will come to appreciate the humor of Asperger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Are Us, particularly their \u00e2\u0080\u009chilarious one-liners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as much as he does.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wanted to be professional comedians \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at least getting a summer of it and hopefully a lot more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lehmann said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be a hit.\u00e2\u0080\u009dYour health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

It isn\u2019t a new swipe-left app and doesn\u2019t involve overpriced stretchy pants.It\u2019s coloring books for adults, which have been gaining traction, booksellers say. Enthusiasts claim that coloring is therapeutic, fosters creativity and reaps benefits associated with meditation.The book, released in November, features designs inspired by the fashion pages of the British edition of the magazine during the 1950s, including ready-to-wear by Christian Dior, Givenchy and Chanel.Kate Hudson posted a Snapchat video of her coloring aboard a plane en route to a \u201cKung Fu Panda 3\u201d premiere.\u201cAfter the monks left, people came in looking for books on coloring,\u201d said Lisa Matalon, a saleswoman at the store. \u201cI guess it all stems from the same process of mindfulness and relaxation.\u201dWords is now stocked with an array of adult coloring books and accouterments like colored pencils and markers.

How did you first get involved in this film?Would you talk about how you sought to play the character of this hopeful screenwriter Elliot?I tried to make him unjustifiably confident in his abilities. There\u2019s a lot of that feeling in Los Angeles of destiny with no evidence to back it up. So I tried to capture what I see in a lot of people out here. That aspect was really, really fun to do.When you\u2019re playing a character who is desperately trying to get to the kind of success you\u2019ve already achieved, what from your own experiences do you bring?I try to bring as much humanity to it as I can and respect what\u2019s been written, rather than putting my big fingerprints all over it. I thought Andrew wrote a really funny script. And getting to work with Paul Rudd and do scenes with him, even though it was voice-over, was really terrific. But my job was to get out of the way of what was already a great script.I\u2019ve never really thought of anything that I do as, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve done that, now this has to be the direction of my career.\u201d I just like doing really interesting projects. \u201cRatatouille\u201d was as interesting, fun and challenging as doing this.

Did you record together?We did a few scenes together over Skype, but a lot of times it was just me doing stuff by myself. We\u2019ve known each other as friends for a long time, so we had a good rapport. It was easy.What struck you most about Andrew Kevin Walker\u2019s script?I thought the overall satire of Los Angeles was a really sharp one about showbiz and culture. It was fun to play someone clueless to the subtle targets they were taking down. He was more of the example of what the problem was, than someone who was pointing out what the problem was.Do you think the movie tells some truths about Hollywood?It\u2019s an amplified satire, but I think it\u2019s pretty on target. Audiences will have to judge that when they see it, but I think it does a good job.Advertisement"}

The duplex, a successor to the one Ms. Butler bought soon after landing her first Broadway show, \u201cBlood Brothers,\u201d in 1993, has the outdoor space that is a must. The terrace, which is large enough to hold a pair of chaise longues and a small table and chairs, is an acceptable stand-in for the yard she lost out on in Watchung.And it was be-still-my-heart to the massage chair, a present from Mr. Mazzarino on the opening night of \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201dThe couple renovated the kitchen and added closets when they moved in 15 years ago.

A green-thumbed neighbor has befriended her daughters and is teaching them how to cultivate herbs and cook with them. And very soon it will be the season to do their own planting on their own balcony.The family is hoping for a more impressive harvest this year. \u201cTypically we get maybe one carrot and a few tomatoes,\u201d Ms. Butler said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll make salad and eat it outside.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In addition, Charter agreed to expand its Internet footprint to two million more homes and to offer a cheaper broadband service to low-income households.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said in a statement that the conditions ensured the company\u2019s \u201ccurrent consumer-friendly and pro-broadband business practices,\u201d adding that the combined entity \u201cwill be a leading competitor in the broadband and video markets.\u201dRegulatory approval would be a major win for Charter, which had circled Time Warner Cable for the last three years. Comcast stepped in with a rival bid for Time Warner Cable that collapsed under regulatory pressure last year. After that, Charter announced its pair of deals for Time Warner Cable and Bright House in May 2015.The approvals will have enormous implications on the telecommunications, media and technology ecosystem, with the combined company set to have greater influence over program pricing, new technologies in broadband infrastructure, and business models emerging in streaming video. Consumers have also come to rely on the Internet as a utility, but see prices increase with few options for providers.On Monday, Dish declined to comment on the regulators\u2019 move to approve the Charter deals. Dish is part of the Stop Mega Cable Coalition, which was formed to raise awareness of the harms that could result from the deals, and which on Monday said in a statement that the conditions proposed by the F.C.C. fell short of \u201caddressing all of the threats to competition and consumers posed by this transaction.\u201dThe coalition said Charter should be required to offer a stand-alone broadband service.Some consumer advocates also opposed any approval of the deals, fearing that a combined entity would eliminate competition and increase prices for customers.\u201cCreating broadband monopoly markets raises consumer costs, kills competition, and points a gun at the heart of the news and information that democracy depends upon,\u201d Michael Copps, a former Democratic member of the F.C.C. and a special adviser to the Common Cause public interest group, wrote in an email. \u201cF.C.C. approval of this unnecessary merger would be an abandonment of its public interest responsibilities.\u201dThe F.C.C. has the broad mandate of protecting the public interest, which gives it the ability to create conditions that may seem unrelated to antitrust reviews but could make a deal good for consumers, said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official at the Justice Department who is now president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit media advocacy group.\u201cOffering to extend their broadband footprint and offer subsided broadband to some low income customers furthers existing F.C.C. policy efforts and serves the public interest,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article gave an outdated value for the Charter Communications deals. They are valued at $65.5 billion, no longer the $88 billion they were valued at when first announced.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington and Emily Steel from New York.

{"Headline": "Vox Media Tries Something Old on Something New", "Date": "2016-04-24", "News": "Supported byVox Media, the ambitious online news start-up that runs Vox, a politics site; SB Nation, a network of sports sites; and The Verge, a site about technology, says its next new project will be reviving something old.First, the new: A new outlet, called Circuit Breaker, will begin publishing on Monday, primarily as a Facebook page, not a separate website, a first for Vox Media.Now the old: Circuit Breaker will be, in the words of The Verge\u2019s editor, Nilay Patel, a \u201cclassic gadget blog,\u201d one that publishes news and gossip about technology products at a frenetic pace.For years, starting in the early 2000s, such sites, like Engadget and Gizmodo, were irreverent in tone but deeply reverent in spirit. They were written for and by gadget fans, with an obsessive focus on televisions, game consoles and, most of all, cellphones.As smartphones became ubiquitous, however, their focus broadened. Tech publications became culture publications, and many culture sites incorporated writing about technology. While both Engadget and Gizmodo remain, they are far different than they were just a few years ago.Circuit Breaker will be edited by Paul Miller, a former employee of The Verge who is returning to the company. Mr. Miller said the new page would reach for a \u201ccore audience\u201d of hard-core gadget fans. The Verge offers some popular gadget coverage, but Mr. Miller said many of those gadget fans \u201cfeel neglected when we\u2019re talking about Netflix\u201d and technology\u2019s role in the broader culture.The page will also steer clear of covering the business of tech, leaving industry stories to The Verge or ReCode, the tech news site founded by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg that Vox Media acquired last year. (Some articles and reviews from The Verge, where Mr. Mossberg publishes a column, will appear on Circuit Breaker.)Instead, Mr. Miller said, he plans to focus on physical products that have yet to mature, or might never. He includes in this group virtual reality headsets, drones, home automation gear, hoverboards and offbeat projects.Circuit Breaker\u2019s stated mission is an acknowledgment of just how powerful the smartphone has become, including for publications. Not only are people spending huge amounts of time on the devices, the programs on the phones, and social media apps like Facebook in particular, wield huge influence over people\u2019s digital lives.\u201cWe started out, a few years ago, building media brands on websites, because that\u2019s where we thought the growth was, and we were right about that,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, Vox Media\u2019s chief executive. Eventually, he said, \u201cpeople started concentrating around a few specific apps\u201d \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube. \u201cWe invest based on where we see potential.\u201dIf Circuit Breaker is an ode to a simpler time in consumer technology, it also offers a clear audience to advertisers: people who are explicitly interested in buying things.\u201cIt\u2019s a high-demand category,\u201d Mr. Bankoff said.Vox Media will not be the first major media company to tailor a publication to a social platform. Vox, the politics site, alongside 19 other publishers, operates a channel on Snapchat, with which it shares ad revenue. BuzzFeed has invested in Facebook-centric brands, and countless news sites have dabbled with Instagram accounts and YouTube channels.But media companies are still charting their courses carefully. Advertising arrangements with platforms are in flux, and major tech companies, which operate at a different scale than most publications, make for intimidating \u2014 and unpredictable \u2014 negotiators.Circuit Breaker will also exist, in blog form, in a section on The Verge\u2019s website. But the primary focus of the editors is on Facebook. The page will be at facebook.com/circuitbreaker, and visitors will find a dense feed of videos and news updates.The editors said they do not expect people to frequently check Circuit Breaker\u2019s Facebook page for updates. Instead, readers will experience the site primarily through their Facebook news feeds, where Circuit Breaker videos, posts and broadcasts will appear alongside updates from friends, family and the countless other organizations vying for attention on the platform.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be playing the News Feed game like everyone else,\u201d said Helen Havlak, who oversees social media distribution for The Verge and will work on the new site. \u201cFrom a distribution perspective, we\u2019re probably going to be changing, like, every 48 hours.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their meeting, on a chilly February afternoon in New York, was an experiment to see what might happen when two seemingly dissimilar public figures sit down for a frank discussion about the state of the union. Thanks to the instantly flirty state of their union, topics spanned the inauthenticity of unconditional love, the grotesque fun house of the American presidential race and the danger of self-censorship \u2014 which both of them are determined to avoid: Handler on \u201cChelsea,\u201d her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d-style docu-series and talk show, which premieres on Netflix next month, and Wieseltier in the new essay-driven magazine he\u2019s founding with Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs. Wieseltier shifted slightly on the couch to be closer to Handler, they locked eyes and cackled, and she started in with an easy question.A picture credit on Page 69 this weekend with an article featuring a conversation between the cultural critic Leon Wieseltier and the comedian Chelsea Handler misstates the name of a hair and makeup agency whose services were used in styling Wieseltier.

{"Headline": "Twitter Gains Rights to Stream Thursday N.F.L. Games", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported byLeave it to the N.F.L. to sell the same product three times.A decade ago, the league began showing Thursday night games on its fledgling NFL Network. Then CBS, and later NBC, agreed to pay the league hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the right to broadcast some of those games as well.The games shown on Twitter will be the CBS or NBC broadcasts, depending on which network is showing the game, and will include pre- and postgame highlights only available on Twitter. Twitter and the N.F.L. have not announced how the games will look on individual feeds.The partnership speaks volumes about the power of the country\u2019s most powerful sports league, which wants to expand its footprint overseas and reach younger consumers who may never pay for a cable or satellite package, or even own a television.It also illuminates the sharp-elbowed race to survive in Silicon Valley, where Twitter and other technology companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are rushing to find ways to offer consumers must-see content everywhere and at any time. By joining a sports behemoth that garners the highest ratings in television, Twitter hopes to pump air back into its sagging fortunes.\u201cThey need to give people more reasons to come back to Twitter to get their info-of-the-day fix,\u201d said Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management and a close watcher of the company. \u201cIf these N.F.L. games go well, they can expand into other types of content and give users more reasons to spend more time on Twitter properties each day.\u201dMajor League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other sports leagues already stream national packages of games for $100 or more a season. But they, like the N.F.L., will be watching to see how fans consume games on their smartphones and tablets and whether the alliance with Twitter can generate profits.Even as the nation\u2019s largest sports league with $13 billion in annual revenue, the N.F.L. is trying to anticipate shifts in the media landscape. For decades, the league has relied on a tested model: Collect billions of dollars from television networks that broadcast games for free over the air, or from cable and satellite networks.Most of the league\u2019s television agreements with these networks expire in the next five years, so the N.F.L. wants to find new ways to market its games for the next generation of fans.\u201cThere are huge swaths of young people who never watch broadcast television,\u201d said Ed Desser, a sports media consultant. The streaming experiment \u201callows them to plan ahead.\u201dFor now, along with appearing on Twitter\u2019s mobile and desktop apps, the company said it will show games on video game consoles that use Twitter apps, such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.At the N.F.L.\u2019s annual meeting last month, league executives told team owners and executives that the biggest opportunities for new revenue would come from digital and international businesses. Selling the streaming rights to live games to Twitter appears to fill both of those categories, without upsetting CBS, NBC and other networks that pay dearly for media rights.To assuage them, Twitter will show the networks\u2019 ads. But to make money it will sell ads for the time normally reserved for local spots. This let Twitter pay less than it might have otherwise, and it will allow NBC and CBS to reach more viewers.\u201cThe attraction wasn\u2019t just revenue, it was a reach decision,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman. Other bidders, he added, had offered more money than Twitter.By signing a one-year deal with Twitter, the N.F.L. will retain the flexibility to look elsewhere for the long run.Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, announced the deal, appropriately enough, on his Twitter feed, his first Tweet in 19 months.The league might have had a receptive ear at Twitter. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, held the same position at the N.F.L. from February 2008 to October 2010.The move is a significant strategic shift for Twitter, which last month celebrated its 10th anniversary. While Twitter has grown to hundreds of millions of regular users, for years the company has been on a quest to boost its slowing growth by making significant changes to the product and by spending millions in marketing campaigns.So far, little has helped. Twitter user growth was flat at the end of 2015, compared to the third quarter of the year, at 320 million monthly visitors.\u201cWe wanted to focus on what we do best,\u201d Noto said, explaining the sports push. For Twitter, he added, that focus was \u201clive\u201d content.The league experimented with live-streaming last season when Yahoo paid about $20 million for the rights to show a Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game played in London in October. In a sop to its broadcast partners and fans, the Bills-Jaguars game was still shown on television in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets.But streaming games free to the more than 180 countries where Twitter is available might attract fans in places where the N.F.L. does not have major broadcast partners.But according to one mathematical conversion that Yahoo disputes, the 15.2 million unique users for the Bills-Jaguars game amounts to the television equivalent of 2.36 million average viewers, about 1.6 million of whom were in the United States.Still, Twitter hopes that the magnetism of the N.F.L. provides them with a sorely needed boost.\u201cThis to me is much more about publicity and marketing for Twitter than selling ads,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Viacom\u2019s Woes May Deepen in Standoff With Dish Network", "Date": "2016-04-20", "News": "Supported byOn one level, the dispute between Dish Network and Viacom that brought the companies to the brink of a television blackout on Wednesday resembles others that have become relatively routine in the industry and a common annoyance for customers.While such negotiations between TV companies and their cable and satellite distributors used to take place behind closed doors, they have erupted into messy public battles in recent years as the television industry has come under more pressure. Both sides are trying to secure their positions and profit against the backdrop of a rapidly changing television landscape where ratings are in steep decline and cable and satellite companies are battling against a tide of so-called cord cutters.Yet this specific clash is particularly crucial for Viacom.\u201cPeople that have taken Viacom down in the past have done just fine,\u201d Charles W. Ergen, chief executive of Dish, said in a conference call on Wednesday, hours before Dish\u2019s contract to carry Viacom\u2019s bundle was set to expire at midnight. \u201cBest I can tell, they don\u2019t regret the decision.\u201dShould the two sides fail to reach an agreement, about 14 million Dish customers would experience a blackout of 18 Viacom channels, including MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central.The dispute stems from Viacom\u2019s wanting Dish to pay increases, which Dish argues are not justified given deteriorating ratings at the networks as well as the wide availability of Viacom programming on streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. The two companies have been operating under a short-term extension of a deal that expired in January.Mr. Ergen said on Wednesday that the company was prepared to drop Viacom channels from its lineup, especially after negotiations between the two companies hit a standstill last week. He said that discussions had been more productive this week.\u201cThere actually probably is a path to continue carriage, but it\u2019s not done yet,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd obviously, the devil\u2019s in the details.\u201dBenjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Research, said Dish\u2019s comments that it would replace Viacom channels with other content suggested that \u201cit may not intend to pick those networks back up at a later date.\u201dAnalysts estimate that if Dish dropped Viacom networks permanently, Viacom could be forced to make large cost cuts and could experience significant profit declines. Todd Juenger, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, predicted that Viacom stock would be worth about $28 \u2014 down from about $37 on Wednesday.\u201cEven if Dish and Viacom ultimately reach a distribution renewal, we believe the terms will be onerous for Viacom,\u201d Mr. Juenger said in a research note, \u201cwhich bodes poorly for future Viacom renewals.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Staying In the New Going Out?", "Date": "2016-04-12", "News": "Supported bySign of the TimesI first noticed it at work. On Monday mornings a deathless ritual unfolds in offices across the land: the posing of the question, \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d A few years ago, my coworkers and I exchanged happy highlight reels of ambitious urban activities before cracking open our laptops and pouring ourselves a tall, refreshing glass of work. One of us went to an off-Broadway play. One of us went to a Beyonc\u00e9 concert. One of us went on a date. We had fun!These days, we respond to the question with a look of puzzled amnesia. Did we do anything? \u201cNot really,\u201d we say. \u201cIt was pretty uneventful.\u201d We furrow our brows trying to remember key events, but nothing comes to mind. It\u2019s as though the last two days have elapsed in a narcotized, undifferentiated blur. A leisure-time blackout. We still have fun \u2014 probably? \u2014 we just have no clue how it happened.Unlike Willa Cather\u2019s hardy immigrants, however, my self-imposed confinement involves millions of megabytes worth of pirated TV (if law enforcement is reading this, I\u2019m just kidding) and a hamburger delivered with two clicks. Sometimes I enjoy these things with a boyfriend; sometimes I enjoy them with friends. Alone, I can always socialize from my cubbyhole \u2014 on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Tinder, Snapchat. All of these platforms have a way of bringing out the worst in people, it\u2019s true, but then, so do bars at 2 a.m.Every generation\u2019s fear is that the next generation has found better ways to avoid the risks of being a human. Baby boomers, for one, deem it pathetic that younger people refuse to ask each other out on the phone and do it by text instead; Gen Xers think Millennials are losers for resorting to Tinder instead of spotting a comely stranger and buying that person a beer. This scorn is both deserved and fruitless. In 20 years, texting will look audacious compared to whatever ultra-mediated quasi-contact young people are making.Let\u2019s strip away the censure, for a moment, by analogizing the trend to personal wealth management. If we define \u201ccapital\u201d in this metaphor as a mixture of our time and emotional stasis, then staying in is the ultimate conservative investment. It\u2019s like pouring your money into a savings account: You\u2019ll grow marginally; you\u2019ll stay safe; your expectations will be met and never exceeded. The worst-case scenario is that your delivery fries are soggy and your premium cable TV episode is a B+ instead of an A. You can always pull the ripcord on your show and go to bed early. A failed night means that you got a good night\u2019s sleep. That\u2019s still a win. A modest win, but a win.Going out, on the other hand, is closer to prospecting. The upside is huge: You could have a life-altering adventure, meet your soul mate, find your new best friend. The potential downside is equally monumental. You could run into an ex, lose your wallet, suffer a grope, be rejected. The scope of experience at a party or a bar is, as the hedge funders might put it, high beta. We do it for the possibility of encountering the spectacular. This rarely happens.There are opportunity costs associated with chronic staying in, too. A year\u2019s worth of weekends spent at home is a bit like never moving out of your parents\u2019 house: At some point you have to leave the nest. Leaving the nest, even just to get outside, is how we grow, challenge ourselves and discover things that have not been tailored to our relevant interests by an algorithm. As with Keynes\u2019s paradox of thrift, the indisputable smart play for the individual is to spend nights and weekends snuggled under the duvet with an iPhone. But what\u2019s the point of living in a city if you treat it like a suburb?So yes, we know what we\u2019re losing when we hibernate. For proof, observe that nesting remains indefensible as an excuse; if someone invites you out, you can\u2019t refuse by telling them that you\u2019ve got \u201cplans to stay in,\u201d because a plan to stay in still counts as no plan at all. We burrow with a slight wince, in a blanket of mild contrition. But, oh, what a cozy blanket.Advertisement"}

(Last year\u2019s event was a roast of the cabaret comedian Bridget Everett.)In his subsequent meetings with Mr. Eagan, Mr. Early recalled, \u201cI was speaking very florally about my ambitions in comedy, and the whitewashing of comedy and wanting to host a show that was more diverse and gayer than I was used to.\u201d Mr. Eagan asked him to take over Ars Nova\u2019s \u201cShowgasm\u201d series, a place for artists to experiment with short-form pieces, and encouraged him to bring in more comedians.Though Mr. Early is deeply entrenched in the alternative comedy scene in New York, his stand-up has always had a theatrical flair: He often sings Britney Spears songs in his sets. He began doing stand-up five years ago and quickly gravitated to the downtown variety scene, which incorporates a rich history of drag, burlesque, music and Off Broadway theater and produces more character-driven, less caustic comedy than the traditional stand-up world.His style is open and warm, incorporating pop culture references of the alt scene into a showier act. While his topics are standard for almost any comic \u2014 politics, dating, sex, hipsters \u2014 his point of view is distinct.

{"Headline": "\u2018Horace and Pete,\u2019 Keeping You on the Edge of Your Seat, Right Up to Last Call", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookOn Saturday, he sent another message, in what was by now a weekly series, that \u201cEpisode 10\u201d was available. Not until the episode\u2019s wrenching conclusion and the postcredits curtain call was it clear this stunning experiment was over. It felt too soon.For 10 weeks the series used television\u2019s simplest and oldest format, actors on a stage, to suggest new possibilities for what the medium can become.Before I begin the spoilers, a word to readers who haven\u2019t seen the show. Maybe you haven\u2019t watched because \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d costs money: $31 for the full season. (Louis C. K. sold the episodes weekly through louisck.net, starting at $5, dipping to $2, then settling at $3 apiece.)Is it worth it? For $31, you could buy a generous round of beers at a Brooklyn dive like the one in the series, or a couple of schmancy cocktails at one of the hipster bo\u00eetes are crowding out that sort of place. It\u2019s more expensive than a month of Netflix or Hulu, but cheaper than a typical night of theater, to which the \u201cHorace\u201d experience is comparable. It\u2019s about what you\u2019d pay for a season of many series on iTunes and better than most of them.I can\u2019t set your budget, but I can say that if you\u2019re willing to pay for art that challenges and moves you, and for the actors who give it life, you will do many, many worse things with $31 in your lifetime than to buy this series. (In which case, go now and read the rest of this later.)No drama since \u201cMad Men\u201d has landed weekly with so little sense of where the next episode would go. \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d might dive into the past or riff on the week\u2019s headlines. It might collect a series of set pieces or \u2014 as in the astonishing third episode guest-starring Laurie Metcalf \u2014 showcase a single performance.But in the end, the surprise was in service of the story about a family for whom the mistakes of history would return, generation after generation, as predictably as happy hour \u2014 or in this case, unhappy hour.The dysfunction in the Wittel family is layered, like cheap wallpaper in an apartment. The bar (from which the series takes its name) has been around for a century, a record that seems less a legacy than a sentence. It\u2019s been run by a chain of Horaces and Petes who had sons named Horace and Pete. Louis C. K.\u2019s Horace, we learn in the finale, is the eighth in the line, the son of Horace VII (also played by Louis C. K.), an abusive tyrant.It takes a moment to realize the finale opens with a flashback, because the apartment set looks essentially the same. So does the bar, painted in the dingy browns and yellows of cigarette-stained teeth. It\u2019s always a kind of 1976 at Horace and Pete\u2019s, even in 2016, weighted with malaise, the only difference being the names on the cover of The Daily News and the barflies arguing over them.There\u2019s Budweiser on tap because there was always Budweiser. Things are the way things are because that\u2019s the way things were. History is handed down from father to son like a punch in the arm. As for the daughters \u2014 Horace\u2019s sister, Sylvia (Ms. Falco), summed up the bar\u2019s history in the pilot: \u201cHow many wives have been beaten up here?\u201dMs. Falco plays Horace and Sylvia\u2019s abused mother as well, which is an efficiency of casting \u2014 wouldn\u2019t you use this actress as much as possible? \u2014 but also, like Louis C. K. as Horace VII and Mr. Buscemi as the younger Uncle Pete, underlines the idea of eternal return. It\u2019s as if there were one version of each of these people, and they just keep being reborn. (It\u2019s a kind of perversion of the Resurrection story of Easter, the holiday that looms largest in this series.)There\u2019s a sense in the finale of the chain finally being broken, for (slightly) better and (horribly) worse. Each generation of Wittel men, it seems, has left the next a little worse off, until finally Pete (Mr. Buscemi), broken and off his meds, kills Horace, the cousin he grew up believing was his brother.There won\u2019t be another Horace and Pete; the bar is packed up and Pete left no descendants we know of. There is a Horace IX (Angus T. Jones), Horace\u2019s estranged son, to whom Sylvia gives a wonderfully tart eulogy of sorts for her brother: \u201cHe was nothing, really. He was no kind of man. He was not particularly funny or smart or kind or \u2014 you know, he was just some guy. But he was your father.\u201dLouis C. K. is reportedly submitting \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d for the Emmys as a drama. If it gets a nomination \u2014 Mr. Alda, Mr. Buscemi, Ms. Falco and Ms. Metcalf would all be strong picks \u2014 that would be a landmark for an independent show. Few artists have Louis C. K.\u2019s resources or multi-hyphenate ability, but the series could at least expand the possibilities.But in its short life, the show has already left a legacy. Louis C. K. has never drawn sharp lines between drama and comedy. His work is about provoking strong feelings, whether a laugh or a cry or a scare. His FX series, \u201cLouie,\u201d lives by that idea and \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d extended it, drawing strong performances out of comics like Aidy Bryant and Kurt Metzger.Like its bar, \u201cHorace and Pete\u201d operated out of old, dusty traditions. It recalled the staging of 20th-century sitcoms and the earliest live-theater days of 1950s television. But it was also hypercurrent. Like modern \u201climited series\u201d (the seasons of \u201cFargo,\u201d e.g.), it wasn\u2019t obligated to spin out its story for years; like Netflix and Amazon series, it was free of network scheduling. Both on the episode and series level, it was only as long as it needed to be.\u201cHorace and Pete\u201d did not end happily, leaving us with the sobs of Sylvia, a survivor of both cancer and her family. But it was a gorgeous snapshot of humanity and a bracing preview of television\u2019s future, a story that exemplified how, to move forward, sometimes you have to go into the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Approves Fully Paid Parental Leave", "Date": "2016-04-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 San Francisco on Tuesday became the first city in the United States to approve six weeks of fully paid leave for new parents \u2014 mothers and fathers, including same-sex couples, who either bear or adopt a child.Before the vote, the supervisors amended the proposal to make employees eligible only when they have worked for a company 180 days. The ordinance goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, for companies with more than 50 employees, and a year later for those with 20 or more workers.The new law will make San Francisco\u2019s policy far broader than that of New York City, which has also expanded its parental leave policy. In December, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York ordered that 20,000 nonunionized workers be given six weeks of fully paid parental leave, but that amounts to a sliver of the total municipal work force of around 300,000.Except for a group of small-business owners, the ordinance here had wide support. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce said that while it favored expanded parental leave benefits, there was a \u201cstrong belief among many business owners that once again, to the financial detriment of small businesses, a mandate is being adopted in San Francisco that would be better dealt with at the state or federal level.\u201d In a letter to the Board of Supervisors, the chamber declared itself \u201cneutral\u201d on the issue.Scott Wiener, the supervisor who introduced the measure, said that San Francisco lawmakers had chosen to take up the issue partly because there was little hope of change at the national level.\u201cWhether it\u2019s paid parental leave, infrastructure investment, minimum wage, paid sick leave or addressing carbon emissions, we know the states have to act,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in an interview before the vote.The ordinance requires a second vote by the supervisors next week and approval by Mayor Edwin M. Lee. Legislators described both as formalities given the unanimous vote on Tuesday.Only two states besides California \u2014 New Jersey and Rhode Island \u2014 mandate paid parental leave, and none at full pay. The funds for parental leave in all three come from employee-funded public insurance systems.Supporters of the measure rallied on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday.Julia Parish, 33, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society who is eight and a half months pregnant, said the measure would be particularly helpful to lower-income residents who do not work for companies with generous benefits. \u201cWe are ahead of the curve in California, but globally, we are way behind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201dIndeed, by global standards, the San Francisco ordinance is a modest step. The United States is one of two countries out of 185 listed by the International Labor Organization that do not have a national law providing some form of paid parental leave. (The other is Papua New Guinea.)The parental leave measure is one of several pro-worker initiatives emerging from California. Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law Monday that would progressively raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Separately, the leader of California\u2019s Senate is pushing to offer tax-free retirement savings plans for the 7.5 million workers in California who do not have employer-provided retirement plans.At a time of great divisions at the national level, amplified by the bitterness of the presidential election campaign, California\u2019s Democratic leaders say they see an opening to push hard on liberal issues inside the state.\u201cWith the presidential election in the background \u2014 with so much anger and anxiety \u2014 California is going in a vastly different direction,\u201d said the Senate president pro tempore, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who wrote the retirement savings plan. \u201cWe are proving that despite the large legislative vacuum in Washington, D.C., that California can lead on its own.\u201dGavin Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, said the country\u2019s divisions were making action by the states more urgent and necessary.\u201cThe nation is alive from the bottom up,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cFor all the disproportionate focus on Washington, D.C., there\u2019s a whole other America out there, and it should give pause to the pessimists.\u201dPro-labor battles have been hard fought in Washington. The federal parental leave law, known as the Family and Medical Leave Act, provides for 12 weeks of parental leave \u2014 unpaid.The law, vetoed or blocked for a decade, was passed in 1993 and signed by President Bill Clinton.Paid family leave, including parental leave, is scheduled to start in New York State in 2018 as part of a budget passed last week by the Legislature; in the first phase of the law, workers will get 50 percent of their wages during eight weeks of leave.In addition to parental leave, experts point to a growing number of states and municipalities that are passing laws governing sick leave and retirement plans.California\u2019s retirement savings plan addresses what experts say is the looming problem across the country of underfunded retirements. Under the program, called Secure Choice, a yet-to-be determined amount \u2014 around 3 to 5 percent \u2014 would be automatically deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks and placed in an investment fund that they can maintain throughout their careers.The fund would be overseen by portfolio managers chosen by the state. Employers will not add funds to the plan \u2014 the savings come entirely from employees.Employees can opt out of the savings plan.The program passed unanimously through a vetting committee led by the state\u2019s treasurer, but still needs to pass the full Legislature and be signed by the governor.Karen Friedman, the policy director of the Pension Rights Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said that while Secure Choice was a modest start to address the country\u2019s savings shortfall, it was also a \u201cblueprint\u201d for similar programs being proposed in about 25 other states.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of proposals out there, but California became the state leading the effort,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition that most people are retiring without adequate income.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a political branding opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile others fiddle and diddle, California moves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bob Dylan-Inspired Drama Is in the Works", "Date": "2016-04-15", "News": "Supported byThe biggest star behind a spate of new streaming television shows is no celebrity or top-flight director, but rather innovative music deals.\u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d which will have its premiere in August, follows five young creatures on adventures set to classic Beatles songs like \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d and \u201cMagical Mystery Tour\u201d \u2014 to be sung by Eddie Vedder, Sia and other pop stars \u2014 that are woven into the plot. For example, in one episode, a character is trapped under glass while the song \u201cHelp!\u201d plays.The other shows are to involve even deeper kinds of musical integration. \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d planned as an hourlong drama, will include characters and settings drawn from the lyrics of Mr. Dylan\u2019s songs, and each episode of the Motown show \u2014 whose theme song is the Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cABC\u201d \u2014 will revolve around a different song from that catalog.\u201cTime Out of Mind\u201d and the as-yet-untitled Motown show have not been formally announced, but entertainment executives involved in their production, who were not authorized to discuss contractual details publicly, said that in both cases deals were close to being completed. Representatives of Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on those productions.When producers approach music publishers or record labels for licensing rights, they usually seek permission for only a handful of songs. But the deals around these shows break new ground, music executives say, by securing rights to a large pool of songs that the producers can draw on.For \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d that means the catalog of more than 250 songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and for \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d it involves Mr. Dylan\u2019s full catalog of more than 600 songs, including not only the right to record the material with new singers but \u2014 in an arrangement that people close to Mr. Dylan called unprecedented \u2014 to make use of song lyrics for characters, situations and themes in each episode\u2019s plot.\u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual, and you could only do it with a catalog that has a distinct feel and a distinct meaning,\u201d said Martin Bandier, the chief executive of Sony/ATV, the giant music publisher that controls the Beatles and Motown catalogs.The central force behind each of the new shows is Josh Wakely, a 34-year-old Australian writer and director who has secured extensive licensing arrangements with the songs\u2019 music publishers.Mr. Wakely, whose production company is called Grace: A Storytelling Company, approached Sony/ATV through its Australian office for \u201cBeat Bugs,\u201d and has said that it took him three years to complete the licensing deal. He was then introduced to representatives of Mr. Dylan, who controls his own songwriting rights but uses Sony/ATV as an affiliate in Australia.The deals reflect the ever-growing willingness of music publishers \u2014 who control songwriting rights, as opposed to recordings \u2014 to find new sources of income as music sales dry up, as well as the expanding popularity of streaming television.After the success of Netflix in recent years, Amazon Studios has made an aggressive push into television. In addition to shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d each of which has won a Golden Globe for best comedy, the streaming service will also release a highly anticipated Woody Allen comedy later this year.The streaming services\u2019 big push into TV \u2014 along with more cable channels producing original content \u2014 has sent industry executives into a frenzied competition to gobble up talent, and take bigger risks on new projects. Last year, there were 412 scripted television shows, the most ever.An article on April 16 about three streaming television shows that draw on valuable song catalogs from the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Motown label gave an incorrect age from a publicist for Josh Wakely, the Australian writer and director who secured the licensing arrangements with the music publishers. Mr. Wakely\u2019s age at the time the article was published was 34, not 31. The error was only recently discovered by The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Forecast for Growth Disappoints Wall St.", "Date": "2016-04-18", "News": "Supported byNetflix is now available in most countries around the world, putting more pressure on the company to continue its fast-paced growth abroad as well as at home.On Monday, Netflix announced that it expected to add just two million members outside the United States in the second quarter this year \u2014 less than the 3.5 million analysts had expected. The figure also represents a decrease from the 2.4 million members the streaming service added internationally in the same period the previous year.That cloudy forecast sent shares down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as Netflix has tied its future to its bold global push. The company has been pouring resources into its expanding international footprint, telling investors that it would run at break-even profitability until the end of 2016 as it continued to roll out the service abroad and increased its investment in content.As the company experienced slowing growth in the United States over the past year, executives pointed to the rest of the world as the next frontier for streaming television to hundreds of millions more potential customers. While the United States counts about 100 million broadband households, for instance, there are about 730 million broadband households worldwide, according to analyst estimates.On Monday, Netflix executives said that they had just skimmed the surface of that growth potential and that there was still a big opportunity ahead. The executives attributed the soft international forecast for the second quarter this year to a tough comparison from the previous year, when Netflix started the service in Australia and New Zealand.Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said the company had yet to reach its full potential in many countries because the service in most regions is only in English and available only via international credit cards.\u201cWe cannot wait to break through 100 million subscribers sometime next year,\u201d Mr. Hastings said during an earnings call.At the same time, Netflix said that it expected to add just 500,000 members in the United States in the second quarter because of what it described as a \u201cmodest impact\u201d from price increases. The company characterized the forecast as \u201cin line\u201d with previous years; it added 900,000 members in the United States during the same period in 2015.On the fast-changing competitive landscape, Mr. Hastings said in a letter to investors that the \u201cmarket for relaxation time and disposable income is huge, and we are but a little boat in a vast sea.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe earn a tiny fraction of consumers\u2019 time and money, and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving.\u201dThat uncertainty over the competitive landscape, as well as fears about growth prospects both inside and outside the United States, overshadowed the generally positive first-quarter financial results that Netflix announced on Monday.The company beat expectations for profit and revenue growth during the first quarter. Profits totaled $28 million, up 16 percent from the same period last year, and total revenues increased 24 percent to nearly $2 billion.Netflix added a record 6.7 million total streaming members during the first quarter, bringing its total to 81.5 million, with about 42 percent outside the United States. Netflix had forecast that it would reach nearly 80.9 million total paid members in the quarter.In the United States, Netflix surpassed its forecasts for subscriber growth during a period in which price increases went into effect for some customers. The company added 2.23 million subscribers in America during the quarter, bringing its paid membership in the country to 45.7 million.Outside the United States, Netflix also beat its expectations for growth, adding 4.5 million international streaming subscribers.The company said it was planning to spend more than $6 billion on programming in 2017, up from $5 billion this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Dinner in a Box. But Are Meal Delivery Kits Cooking?", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosBut after two meal kit companies approached her to work with them, Ms. Moulton thought she should investigate. As for anyone who has been paying attention to home-cooking trends, it was hard not to be at least a little meal-kit curious. So she signed up.\u201cI have to say I was very pleasantly surprised,\u201d she said, echoing the sentiment of many very good cooks who have taken the plunge and ordered a box. Ms. Moulton has not decided whether she\u2019s going into business with one of the companies, but the kits gave her ideas for recipes. And the best part? She didn\u2019t have to decide what to cook for dinner.\u201cMaking dinner every night really wears thin,\u201d she said. \u201cYou bore yourself. Even me.\u201dIn the span of a few short years, more than 100 companies have jumped into the meal kit game. Millions of cardboard boxes arrive on urban and rural doorsteps every month, holding everything one needs to cook dinner, down to the rice wine vinegar and panko.Ingredients are packaged in exact proportions, ready to be chopped or saut\u00e9ed according to well-illustrated recipe cards. In less than an hour, even a mediocre cook with salt, pepper and cooking oil can produce an Instagram-worthy meal.\u201cWe\u2019re still a tiny percentage of the overall home cooking world,\u201d said Matt Salzberg, the chief executive of Blue Apron, adding that the company is making money on every shipment. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why Blue Apron wouldn\u2019t have a place in every home in America in some way.\u201dSome analysts say meal kits show classic signs of a bubble that may already be leaking air. They make comparisons to the rise and fall of the grocery delivery service Webvan in the first wave of the tech boom, or meal assembly storefronts, where cooks pick recipes online and then show up to put together what are essentially fancy casseroles from precut ingredients. Such companies once opened at a rate of 40 a month in the early 2000s but have faded from view.Others say this is different. Like frozen foods or the microwave oven, meal kits may be a kitchen innovation that fundamentally changes how people cook at home.\u201cBagged lettuce seemed like a fad, too,\u201d said Jenny Zegler, the global food and drinks analyst for the research company Mintel.Meal kits seem to have arrived at just the right moment, burrowing deep into the everyday life of a digitally fluent nation whose tastes have been honed on restaurant meals, farmers\u2019 markets and food television. The kits appeal to people eager to learn more about cooking with chickpea flour or organic escarole but less enamored with their procurement.\u201cThere is a feeling of a lack of accomplishment, especially among millennials who feel like it\u2019s a solid effort just to get frozen ravioli cooked and a bagged salad together,\u201d said Melissa Abbott of the Hartman Group, which researches eating patterns. \u201cThey say these meal kits are teaching them how to cook so they can participate in the conversation and feel empowered.\u201dIt\u2019s not just younger people. Jennifer Freed, 53, has spent the last 20 years commuting between Los Angeles and New York as she built her business, the film industry accounting firm Trevanna Post. She and her husband, Carl, raised two children, largely with the help of a nanny who cooked. The family had Chinese food on Sunday and went out Saturday night. She might cook a meal a week. Cold cereal or takeout filled the gaps.With the kids and the nanny gone and her business responsibilities easing, she and her husband needed a new approach to dinner. Her mother signed her up for Blue Apron.\u201cI thought it can\u2019t be worse than it is now, which is eating Raisin Bran,\u201d she said. She\u2019s been a member of the subscription service for three months, getting three meals a week. On Sundays, her mother and sister-in-law bring over their Blue Apron meal kits, and they cook a dinner party together.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t made me a great cook, but it has made me more confident,\u201d she said.\u201cThey are teaching very valuable lessons to people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether this is a step in a process or an enduring solution to a problem, I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d\u201cIt is cooking,\u201d Mr. Bittman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not shopping and it\u2019s not planning and in a way it\u2019s not thinking, but it is cooking.\u201dHe said he could not predict the financial viability of the concept, or whether it\u2019s a steppingstone on the path back to cooking or a permanent part of the kitchen.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bubble in the sense that it\u2019s going to blow up and not exist anymore like the first dot-com thing,\u201d Mr. Bittman said. \u201cIt may be that if you join our meal kit company and then you learn how to cook and then you don\u2019t need a meal kit anymore, we are a great company.\u201dThe delivery of precurated ingredients is not going away, he and others say. Grocery stores are trying to figure out how to get in the game, and although there are three big meal kit players on the national scene, the regional variations are, by some estimates, more than 100 and growing, each seeming more specialized than the one before.She wrote 450 recipes last year, and each month sends out about 150,000 meals like lemongrass- and coriander-crusted pork loin and coconut-almond breakfast smoothies. The price works out to about $11.49 a meal, which she admitted makes it a luxury item for some. But Ms. Kelly said she has friends who aren\u2019t wealthy who use it because the time-cost ratio works in their favor. \u201cHonestly, especially in the Bay Area, it can be cheaper to do a meal kit than shop,\u201d she said.Costs can drop to about $9 or $10 a meal with some services, but Ms. Moulton said that is still a lot for some people. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s sustainable for the general population,\u201d she said.For $59, you can cook spiced honey glazed duck for four by the San Francisco chef Dominque Crenn. For $29, two people can have miso-glazed cod vetted by Weight Watchers and guaranteed to cost you only seven points on the company\u2019s weight-loss plan.The one consistent complaint about the kits is what seems to be excessive packaging. The nation\u2019s desire for the kits is ahead of the logistics and packaging industries, which are scrambling to keep up.Many companies provide labels for customers to ship back waste, sanitizing and reusing gel packs and recycling what they can. And companies are working with packing material companies and shippers to reduce both costs and garbage while keeping food cold and safe. But the system is far from perfect.\u201cWe are still in early days here, but when there is that much attention and money being spent for this, there will eventually be compostable insulation or dissolvable insulation you can put into water and turn into dog food or something,\u201d said Andy Levitt, who started the Purple Carrot. \u201cSomeone will make a dent so people can have access to meal kits without the guilt.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even get fennel or shallots at my local grocery store sometimes,\u201d said Toni Byrd, a federal public defender who lives in Lewisburg, Pa., and who subscribes to the Purple Carrot. \u201cAnd as a single person, I used to waste food.\u201dTaylor Hale and Leslie Grove, who live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, did a lot of soul searching before signing up for a meal kit service recently. He\u2019s a systems engineer at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. They grow a lot of their own food, know their local farmers and have started a small coffee roasting and spice business.They said they would try it for two months, weighing whether the lack of leftovers, which they often throw out, and the time saved shopping balance the cost.\u201cObviously I\u2019ll sit down and think about the math for a long time,\u201d Mr. Hale said. \u201cThe thing that is the toughest for me is to let go across the board of knowing who grew what I was eating.\u201dIndeed, at the end of the day it may be that meal kits lack the tribal fire appeal that comes with traditional cooking and shopping. By turning over the recipe and food selection to others, an essential part of the home-cooking experience is lost.\u201cCooking is a whole sociological thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI even like talking to the cashiers.\u201d\u201cEating the food cooked by your own hand from your own family and traditions are the things that constitute our emotional life with food,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine we are going to look back and say, \u2018Oh remember that Blue Apron Burmese curry we used to have on Thursdays?\u2019 It\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s not ours. It doesn\u2019t have our family sentiments behind it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Herby Persian Frittata From Michael Pollan\u2019s Chef Teacher", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported byFood MattersIt\u2019s been nearly 16 years since the U.C. Berkeley undergraduate decided to pursue a culinary career, and this excitement about discovering \u2014 and sharing \u2014 has not abated. It is her driving force. It propelled her, during her sophomore year, to ask for a job at Alice Waters\u2019s famed Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, where for four years she learned not only how to cook professionally, but also to teach \u201cthe young kids coming in, wide-eyed\u201d to do the same. And it led her afterward to apprenticeships with the legendary Tuscan butcher Dario Cecchini and the revered chef Benedetta Vitali in Florence.This week finds her on the road with \u201cPop-Up Magazine,\u201d the \u201cpublication\u201d whose stories are told on a stage, instead of printed in a book. On Tuesday night at BAM, she took the stage to talk about the \u201ctaste of conflict\u201d \u2014 and the flavors and ingredients we miss or lose due to the politics of war. When she gets back home to Berkeley, she\u2019ll return to spring and doing what she loves best: \u201cpeeling and turning an artichoke perfectly,\u201d gathering greens to make an herb-filled Persian frittata (kuku sabzi, the recipe for which she shares below) in the style of her mother and telling anyone who will listen to brine their poultry the day before cooking it. At the rate she\u2019s going, before long, there will be salted chicken in every pot.Nosrat grew up eating traditional Persian dishes, like the Iranian frittata known as kuku sabzi; her mother\u2019s version was greener than anyone else\u2019s. \u201cShe was a health food freak and grew up on a farm and believed in packing as many greens and herbs in there as possible. I\u2019ve never seen a kuku as full of green things as hers.\u201d The chef\u2019s version is at least as verdant. \u201cIt\u2019s so insanely green, and healthy, and spring, and fresh-tasting and different. And it reminds me of my mom,\u201d she says, enthusiastically. You can make it with whatever fresh herbs and leafy stems you can get your hands on \u2014 Nosrat has friends who make it with lettuce. 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees if you do not want to flip your kuku partway through cooking.2. If using chard, strip the leaves: Gripping at the base of each stem with one hand, pinch the stem with the other hand and pull upward to strip the leaf. Repeat with remaining chard.3. Gently heat a large cast iron or nonstick frying pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add in the chard leaves, or other greens, and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the leaves are wilted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, set aside and allow to cool.4. If using chard, thinly slice the stems, discarding any tough bits at the base.5. Return the pan to the stove and heat over a medium flame. Add 2 tablespoons each of butter and olive oil. When the butter begins to foam, add the sliced leeks and chard stems, along with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender and translucent, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir from time to time, and if needed, add a splash of water, reduce the flame, or cover with a lid or a piece of parchment paper to entrap steam and keep color from developing.6. In the meantime, squeeze the cooked chard (or nettles or spinach) leaves dry, then chop them roughly. Put them in a large bowl with the cilantro and dill. When the leeks and chard stems are cooked, add them to the greens. Use your hands to mix everything up evenly. Taste the mixture and season generously with salt, knowing you\u2019re about to add a bunch of eggs to the mixture.7. Add the eggs in, one at a time, until the mixture is just barely bound with egg \u2014 you might not need to use all nine eggs, depending on how wet your greens were and how large your eggs are. It should seem like a ridiculous amount of greens! I usually taste and adjust the mixture for salt at this point, but if you don\u2019t want to taste raw egg, you can cook up a little test piece of kuku and adjust salt if needed.8. Wipe out and reheat your pan over medium-high heat. (This is an important step to prevent the kuku from sticking.) Add 4 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then stir to combine. When the butter begins to foam, carefully pack the kuku mixture into the pan.9. To help the kuku cook evenly, in the first few minutes of cooking, use a rubber spatula to gently pull the edges of the frittata into the center as they set. After about two minutes of this, reduce the heat to medium and let the kuku cook without touching it. You\u2019ll know the pan is hot enough as long as the oil is gently bubbling up the sides of the kuku.10. Because this kuku is so thick, it\u2019ll take a while for the center to set. The key here is to not let the crust burn before the center sets. Peek at the crust by lifting the kuku with a rubber spatula, and if it\u2019s getting too dark, too soon, then reduce the heat. Rotate the pan a quarter turn every 3 or 4 minutes to ensure even browning.11. After about 10 minutes, gather all of your courage and prepare to flip the kuku. First, tip out as much of the cooking fat as you can into a bowl to prevent burning yourself, then flip the kuku onto a pizza pan or the back of a cookie sheet, or into another large frying pan. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil into the hot pan and slide the kuku back in to cook the second side. Cook for another 10 minutes, rotating the pan every 3 or 4 minutes.13. Remove from the oven when done and carefully flip out of the pan onto a plate. Eat warm, at room temperature, or cold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock", "Date": "2016-04-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.Now that attitude may be changing.The Silicon Valley company\u2019s stock-based compensation \u201cprovides additional reason to remain cautious\u201d on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company\u2019s operating results that exclude that expense.Tech companies stand out as some of the most generous givers of shares to employees. While the median number of restricted shares granted at Standard & Poor\u2019s 1500 companies to executives and employees in 2014 equaled 450,198 shares, tech companies granted a median 798,000 shares of restricted stock to workers, according to data from Equilar, a research firm that provides data on executives, boards and compensation.As a result, there has been a \u201cheightened investor focus on the level of stock-based compensation among the Internet companies,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.In an interview, Mr. Mahaney said stock-based compensation could \u201cdistort the quality\u201d of a company\u2019s earnings and \u201cmake them look stronger than they are.\u201dMr. Mahaney has identified Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Alibaba as among the tech companies that are highly dependent on stock to pay their employees. In a report, he wrote that Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation over the last two years accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, on average, the highest percentage of any Internet company.LinkedIn, whose share price is down about 48 percent this year, did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter, whose stock is down more than 20 percent this year, also did not respond to a request for comment.Another tech company that Wall Street analysts are examining for its stock-based compensation expenses is Workday, which sells human resources and financial management software. The company is expected to increase its stock compensation about 48 percent in its 2017 fiscal year, which is faster than its revenue is projected to grow, according to Sarah Hindlian, an analyst at Macquarie Group.In an illustration of how stock-based compensation expenses can affect a company\u2019s results, Ms. Hindlian says Workday\u2019s margins are projected to be around negative 25 percent for fiscal year 2017. But when the company\u2019s $370 million in stock-based compensation is excluded from results, its operating margins are much better, coming in around zero.Workday\u2019s heavy reliance on stock-based compensation has been a factor in Ms. Hindlian\u2019s projections for the company\u2019s share price. Last month, she forecast that Workday\u2019s stock would trade at $49, down from its current price of about $77. She has a sell recommendation on the stock.Ms. Hindlian says that while it can be reasonable for companies to pay workers a lot in stock, the practice can become scary when the stock starts to fall. \u201cParticularly with software companies, you run the risk of losing your leading salespeople, engineers and developers when the stock falls, because employees feel like they\u2019re getting a pay cut,\u201d said Ms. Hindlian, who also rang the alarm on LinkedIn\u2019s use of stock-based compensation over a year ago.\u201cSomewhere along the way a management team may feel pressure to increase their share price to avoid loss of employees,\u201d Ms. Hindlian said, \u201cwhich can ultimately mean management goals and shareholder interests become misaligned.\u201dWorkday declined to comment.When companies authorize additional shares to pay employees and management, that also creates \u201cdilution,\u201d or a decrease in how much of the company a shareholder owns when new stock is issued. That effect is starting to push others on Wall Street to lower their price projections for tech company stocks. Mr. May of Citigroup lowered his price targets this month on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter to \u201cfully capture the likely ongoing dilution from future share grants as part of employee compensation,\u201d he said.The increased scrutiny of tech companies that rely heavily on stock to pay employees is just one of many places where investors are taking a harder look as markets soften, said John Roe, a managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions, a group that advises shareholders on corporate governance issues.He noted that some shareholders had also submitted proposals asking companies to consider the impact of share buybacks on earnings, to figure out whether executives delivered better earnings by improving performance or by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\u201cYou see a brighter focus on certain practices when there is more volatility and markets are going down,\u201d said Mr. Roe. \u201cThe reliance on equity compensation is one of those things that you might always worry about, but recent events have amplified that concern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Has Seen the Future, and It Is WWE Wrestling", "Date": "2016-04-08", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessA four-hour-plus extravaganza, WrestleMania 32 culminated with a title match that pitted Roman Reigns against Paul Levesque, a.k.a. Triple H, a villain turned fan favorite who is also a top WWE executive and is married to Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of Vince McMahon, WWE\u2019s billionaire chief executive. Although Triple H controlled the match most of the way, he lost the world championship after his wife leapt into the ring, which flustered him, allowing Reigns to win. Boos rained down as the victor hoisted his championship belt.Although professional wrestling does not exactly qualify as a real sport, nearly 102,000 fans showed up at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., to watch WrestleMania 32, which grossed a record $17.3 million from the live event alone. Tens of thousands of additional fans paid $59.95 to watch on pay-per-view television. Many more watched it on a streaming app called WWE Network, which costs subscribers $9.99 a month.In mid-February, during its quarterly earnings call, the company announced that the WWE Network had 1.22 million subscribers. After WrestleMania 32, that number jumped to 1.82 million. Although some of those subscribers will fall away \u2014 the WWE Network offers a monthlong free trial to potential customers, some of whom undoubtedly signed up just to watch WrestleMania for free \u2014 that is still nearly a 50 percent increase in six weeks.But strategically at least, what the N.F.L. is doing is not all that different from what WWE has done with its digital app. With more and more people watching movies and television shows that are streamed to digital devices rather than shown via traditional platforms like cable and satellite, the N.F.L. is preparing for the day when the same is true for live sports.Right now, live sports are the single most important reason the transition from traditional television to online streaming isn\u2019t happening even faster. There are advertisers who will air commercials only during live events, which mostly means sports; they know that many viewers will avoid ads by seeking out their favorite shows on on-demand streaming services. And there are many viewers whose desire to watch sports is the only thing keeping them from cutting the cord.But the N.F.L. isn\u2019t in the business of propping up traditional television\u2019s business model; it\u2019s in the business of getting people to watch football games. And when the day comes that most of them prefer to have those games streamed, well, the N.F.L. wants to be ready.WWE started its own streaming business in 2014. For more than two decades, its television home has been USA Network, which airs WWE\u2019s flagship show, \u201cRaw,\u201d every Monday night. (A second show, \u201cSmackdown,\u201d runs on Thursday nights.) USA, which is owned by NBC Universal, is one of the top-rated cable networks, in no small part because \u201cRaw\u201d is among the top-rated cable shows. The programming WWE doesn\u2019t air on USA \u2014 premium content like WrestleMania \u2014 has historically consisted of pay-per-view events.Around 2011, WWE started thinking about starting its own HBO-style cable channel, according to George Barrios, the company\u2019s chief strategy and financial officer. (Barrios went to WWE from The New York Times Company, where he was the treasurer.) But by 2013, WWE executives had done research showing that wrestling fans \u2014 most of whom are not wealthy \u2014 were big users of broadband, watching shows from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu considerably more often than most people. They were also voracious watchers of YouTube. (Barrios said the WWE gets more YouTube views for its short-form content, such as highlights, than any other sports channel.) So the company decided to abandon the cable channel idea and develop a streaming service instead.\u201cWe thought if this is where our consumers are going, we needed to be there as well,\u201d Barrios said. Streaming has undeniable advantages over traditional television. The subscribers belong to WWE, not to a cable company, so it can market to them more directly. It can sell WWE clothing and paraphernalia directly from its app. The WWE Network allows it to make money on its popular archives. And it gets steady, monthly checks from its subscribers, rather than having to count on less-reliable pay-per-view revenue.\u201cThey thought they needed one million subscribers to make it work,\u201d said Brandon Ross, an analyst who covers the stock for BTIG, an investment firm. \u201cFor them, it was a no-brainer.\u201d The WWE Network hit the million mark in 2015. WWE still offers its premium events on pay per view \u2014 so as not to lose fans who don\u2019t yet have broadband \u2014 but that income stream is declining as more wrestling fans turn to the WWE Network.What you won\u2019t find on the WWE Network is either \u201cRaw\u201d or \u201cSmackdown,\u201d which remain on USA. But that doesn\u2019t mean that USA executives aren\u2019t nervous. In May 2014, a few months after the launch of its new streaming service, WWE signed a new rights deal with the cable network that was considerably lower than expected. Clearly, the lower amount was a result of USA\u2019s fears that streaming would cut into its ratings. Wall Street panicked, and WWE\u2019s stock dropped almost 50 percent in a day. Though the stock eventually recovered, McMahon lost his billionaire status for a while.Today, \u201cRaw\u201d and \u201cSmackdown\u201d have a combined viewership of well over 10 million. That\u2019s still a lot higher than the WWE Network\u2019s 1.82 million subscribers. And WWE\u2019s television rights remain its largest single source of revenue. But the ratings for \u201cRaw\u201d are down somewhat \u2014 as are the ratings for the entire USA Network \u2014 and if the WWE Network continues to gain subscribers at the pace it is on, it\u2019s worth wondering how long WWE will remain committed to a cable network whose profits are dependent on an eroding business model.If I were an executive at CBS, NBC, Fox or ESPN, I would be nervous, too. The N.F.L.-Twitter deal might not look like much in financial terms, but it offers the N.F.L. a cheap and easy chance to experiment with putting football games online in a way that is untethered to a television network or a cable or satellite subscription. Over time, that can\u2019t possibly lead anyplace good for the networks.Indeed, Twitter got the deal over other Internet companies \u2014 some of which offered more money \u2014 precisely because it was willing to let the N.F.L. do pretty much anything it wants as it tries to work out a business model for streaming.For the N.F.L., Twitter offers a young, sports-minded audience (the Twittersphere lights up during major sports events); a way to reach football fans, and potential fans, internationally; and a chance to lure the many millennials who refuse to subscribe to cable even if it means missing pro football. As for Twitter, the N.F.L. allows the company to offer something no other social media service can claim, which it needs as it tries to reinvigorate its stalled subscriber base. Having professional football will increase user engagement; one can easily imagine people watching the game and posting to Twitter on the same screen. And it will give the company the chance to rethink how it generates advertising, which it desperately needs to do. For both parties, the deal makes sense.\u201cThe N.F.L. has a long history of finding the next wannabe,\u201d said Jay Rosenstein, a former executive at CBS Sports who now consults for Headline Media, a television talent and programming company. By that he means the N.F.L. finds entities yearning to carry pro football and turns that desire into money.The NFL added \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d for ABC (now on its corporate sibling ESPN), brought in Fox for Sunday afternoons, created \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d for ESPN (NBC now televises that package of games), moved games to Thursday night for its own network (which are now also shown on CBS and NBC), and sold its Sunday Ticket package to DirecTV. The N.F.L. is looking to streaming for the next wannabe.Rosenstein noted that all the N.F.L.\u2019s major television deals would be up for grabs at the end of this decade and the beginning of the next. Is it possible that a big Internet player, like Amazon, whose $100 billion-plus in annual revenue dwarfs that of, say, CBS ($13.9 billion last year), could decide to outbid one of the television networks for exclusive rights to one of the N.F.L.\u2019s packages of games? It is.As the N.F.L. gets savvier about streaming games thanks to its Twitter experience, could it decide to create its own subscription-only digital app for another package of games? It could. HBO now has a streaming app that viewers can pay for without needing a cable subscription. Why couldn\u2019t the N.F.L. do the same thing? It\u2019s not going to happen next week, or even next year, but if I were a betting man, I\u2019d say it will happen someday. If its fans eventually abandon old-fashioned television, so will the N.F.L.\u201cSports is what keeps people coming to television,\u201d said Ross, the securities analyst.Until it doesn\u2019t.An earlier version of this article misidentified the network for which \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d was created. It was ESPN, not NBC. (NBC gained the rights to that package of games in 2006.)Email: nocera@nytimes.comTwitter: @NoceraNYTAdvertisement"}

But then a bartender suddenly yelled, \u201cNow seating for the 7 p.m. screening of \u2018Spring Breakers.\u2019\u201dCall it the anti-Netflix: a cozy theaterlike experience that doesn\u2019t involve sitting at home with Chinese takeout.\u201cThere\u2019s less and less reasons to go out and see a movie,\u201d said Tim Chung, 28, the managing partner of Syndicated. \u201cEverything is available everywhere now, at all times. So we\u2019re trying to offer people more reasons to leave their couch.\u201d\u201cThe AMCs have that fluorescent and hospital lighting going on,\u201d said Kent Johnson, 35, who was celebrating his birthday at Syndicated with friends. \u201cHere the lighting is better. It\u2019s laid-back and there\u2019s more food and drinks. And it\u2019s cheaper.\u201dSyndicated is not his only option. Several boutique cinemas that offer a social atmosphere are opening in New York.As a native New Yorker, his main goal was to recreate some of the moviegoing romance of his youth, at places like the Plaza Theater with its Tudor-theme d\u00e9cor and balcony (closed in 1996), and the old Beekman Theater immortalized in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (closed in 2005).\u201cWhat\u2019s important is to capture that feeling when I was 10 years old going to the Beekman,\u201d said Mr. Olch, who incorporated details like red velvet seats and a balcony into the Metrograph\u2019s design.Alamo is a popular Texas-based chain that combines first-run films (and a few oldies) with a restaurant and bar, serving food and drinks on a narrow table that runs the length of a row of seats.After expanding to Yonkers in 2013, Alamo had been looking to enter the lucrative New York City market with its distinctive brand of dine-in cinema, and decided on Brooklyn. \u201cDowntown Brooklyn was kind of an ideal spot for us,\u201d said Cristina Cacioppo, 37, New York creative manager.\u201cI think that being in New York, people want to go out,\u201d Mr. Viragh said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to sit at home in their cramped apartment. They want to go and experience something that\u2019s unique, with a group of people.\u201dIt took him some time to realize his vision, partly because of a Prohibition-era law that barred the sale of alcohol in movie theaters. He hired a lobbyist, who helped to get the law repealed in 2011.With the concept of drinking and moviegoing gaining acceptance, newer places like Syndicated are adding their own spin. With its $3 admission and communal seating, it seems less like being in a traditional theater and more like hanging out in a friend\u2019s very large, fancy living room.\u201cEveryone\u2019s drinking and having a good time here,\u201d said Mr. Chung, who studied filmmaking at the School of Visual Arts and worked as a film location scout. The programming reflects his taste, like the recent pairing of \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d and \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d for Valentine\u2019s Day.Syndicated also dispenses with the usual previews and cellphone warning, and prides itself on a showtime that begins at the designated hour. \u201cWhen you go to the movies and it\u2019s supposed to start at 10 and you see that it doesn\u2019t start till 10:30,\u201d he said with a sigh, \u201cthat always kind of bugs me.\u201dAt a screening of \u201cLars and the Real Girl\u201d in February, there was also something rarely heard at the multiplex.

{"Headline": "Robert Durst\u2019s Transfer to a Los Angeles-Area Prison Is Approved", "Date": "2016-04-27", "News": "Supported byProsecutors in Los Angeles contend that Mr. Durst killed Ms. Berman shortly before Christmas 2000 so that she would not reveal what she knew about his role in the sudden disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen, 18 years earlier. At the time, the authorities in New York had reopened the investigation into Ms. Durst\u2019s disappearance, prompting Mr. Durst to flee New York.During a 16-minute hearing on Wednesday in United States District Court in New Orleans, Mr. Durst, appearing frail and shrunken in an orange jump suit, told Judge Kirk D. Engelhardt that he had been \u201cwanting to get to Los Angeles for almost a year to enter my not-guilty plea.\u201dJudge Engelhardt approved a defense motion that Mr. Durst be sent to Terminal Island. The judge also approved a prior plea bargain arrangement, in which Mr. Durst was sentenced to 85 months in prison for illegally possessing a .38-caliber revolver. Mr. Durst was assessed a $5,000 fine.Mr. Durst\u2019s lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said Terminal Island \u201chas the facilities to take care of a 73-year-old man\u201d with various health issues.\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill Susan Berman,\u201d said Mr. DeGuerin, the lead lawyer in what has become a formidable defense team of lawyers from Houston, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.For more than two years, John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles County, has been building a circumstantial case against Mr. Durst that ties together Ms. Berman\u2019s unsolved murder and Ms. Durst\u2019s disappearance.After the arraignment in August, Mr. Durst will for the first time get a look at the prosecution\u2019s case, through discovery. That will almost certainly lead to a protracted period of wrangling over the evidence, which includes handwriting analysis, filmed interviews with Mr. Durst and testimony from friends and relatives.Mr. Durst had been active in New York in the family real estate business until 1994, when his father and his uncle turned the reins of the empire over to his younger brother, Douglas Durst.In 2003, Robert Durst, who had moved to Houston, was acquitted of murder charges in Galveston, Tex., in spite of admitting in court that he had carved up the body of a neighbor and threw the body parts into Galveston Bay.Mr. Durst has been fodder for books, television specials, and dramatic and documentary movies, including the HBO documentary mini-series, \u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst.\u201d He has even been parodied on comedy shows: The actor Fred Armisen, who first played Mr. Durst in a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch, is reprising the role in the Netflix series \u201cThe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d where he appears as an old flame of one of the characters.Allan M.

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: To Be or Not To Be an Uber Employee", "Date": "2016-04-23", "News": "Supported byHas anyone spent so much for so little before? I mean, other than what our bosses pay you?Oh also, I started watching back episodes of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d on Netflix and man, that show rules. It deals with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM, or Big Blue, reigned supreme. A different era entirely.Here\u2019s what matters: Aside from the $100 million Uber said it would pay drivers involved in the suit, the company conceded to a bunch of new rules and policies that make things at least slightly better for drivers.For one, drivers can ask for tips now, something they weren\u2019t able to do before (unlike Lyft, where they can get tips inside the app). Uber will also create a union-style \u201cdrivers association\u201d in California and Massachusetts \u2014 just don\u2019t call them unions! \u2014 so that drivers can air their grievances. And drivers won\u2019t automatically be deactivated for canceling too many trips over time.That seems like a list of ways Uber can defend itself in other states in which it faces lawsuits. Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.This settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.Am I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?The counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.Anyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rovi Buys TiVo in $1.1 Billion Deal", "Date": "2016-04-29", "News": "Supported byAs television moves to the cloud, two companies are coming together to try to find the silver lining.More and more television viewers are migrating to YouTube or Netflix, creating a vulnerability for companies like TiVo and Rovi whose business models rely on traditional TV viewing habits. Adding TiVo\u2019s 10 million households to Rovi\u2019s 18 million, as well as its research and development team and patent trove, arms the combined company to compete, analysts said.\u201cThere are real questions around durability of what these guys have created, so they\u2019re coming together to fight the good fight,\u201d said Barton Crockett, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, by phone. \u201cThey\u2019re in a place of tremendously large question marks right now.\u201dThe deal may not happened without recent decisions by two men.The first is Glenn W. Welling, an activist investor at Engaged Capital who successfully claimed two seats on Rovi\u2019s board last year and pushed the company to consider a merger with TiVo, people briefed on those discussions said last month.The second, Thomas S. Rogers, led TiVo as chief executive for more than a decade until he announced in November that he was stepping down. He stayed on as chairman as Naveen Chopra, TiVo\u2019s chief financial officer, stepped up as interim chief executive. The management shuffle gave Rovi a chance to make its move.The combined company will take the TiVo name and be led by Thomas Carson, the chief executive of Rovi.\u201cBy working together, Rovi and TiVo will revolutionize how consumers experience media and entertainment, and at the same time build value for our stockholders,\u201d Mr. Carson said in a statement on Friday.The TiVo of today is not merely the device that rose to popularity in the early 2000s by giving TV watchers the ability to fast-forward through commercials. TiVo technology has gained traction with cable operators around the world because it can also stream video from sites like Netflix in their own boxes. Many of the larger cable providers, however, have opted to create their own versions of TiVo rather than work with the company.Under the terms of the deal, Rovi will pay about $10.70 per share in cash and stock. TiVo shareholders will receive $2.75 per share in cash, and the remaining $7.95 will be paid in common stock of the combined company.The stock component of the transaction includes an option that will give TiVo shareholders fewer shares if Rovi\u2019s stock price goes up to a certain average price, and more shares if Rovi\u2019s stock price falls to a certain threshold.The deal is expected to increase Rovi\u2019s earnings within the first 12 months after closing, something its shareholders applauded on Friday. Rovi\u2019s stock price gained 1.6 percent to close at $17.62. TiVo\u2019s shares gained almost 6 percent, to $9.98.\u201cWe had a higher valuation for TiVo than was the takeout price,\u201d said Thomas Eagan, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group LLC. \u201cI see TiVo as a product company that has some patents and Rovi is a patent company searching for a product, and that\u2019s why this isn\u2019t a bad match.\u201dA combined company would generate about $800 million in revenue this year, on a pro forma basis, according to the companies\u2019 estimate. The two also said they could save about $100 million in annual costs.In addition to announcing the deal, Rovi reported a slump in revenue and wider net losses in the first quarter compared with a year ago. And it sued Comcast over intellectual property during the quarter after the cable provider neglected to renew their contract.The combined company will have more than 6,000 patents and pending applications. Both have been able to generate billions of dollars from intellectual property licensing and awards from patent-related lawsuits.\u201cA very big part of the value in TiVo and Rovi is tied to patents and their willingness to file and litigate around their patents,\u201d said Mr. Crockett.The transaction is subject to approvals by both sets of shareholders as well as regulators. The companies said they expected to close the transaction by the third quarter of this year.Evercore provided financial advice to Rovi, and LionTree Advisors worked with TiVo. The law firm Cooley was Rovi\u2019s legal adviser, and TiVo received legal advice from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is That Even a Thing?", "Date": "2016-04-16", "News": "Speakers and writers of American English have recently taken to identifying a staggering and constantly changing array of trends, events, memes, products, lifestyle choices and phenomena of nearly every kind with a single label \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a thing. In conversation, mention of a surprising fad, behavior or event is now often met with the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that actually a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen did that become a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is that even a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Calling something \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d is, in this sense, itself a thing.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do either. My assumption is that language and experience mutually influence each other. Language not only captures experience, it conditions it. It sets expectations for experience and gives shape to it as it happens. What might register as inarticulateness can reflect a different way of understanding and experiencing the world.Clearly, cultural phenomena have long existed and been called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009crages\u00e2\u0080\u009d or have been designated by the category they belong to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cproduct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfashion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009clifestyle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc. So why the application of this homogenizing general term to all of them? I think there are four main reasons.First, the flood of content into the cultural sphere. That we are inundated is well known. Information besieges us in waves that thrash us against the shore until we retreat to the solid ground of work or sleep or exercise or actual human interaction, only to wade cautiously back into our smartphones. As we spend more and more time online, it becomes the content of our experience, and in this sense \u00e2\u0080\u009cthings\u00e2\u0080\u009d have earned their name. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d has become the basic unit of cultural ontology.Read previous contributions to this series.Third, the closing gap between satire and the real thing. The absurd excess of things has reached a point where the ironic detachment needed to cope with them is increasingly built into the things themselves, their marketing and the language we use to talk about them. The designator \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d is thus almost always tinged with ironic detachment. It puts the thing at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length. You can hardly say \u00e2\u0080\u009ca thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d without a wary glint in your eye. The volume, particularity and inanity of the phenomena effectively force us to take up this detachment. The complaint that the young are jaded or ironic is misplaced; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the conditions that are this way.Finally, the growing sense that these phenomena are all the same. As we step back from \u00e2\u0080\u009cthings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they recede into the distance and begin to blur together. We call them all by the same name because they are the same at bottom: All are pieces of the Internet. A thing is for the most part experienced through this medium and generated by it. Even if they arise outside it, things owe their existence as things to the Internet. Google is thus always the arbiter of the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that a real thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cA thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then, corresponds to a real need we have, to catalog and group together the items of cultural experience, while keeping them at a sufficient distance so that we can at least feign unified consciousness in the face of a world gone to pieces.Alexander Stern is a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Too Much TV. It\u2019s Too Big TV We Should Worry About.", "Date": "2016-04-25", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIt may have been \u201cTiny House Nation\u201d that finally broke me. Last month this offbeat real estate show on the FYI network began its third season of cramming homeowners into trailers, bungalows and other mini abodes.The homes are little. The season premiere was not. The running time was nearly 65 minutes uninterrupted \u2014 a full hour and a half with ads.As a critic, I\u2019m used to championing greater options for artists. We\u2019re lucky to live in a time when TV creators have freedom from arbitrary constraints. But more and more of my TV watching these days involves starting an episode, looking at the number of minutes on the playback bar and silently cursing.Historically, network television was like a container ship; the product had to fit standard boxes for ease of shipping. Networks needed predictable schedules and had to turn over specific time slots to affiliates.It was a process \u2014 15-minute episodes were a presence in the early days of television \u2014 but 30 minutes generally came to mean comedy, and 60, drama. Episodes used to be longer, in that commercial breaks were shorter, but the journey from beginning to end stayed the same. And networks occasionally tinkered with length. NBC supersized its popular Thursday night sitcoms in the early aughts; Fox inflated \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d like a Macy\u2019s parade balloon. But those stunts were exceptions.Meanwhile, basic cable channels realized that there was no reason their \u201chourlong\u201d series needed to end on the hour. If they pushed a 10 p.m. drama\u2019s end to, say, 11:17, they could give their creators the kind of narrative real estate available on ad-free HBO and Showtime.The most dramatic early claimer of elbow room was FX\u2019s biker-gang drama, \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d which piled on plot and ended its plus-size episodes with music montages. Now it\u2019s common for cable hits to plump up. The most recent season finale of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d ran 90 minutes, though I have rarely seen an episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d that needed its full 60. Like its zombies, it could be hacked down by a third and shamble along just as well.At best, extended episodes can make room for complexity. But focus and showmanship still matter. In a peak-TV era, being able to hook an audience is more important, not less.Louis C. K. may have earned the right to go long by proving he could also go short; his FX comedy, \u201cLouie,\u201d included stories that would run only a few minutes if that was all they needed. AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d a more conventional drama, regularly overstays its one-hour slot by a few minutes. But it uses its time mindfully, to suspend tension and let character moments play out.There\u2019s a certain be-careful-what-you-wish-for aspect to longer episodes, even with great shows. When the sixth season of the sitcom \u201cCommunity\u201d moved to Yahoo from NBC, it was finally free of time-slot constraints \u2014 and something was off. The pacing was sluggish; the jokes were less crystalline. Maybe \u201cCommunity\u201d \u2014 a product of the fractious network-TV compromise between art and business \u2014 needed limits in order to transcend them.Those time constraints and network scissors, much as writers love to bash them, can be the Marie Kondo method of comedy. The first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d was originally made for NBC, and like its spiritual forebear \u201c30 Rock,\u201d it was packed like a diamond. The second season, made for streaming, is still funny, but you can feel the drag in some of its 30-minutes-plus episodes.TV was raised with rules, the product of technology and business models that had little to do with art. It\u2019s shedding those strictures as it grows up, which is good \u2014 that\u2019s given us anarchic comedies like \u201cBroad City\u201d and low-and-slow dramas like \u201cRectify.\u201dBut freedom also proves the values of the discipline you learn under restrictions. I appreciate ambitious storytelling. But I also appreciate getting a full night\u2019s sleep.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "TV as New York Growth Industry: \u2018Quantico\u2019 Is Coming to Town", "Date": "2016-04-22", "News": "Supported byJust as he was hitting his stride as a television writer in 2002, Joshua Safran had to move to Los Angeles to work on a network show that was all about his hometown, New York City. Now, he is moving a different hit show with a New York theme to New York.Mr. Safran, the executive producer of \u201cQuantico\u201d on ABC, said the show\u2019s relocation for its second season was the latest evidence that Hollywood is no longer the irresistible magnet it had long been for the entertainment industry\u2019s talent. New York is playing an increasingly important role as a home base for television shows at a time when the demand for video content is soaring.\u201cThere\u2019s a resurgence here,\u201d Mr. Safran said from his office in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. \u201cMore production brings more jobs, brings more money, brings more happiness.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Friday that \u201cQuantico,\u201d which had been written and produced in Brooklyn but shot on location in Montreal, will cross the border and bring more than 200 jobs with it. When it begins filming in New York in July, \u201cQuantico\u201d will be able to take full advantage of the tax credit that the state offers to film and TV productions.\u201cNew York State knows no creative bounds, and provides an unrivaled opportunity to work with the very best in the industry,\u201d he said.Mr. Safran said the credit of up to 30 percent of many of the costs incurred in production, including salaries paid to crew members, was not the deciding factor in the decision to relocate. The reason was largely creative. But he said the move would help to offset the higher cost of shooting in New York.Officials said 46 episodic shows were now being produced in the city, up from 29 just over a year ago. But they are not all on traditional networks. Shows in the Marvel Defenders series that can be viewed on Netflix are being produced in Brooklyn. The Netflix sitcom \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d and Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d series, which won a Golden Globe, are also filmed in the city.Julie Menin, commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, said the growth of TV production in the city had been \u201cexplosive\u201d and had created thousands of high-paying jobs that support small businesses.As an example, she cited Caf\u00e9 Grumpy, a coffeehouse across the street from the Broadway Stages studios in Greenpoint, which has added five locations. Ms. Menin, in her second month as commissioner, said she had been encouraging producers to shoot in more locations in boroughs other than Manhattan and to patronize local businesses when they do.\u201cYou can actually be a person who works in the film community in New York and not have to take a waiting job,\u201d said Tim Nolan, a partner at the consulting firm, who oversaw the study. \u201cThat\u2019s different today than it was 16 years ago.\u201dMr. Nolan said he had no doubt that the state tax credit paid for itself in jobs and spending. But some economic analysts would disagree.Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, co-wrote a report in 2013 that concluded the credit amounted to an overly generous subsidy to entertainment producers.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to justify distorting a tax system so that it favors one industry over another,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re not getting when you do that.\u201dWhether or not the tax credit is good policy, there is no dispute about its popularity. Since Mr. Cuomo became governor, the state has received nearly 1,200 applications for credits for production and postproduction spending. (Postproduction includes the editing and scoring of a film or video after it is recorded.) The state projects that the applications will yield almost $2.8 billion in credits.The credit for postproduction costs had been just 10 percent, but in 2012, it was raised to match the production credit of 30 percent. For postproduction work done upstate, the credit is higher, at 35 percent.The credits are intended to apply only to local spending and wages. They exclude the salaries of many of the highest paid members of a production team, including actors, directors and writers.\u201cThe program\u2019s consistent growth has brought substantial benefits to local economies in both spending and employment,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cGiven the impact it is having, I am proud to be part of the industry\u2019s resurgence in New York.\u201dDefending the wisdom of the credits, state and city officials point to the expansion of the city\u2019s studios. Steiner Studios has added to its presence in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Silvercup Studios said last summer that it would build a new studio in the Bronx, and Broadway Stages said it would add a location on Staten Island.\u201cWe want neighborhoods that have not seen a lot of production to benefit economically from this industry as well,\u201d Ms. Menin said.She added that Warner Brothers spent $45 million filming the movie \u201cThe Intern\u201d across 17 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and that she would encourage other production companies to follow a less-beaten path.Ms. Menin also noted the shift from the days when companies saved money by shooting films and shows in other cities even though they were set in New York. These days, she said, several shows, including \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d and \u201cThe Americans\u201d are being produced in New York even though they are set elsewhere.When it came to the second season of \u201cQuantico,\u201d Mr. Safran said, he did not want to take that tack. The first season depicted a group of fledgling agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with sites in Montreal passing for Virginia.But the next set of episodes will focus much more on New York, and Mr. Safran, who grew up in Manhattan and attended film school at New York University, said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to fake New York.\u201dHe recalled that when he was hired as a writer and consulting producer on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d \u2014 a show about Manhattan society \u2014 he had to relocate to Los Angeles, where the producers were based. Now, he said, he would not leave New York again.He said the pilot for \u201cQuantico\u201d revolved around a terrorist attack at Grand Central Terminal. \u201cIn Season 1, we sort of destroyed New York locations,\u201d he said. \u201cSeason 2 is going to be very much more a New York story.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a studio in Greenpoint.

It is aimed at 18- to 34-year-olds and will be part of the Go90 streaming offering from Verizon.\u201cWe are capitalizing on the emergence of these strong media brands that can reach millennials and Generation Z,\u201d said Brian Angiolet, Verizon\u2019s senior vice president for consumer product and marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re in the early days of cable, and we want to participate more fully in the economics of that trend.\u201dVerizon\u2019s deal values AwesomenessTV at about $650 million, significantly more than the $33 million that the Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation paid it in 2013.The deal is Verizon\u2019s latest effort to reach elusive millennial viewers. The company introduced Go90, which is free to viewers and supported by ads, in the fall with a mix of live events, prime-time TV programming and original web series.At the same time, Verizon\u2019s rival AT&T has been pushing into digital media.AwesomenessTV programming is already available on Go90, and Mr. Angiolet said that its content had exceeded Verizon\u2019s expectations in attracting audiences and generating return viewers. Part of the strategy for Go90 was to expand upon an ad-supported offering, and Verizon\u2019s deal with AwesomenessTV jump-starts that initiative with the new subscription service, he said.The content will be available exclusively on Verizon platforms in the United States, and AwesomenessTV has the rights to sell the content outside the country.\u201cThe creation of this new branded service represents a transformational step, not just for AwesomenessTV, but also for the entire mobile video landscape,\u201d Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, said in a statement.AwesomenessTV plans to create new series for the offering that will feature \u201chighly serialized drama and comedies,\u201d said Brian Robbins, chief executive of AwesomenessTV. Episodes will last eight to 10 minutes, and there will be 10 to 12 episodes a season, he added.Executives said that they were not yet ready to announce specific projects and that they were completing payment models and price points. They compared the new service \u2014 which has yet to be named \u2014 to an HBO or Netflix service, created specifically for the mobile generation.\u201cWe believe the next evolution of short-form content is just superhigh-quality scripted content,\u201d Mr. Robbins said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With a Stand-Alone App, Starz Looks Beyond the Cable Bundle", "Date": "2016-04-04", "News": "Supported byAnd then there was Starz.The hot and crowded market of subscription streaming services will get yet another entrant on Tuesday when Starz, the premium TV network, plans to introduce a stand-alone app available on Apple and Google devices.Aimed at the 20 million homes that pay for broadband but not the full cable TV bundle, the new service, which costs $9 a month, will offer Starz original series like \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d as well as thousands of TV episodes and movies, including Disney\u2019s blockbuster \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d later this year.The development puts a renewed spotlight on Starz, which has surpassed its rival Showtime to become the second-largest premium TV network in the country behind HBO. Now it is seeking to expand its footprint even more by making the network available outside the traditional pay TV model, as HBO has with HBO Now, and other media companies have with similar services.At the same time, Starz has been the subject of on-again-off-again merger and acquisition chatter since 2013, when it spun off from the billionaire John C. Malone\u2019s Liberty Media. Mr. Malone, known for his deal making, has spoken publicly about what he sees as the need for consolidation of what he calls \u201cfree radicals\u201d in the media industry.Creating a stand-alone streaming service has been a long time in the making for Chris Albrecht, who took over as chief executive of Starz in January 2010.Previously, Mr. Albrecht was the chief executive of HBO, where he helped assemble a slate of signature series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cSex and the City.\u201d During that time, he said, he started exploring the idea of creating a \u201clighter\u201d service that HBO could sell directly to consumers, outside traditional cable or satellite packages.\u201cI like to think it was because I was really smart,\u201d he said, but he instead credited people he hired \u201cwho knew about the space and thought about the way people are going to consume content.\u201dThey said, \u201cThis is something that we should be doing and we should be first,\u201d he recalled.\u201cOther companies that are out there might not now exist if we had done that then,\u201d he added, hinting at the rise of Netflix and of Amazon\u2019s streaming service.Starz had only just started experimenting with original programming, with projects like \u201cParty Down\u201d and \u201cSpartacus.\u201d The flagship network at the time counted about 17 million subscribers and had struck a programming deal with Netflix that Mr. Albrecht described as an \u201calbatross around our neck.\u201d That deal \u201cdid a great job in helping launch Netflix,\u201d he said.The company has changed significantly since then. In 2013, Starz was spun off from Liberty into an independent, publicly traded company. It has also raised its profile with critically acclaimed programs like \u201cOutlander,\u201d based on the best-selling novel about a World War II-era British Army nurse, and \u201cPower,\u201d produced by the rapper Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, about a New York nightclub owner and drug kingpin.Starz now has about 23.6 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan, slightly ahead of Showtime\u2019s 23.4 million. HBO, the leading premium channel, has 32.5 million subscribers. Those figures do not include subscribers to their streaming services.Amy Yong, a media analyst with Macquarie, said subscriber numbers were growing for Starz largely because cable and satellite companies get big incentives to sell its subscriptions.Starz is estimated to capture about $4 a subscriber, with the rest of the subscription fee going to cable and satellite companies.\u201cThey are happy to be partners with cable companies,\u201d Ms. Yong said, at a time when many media companies find themselves in heated disputes with cable operators over rights fees.Total revenues for the company increased 2 percent in 2015 to $1.7 billion, with net income down 12 percent to $237 million, primarily because of increased programming and marketing costs. Analysts expect the expiration of a programming deal with Disney to deliver cost savings in the future.Despite the strides Starz has made, it still suffers a perception problem compared with HBO and Showtime, whose shows \u2014 like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHomeland\u201d \u2014 can become part of the cultural conversation. \u201cEveryone knows and recognizes HBO, and consumers can rattle off the last couple of shows on that network,\u201d Ms. Yong said. \u201cStarz still hasn\u2019t found that voice with the consumer. They don\u2019t have any recognizable hits, but they are getting there.\u201d\u201cIt is like they tied one of their legs to ours, tied an anchor around the other leg and threw the anchor off the boat,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said.\u201cIt was certainly distressing to see that and not a lot of fun since then,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can show the ways that we can continue to evolve through the lines of business that we have, as well as creating new ones. We\u2019re going to show a company that is worth investing in.\u201dOne major focus is the new app, which offers downloads of most content and allows four people to stream simultaneously. People who already subscribe to Starz through a traditional pay TV provider also will be able to use the app, which initially will be available on Apple and Google devices, with other future partners expected.In a statement, an Apple spokeswoman said, \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, the future of TV is apps, and STARZ is another incredible example of iOS and Apple TV customers being able to watch the shows they love on their favorite devices.\u201dStarz original series attract viewers who are more racially diverse and have lower average incomes than audiences of other premium TV networks, according to Nielsen data provided by the network. Mr. Albrecht said that the new app was meant for viewers who are likely to be interested in the network\u2019s original programming but are priced out of higher-cost premium TV networks.Typically, cable and satellite providers sell premium networks like HBO, Showtime and Starz on top of subscriptions to standard cable bundles.\u201cThere is an opportunity to differentiate ourselves to a group of consumers that would likely be customers of Starz if they could access it,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said. \u201cPremiums are stuck on top as a cherry last to be added, first to come off.\u201dIndeed, Starz will have much differentiating to do. The debut of the network\u2019s app comes nearly a year after HBO introduced its $15-a-month HBO Now streaming service to much fanfare. Soon after, Showtime unveiled a similar service for $11 a month. All the while, digital competitors like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have greatly expanded their offerings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congratulations! You\u2019ve Been Fired", "Date": "2016-04-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionAT HubSpot, the software company where I worked for almost two years, when you got fired, it was called \u201cgraduation.\u201d We all would get a cheery email from the boss saying, \u201cTeam, just letting you know that X has graduated and we\u2019re all excited to see how she uses her superpowers in her next big adventure.\u201d One day this happened to a friend of mine. She was 35, had been with the company for four years, and was told without explanation by her 28-year-old manager that she had two weeks to get out. On her last day, that manager organized a farewell party for her.It was surreal, and cruel, but everyone at HubSpot acted as if this were perfectly normal. We were told we were \u201crock stars\u201d who were \u201cinspiring people\u201d and \u201cchanging the world,\u201d but in truth we were disposable.Some viewed the statement as a sign that Mr. Bezos at least seems to recognize that it\u2019s not normal for employees to cry at their desks. But it was also a defiant message that he had no intention of letting up.I am old enough to remember the 1980s and early \u201990s, when technology executives were obsessed with retaining talent. \u201cOur most important asset walks out the door every night,\u201d was the clich\u00e9 of the day. No longer.Treating workers as if they are widgets to be used up and discarded is a central part of the revised relationship between employers and employees that techies proclaim is an innovation as important as chips and software. The model originated in Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s spreading. Old-guard companies are hiring \u201cgrowth hackers\u201d and building \u201cincubators,\u201d too. They see Silicon Valley as a model of enlightenment and forward thinking, even though this \u201cnew\u201d way of working is actually the oldest game in the world: the exploitation of labor by capital.HubSpot was founded in 2006 in Cambridge, Mass., and went public in 2014. It\u2019s one of those slick, fast-growing start-ups that are so much in the news these days, with the beanbag chairs and unlimited vacation \u2014 a corporate utopia where there is no need for work-life balance because work is life and life is work. Imagine a frat house mixed with a kindergarten mixed with Scientology, and you have an idea of what it\u2019s like.I joined the company in 2013 after spending 25 years in journalism and getting laid off from a top position at Newsweek. I thought working at a start-up would be great. The perks! The cool offices!It turned out I\u2019d joined a digital sweatshop, where people were packed into huge rooms, side by side, at long tables. Instead of hunching over sewing machines, they stared into laptops or barked into headsets, selling software.Tech workers have no job security. You\u2019re serving a \u201ctour of duty\u201d that might last a year or two, according to the founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, who is the co-author of a book espousing his ideas, \u201cThe Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.\u201d Companies burn you out and churn you out when someone better, or cheaper, becomes available. \u201cYour company is not your family,\u201d is another line from Mr. Hoffman\u2019s book.His ideas trace back to a \u201cculture code\u201d that Netflix published in 2009, declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re a team, not a family.\u201d Netflix views itself as a sports team, always looking to have \u201cstars in every position.\u201d In this new model of work, employees are expected to feel complete devotion and loyalty to their companies, even while the boss feels no such obligation in return.UNFORTUNATELY, working at a start-up all too often involves getting bossed around by undertrained (or untrained) managers and fired on a whim. Bias based on age, race and gender is rampant, as is sexual harassment. The free snacks are nice, but you also must tolerate having your head stuffed with silly jargon and ideology about being on a mission to change the world. Companies sell shares to the public while still losing money. Wealth is generated, but most of the loot goes to a handful of people at the top, the founders and venture capital investors.The Netflix code has been emulated by countless other companies, including HubSpot, which employed a metric called VORP, or value over replacement player. This brutal idea comes from the world of baseball, where it is used to set prices on players. At HubSpot we got a VORP score in our annual reviews. It was supposed to feel scientific, part of being a \u201cdata-driven organization,\u201d as management called it.Grinding out phone calls, trying to make a number, hooked to a machine that watches you work \u2014 this is progress? The people who worked in the furniture factory probably didn\u2019t have easy lives, either. They certainly didn\u2019t have a beer garden, as workers at HubSpot do. On the other hand, they didn\u2019t go through weeks of training that felt eerily like a cult indoctrination, being told that they could use their \u201csuperpowers\u201d to \u201cchange people\u2019s lives\u201d by spreading \u201cdelightion\u201d to their customers.Given the choice, I think I\u2019d rather make furniture.An Opinion article last Sunday about working in technology misstated the findings of a 2013 study by Payscale.
