Stewart\u2019s suggestion to \u201cbuild something awe-inspiring.\u201d Do we really have to appeal to his sense of grandiosity in order to stimulate action? The result may well be a mega-golf course and resort in the center of Yellowstone Park, complete with the TRUMP logo.Repairing and improving the country\u2019s roads, bridges, federal buildings, national parks, energy and computer systems may not be glamorous, but such projects will generate well-paying employment instead of minimum-wage service jobs, and would leave a real (not a real-estate) and lasting legacy.DONNA BERGENTOM MADDENSkokie, Ill.To the Editor:I\u2019d like to add an item to the list of infrastructure projects suggested in the article: a coast-to-coast project to put all power and telephone lines underground.Such a project could employ more medium and low-skilled people than the construction of the Interstate Highway System did during the Eisenhower administration. It could be financed, at least partly, through the military budget as a national security measure that secures our power distribution systems against attack. And it would save untold millions of dollars year-in and year-out by avoiding the cost of power outages every time a storm hits.The current generation would thank President Donald Trump for the jobs and the boost to the economy, and generations to come would thank him for his foresight.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Faces Epic Juggling Act After Tesla-SolarCity Deal", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTesla Motors\u2019 eager shareholders have made Elon Musk too cool to fail. Their decision to back the Silicon Valley billionaire\u2019s quixotic $2.6 billion bid for SolarCity, a solar-panel company run by his cousin, sets up an epic 2017 juggling act. A lot could go wrong as Mr. Musk tries to integrate the two companies without compromising on Tesla\u2019s ambitious production targets. Indulgent investors, though, are likely to give him a pass.His grand vision is to create a one-stop shop for people who want to power their lives with renewable energy. Tesla already makes electric cars and wall-mounted battery packs that can be used to power homes. SolarCity, whose main innovation is a clever financing model, will round out the picture with rooftop solar panels, solar shingles and the like.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The vision is appealing, but in the short run it looks challenging. Tesla may have surprised investors by turning a narrow \u2014 and rare \u2014 profit in the third quarter, but the vast bulk of its current $28 billion market capitalization is predicated on Mr. Musk\u2019s turning the company from a niche supplier into a truly mass manufacturer of electric vehicles. Tesla\u2019s shares have fallen about 16 percent since the company unveiled its SolarCity bid in June, reducing the value of the all-stock deal to around $2 billion.Hitting a self-imposed target of cranking out 500,000 cars per year by 2018, from a current run rate of around 100,000, already looked daunting. Tesla, after all, has a history of missing production and sales targets; its Model X S.U.V., for example, was delayed by problems with its falcon-wing doors.Now Mr. Musk and his team also have a major acquisition to worry about. Throw in his continued role as chief executive of the rocket venture SpaceX, and he has a lot up in the air. Moreover, to deliver on its promises, Tesla will probably need to ask investors for fresh capital at some point next year.For most chief executives, all this would make 2017 a make-or-break year. But Tesla investors\u2019 overwhelming support of the SolarCity deal suggests that Mr. Musk is in a different category. Even if the wheels start to come off, he will probably be able to persuade the faithful to keep him in place and to hand over more cash. That may make Mr. Musk\u2019s all-electric vision a self-fulfilling prophecy, no matter the cost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: The Valley Awakens to Trump", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byBitsSilicon Valley loves disruption \u2014 just not, it turns out, disruptions of a certain kind.The tech elite had criticized him for his statements about immigration and globalization, along with much in his personal behavior. Mr. Trump in turn took the Valley companies to task for building their iconic products in China, and implicitly condemned the local culture of global elites, driving their subsidized Teslas past much of working-class America.With a relationship like that, there are expectations that much of the tech business as usual is over. At first pass, even before Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and programs are known, the tech world seems to feel as if it won\u2019t be at the center of attention, the way it seemed to be in the now-passing Obama years.President Obama, a self-proclaimed geek, liked publicizing his school science fairs at the White House and embraced the idea that the sweeping changes to the economy and society wrought by modern technology were ultimately beneficial.Not being cool with the powers that be would indeed be disruptive, and could very likely affect local profits. But there are a few things the Valley should bear in mind before falling into utter despair.For starters, no matter who is in charge, the future is still coming at us, one day at a time, and they have a big role in that. The next administration won\u2019t recall all iPhones or forbid the production of apps.And while Mr. Trump may profess anger at the digital industry, he is clearly fond of Twitter, and ran a lightweight, fast-moving and iterative campaign that owed much to his fans using new media like YouTube.Besides, Mr. Trump famously likes to do deals; with all the billions lying around the Valley, the two sides might eventually find a way to do business together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Are No New Ideas, Only Rediscoveries", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Around 1900, a century before Tesla\u2019s Model S, there were more than 30,000 electric cars registered in the United States. In London, passengers were being ferried around by a small fleet of electric taxis, nicknamed Hummingbirds for the distinctive whir of their engines. So begins \u201cRethink: The Surprising History of New Ideas,\u201d the British journalist Steven Poole\u2019s attack on what he calls a \u201cSilicon Valley ideology\u201d: the notion that every great innovation of today is a \u201cflash of inspiration,\u201d an invention of \u201csomething from nothing.\u201d In an anecdote-rich tour through the centuries, Poole traces \u201cnew\u201d ideas in mental health back to the Stoics; dates the invention of the e-cigarette to 1965; and tells us that the leech is now an F.D.A.-approved \u201cmedical device,\u201d used for, among other things, preventing blood from pooling after reconstructive plastic surgery. We live in \u201can age of rediscovery,\u201d Poole writes. \u201cOld is the new new.\u201dPoole\u2019s strategy is to categorize. He assembles chapters on ideas that should have died but won\u2019t (\u201czombie ideas,\u201d he calls them), on bad ideas that led to good ones (\u201csteppingstones\u201d) and so on. The method, though, yields little in the way of insight. A survey of ahead-of-their-time ideas, for example, leads to the underwhelming conclusion that the world would have been a better place if folks had figured things out sooner.And Poole, perversely, finishes every chapter with a recapitulation, each a dispiriting reminder of how little his argument has progressed, delivered in the tone of Microsoft Word\u2019s old AutoSummary function: \u201cMany people died needlessly of cancer in the decades after the electronic cigarette had been invented, and before its eventual rediscovery, but the new version may be a revolution in public health. Similarly, the rejection of atomism for so long may well have delayed the development of lifesaving technologies, but at least now we enjoy its benefits in molecular pharmacology and other fields. And in future the embrace of edible insects could, according to its proponents, forestall major famines.\u201dPoole, a language columnist for The Guardian, is the author of five other books. He\u2019s a brisk writer, and his prose can be charming: In a review of a book on eating meat, he writes, \u201cIf I ate only animals I killed myself, I would live on a rather uninspiring diet of clothes moths and the occasional mosquito.\u201d Here, though, things never get moving because he shirks the basics of narrative writing: character, scene, emotional connection. I was eager to know Grace Hopper, an early software developer braving a man\u2019s world, but Poole describes her only as a \u201crebel pioneer.\u201d His field reports lean heavily on perfunctory stock settings (\u201cdark, wintry afternoon,\u201d \u201ccrisp spring afternoon,\u201d \u201ca light-filled studio\u201d) and then devolve into pages of stultifying quotation.The whole project has a slapdash, cynical vibe. On the first page, Poole introduces us to the Scottish chemist Robert Davidson and credits him with building, in 1837, \u201cthe first known electric car.\u201d In fact, it was a locomotive. In lieu of transitions, he reaches for easy, but quite awkward, rhetorical questions. \u201cBut how exactly could the inheritance of acquired characteristics take place?\u201d Two pages later: \u201cBut how exactly do we establish that inheritance of stress and depression can happen in humans?\u201d A writer more wary of the familiar might have resisted the urge to remind us of the quote from Ecclesiastes, that there is \u201cno new thing under the sun,\u201d or of George Santayana\u2019s admonition that those who do not know the past \u201care condemned to repeat it.\u201d His sentences include generous helpings of phrases like \u201ccutting-edge\u201d and \u201chigh-tech\u201d and other mainstays of weak-sauce hype. By the final pages, when, I kid you not, Poole riffs on humanity\u2019s future in the stars, it becomes clear that \u201cRethink\u201d will never answer its existential question: Yes, old ideas are rediscovered, but where, for readers living in a golden age of vinyl records and home pickling, is the surprise in that?Gareth Cook, a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biggest Spike in Traffic Deaths in 50 Years? Blame Apps", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe messaging app Snapchat allows motorists to post photos that record the speed of the vehicle. The navigation app Waze rewards drivers with points when they report traffic jams and accidents. Even the game Pok\u00e9mon Go has drivers searching for virtual creatures on the nation\u2019s highways.When distracted driving entered the national consciousness a decade ago, the problem was mainly people who made calls or sent texts from their cellphones. The solution then was to introduce new technologies to keep drivers\u2019 hands on the wheel. Innovations since then \u2014 car Wi-Fi and a host of new apps \u2014 have led to a boom in internet use in vehicles that safety experts say is contributing to a surge in highway deaths.After steady declines over the last four decades, highway fatalities last year recorded the largest annual percentage increase in 50 years. And the numbers so far this year are even worse. In the first six months of 2016, highway deaths jumped 10.4 percent, to 17,775, from the comparable period of 2015, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\u201cThis is a crisis that needs to be addressed now,\u201d Mark R. Rosekind, the head of the agency, said in an interview.Alarmed by the statistics, the Department of Transportation in October outlined a plan to work with the National Safety Council and other advocacy groups to devise a \u201cRoad to Zero\u201d strategy, with the ambitious goal of eliminating roadway fatalities within 30 years.The Obama administration\u2019s transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, said that the near-term effort would involve identifying changes in regulations, laws and standards that could help reduce fatalities. That might include pushing for all states to tighten and enforce laws requiring use of seatbelts in cars and helmets on motorcycles, while cracking down on distracted or drunken driving. The effort might also include tougher regulation of heavy trucks, Mr. Foxx said.A second, related effort would focus on setting longer-term goals and speeding the introduction of autonomous-driving technologies that many safety experts say have the potential to prevent accidents by removing distracted humans from the driving equation.One concern so far, though, is that current generations of automated driver-assistance systems, like the Autopilot feature offered by Tesla Motors, may be lulling some drivers into a false sense of security that can contribute to distracted driving.Whether highway safety officials in the Trump administration will have the same priorities, though, is too soon to say. The names of candidates for transportation secretary have not yet been publicly floated.Most new vehicles sold today have software that connects to a smartphone and allows drivers to place phone calls, dictate texts and use apps hands-free. Ford Motor has its Sync system, for example. Others, including Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz, offer their own interfaces as well as Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto.Automakers say these systems enable customers to concentrate on driving even while interacting with their smartphones.\u201cThe whole principle is to bring voice recognition to customers so they can keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel,\u201d said Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford, which began installing Sync in cars in 2007.Since then, the company has added features to reduce distractions, like a \u201cdo not disturb button\u201d that lets drivers block incoming calls and texts.CarPlay allows use of the iPhone\u2019s Siri virtual assistant to answer phone calls, dictate texts and control apps like Spotify and Pandora. Both Sync and CarPlay present simplified menus on a car\u2019s in-dash display to reduce driver distraction and turn off the phone\u2019s screen, eliminating the temptation to use the device itself.But Deborah Hersman, president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the federal National Transportation Safety Board, said it was not clear how much those various technologies reduced distraction \u2014 or, instead, encouraged people to use even more functions on their phones while driving. And freeing the drivers\u2019 hands does not necessarily clear their heads.\u201cIt\u2019s the cognitive workload on your brain that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Ms. Hersman said.Technology in some new cars is meant to reduce driver distractions or compensate for them.Dr. William Chandler, a retired neurosurgeon in Ann Arbor, Mich., just bought a 2017 BMW X5 sport utility vehicle that warns him if he drifts out of his lane on the highway or if a car is in his blind spot. His favorite feature is a heads-up display on the windshield in front of him that projects his speed, the speed limit and navigation information.\u201cIt puts all the directions and turns right there in my field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real safety factor for distracted driving, because I\u2019m never looking at the map on the screen in the console.\u201dBut new cars make up only a small portion of the 260 million vehicles on the road in the United States. Digital diversion is harder to address in older models.Brett Hudson, 26, a teacher at a charter school in Jackson, Mich., said his iPhone 6 Plus had become essential to his daily commute in his 2002 Chevrolet TrailBlazer. He uses Apple Maps for navigation, listens to music via Pandora and gets his favorite Michigan football call-in show on iHeart Radio.To reduce the time he looks at the phone, Mr. Hudson installed an aftermarket Bluetooth system for hands-free phone calls. He mounts the iPhone on a clip attached to an air vent, enabling him to see the screen while still keeping the road in his field of vision.Mr. Hudson concedes that the setup is not risk-free.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that when I do have to touch the phone,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018my brain becomes so totally focused, even in that short period of time, and I don\u2019t really remember what\u2019s happening on the road in those four or five seconds.\u201dInsurance companies, which closely track auto accidents, are convinced that the increasing use of electronic devices while driving is the biggest cause of the rise in road fatalities, according to Robert Gordon, a senior vice president of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\u201cThis is a serious public safety concern for the nation,\u201d Mr. Gordon said at a recent conference in Washington held by the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cWe are all trying to figure out to what extent this is the new normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Power Couple: Tie-Up Shows How Batteries and Solar May Link", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byThe solar panels \u2014 15,000 of them \u2014 sweep down the hill from a former dairy farm here, gleaming rows of silver and blue nestled between fields of recently harvested corn. The installation, a project developed in partnership with SolarCity, the leading rooftop solar provider in the United States, and the local electric cooperative, is meant to help create more green energy options for customers, mainly a handful of utilities operating in the state.But it is what lies toward the bottom of the array that gives the project its distinction: about 30 white refrigerator-size battery banks courtesy of Tesla, the electric carmakerThe facility, the Mountain Ash Solar Farm, is not running yet, but, along with a similar, larger project under development in Hawaii, it offers a steel-and-glass example of what Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, founders of SolarCity, have in mind for their merger planned for this year.Solar energy has long been seen as an important weapon in the fight against climate change, but its usefulness is limited because the sun sets \u2014 and is temporarily blocked by passing clouds \u2014 which can create a mismatch between supply and demand or lead to complications on the grid. Adding batteries to the mix not only solves those problems, but allows solar power plant operators to sell new services to system operators.Indeed, the project on the Hawaiian island of Kauai \u2014 where the companies are installing batteries at a solar farm to help fuel the grid during the evening \u2014 was the impetus for the proposed merger, according to Mr. Musk. As constituted, each joint deal is subject to special approval from independent board committees at both companies, making the process too burdensome.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do dozens and then hundreds and maybe thousands of these deals, there\u2019s no way we can keep having\u201d such an unwieldy process, he said on a conference call with financial analysts this summer. Under the proposal, set for a shareholder vote on Nov. 17, Tesla would acquire SolarCity. \u201cIt\u2019s very limited what we can do until we have actually one company.\u201dThere are plenty of reasons for skepticism that the Musk-Rive vision will come to pass. Both companies, which lost more than $1.6 billion, or 1.45 billion euros, last year between them, face financial pressures from rising debt and a continual flurry of spending. Some energy analysts say the proposed acquisition is at least as much about helping Mr. Musk\u2019s personal investments as furthering his green agenda, while others have questioned the wisdom of taking on a complicated transaction just as Tesla is beginning production at its huge battery factory in Nevada and preparing to bring its first moderately priced car to market.Still others say it is not necessary to own the solar provider to sell batteries to go with solar power systems. While the combination can reduce prices, it can still be too expensive to compete with cheap electricity from other sources. The key would be to lower the cost of the batteries. However, driving down that price depends heavily on the battery factory meeting its targets as it increases production, which will take years, even if everything goes smoothly.Nonetheless, the companies are already moving forward as one in some ways and have been since 2010.In a filing in April with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla anticipated recognizing $44 million in revenue this year from SolarCity for energy storage product sales, up from $8 million from SolarCity last year. That means, according to an analysis by GTM Research, which tracks certain clean technologies, Tesla could sell almost 60 percent more batteries for on-site storage at single buildings or facilities to SolarCity over 2016 than was installed for that segment of the United States storage market last year.Bob Rudd, vice president of development, energy storage and microgrids at SolarCity, declined to give specifics, but said he was in talks for a number of large installations, any one of which could double what the company had installed. But interest in these kinds of projects is growing, and SolarCity and Tesla have plenty of competition to build them.Massachusetts, for instance, approved a storage mandate earlier this year, joining California and Oregon, and other states are weighing storage targets. New Jersey has an incentive program, and New York City recently set a target for its utilities to install 100 megawatt hours of storage by 2020.The project here could produce enough energy to run 725 average Connecticut homes each year over its 20-year life. But the batteries can also act as a bulwark against outages during storms, said Drew A. Rankin, chief executive of the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, which mainly supplies wholesale power to a consortium of utilities in the state.\u201cWe see it as a huge benefit,\u201d he said.The Kauai project, among the largest storage installations in the nation, is a way for the island to better use its abundance of solar energy to meet aggressive renewable goals, said David Bissell, chief executive of the electric cooperative there. The state, which relies heavily on diesel fuel for electricity and pays some of the highest rates in the country, has a mandate to use 100 percent renewable fuel by 2045.Kauai has already come close \u2014 as high as 98 percent \u2014 but only for minutes at a time, Mr. Bissell said, and is at 40 percent renewable in its generation mix overall. Not allowed to use wind because of the island\u2019s endangered seabird population, they need to add more solar, which is their lowest-cost source of new generation, but they already have more power coming into the grid during the prime daylight hours than the system needs. Hence, they turned to storage.A request for proposals a few years ago yielded several applications, but no one came in with a price low enough, including SolarCity. But the company kept trying and eventually came up with a price that made sense for the utility, Mr. Bissell said. The solar panels will sit on about 50 acres and fill the batteries during the day with enough energy to power 5,000 homes through the evening peak. It is due to come into service in the first quarter of next year.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Mr. Bissell said, adding that they were already looking to develop an even bigger project. \u201cWe\u2019re very bullish on solar and storage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Inside, the dash looks like the helm of a spaceship, with a center console map display bigger than an iPad that, once on the road, Mr. Ocean never consults.It\u2019s been more than a year since he\u2019s had a steady home \u2014 most of his beloved cars are in storage. He moves from city to city, hotel to hotel. In a couple of days, he\u2019ll be in New York, looking for an apartment. A day after that, he\u2019ll turn 29.Over the past three years, his absence from the pop troposphere \u2014 a void interrupted only by the occasional collaboration, Tumblr post or paparazzi shot \u2014 has felt like a position statement against celebrity culture, while simultaneously guaranteeing that Mr. Ocean\u2019s fame, turbo-boosted by fervent curiosity, would grow even wider.His exile began in earnest in 2013. He was living here, in a glass-walled apartment high over Sunset and Vine, with a panoramic view of South Los Angeles. But the city was choking him: People had stolen money from him; there were \u201cphysical sorts of things going on in the streets\u201d; and he grew concerned about the management of his affairs. \u201cIt started to weigh on me that I was responsible for the moves that had made me successful, but I wasn\u2019t reaping the lion\u2019s share of the profits, and that was problematic for me.\u201cI had, in the midst of all of this, this feeling of isolation,\u201d he added. \u201cWithin my circle, there was a lot of places I thought I could turn that I felt like I couldn\u2019t turn to anymore.\u201dSo he left, hopping a plane to London, a city where he barely knew anyone, with only a duffel bag full of clothes and a backpack carrying the precious hard drives holding all of his music.There\u2019s a fine line between a sane escape and running away. Did you feel you were on one side or the other of that?I never thought about it like that. I always thought about it like, if your house is on fire, you need to get out of the house.Did you feel that certain things in your career also hadn\u2019t gone the way you would have liked?Certain moments were drawbacks for sure. Now I look at things differently, but at the time, yeah. Audiences in excess of five million people [on national TV]. I was always reluctant to do those things except in cases where they had this nostalgic significance to me. Like performing at the V.M.A.s, being tapped to perform at the Grammys \u2014 me saying yes to those things had a lot to do with how those things made me feel before I was actually in the business. And just wanting to be rubbing shoulders with those people and being seen at those places. I still was reluctant and sort of skeptical of those things because I questioned whether or not I was prepared.I feel like the public knock on you is that you want to be anonymous, or you want to be in some kind of retreat from the spotlight. Sometimes I\u2019m fascinated with how famous my work could be while I\u2019m not so famous. Super-envious of the fact that Daft Punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the world, while also understanding that will never be my situation. It\u2019s too late. It\u2019s hard to articulate how I think about myself as a public figure. I\u2019ve gotten used to being Frank Ocean. A lot of people stopped me on the street when I hadn\u2019t put music out in a while, literally would yell out of an Uber, \u201cFrank, where the album?\u201dHas dating been difficult for you in this period of increased celebrity? I think normal would be the word, whatever that word means, which is usually nothing. I\u2019m in a very different place than I was four or five years ago with all that stuff. Different in my relationship with myself, which means everything. There\u2019s no, like, shame or self-loathing. There\u2019s no, you know, crisis.Have you been in love since then, since 2012?Not the lasting kind.Control is often at the forefront of Mr. Ocean\u2019s mind. When he was on tour, his concerts would be recorded each night, and he would watch the tape, type up notes and email them to his team to prepare for a morning meeting. When \u201cBlonde\u201d and \u201cEndless\u201d were being recorded, he carried the hard drives with his music in his backpack, and the backups, too: \u201cI\u2019d rather the plane goes down in flames and the drives go down with me than somebody put out a weird posthumous release.\u201d When he answers questions, he takes meaningful pauses, mulling over premises, before answering in expansive stories paired with precise bursts of logic.After bouncing around hotels in London, he moved into a furnished apartment that he eventually stripped bare of all but the essentials: \u201cI just wanted to be able to walk around and not run into an end table or some useless piece of furniture.\u201d He rode electric bikes around the city, made new friends \u2014 \u201cwhich is not as difficult as celebrities make it sound\u201d \u2014 went on dates. He recorded in a handful of studios, including Abbey Road, where he asked for the studio, too, to be decluttered, removing furniture and bringing in flower arrangements.Piece by piece, the music that would become \u201cBlonde\u201d and \u201cEndless\u201d was coming together, though up until then, it had been slow going. He\u2019d begun recording at Electric Lady in New York, but after he took a pause away from the studio, the rhythm of writing was gone. \u201cI had writer\u2019s block for almost a year,\u201d he said. During that time, he would go to the studio, \u201cstare at the monitors and come up with nothing, or nothing that I liked.\u201dThat dry spell broke only after he reconnected with a childhood friend from New Orleans who was going through difficult times. That conversation, he said, \u201cmade me feel as though I should talk about the way I grew up more.\u201dHe decided that he wanted \u201cBlonde\u201d and \u201cEndless\u201d to be more autobiographical than his earlier releases. \u201cI wrote \u2018Channel Orange\u2019 in two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end product wasn\u2019t always that gritty, real-life depiction of the real struggle that happened.\u201dSo he turned inward, and backward, telling stories about his childhood, family life, and romantic relationships \u2014 some frivolous, like on \u201cNikes\u201d (\u201cHe don\u2019t care for me/but he cares for me/and that\u2019s good enough\u201d); some meaningful, like on \u201cSelf Control\u201d (\u201cWish we\u2019d grown up on the same advice\u201d): \u201cThat was written about someone who I was actually in a relationship with, who wasn\u2019t an unrequited situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was mutual, it was just we couldn\u2019t really relate. We weren\u2019t really on the same wavelength.\u201dIn places, like on \u201cIvy,\u201d he manipulated his voice to sound younger, to better capture the time he was evoking. Many of the new songs have two or three competing narratives \u2014 different points of view participating in the same story. \u201cThat was my version of collage or bricolage,\u201d he said. \u201cHow we experience memory sometimes, it\u2019s not linear. We\u2019re not telling the stories to ourselves, we know the story, we\u2019re just seeing it in flashes overlaid.\u201dOn \u201cBlonde,\u201d especially, you used a lot of different voices.Sometimes I felt like you weren\u2019t hearing enough versions of me within a song, \u2019cause there was a lot of hyperactive thinking. Even though the pace of the album\u2019s not frenetic, the pace of ideas being thrown out is.Are they always multiple points of view, or are they multiple Franks interrupting each other to be heard?It\u2019s the same thing \u2014 to me \u2014 because my point of view from one emotional state to another is a different point of view. Sometimes I want to talk on a song and be angry, because I am angry. Then there\u2019s always a part of me that remembers that this record lives past my being angry, and so do I really want to be angry about that? Is that feeling going to have longevity?Were you working toward a fixed idea on these albums? Or was it mutating and evolving as you went?When I was making the record, there was 50 versions of \u201cWhite Ferrari.\u201d I have a 15-year-old little brother, and he heard one of the versions, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYou gotta put that one out, that\u2019s the one.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNaw, that\u2019s not the version,\u201d because it didn\u2019t give me peace yet.You were reaching for something ineffable?They\u2019re just chords, just melodies. I don\u2019t know what combination of those objects is gonna make me feel how I need to feel. But I know precisely the feeling that needs to happen.When releasing \u201cEndless\u201d and \u201cBlonde,\u201d he took his time: \u201cI know that once it\u2019s out, it\u2019s out forever, so I\u2019m not really tripping on how long it\u2019s taking.\u201d He described his mood after the release of \u201cBlonde\u201d as \u201cpostpartum.\u201d Rather than going on a promotional tour, playing radio festivals and making the usual rounds, he spent about a month traveling: \u201cChina, Japan, Oceania, France, just around. Casual.\u201dYou solved some rather intractable business issues. You recalibrated the cast of professionals who work on your career. Were those your main goals?With this record in particular, I wanted to feel like I won before the record came out, and I did, and so it took a lot pressure off of me about how the record even would perform after the fact. Once the goal is met, everything else is lagniappe. It\u2019s not essential for me to have a big debut week, it\u2019s not essential for me to have big radio records.What about the data side, the numbers, the sales?I know exactly what the numbers are. I need to know. I need to know how many records I\u2019ve sold, how many album equivalents from streaming, which territories are playing my music more than others, because it helps me in conversations about where we\u2019re gonna be playing shows, or where I might open a retail location, like a pop-up store or something.Do you feel like the numbers are commensurate with what you thought they would or should be?Well, we doubled \u201cChannel Orange\u201d first week. I\u2019m always gonna be like, \u201cWe could have done a little bit better.\u201d I guess there\u2019s a satisfaction that comes with looking at numbers like that, and I\u2019m making, like, No Limit-type of equity, Master P-type of equity on my record.And there have been accolades, too. In 2013, Mr. Ocean won two Grammys, and he has been nominated since, but come February, he will not win any, because he chose not to submit his music for consideration. \u201cThat institution certainly has nostalgic importance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\u201d He noted that since he was born, just a few black artists have won album of the year, including Quincy Jones, Herbie Hancock and Ray Charles.Though Mr. Ocean said the Grammys reached out to his representatives, he never spoke with them directly before making his decision. \u201cI think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.\u201dHe is as much refusenik as artist \u2014 what he does may be less important than what he chooses not to do.And moving forward, what he may choose not to do is release an album without a visual component, or even release something album length at all. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not in a record deal, I don\u2019t have to operate in an album format,\u201d he said. \u201cI can operate in half-a-song format.\u201dOr he might devote less time to music. \u201cI believe that I\u2019m one of the best in the world at what I do, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more interesting for me to figure out how to be superior in areas where I\u2019m na\u00efve, where I\u2019m a novice.\u201dA few weeks ago, he was flying back from Washington with his mother after a White House state dinner, where he had been one of President Obama\u2019s guests. Mr. Ocean told her how he\u2019d been poking around the visual arts degree offerings at the New School, thinking about what it would take to begin to learn and refine a new craft.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have time to do that,\u201d she told him. And he replied, \u201cMom, I\u2019m rich!\u201dHe\u2019s laughing now. After a long drive, the Tesla is parked behind an anonymous recording studio, where he\u2019s about to go work on new music. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to flex up on my mom,\u201d he said. Rather, it was \u201ca personal service announcement to me, to just be like \u2018Wait, look at your position, you have the luxury of choice.\u2019\u201dNow he\u2019s finished laughing, back in control. \u201cThis has always been my life and no one else\u2019s,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been since the day I came in it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The arrests are the first charges in multiple state and federal investigations into Valeant\u2019s business practices.According to the complaint, filed Wednesday in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, Mr. Davenport, who pocketed about $40 million after the purchase option agreement went through, used a series of shell companies to transfer a $10 million kickback payment to Mr. Tanner.Mr. Tanner was forced out of Valeant in 2015. Mr. Davenport remained at Philidor until the company shut down in January. Both men said through their lawyers that they intended to defend themselves.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference on Thursday that the investigation was continuing. He would not say whether his office was looking into Valeant\u2019s accounting practices.In a statement, Valeant noted that the company and its top executives had not been charged in the case, and said it was cooperating with the investigation.The authorities\u2019 investigation revealed that as JPMorgan was competing with other big banks for business in China, some bankers concluded that they needed to bring on the children of well-connected parents, known as princelings.\u201cWe lost a deal to DB today because they got chairman\u2019s daughter work for them this summer,\u201d one JPMorgan investment banking executive told colleagues, referring to Deutsche Bank.Many of the job candidates were unqualified, the authorities said, but JPMorgan hired them anyway.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID POST Making Your Money Mean SomethingRemember when investing was all about the financial returns? For a growing number of individuals and families, those days are long gone.Today\u2019s investors increasingly want other kinds of returns as well. They want to travel with friends to faraway places, collect fine wines \u2014 and even own the winery. They want to scour galleries for the next up-and-coming artist or style. They want to take action to aid people or areas in need, spending a vacation helping to build a school in Africa, perhaps, rather than just lounging on a secluded beach.Bottom line: Investors want to put their money into products and companies they admire, causes they care about and personal passions that bring them joy.\u201cThey can purchase a $100,000 Tesla to minimize their use of fossil fuels,\u201d says Tom Corley, author of \u201cRich Habits: The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals.\u201d \u201cThey can create a financial plan that invests their money in companies producing products that are in line with what's important to them.\u201dIn fact, says Demetri Argyropoulos, founder of business-advisory firm Avant Global, those who own equity in a brand are 54 percent more likely to use that brand\u2019s product.For health-minded people, organic foods have become mainstream as genetic modification and pesticides have ingrained themselves in our food supply.Many cities and states now require recycling. Technology is helping to create better and faster ways to recycle, as well as more uses for recycled items.The large turbines are popping up from coast to coast as individuals are looking for cleaner energy sources. In addition to its environmental benefits, this technology is helping to create better ways to harness the energy.Solar power has been around for decades, but technology has finally caught up as demand is increasing for more environmentally friendly energy sources.Turn on the news and you will see companies jumping toward renewable energies. The growth within the market has been exponential as technologies create new kinds of renewable energy and better ways to harness it.Of all the things driving change in the art world, technology has had the greatest impact, fueling a jump in online art-buying as well as new ways to create art.The urge to see the world has combined with the urge to do good, essentially creating a new way of vacationing. Millennials in particular are driving this cultural change.A cultural shift to be more environmentally conscious has created a surge in the use of sustainable fabrics. Technology is only helping to grow the industry as it creates new fabrics.Technology has helped the 3D-printing market grow exponentially, which has fueled cultural exploration. The technique is now being used in everything from fashion design to medical innovation.Private aviation is a growing market among affluent individuals because of the experiences it offers. As the technology has gotten better, the cost has also gone down, increasing demand.Working out is more than just exercise, it has become an experience unto itself. This cultural movement is especially seen in the boutique gym market and the devotion of its members. Health food has been a cornerstone of the wellness movement as living a healthy lifestyle has become a kind of cultural movement. Healthy food is also impacting the environment as people look to \u201ceat clean.\u201dBicycles are more than just an evironmentally friendly way to get around. They have become a cultural explosion, with the boutique gym culture latching on to their popularity.Personal robotics are another area of technology looking to make our lives easier. This burgeoning marketplace is set to grow even more in upcoming years.Smart homes are using Internet of Things technology to make our lives easier, while also using less electricity and alternate electricity sources to create fewer emissions.Financial technology is turning banking on its head and will continue to grow as individuals look for smarter, faster and better ways to interact with their finances.In addition to their improved safety, self-driving cars will be a cultural phenomenon that yields environmental benefits as well.Wearables started out as fitness trackers, but as their technology gets more complex with each new iteration, their popularity has exploded within the fashion world.See how the experiences you love lead to surprising connections.Karla Dascal, a Miami-based entrepreneur who owns wellness center Sacred Space Miami, often travels to India for yoga retreats \u2014 and invests in companies she wants to see grow. For Dascal, health is a way of life. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have your health, you have nothing,\u201d she says.Dascal started investing in health-and-wellness companies before most of her peers. Now, though, many of her friends are also buying wellness products, adopting healthier lifestyles and seeking rejuvenating experiences. \u201cPeople are now very interested in this,\u201d she says.The rise of small, high-end gyms supports that perception. In 2016, boutique gyms accounted for 42 percent of the total U.S. fitness-club market, double what it was in 2014. Members typically paid $80 to $140 a month for access to these gyms in 2014, significantly more than the $52 average for overall gym memberships. Organic foods and immersive wellness experiences \u2014 including healthy-eating retreats, outdoor fitness challenges and expert seminars on wellness-related topics \u2014 are also doing well. This growth is being seen in the uptick in IPOs of health and wellness companies over the past couple of years, including well-known gyms and healthy-snack makers.Investing in sustainability is another way people are putting their values to work \u2014 installing solar panels on their roofs, holding shares or making direct investments in renewable-energy technology, buying organic foods and purchasing electric cars. One indicator of the strength of the market for environmentally friendly products is the revenue gains enjoyed by electric-car manufacturers, who have built their business on the premise that people will pay a significant premium for sustainable products. From 2013 to 2015, Tesla\u2019s revenue doubled, to about $4 billion.And with individuals now building more environmentally friendly homes, interest in Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Powerwall is growing. The home battery will use electricity generated by solar panels to power the house. In some setups, homeowners will even be able to sell unused power back to the grid.Another area attracting investors with a purpose: water. David Wilson, head of the strategic analysts group at Capgemini, which tracks the habits of affluent individuals, says he\u2019s seeing people make direct investments in technology firms that support water purification or companies aiming to improve water sustainability in emerging markets. \u201cThey\u2019re making investment choices based on clearly defined objectives,\u201d Wilson says.As a result, desalination companies are likely to become a major focus. As droughts have become more frequent and widespread, there\u2019s greater urgency to develop cheaper and more efficient ways to remove the salt from seawater to make it drinkable. Once that technology is up and running, investors in these projects are likely to want to travel to see the results of their efforts in action.40% of high-net worth individuals consider themselves early adopters of technologyMany investors are also passionate about technology \u2014 they want everything from mobile gadgets and smart-home devices to optimized financial technology and personal robots. Some 40 percent of individuals in this income bracket say they are early adopters of technology, according to a study by Accenture.The same report found that 87 percent of investors with a net worth of at least $750,000 are using digital products to handle their financial needs. They\u2019re also upping their investments in FinTech-related endeavors \u2014 895 projects in 2015, four times more than in 2010. Meanwhile, venture capital firms have poured more than $4 billion into wearable-technology players in the past two years, up from just $333 million in 2011.Then, of course, there\u2019s the investment that has beckoned the heart and the portfolio of the affluent from time immemorial: art.The value of the online art market is estimated to increase by 193 percent between now and 2020In 2015, financial advisors surveyed by Knight Frank\u2019s Wealth Trends reported 63 percent of their clients were becoming more interested in buying paintings and sculpture. Wilson says he\u2019s seen a rise in art collecting among the wealthy, noting that \u201cpeople buy art for the aesthetic value \u2014 they can get a personal benefit from it every day, while at the same time it\u2019s an uncorrelated asset.\u201dThe difference today is that it\u2019s so much easier for potential collectors to explore what\u2019s out there than it used to be. Galleries are everywhere \u2014 not just in major international hotspots. But perhaps even more important has been the rise of online purveyors of paintings and sculpture, all vying to disrupt the closed and secretive global network of high-end art exchange. Online art sales rose 24 percent year-over-year in 2015, and the value of the online art market is forecast to soar 193 percent by 2020.Finding the best ways to invest in your values and passions isn\u2019t easy, but a financial advisor with experience counseling the wealthy can help, says Corley. \u201cThe good ones are continuously updating their knowledge (of investment options.)\u201dMeanwhile, investors\u2019 determination to use their money to express who they really are will no doubt continue to spread and strengthen. \u201cPeople are living longer,\u201d says Argyropoulos. \u201cSo they want to make a difference while they\u2019re alive. They want to be able to realize their dreams while they can.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Intel to Team With Delphi and Mobileye for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byToday\u2019s automobiles are often described as computers on wheels, for the scores of processors and chips they use to control everything, including the transmission, brakes, power windows and navigation system.The advent of self-driving cars may require the equivalent of a supercomputer on wheels. Which is why three technology companies in the field \u2014 Intel, Delphi Automotive and Mobileye \u2014 plan to collaborate in an alliance to be announced Tuesday.For Intel, especially, it will be an effort to catch up in autonomous vehicles, a field where some chip makers have made deeper inroads.The processing power required to scan the road, identify pedestrians and fuse images from radar, cameras and other sensors \u2014 all in real time \u2014 is spurring a race to provide increasingly complex computer brains that will dwarf those found in cars today.The competition is reflected in the partnership being announced on Tuesday, in which Intel will provide specialized computer chips to Delphi, an auto supplier, and Mobileye, an Israeli company that specializes in vision systems that have been used in some of the autonomous-driving systems made by Tesla Motors.Within about two years, Delphi and Mobileye hope to offer automakers a system that can give less expensive cars and trucks the intelligence to drive themselves. At the center will be a package of Mobileye and Intel chips capable of computing about 20 trillion mathematical operations a second, Glen DeVos, Delphi\u2019s vice president of engineering and services, said in an interview on Monday.A later version of the system, he said, will aim to have two to three times that processing power.\u201cTo be able to do all the computation you need for a fully automated vehicle, you can almost never have too much processing power,\u201d he said.An Intel spokeswoman confirmed the partnership. She said Delphi and Mobileye would begin using the Core i7 Intel chip, and later would use a more powerful and unnamed processor to be unveiled in a few weeks.The partnership is the latest by Intel in its bid to muscle into the rapidly expanding automotive chip business. Nvidia, Qualcomm and a few other companies are ahead of Intel, which once dominated the personal computer business but has struggled to duplicate that success in other areas, including mobile devices and automobiles.Intel announced this month that it would invest $250 million in start-ups working on automated-driving technologies. In July it formed a partnership with Mobileye and the German automaker BMW to provide chips for a self-driving car that BMW intends to begin producing by 2021.\u201cIntel is looking to get into the automotive space because the demand for processing power in cars is going to skyrocket,\u201d said Michael Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner Group who follows automated driving trends.According to Gartner, the automotive semiconductor business generated revenue of nearly $30 billion in 2015, up from nearly $15 billion in 2003.Specialized chips are one of the essential technologies needed to make self-driving cars a reality. To perform safely and competently, autonomous vehicles need radar to detect obstacles, cameras to identify pedestrians and the color of traffic lights, highly detailed 3-D maps to determine the vehicle\u2019s precise position and superfast computer brains to pull all of this information into split-second decisions.\u201cYou\u2019re taking in vast amounts of visual data, and you have to process it really fast, with no delay,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said. \u201cIt all has to happen in real time.\u201dIntel faces formidable competition. Nvidia makes a processing unit that Audi is putting into its newest models, and another that Tesla has just started using its cars.The Nvidia device used by Tesla, called the Drive PX 2, can compute 24 trillion operations a second. Nvidia recently demonstrated a more powerful version called Xavier.\u201cIntel is a very powerful company,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, Nvidia\u2019s senior directive of automotive technology. \u201cBut they are coming late to the game. We have been in this space a long time already.\u201dMr. DeVos said Delphi chose to work with Intel because the chip maker had a plan to produce increasingly powerful automotive processors, and the scale to make the system affordable for mainstream cars.\u201cIt\u2019s all about getting to mass production,\u201d he said.Delphi is using its own radar technology and Mobileye\u2019s image processing system, with self-driving algorithms developed by Ottomatika, a company spun off from Carnegie Mellon University.Ottomatika, which Delphi acquired last year, is a source for many of the basic technologies used in autonomous vehicles.An article on Tuesday about technology companies\u2019 role in developing self-driving vehicles misstated the number of operations per second that Nvidia\u2019s Drive PX2 can compute. It is 24 trillion operations a second, not 24 million.Advertisement"}

Out in the parking lot, Pal Valsgard wore a milder expression\u2014 a trace of impatience \u2014 as he gazed at his electric car.He brushed away raindrops. Minutes ticked by as he waited by a green kiosk for the car to take a big gulp of power.Mr. Valsgard was no technophile, just an English teacher trying to get his family to the airport for a jaunt to London, and he was running a little late. Nowadays, in this chic capital city, plugging an electric car into a shiny charging station is a routine experience, if a bit time-consuming.Norway, one of the world\u2019s leading oil producers, has become an unlikely proving ground for the proposition that electric cars are ready for prime time. Because of big tax breaks, they have come out of nowhere to seize a third of the new-car market in just five years. Politicians and business leaders from all over the world are trekking to this city to see if the trend is real.Over the summer, leaders of Volkswagen, the German carmaker caught up in an emissions-cheating scandal, visited this very parking lot without fanfare to watch the action at the charging kiosk, announcing weeks later that electrification would be their recovery strategy. The company is promising 20 new models of electric cars by 2020.Norway is a tiny country, just five million people, but the success of electric cars here is bringing a big question into focus. Could the world\u2019s transportation system be on the verge of a disruption, one that could slow the growth of oil demand and eventually reverse it?That question is not just profound, it is urgent. Nations have pledged to fight global warming, which means sharply paring emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by midcentury, just over three decades away.If that is to be achieved, some studies suggest, there will be no place for cars burning gasoline or diesel. They will have to run on electricity, or possibly another alternative fuel, and the electric system itself will have to become much cleaner.The studies suggest that electric cars must begin to take the majority of the world\u2019s new-car market in the 2030s, becoming the default choice for most families. Leading oil companies and oil-producing states \u2014 Norway excepted \u2014 have been vocal in arguing that it will not happen.As a business strategy, in other words, the big oil companies are counting on political leaders failing to meet their stated goals for limiting climate change. The stock market seems to be betting with the oil companies.But out on the roads of several countries, things are getting interesting.They are getting so interesting, in fact, that several countries \u2014 including Norway, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 are talking, however tentatively, about the possibility of banning the sale of new fuel-burning cars. If enacted, such bans would likely not take effect until 2030.That fast growth is occurring from a tiny base, though, and the cars still represent far less than 1 percent of all cars on the road. Still, if such rapid growth were to continue, it is not hard to see how the cars could become a disruptive force within a few years. \u201cThese technology disruptions seem like they are not going to happen at all, and then they happen so fast you can\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Rami Syvari, head of international sales for Fortum Charge & Drive, which is racing to install car chargers in Norway.Owners of electric cars, even as they acknowledge some problems and a bit of a learning curve, tend to gush with enthusiasm, saying the cars are inherently cleaner, mechanically simpler, easier to maintain and more fun to drive than fuel-burning cars.The vehicles have one huge problem, though: the battery that makes them possible. The limitations of available battery technology mean that the range of the cars has been limited, typically to less than 100 miles, or 160 kilometers.But as the market grows, innovation in batteries seems to be taking off. Economies of scale are kicking in. A wave of new cars is coming over the next couple of years, with the manufacturers promising big improvements.For instance, General Motors is on the verge of shipping the Bolt, a sporty-looking hatchback with a promised range of 238 miles. That is four solid hours of highway driving.The new cars are expected to cost below $40,000, or 36,000 euros, and in the United States, federal and state tax credits for electric cars will in many places push that below $30,000. Leases are expected to be available at $200 a month, and electricity in most places is far cheaper than an equivalent amount of gasoline.But things are moving fast enough that the possibility of a real disruption can no longer be dismissed out of hand.\u201cIn an extreme scenario where electric cars gained a 50 percent market share over 10 years, about a quarter of European gasoline demand could disappear,\u201d Fitch analysts said in the report.In the United States and abroad, there are signs that a significant fraction of the public wants to give the cars a try.Still, the hurdles for electric cars are enormous. Even if the cars improve as rapidly as the manufacturers are promising, large countries like the United States still have work to do to make them a practical option.At the top of this trouble list is the chicken-or-egg problem of chargers. Because not enough people own electric cars, not enough public charging stations have been installed, which discourages people from buying the cars.But Norway is battling its way out of this problem, with public money as well as heavy private investment going to put up fast charging stations the length and breadth of the country. California is making headway, too. New York is about to make a serious push on electric cars and chargers, and Massachusetts is already doing so.In Norway, as elsewhere, the people already buying electric cars tend to have garages where they can charge at night. That usually gives them enough range for daily commuting. The problem is long trips, and the answer is fast chargers that can inject 50 or 100 miles\u2019 worth of electricity in under 30 minutes.It definitely takes longer than gassing up a regular car would. The drivers say you get used to that. The time required is about what you would need to stop for a leisurely coffee, or perhaps a fast-food meal. In Norway, this has not been lost on McDonald\u2019s.The company is offering its parking lots for the installation of charging kiosks, drawing a high-end clientele into the restaurants. \u201cIt\u2019s fast food and a fast charge,\u201d said Jan Haugen Ihle, the Norway manager for Fortum Charge & Drive, the company installing the big green kiosks.It was at one of those kiosks the other day, outside the Munch Museum in a district called Toyengata, that the English teacher, Mr. Valsgard, was topping up his battery. Earlier, he had stopped by a McDonald\u2019s to charge up, only to find the charger broken.This sort of thing has been a problem, Mr. Ihle acknowledged. As electric car sales zoom in Norway, the chargers are in such heavy use that some of them do not stand up to the wear and tear. His firm has been pressing its suppliers to upgrade to heavy-duty components.The charging delay accounted for Mr. Valsgard\u2019s anxiety, as he was rushing to pick up his family and catch a flight. But afterward, by email, he reported good news. \u201cI made it to the airport, and everything went fine,\u201d he wrote.For drivers like him, the interest in electric cars in Norway has been driven by big tax breaks, along with lots of small perquisites, like free tolls and the ability to use reserved freeway lanes. In countries with the fastest increase of electric cars, the tax breaks are about $15,000 per car.The United States is not so generous, offering a $7,500 federal credit, but states like California are adding to that, so that the total incentives in some places are around $10,000 per car.The need for the breaks would likely be temporary, given the rapid drop in battery costs. And as word starts to spread, people get enthusiastic about the cars. That has certainly been the experience of Ms. Skauge, the owner of the driving school here.\u201cI have to tell you that four of my pupils, they have bought the same car after driving our Nissan Leaf,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working as a driving teacher for 20 years, and I\u2019ve never seen this kind of interest in a car.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Vehicle\u2019s Sound System Can Be a Matter of Life and Death", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byAdjusting the acoustics of modern automobiles is not only about comfort or pizazz. There are safety considerations, too.Advanced driver-assistance features like lane departure warnings, automated braking systems and vehicle or pedestrian proximity alerts generate their own bells and chimes. But such sonic alerts can create dangerous distractions, leaving drivers unable to determine which sounds are critical.\u201cWe spend a lot of time tuning those beeps and pings and assessing the quality of the chimes,\u201d said Alan Norton, senior technical leader for audio quality at Ford Motor.Electric vehicles, with their virtually silent motors, present a separate set of challenges. Especially at low speeds, an electric vehicle provides no audible sounds that might alert pedestrians, cyclists or other drivers to the car\u2019s presence.\u201cNormally, you expect to hear a car coming,\u201d said Grant Courville, a senior director at the software company QNX.And so, for several years, designers of electric vehicles have experimented with added sounds called external pedestrian alerts that would warn those nearby that a car was approaching.The electric Nissan Leaf uses such a system, aptly named the Approaching Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians. It is set off automatically at speeds below 16 miles per hour, emitting a noise from a speaker in the front of the car that sounds like a muted version of a Harrier jet taking off.At 19 m.p.h., the Leaf\u2019s wheels generate enough noise to turn pedestrians\u2019 heads, so the speaker shuts off. (In reverse, the Leaf sounds like something from a \u201cStar Trek\u201d fan\u2019s garage, emitting a phasers-on-stun sound effect.)As yet, though, there is no industry standard for electric vehicle warnings, which is why many electric cars \u2014 including the Tesla Model S \u2014 do not have them.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been instructed by its parent, the Department of Transportation, to develop a rule for such pedestrian safety sounds. But the agency has several times postponed putting such a rule into effect.One difficulty, audio engineers say, is that lower-frequency sounds, which travel farther at lower volumes, lack the kind of directionality that could tell someone stepping off a curb where a car was coming from. Conversely, higher frequency sounds tell listeners where the sound is coming from but require more volume to alert people that a car is headed their way.Within vehicles, meanwhile, audio programmers continue to work on systems to reduce potentially hazardous sonic distractions. In sport utility vehicles with three rows of seats, for example, it can be difficult for a driver to talk to someone in the very back.\u201cYou\u2019re probably tempted to turn around and take your eyes off the road,\u201d Mr. Courville said.So QNX has developed a system that detects when the driver is speaking, and it uses a nearby microphone to pick up his or her words and send them through the rear speakers.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to yell for in-car communications,\u201d Mr. Courville said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teslas in the Trailer Park: A California City Faces Its Housing Squeeze", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byThe town of Mountain View, Google\u2019s home, wants to do something about that. Given new marching orders from a reform-minded City Council that was swept into office here two years ago, Mountain View is looking to increase its housing stock by as much as 50 percent \u2014 including as many as 10,000 units in the area around Google\u2019s main campus.\u201cWe need to provide housing because there\u2019s a housing shortage,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a Mountain View councilman. That may seem an obvious tautology, but it turns out to be highly contentious in a state where most cities and suburbs are still dominated by anti-growth politics that seek to maximize the construction of tax-generating offices while minimizing the number of budget-depleting residents.Mountain View\u2019s political evolution, combined with some limited cases elsewhere, suggests that as rent and home prices have reached the point where even highly paid tech workers are struggling \u2014 the median home here costs $1.4 million, according to Zillow \u2014 the tide is slowly shifting away from resisting growth at all costs and instead trying to channel it.This Silicon Valley city of about 80,000 people is also a reminder that, despite the outsize attention given to big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, any solution to California\u2019s housing crisis is going to rely heavily on suburbs as well.This was underscored by the results of last week\u2019s election, when voters across California passed various affordable housing measures along with new transit funding, and, in some cases, rejected efforts to restrict or cap development. In Palo Alto, several pro-housing candidates were elected to the City Council. Residents in Mountain View approved rent control.\u201cHousing used to be about \u2018them\u2019 \u2014 like poverty or unemployment,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cBut it has become so expensive in the Bay Area that housing now touches enough people to win elections.\u201dMany employees say they would prefer to live closer to work. But these companies reside in small cities that consider themselves suburbs, and the local politics are usually aligned against building dense urban apartments to house them.Take Palo Alto, the Silicon Valley city that has become emblematic of the state\u2019s reputation for rampant not-in-my-backyard politics. Palo Alto has one of the state\u2019s worst housing shortages. With about three jobs for every housing unit, it has among the most out-of-balance mixes anywhere in Silicon Valley.But instead of dealing with this issue by building the few thousand or so apartments it would take to make a dent in the problem, the city has mostly looked to restraining a pace of job growth that the mayor described as \u201cunhealthy.\u201dFarther up the peninsula near San Francisco, the small city of Brisbane told a developer that its proposal for a mixed-use development with offices and 4,000 housing units should have offices for about 15,000 workers, but no new housing.Play that out a thousand times over and the crux of the state\u2019s housing crisis is clear: Everyone knows housing costs are unsustainable and unfair, and that they pose a threat to the state\u2019s economy. Yet every city seems to be counting on its neighbors to step up and fix it.The results are strange compromises like the one made by Rebecca and Steven Callister, a couple in their late 20s who live in a double-wide trailer in a Mountain View mobile home park whose residents are retirees and young tech workers.Mr. Callister is an engineer at LinkedIn, the sort of worker who, in most places, would own a home. But given the cost of housing in Mountain View and the brutal commute times from anywhere they could afford, a trailer makes the most sense and lets him spend more time with the couple\u2019s two young children.\u201cWe joke that it\u2019s the only mobile home park with Mercedeses and Teslas in the driveway,\u201d Mrs. Callister said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the new middle class in California.\u201dIn contrast to Palo Alto, Mountain View is trying to wedge new apartments into its office parks. Much of the action centers on the North Bayshore area, a neighborhood of low-slung office buildings surrounded by asphalt parking lots.Each weekday morning, North Bayshore fills up with cars and young Google employees. They pack the narrow sidewalks and zip around on multicolored bikes. But then the day ends, everyone goes home and there is not much left besides sounds from the nearby freeway and overachievers working late.Mr. Siegel, the city councilman, wants to turn this prototypical example of sprawl into a bustling urban neighborhood. The city has plans for nearly 10,000 new apartments and hopes that businesses like a grocery store, bars and retail shops will follow them.Here in Mountain View, as in many places, residents are mostly aligned against putting too many apartments near the city\u2019s core single-family-home neighborhoods. The city is looking to create new neighborhoods by pushing growth to areas like North Bayshore, where there are already a lot of jobs and few neighbors to complain.Versions of that strategy are taking hold across the Bay Area.Sunnyvale, where Yahoo is based, is looking to transform an older industrial area near one of its rail stations into a new development that would include offices and housing. Menlo Park is studying how to allow for up to 4,500 housing units to be built on industrial land near Facebook\u2019s headquarters.Chris Meany, a partner at Wilson Meany, a real estate development firm in San Francisco, recently headed up a project in San Mateo, about a half-hour south of San Francisco. There, a defunct horse-racing track is being redeveloped into a mixed-use project that sits along a train stop and will eventually comprise five office buildings and 1,000 houses, apartments and condos.Given the political resistance to new housing and the cascade of lawsuits that are a good bet to follow any new proposal, Mr. Meany said he and other developers were more likely to focus on mega-projects with a bigger payoff.\u201cA planner would go out and say, \u2018We should do things regionally and scatter housing throughout the area,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the developer who has to actually get it done, it is better to go off and find large areas of problematic land than trying to choose the smartest location.\u201dNorth Bayshore was historically farmland and the site of the city dump, but in the 1970s, when tech first started booming, Mountain View looked to develop it into a low-density office park.The area has since become a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s booms and busts. Early tenants included faded giants like Silicon Graphics. Then came the 1990s and the dot-com boom and bust.In 1999, just before the bust hit, a little start-up named Google moved from Palo Alto to North Bayshore when it had only a few dozen employees. Today, Google has about 20,000 workers here, and the crush of daily commuters leads to long backups at the three freeway exits into the area.Four years ago \u2014 as Google was swelling, rents were exploding and eviction stories were becoming commonplace \u2014 Mountain View started looking to redevelop North Bayshore. The acrimonious debate over whether to add housing included both predictions that the neighborhood would fill up with the tech equivalent of Chinese factory dorms and worries that residents would disturb a habitat for local burrowing owls.Since then the Council has approved about 2,000 new units elsewhere in town. In all, Mountain View is studying how to add a total of 17,000 units. Mr. Siegel said developers submitted more proposals for housing than the city could process, so the town was looking to hire more planners.There are plenty of desks and a budget to pay them, but few want to take the job.\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.Advertisement"}

Instead, the bank negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement.Since becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in January, Neel Kashkari has repeatedly sounded the warning about American banks, saying that they were still too big to fail even after the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.In a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, he said his plan would require banks with $250 billion or more in assets to issue common equity of 23.5 percent, up from 13 percent required under current rules.Long-term debt would not be allowed to be counted as part of that cushion because history showed it was not a foolproof buffer to losses, Mr. Kashkari said.The plan would be likely to prompt banks to break apart because of the high cost of holding so much capital.Many in the banking industry say that the plan will go nowhere. However, these days few people can say with any certainty what policies President-elect Donald J. Trump will ultimately adopt.As part of Goldman Sachs\u2019s push into consumer lending, the bank wants Americans to know that debt happens.The 15- and 30-second video ads, which will appear on Facebook, Hulu, Pandora and YouTube, depict debt as an unavoidable nuisance of modern life, not something shameful. \u201cDebt happens.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Style Puts Gloss on Tesla\u2019s Bid for SolarCity", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe deal is about as conflicted as they come. Elon Musk owns large interests in both companies and had the idea for SolarCity, which is led by his cousin. Mr. Musk is also chief executive and chairman of Tesla and is chairman of SolarCity.Incestuous ties like these are not uncommon in Silicon Valley. Yet SolarCity is struggling. Its stock price has declined by more than two-thirds since early 2015 and its revenue is down as solar takes a beating from low oil prices.Given the context and the initial bumbling of the process, it is understandable why some thought that Mr. Musk\u2019s interest in SolarCity was a way to bail out his investment.The initial market reaction when the offer was announced in June indicated as much. Tesla\u2019s stock price declined more than 12 percent in the wake of the possible bid.After the decline in Tesla\u2019s stock price and the criticism of the conflicts, one might have thought that the merger was as dead as pets.com.But a good narrative in Silicon Valley means everything, and Mr. Musk has long played the role of visionary to great effect. He put this to good use in the last few months to shine up this deal.Lawyers were brought in to tidy up the process. SolarCity shopped itself around but found no other buyers \u2014 who else would buy when Mr. Musk had so ardently expressed his desire to acquire a company of which he already owned a fifth?Most important, Mr. Musk amped up his vision.In capital markets today, conglomerates are hated and companies are carved and diced to the finest business. But not Tesla.Tesla has been portrayed as a car company and a battery company, but now Mr. Musk\u2019s vision has turned Tesla into an integrated solar company with SolarCity the crucial missing piece. Well-heeled consumers would get their car from Tesla, as well as their home battery storage and solar from SolarCity to power it all.The strategy appears to be working.The influential proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, has endorsed the merger. \u201cThe transaction is a necessary step toward TSLA\u2019s goal of being an integrated sustainable energy company,\u201d I.S.S. wrote, using Tesla\u2019s stock market ticker symbol.In addition, the advisory service cited the low premium and the fact that Tesla, a $30 billion company, could probably handle SolarCity\u2019s $3.1 billion in debt with the ability to raise more needed capital in the markets.Then there are the structural biases for a deal. The shareholders of Tesla are largely also invested in SolarCity. Mr. Musk owns 21.7 percent of SolarCity and 20.1 percent of Tesla. But the second-biggest shareholder of each is the mutual fund giant Fidelity, which owns 8.9 percent of Tesla and 11.6 percent of SolarCity. Vanguard, BlackRock and Bank of Montreal are in the top 10 shareholders of each.Theoretically, these institutional investors are supposed to look at each investment separately, but a bailout of SolarCity by Tesla might be in their best interest. Certainly, the voting dynamics work in Tesla\u2019s favor.But the biggest spur pushing this deal toward success may be the willingness to believe in the Silicon Valley magic.Take the I.S.S. report. It cited three reasons for the deal. Ultimately, it came down to what the advisory service said was that vision of an integrated solar company.Really? Would any other industry get this pass? Let me answer that: No. The simple truth is that Silicon Valley visionaries are given freedom no other chief executive would. To put it another way, there is a Musk pass (as well as a Zuckerberg pass and a Brin and Page pass). (Glass Lewis, the other large proxy advisory service, refused to give Mr. Musk his pass, calling for a vote against the deal because of the conflicts.)But how could you not bet on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision?Because of this last fact, I fully expect this deal to happen. Perhaps this is to be admired. Too often, institutional investors play it too safe. Now, public shareholders can profit from some risk-taking instead of leaving it all to the venture capitalists.Still, questions persist about the business model of the combined company. The solar market is saturated and limited to people with the cash to buy panels. This is why financing is such an important part of the equation. And are there legions of potential customers willing to spring tens of thousands of dollars for terra cotta glass solar shingles?There is great risk here, as well as possibly great rewards. In most cases, institutional shareholders would pass on the deal solely because of the risk, let alone the conflicts and conglomerate issues. And it raises the question of whether Silicon Valley should, alone among other industries, have a special pass to make deals that no company in any other industry could.Even institutional shareholders seem to lose their heads when it comes to Silicon Valley.An earlier version of this article misstated Tesla Motors\u2019 position on fund-raising. While the company has said it may need to raise funds in the future, it said last month that it had no need to do so now.Advertisement"}

His approach to wealth harks back to the days of \u201cDynasty,\u201d DeLoreans and deficits, when the rich were admired and a former actor-turned-president restored America\u2019s optimism and global muscle.The wealthy are already partying like it\u2019s 1989.

All that is missing now is Robin Leach\u2019s \u201cChampagne wishes and caviar dreams.\u201d And Mr. Leach is optimistic.\u201cIn the next four years, it will be O.K. to be rich again,\u201d said Mr. Leach, whose hit TV show \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\u201d helped define \u201980s aspirations. \u201cThe cars will get bigger, the houses will be more luxurious, and it will be O.K. to wear jewelry and gowns again.\u201dOf course, times have changed since Gordon Gekko said that \u201cgreed, for lack of a better word, is good.\u201d In a post-Thomas Piketty world where even traditional Republicans warn about the wealth gap and the effects of globalization and technology, Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201980s blueprint may prove as outdated as shoulder pads and the Cold War. His rewards for those at the top are likely to make inequality even wider and could draw criticism from the populist voters who helped elect him.Still, Mr. Trump remains a creature of the decade that made him famous. Take his tax plan. He has proposed cutting the top rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent, cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, trimming the capital gains tax and eliminating the estate tax. These would be the largest tax cuts for the wealthy since the Reagan reductions of 1986.According to the Tax Policy Center, the after-tax incomes of middle-class and lower-income taxpayers would grow less than 2 percent under the Trump plan. The incomes of the top 1 percent of earners, by contrast, would soar about 14 percent.Put another way, nearly half of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent \u2014 recalling Reagan\u2019s trickle-down theory: Money at the top will flow down to those at the bottom.\u201cThe question is: In this economy, will that actually happen?\u201d said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Mr. Trump, of course, has invited the Reagan comparisons, borrowing Reagan\u2019s 1980 slogan \u201cLet\u2019s make America great again.\u201d And like Reagan, his combination of tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending by government could lead to higher deficits.Yet for now, Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is ushering in an \u201980s-like euphoria among the rich. Since the election, stocks have reached record highs. Strong art sales this month at Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips brought in a total of more than $1 billion. Christie\u2019s sold a de Kooning for $66.3 million (well over its estimate of $40 million) and a favorite of \u201980s collectors, a Monet, for $81.4 million.High-end real estate, which was in a slump, is also poised for growth now that a real estate developer will be in the White House.Sales of luxury goods are rising, after a slowdown in China and less conspicuous consumption put a damper on them last year. An executive with Net-a-Porter, the high-end fashion company, cited Mr. Trump\u2019s wife in the 1980s \u2014 Ivana \u2014 as a \u201ckey inspiration\u201d for some of the fall fashion lines, which emphasize \u201chard-edged, power-shoulder jackets,\u201d bouffant hair and bright lipstick.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s celebratory election dinner was an \u201980s throwback moment. Rather than heading to Maialino, Le Bernardin or any of the current power restaurants, Mr. Trump and his family opted for the \u201c21\u201d Club, a favorite haunt of the celebrities and power brokers in the 1970s and \u201980s. As he told the wealthy crowd at the restaurant, \u201cWe\u2019ll get your taxes down. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump is reluctant to give up his ultimate homage to the \u201980s: his apartment. The three-story penthouse in Trump Tower is filled with gold, marble, Greek gods painted on the ceiling and pillows embroidered with the Trump family \u201ccoat of arms.\u201d For a man who once said, \u201cPart of the beauty of me is that I am very rich,\u201d it is no wonder he is having second thoughts about leaving his Versailles in the sky for public housing on Pennsylvania Avenue.Mr. Trump\u2019s flash and dazzle stand in stark contrast to the new culture of wealth. In the \u201980s, success meant excess, bigger was better, and wealth was meant for display. Today\u2019s wealth culture, by contrast, is all about staying under the radar \u2014 jeans and sneakers instead of suits, whitewall minimalism rather than gold, and a Tesla in the garage, not a Rolls. They prefer the attention of signing the Giving Pledge to buying a megayacht.The question is whether Mr. Trump, leading by example, will make wealth glamorous again \u2014 and bring back the days of Champagne wishes and caviar dreams.\u201cThe funny thing is, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t even drink Champagne or any alcohol,\u201d Mr. Leach said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t eat caviar.\u201dROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Bid for SolarCity Gets Support From Shareholder Adviser", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Investors who are betting that Tesla Motors\u2019 bid to buy the solar panel company SolarCity will succeed received encouragement on Friday after an influential shareholder adviser blessed the union of the two.The advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, said Tesla shareholders should back the deal on three counts. The first is that buying SolarCity would help Elon Musk turn Tesla into a green energy company whose products would run from solar panels to electric cars.I.S.S.\u2019s second rationale is that the estimated $150 million in cost savings that would arise from a merger of the two could eventually yield $1.5 billion when capitalized, taking care of two-thirds of the purchase price.The last is a starker calculation of dollars and cents: Tesla would be buying SolarCity at a cheap price.Tesla has offered to pay 0.11 of a newly issued share in itself for each share of SolarCity, a bid valued at $20.99 as of Friday afternoon. That is lower than where SolarCity was trading this summer when Mr. Musk announced his deal intentions.Mr. Musk has said that putting the two together is a \u201cno-brainer\u201d from a strategic standpoint. But critics have argued that the deal amounts to a bailout of SolarCity, whose fortunes and stock price have declined as the company has run up $3.1 billion in debt to support its business. Investors have also become pessimistic about the fate of independent solar companies. Competitors like SunEdison have filed for bankruptcy.I.S.S. said Tesla, as a $30 billion company with no debt, should be able to support its corporate sibling, though at a potentially high financing cost.The backing of I.S.S. could prove important to swaying Tesla shareholders, because the firm\u2019s recommendations carry great weight among the big mutual funds that make up the electric carmaker\u2019s independent shareholders.It has always been assumed that SolarCity shareholders would back the deal, especially because advisers to the solar company\u2019s independent directors tried and failed to solicit serious competing bids.Shares of SolarCity rose 8.8 percent on Friday to close at $20.18. Shares of Tesla rose 1.7 percent to close at $190.56.Advertisement"}
