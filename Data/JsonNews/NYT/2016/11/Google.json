{"Headline": "Trying Snap\u2019s Spectacles: Live With the Look, Enjoy the View", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported bySpectacles, the first hardware product released by the company that makes the popular photo-messaging app Snapchat, are large, whimsically goofy sunglasses with a camera embedded in the frame.It takes some courage to put them on. But I did so anyway \u2014 and I\u2019m glad I did.The greater likelihood is that you\u2019ll come off as if you\u2019re trying too hard, especially if you\u2019ve got the red or teal Specs. (They also come in a more staid black.) It\u2019s possible members of your family will laugh every time you look in their direction, that your spouse will openly question your maturity and sanity, and your offspring will threaten to disown you. What I\u2019m saying is, it takes a certain personality to pull these off, and your humble-nerd correspondent may not be in possession of said style.But ignore the haters. Whatever your head shape, if you are lucky enough to find some Spectacles this season, you will be getting your eyes behind one of the most compelling new gadgets to be released by a major technology company in years.But Spectacles are worth the titters and strange looks. For a first-generation piece of hardware, these glasses are remarkably well designed, thoroughly useful and completely fun. More than that, they may be lighting the way to a future in which you might finally pull your face away from your phone when anything interesting happens around you.I won\u2019t spend much time detailing how Spectacles work because there isn\u2019t much to say. Like any sunglasses, you slide them over your face when you go outside. When you see something interesting, tap the button near your left temple to snap a 10-second video of the scene. (A small light shines while you\u2019re recording, to prevent spying.) Later on, look at Snapchat on your phone to view, share, caption, draw on or otherwise edit the clips you\u2019ve captured from your Specs.If you aren\u2019t a regular Snapchat user, these glasses are probably not for you, but it is possible to export the videos you capture to your phone\u2019s camera roll. The video quality isn\u2019t spectacular, but it\u2019s surprisingly good; in well-lit areas (which are the main places you\u2019ll be wearing sunglasses) your videos will be nearly as good as those you shoot with your phone.In other ways, Spectacles surpass any phone. Over the last decade, smartphone cameras have intruded upon every corner of life. This has been magical \u2014 I have fantastic pictures of my family that I\u2019d never have captured without my phone \u2014 but it also creates an uncomfortable distance. My children\u2019s primary memory of me is of my face staring at them through a five-inch piece of glass.Spectacles collapse that distance. You can snap a memorable moment without ever leaving the moment. Your eyes are your viewfinder; just reach up and tap, and whatever you look at is recorded.It\u2019s not just that Specs let you remain in the moment. When you play back what you captured from the glasses, you return to the moment more easily. The images I snapped with my Specs over Thanksgiving weekend are deeper, more real and more emotionally evocative than most other snapshots I usually shoot.I think this has to do with point of view. When you take a picture with a camera, you are usually cropping an ideal shot that bears little resemblance to what you actually saw. But Specs don\u2019t idealize the present. Because you just shoot what you see, the images seem to jog deeper memories about what happened when you were there. It\u2019s a trippy sensation, and one I couldn\u2019t resist.There are other thoughtful details in Specs. When you\u2019re just out shooting, they don\u2019t need your phone nearby to work. They come with a charging case made of delightfully tactile, grippy material (you can shoot about 100 clips per charge). And the lenses are mirrored, so you can see yourself when you turn the Specs around for selfies.Mostly, though, I was surprised by the degree of finish from a new gadget. From the Apple Watch to the Oculus Rift, a lot of new hardware released in the last couple of years has failed to deliver on its early hype. Spectacles are different. They\u2019re real, and they\u2019re spectacular.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Agrees to Pay Royalties, Ending German Music Dispute", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 For years, YouTube users in Germany have searched for music videos on the online streaming service, only to be confronted with one of the most hated icons on the internet here: a small red TV-shaped symbol informing them they were unable to view the video.On Tuesday, the long-running dispute over royalties between YouTube and Germany\u2019s main music rights organization that set off the error message finally came to an end.Neither side published the details of the agreement.\u201cWe remained true to our position that authors should also get a fair remuneration in the digital age, despite the resistance we met,\u201d Harald Heker, GEMA\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. He added that the agreement covered future royalties, as well as those accrued over the last seven years.The dispute has played out in a series of court cases.In 2012, a Hamburg court ordered Google, YouTube\u2019s owner, to install filters to detect and stop people from watching material to which the internet conglomerate did not own the rights, or face a fine of 250,000 euros, or about $275,000.In January, however, a Munich court ruled against GEMA, which was seeking \u20ac1.6 million in damages over a selection of music that was to be compensated with 0.375 euro cents each time a song was played.Under the deal announced on Tuesday, both sides have agreed to drop all pending court cases.Germany\u2019s justice minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the agreement as a \u201cgreat step forward\u201d in attempts to hold internet providers such as Google, Facebook and Twitter accountable for the content they distribute.\u201cI think it is great that there is finally an agreement between YouTube and GEMA that effectively involves nothing more than consenting to compensate artists whose videos are shown\u201d on the platform, in keeping with German copyright law, Mr. Maas told reporters.Unlike in the United States, where copyright law protects sites like YouTube that host copyrighted material posted by users, in Germany they are considered to be digital forms of traditional companies and, as such, are equally beholden to laws that exist for publishers or music providers.Across Europe, regional authorities are considering giving newspaper and magazine publishers the right to charge Google and others when content is used on so-called news aggregation sites like Google News. The plans are under discussion and will not come into force until 2018, at the earliest.They also may lead to online video services having to pay more to music rights holders when their content is viewed online.European officials and some industry groups say the changes are required to give publishers and music labels greater control over their copyrighted material, though many American tech giants say the proposals go too far and will probably hamper innovation and investment.Mark Scott contributed reporting from RomeAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hulu Adds ESPN, ABC and Fox News to Streaming Service", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byHulu\u2019s new so-called skinny bundle is beginning to take shape.Hulu has signed deals that will make networks like ABC, ESPN and Fox News a part of its forthcoming live streaming service, the company announced on Tuesday.Through the deal, 21st Century Fox\u2019s and Disney\u2019s collection of broadcast and cable channels \u2014 both companies are part owners of Hulu \u2014 will join the new service. Hulu previously made a deal with Time Warner, which owns channels like TNT, TBS and CNN, and is also an owner. Hulu\u2019s fourth owner, Comcast, which has a vast array of cable channels through NBCUniversal like USA, Bravo and E, has not reached an agreement to join the service.The live service is expected to make its debut in early 2017, and though Hulu has not said exactly how much it would cost, media executives have said that it may be around $40 a month.Hulu\u2019s live offering will be the latest cheaper and slimmer television package at a time when more people are canceling traditional \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 cable subscriptions. Other skinny bundles include SlingTV, which goes for about $20 a month, and PlayStation Vue, which goes for about $40 a month.YouTube, owned by Google, is also expected to introduce a streaming service, which will begin early next year.Two weeks ago, Google signed CBS onto the service, according to two people familiar with the deal. The service is looking at a starting price of $25 to $40 a month, those people said.Hulu\u2019s new package also aims to attract more subscribers as it faces slowing growth. Hulu has 12 million subscribers, which is dwarfed by Netflix\u2019s 47 million domestic subscribers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Media\u2019s Next Challenge: Overcoming the Threat of Fake News", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byMediatorNo doubt about it: Campaign 2016 has been a smash hit.And to the news media have gone the spoils. With Mr. Trump providing must-see TV theatrics, cable news has drawn record audiences. Newspapers have reached online readership highs that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.On Wednesday comes the reckoning.Taken together, it means another rapid depletion in the nation\u2019s ranks of traditionally trained journalists whose main mission is to root out corruption, hold the powerful accountable and sort fact from fiction for voters.It couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse moment in American public life. The internet-borne forces that are eating away at print advertising are enabling a host of faux-journalistic players to pollute the democracy with dangerously fake news items.That contraction in the reporting corps, combined with the success of disinformation this year, is making for some sleepless nights for those in Washington who will have to govern in this bifurcated, real-news-fake-news environment.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest crisis facing our democracy, the failing business model of real journalism,\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a longtime critic of fake news, told me on Saturday.Ms. McCaskill said that \u201cjournalism is partly to blame\u201d for being slow to adjust as the internet turned its business model upside down and social media opened the competitive floodgates. \u201cFake news got way out ahead of them,\u201d she said.It does not augur well for the future. Martin Baron, the Washington Post executive editor, said when we spoke last week, \u201cIf you have a society where people can\u2019t agree on basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?\u201dThe cure for fake journalism is an overwhelming dose of good journalism. And how well the news media gets through its postelection hangover will have a lot to do with how the next chapter in the American political story is told.That\u2019s why the dire financial reports from American newsrooms are so troubling. If the national reporting corps is going to be reduced even more during such an election-driven readership boom, what are things going to look like when the circus leaves town?I surveyed the higher precincts of the industry last week, and what I found wasn\u2019t entirely gloomy; there was even some cause for optimism. But there\u2019s going to be a lot of nail-biting and some bloodletting on the way to deliverance.It\u2019s pretty much taken as a given that the news audience will largely shrink next year, despite what is expected to be a compelling news environment.\u201cIs anything in 2017, politically speaking, going to be as sexy as it was in 2016? I\u2019m not going to play poker at that table,\u201d Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, told me on Friday.Still, though he\u2019s predicting a ratings fall of 30 percent or perhaps \u201cmuch more\u201d at MSNBC, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have financial pressure on my bottom line.\u201dThat\u2019s not only because MSNBC and its competitors earned tens of millions of unexpected election-related dollars this year, but also because they still draw substantial income from cable subscriber fees.Mr. Baker of The Journal said he was confident that newspapers could make the transition but acknowledged a rough interim period that will require cuts and will be even harder to navigate or survive for smaller, regional papers (a practical invitation to municipal corruption).The cause for relative optimism comes from the performance of some of the more ambitious, well-reported newspaper articles of the last year.But in this new era, subscriber numbers are more important than fly-by-night readership.\u201cIt shows people are willing to pay for great, original, deeply reported and expert journalism,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said. \u201cThat will allow great journalism to thrive.\u201dIt could be Pollyannaish to think so, but maybe this year\u2019s explosion in fake news will serve to raise the value of real news. If so, it will be great journalism that saves journalism.\u201cPeople will ultimately gravitate toward sources of information that are truly reliable, and have an allegiance to telling the truth,\u201d Mr. Baron said. \u201cPeople will pay for that because they\u2019ll realize they\u2019ll need to have that in our society.\u201dOr don\u2019t. You\u2019ll get what you pay for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protecting Your Digital Life in 9 Easy Steps", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byEditors\u2019 note: This article, originally published in November 2016, was updated May 16, 2017. There are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information.\u201cWhen I use the term \u2018attacker\u2019 I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven\u2019t given express permission to,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a hacker, a corporation or even a government.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended. We added a few of our own, based on additional interviews and news events.Encryption is just a fancy word for scrambling your data so no one can understand what it says without a key. It\u2019s useful for protecting information on your computer, but also for making sure prying eyes can\u2019t snoop on text messages and emails on your phone. But encryption is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around.\u201cYou can be sure by looking at the code that they\u2019re not doing anything weird with your data,\u201d Mr. Larson said.\u201cIn general, the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible,\u201d said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the organization that developed Signal.In May, cybercriminals used ransomware, a type of software that locks down people\u2019s data and threatens to destroy it if the attacker is not paid, to hijack hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.Also, make sure to update your software regularly, particularly your operating system. Frequently, software companies will release updates that patch bugs and vulnerabilities when they are discovered. But outdated or unauthorized copies of the software may still contain the security flaws. This is a particular problem with computers using Microsoft Windows, the most popular operating system in the world and therefore a big target for hackers.Your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket, but Mr. Larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information.Even if your data were password-protected, someone who gained access to your computer \u201cwould have access to all your files if they were unencrypted.\u201dBackups will protect your photos, documents and other data not only from a technical malfunction, but from ransomware and other malicious hacking. Just make sure to test or check your backups periodically.But making up new combinations all the time is irritating and inconvenient, tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple. That is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes. It\u2019s far better to create really strong ones for every login. And new passwords can pose security risks, because it\u2019s hard to remember complex ones, so you are tempted to write them down.That can lead to a lot of hard-to-remember passwords.As far as making passwords up goes: Don\u2019t be precious about it. Use a random word (an object near you, for example), scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks. If you\u2019re writing passwords down or using a password manager, you don\u2019t have to worry about making them memorable.When you turn on two-factor authentication, anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security: a code that is sent to your phone via text message. (Though sadly, not through Signal.)You should also set two-factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites where it\u2019s available. But email is the most important account, since many sites use email for password recovery, a fact that hackers have exploited. Once they have access to your email, they can get access to banking, social media, data backups and work accounts.And this is a good time to note that you should always find out whether the Wi-Fi network you are using is secure. Public networks \u2014 and even private networks without security keys \u2014 often are not.VPNs create an encrypted \u201ctunnel\u201d through which all of your data is sent, meaning other computers or devices on the same network as your computer can\u2019t make sense of it. The only people who have the \u201ckey\u201d in this case is your computer and the VPN provider you connect to when you turn it on. This is especially useful on public Wi-Fi networks, like at the airport or coffee shop, where you don\u2019t know who else is using the same network.This feature, available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, among other browsers, may sound secure, but pay attention to the clear warnings.On Chrome, the second paragraph of the \u201cincognito\u201d home screen spells it out for you.\u201cYou aren\u2019t invisible,\u201d it says. \u201cGoing incognito doesn\u2019t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider or the websites you visit.\u201d In reality, it simply keeps your computer from keeping a record of where you go. It doesn\u2019t stop sites from tracking and collecting data on you, and doesn\u2019t do anything to protect your online privacy or security. It does, however, keep anyone using your computer from knowing where you went.He said, however, that he was not paranoid.\u201cGoogle is built on the hacker ethic, and they have put principle above profits in some aspects,\u201d he said.But he also acknowledged that he meets \u201cpeople all the time who are extremely skeptical of any large software organization, and I think that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d There are trade-offs. Google\u2019s search results are more useful and accurate than competitors\u2019 precisely because of the ways it collects and analyzes information about its customers\u2019 searches.That way, if someone has found a way to compromise your computer, they cannot spy on you.Nicole Perlroth contributed expertise.Advertisement"}

In Part 2, we talked to Amy and Dawn, dear friends and co-workers from Wyoming.All of them had avoided talking about the election, knowing just how difficult the discussion would be. Until now.\u201cWe\u2019re from two different sides of the wall,\u201d Craig\u2019s father says. \u201cThis gay lifestyle and everything \u2014 I didn\u2019t grow up with it.\u201d He describes once, when he was younger, being followed by a man who was trying to pick him up. \u201cI just wanted to beat the hell out of him,\u201d he tells Craig. And then he and his friends caught the guy to do just that.\u201cI\u2019ve come a long way as far as acceptance and tolerance,\u201d he says, reflecting on that past.When the conversation turns to the Confederate flag displayed in his garage, Craig\u2019s father asks what is probably the hardest of the 19 questions: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a sexist or racist?\u201dAfter a pause, Craig answers. \u201cYeah.\u201dHe brings up the derogatory language that his father used when he was a child, which his father acknowledges was a problem and says he\u2019s working to change.\u201cAt the time I was 75/25,\u201d the father says. \u201cNow I\u2019m maybe 60/40.\u201d\u201c60/40 what?\u201d Craig asks.\u201cI guess 40 racist. And 60, you know, O.K. I feel like I\u2019m progressing with it. I feel like I\u2019m trying.\u201d\u201cThis election was different for me,\u201d Amy tells Dawn. \u201cIf, say, John Kasich won, I would be like \u2018Well, you win some you lose some.\u2019 ... I would not have been as upset as I have been, primarily because of some of the behavior that President-elect Trump has exhibited throughout the campaign.\u201d She continues:It disturbed me not only because of my son, but because of other people in the United States who I feel are somewhat marginalized. And it\u2019s so easy, in general \u2014 and it\u2019s human nature \u2014 it\u2019s easy for all of us to say \u2018that\u2019s not me and that\u2019s not going to ever affect me, and so I\u2019m going to look the other way.\u2019\u201cTrump was not my first choice for the candidacy for the presidency,\u201d Dawn says, though she is a Republican and votes Republican. She says she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by \u201cthe way he acts and the way he thinks he can do and say these things, and can get away with it and it\u2019s okay.\u201d But ultimately, she tells Amy, \u201cI had to refocus and reprioritize the reasons I wanted to vote for him. Not that I condone his behaviors, but the other issues were huge for me.\u201d She explains:I worry about our community in general. It is heavily reliant on the oil and the gas and the mining industry, my husband being included in that. For me and my family, I had to think about that. Listening to Hillary\u2019s stance on these things, wanting to put all these coal miners out of business and wanting to put all these regulations on what they\u2019re doing, it stressed me out. This is our way of life.\u201cI\u2019ve heard race more than anything throughout this whole election, throughout this whole year,\u201d Mr. Ponce Landaverde says. \u201cThis whole year is just race. I feel like there needs to be more unity in this country.\u201d He continues:Mr. Hill explained to his friend why, to him, race was a crucial factor in this election, and is a big part of why he is struggling to understand friends who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cA lot of what he has said, it\u2019s disparaging for marginalized people in this country \u2014 African-Americans, Latinos, gay people, women \u2014 it\u2019s disparaging,\u201d Mr. Hill says. \u201cTo a certain extent, voting for Donald Trump after all he said, after all he\u2019s done \u2014 you have to be somewhat comfortable with that in order to cast that vote for that man.\u201d He continues:When I look at people who voted for Donald Trump and I know they know me, that kind of hurt me, man. You had to be cool with some of the stuff that he was saying, or it didn\u2019t bother you. To me I felt like if you knew me, or knew people who were African-American or people who were Latino or people who were gay, people who were Muslim, who worship Muslim faith, that should have rocked you to your core as far as the things he said, and that should have been unacceptable. A large portion of this country didn\u2019t feel that way. In my opinion, I have to look at those people a different way because there\u2019s a question, as an African-American man, would they have my back in a Donald Trump world? Like I said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a racist, Aaron. I don\u2019t. I could never believe you\u2019re a racist, man, that\u2019s silly, that\u2019s stupid.

Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I\u2019ve been working on a book about what\u2019s been happening beneath the surface \u2014 in the plumbing and wiring of the world \u2014 that\u2019s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007?2007? That\u2019s such an innocuous year. But look again.Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you\u2019ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyze enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable both Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, \u201cthe cloud\u201d really took off in 2007.In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson \u2014 the world\u2019s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around \u2026 2007.The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world\u2019s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide.In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it.Why? 2008.Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what the Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our \u201csocial technologies\u201d \u2014 all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst \u2014 froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process.How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power \u2014 in really differentiated ways \u2014 all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas.What one individual or small group can now do \u2014 the power of one \u2014 to make or break things is phenomenal. When President-elect Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at \u201cJeopardy!\u201d or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans.At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas \u2014 think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights \u2014 can suddenly melt away.So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalization and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore\u2019s Law drives more globalization and more globalization drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration.I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn\u2019t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones \u2014 and they are using WhatsApp to organize vast illicit migration networks to get there.So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world \u2014 their community and their job \u2014 are feeling destabilized. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men\u2019s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there\u2019s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas \u2014 but for many others they\u2019ve come faster than they can adapt.That\u2019s why my favorite song these days is Brandi Carlile\u2019s wonderful ballad called \u201cThe Eye,\u201d the main verse of which is: \u201cI wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you\u2019re standing in the eye.\u201dThese accelerations in technology, globalization and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we\u2019re all being asked to dance. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye.For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them \u2014 but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them. More on that another day. This article was adapted from \u201cThank You for Being Late: An Optimist\u2019s Guide to Thriving in The Age of Accelerations,\u201d being published on Tuesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Wants to Be \u2018Comrade.\u2019 For Gay Chinese, That Means Something Else.", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 To the 90 million or so members of China\u2019s Communist Party, President Xi Jinping has a message: Don\u2019t call me president. Don\u2019t call me party secretary.Call me \u201ccomrade.\u201dThere is just one problem. In recent decades, the once ubiquitous term for Communist cadres and leaders has been embraced and popularized by a different group of people: gay men and lesbians.The term \u201ctongzhi,\u201d or \u201ccomrade,\u201d was a nearly universal form of address in China well into the 1980s, but as Mao jackets gave way to Western-style suits and ties, it fell out of favor among Chinese officials.Even Google has caught on. Enter the characters for tongzhi guanxi \u2014 literally \u201ccomrade relationship\u201d\u2014 into its translator, and it gives you \u201cgay relationship.\u201d (Baidu, the dominant Chinese-language search engine, by contrast, offers the literal translation.)Fan Popo, a gay rights activist and filmmaker based in Beijing, said there had been episodes in which Chinese criticized gay rights activists for appropriating the political term.For some younger Chinese, however, the word \u201ccomrade\u201d offered a source of comfort for those who felt too ashamed to use the term \u201ctongxinglian,\u201d or homosexual, Mr. Fan said.\u201cBut now, people have really gotten used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the ticket-takers on the bus \u2014 the people who you would not really expect to know the modern lingo \u2014 don\u2019t say \u2018comrade\u2019 anymore because they know what it means among young people.\u201dNowadays, Chinese typically refer to one another as \u201cmister,\u201d \u201cmiss\u201d or \u201cmadame.\u201d Strangers often address one another as \u201cyoung miss,\u201d \u201cbeautiful woman,\u201d \u201chandsome man\u201d or \u201cmaster.\u201dWithin the party, only top leaders are typically referred to as \u201ccomrade.\u201d At the lower levels, \u201ccomrade\u201d has been replaced by a grab bag of titles. In a commentary published last year, Study Times, a weekly party journal, railed against modern designations like \u201cdeputy secretary,\u201d \u201cboss,\u201d \u201cC.E.O.,\u201d \u201cgrandfather\u201d and \u201cbrother.\u201dThe directive instructed that \u201cparty members must call each other \u2018comrades.\u2019\u201dSome political experts, however, voiced skepticism that the order would change much.\u201cThese days, everyone who joins the party does so to become an official and make money,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a writer and historian. \u201cYou can\u2019t really call these people true comrades.\u201dThere may also be an inherent contradiction.\u201cPower is power,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cYou can say that all party members are comrades.

{"Headline": "Blockbuster Deals in a Race to Stay Ahead of the Competition", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWorld-changing corporate transactions just seem to keep coming. It won\u2019t last, however.The number of multibillion-dollar deals announced in recent weeks is staggering by any measure, particularly in an election year, when the uncertainty tends to drive away deals.Time Warner\u2019s & AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion proposed tie-up has dominated the headlines as consumers latch on to tales of media dominance, but in October alone, $329 billion worth of deal activity in the United States has been announced, according to Thomson Reuters, a record. The worldwide number, $483.1 billion, is also no slouch and the fifth highest on record.Other gigantic deals include General Electric\u2019s combination of its oil business with that of Baker Hughes, British American Tobacco\u2019s $47 billion takeover offer for Reynolds American and Qualcomm\u2019s $38.5 billion deal for NXP Semiconductors. One of the biggest deals this year is Bayer\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto.Looming in the future are potential other big deals like a recombination of Viacom and CBS.Conventional wisdom is that this activity is all about cheap money. Interest rates are at 400-year lows and the world is awash with liquidity as investors try to find anything that yields a decent rate. Capital markets are so well developed that AT&T can seek to borrow $40 billion to buy Time Warner without missing a step. The days of the financial crisis are well and truly over as lenders are again jumping to lend \u2014 albeit at lower leverage rates. (We did learn something from the crisis, thankfully.)The other broad force driving this merger boomlet is confidence. The worldwide economy is choppy, but we are actually in a period of stability. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has come, and though it may prove to be a disaster for the British economy, it has not brought the trade bloc down with it.Indeed, since the British referendum on June 23, the British stock market is up about 15 percent. The decline in the value of the pound has spurred deal-making, like Softbank\u2019s $32 billion acquisition of the British chip maker ARM Holdings.Forget about shareholder value; the top priority of any chief executive is to remain employed. And in a sluggish economy with few obvious opportunities, a big merger has become the only way to acquire growth or a new product or new technology and ensure that the chief executive holds on to power.The challenge facing chief executives is compounded by the changes wrought by technology. Companies, particularly in technology, media and telecommunications, are racing to keep up and avoid being outmaneuvered. Microsoft\u2019s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn can be viewed solely as a defensive play \u2014 keeping its global reach on the internet.This trend has also been apparent in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology deal making of the past years as companies bought drugs instead of developing them.And tech itself continues to produce new challengers and spur further deal activity. The potential initial public stock offering of Snap at very likely an extraordinary valuation will push other tech companies to go public, generating more money in the pockets of the tech elite to make acquisitions.But the result of all this merger activity is a broad push toward oligopoly, meaning industries are dominated by just a few big players.Take media and telecommunications. We are heading into a world that is focused on video as people spend their lives on their smartphones, at least for now. The AT&T-Time Warner combination is built on this premise as AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, bets that the money in telecom is in content.In this new media world, there will probably be four or five big providers of content, two of which will certainly be Facebook and Google. AT&T is making its play to stay in that elite league through its proposed acquisition.A cynic might see the AT&T deal and others getting ahead of any changes to our inadequate antitrust laws. In a low-growth economy, getting bigger and squeezing out competitors is a clear way to success.Yet the monopolistic power play has changed. In the case of AT&T, its businesses do not overlap with those of Time Warner. This is a so-called vertical merger, which is harder to stop, and there is little history of the government doing so.It is how Facebook has been allowed to preserve its dominance by acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 two emerging potential rivals that were swallowed before they could challenge the Google/Facebook dominance.You may have noticed that the \u201cbigger is better\u201d mantra is not politically popular at the moment. Republicans and Democrats alike have called for regulators to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal.In Washington, you can expect not just greater enforcement but possibly a change in the laws to focus on corporate giants that dominate a market through their immense size.So there is a rush to get deals through before the laws change. Either way, things are not getting better. And the risk of being left behind because of technological disruption and change is driving companies to make acquisitions faster. It is also a trend that, not surprisingly, affects larger companies. Thomson Reuters reports there have been 615 deals year to date, down from 967 in 2014, so the deals are concentrated at the higher end.This trend is spurring the return of the oft-derided conglomerates that came about in the 1960s. As was the case then, instead of growth and survival, we may just end up with bloat.At the moment, it is hard to find anything that can slow the merger train. Everything is going right. But it is in these times that perhaps caution is necessary. The merger market has always been cyclical. The current is moving forward, but sentiment can change. In addition, the risk of disruption still exists, whether it be the United States election, renewed uncertainty in Europe or global turmoil from Russia. And there is the prospect of higher interest rates, and how that will affect cheap deal financing is anybody\u2019s guess.If we have learned anything from more than 100 years of corporate mergers, it is that the lurking influences eventually emerge and the current trends driving all of this merger activity are unlikely to last. Let\u2019s hope it ends slowly and not with a sudden burst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biggest Spike in Traffic Deaths in 50 Years? Blame Apps", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe messaging app Snapchat allows motorists to post photos that record the speed of the vehicle. The navigation app Waze rewards drivers with points when they report traffic jams and accidents. Even the game Pok\u00e9mon Go has drivers searching for virtual creatures on the nation\u2019s highways.When distracted driving entered the national consciousness a decade ago, the problem was mainly people who made calls or sent texts from their cellphones. The solution then was to introduce new technologies to keep drivers\u2019 hands on the wheel. Innovations since then \u2014 car Wi-Fi and a host of new apps \u2014 have led to a boom in internet use in vehicles that safety experts say is contributing to a surge in highway deaths.After steady declines over the last four decades, highway fatalities last year recorded the largest annual percentage increase in 50 years. And the numbers so far this year are even worse. In the first six months of 2016, highway deaths jumped 10.4 percent, to 17,775, from the comparable period of 2015, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\u201cThis is a crisis that needs to be addressed now,\u201d Mark R. Rosekind, the head of the agency, said in an interview.Alarmed by the statistics, the Department of Transportation in October outlined a plan to work with the National Safety Council and other advocacy groups to devise a \u201cRoad to Zero\u201d strategy, with the ambitious goal of eliminating roadway fatalities within 30 years.The Obama administration\u2019s transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, said that the near-term effort would involve identifying changes in regulations, laws and standards that could help reduce fatalities. That might include pushing for all states to tighten and enforce laws requiring use of seatbelts in cars and helmets on motorcycles, while cracking down on distracted or drunken driving. The effort might also include tougher regulation of heavy trucks, Mr. Foxx said.A second, related effort would focus on setting longer-term goals and speeding the introduction of autonomous-driving technologies that many safety experts say have the potential to prevent accidents by removing distracted humans from the driving equation.One concern so far, though, is that current generations of automated driver-assistance systems, like the Autopilot feature offered by Tesla Motors, may be lulling some drivers into a false sense of security that can contribute to distracted driving.Whether highway safety officials in the Trump administration will have the same priorities, though, is too soon to say. The names of candidates for transportation secretary have not yet been publicly floated.Most new vehicles sold today have software that connects to a smartphone and allows drivers to place phone calls, dictate texts and use apps hands-free. Ford Motor has its Sync system, for example. Others, including Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz, offer their own interfaces as well as Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto.Automakers say these systems enable customers to concentrate on driving even while interacting with their smartphones.\u201cThe whole principle is to bring voice recognition to customers so they can keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel,\u201d said Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford, which began installing Sync in cars in 2007.Since then, the company has added features to reduce distractions, like a \u201cdo not disturb button\u201d that lets drivers block incoming calls and texts.CarPlay allows use of the iPhone\u2019s Siri virtual assistant to answer phone calls, dictate texts and control apps like Spotify and Pandora. Both Sync and CarPlay present simplified menus on a car\u2019s in-dash display to reduce driver distraction and turn off the phone\u2019s screen, eliminating the temptation to use the device itself.But Deborah Hersman, president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the federal National Transportation Safety Board, said it was not clear how much those various technologies reduced distraction \u2014 or, instead, encouraged people to use even more functions on their phones while driving. And freeing the drivers\u2019 hands does not necessarily clear their heads.\u201cIt\u2019s the cognitive workload on your brain that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Ms. Hersman said.Technology in some new cars is meant to reduce driver distractions or compensate for them.Dr. William Chandler, a retired neurosurgeon in Ann Arbor, Mich., just bought a 2017 BMW X5 sport utility vehicle that warns him if he drifts out of his lane on the highway or if a car is in his blind spot. His favorite feature is a heads-up display on the windshield in front of him that projects his speed, the speed limit and navigation information.\u201cIt puts all the directions and turns right there in my field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real safety factor for distracted driving, because I\u2019m never looking at the map on the screen in the console.\u201dBut new cars make up only a small portion of the 260 million vehicles on the road in the United States. Digital diversion is harder to address in older models.Brett Hudson, 26, a teacher at a charter school in Jackson, Mich., said his iPhone 6 Plus had become essential to his daily commute in his 2002 Chevrolet TrailBlazer. He uses Apple Maps for navigation, listens to music via Pandora and gets his favorite Michigan football call-in show on iHeart Radio.To reduce the time he looks at the phone, Mr. Hudson installed an aftermarket Bluetooth system for hands-free phone calls. He mounts the iPhone on a clip attached to an air vent, enabling him to see the screen while still keeping the road in his field of vision.Mr. Hudson concedes that the setup is not risk-free.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that when I do have to touch the phone,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018my brain becomes so totally focused, even in that short period of time, and I don\u2019t really remember what\u2019s happening on the road in those four or five seconds.\u201dInsurance companies, which closely track auto accidents, are convinced that the increasing use of electronic devices while driving is the biggest cause of the rise in road fatalities, according to Robert Gordon, a senior vice president of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\u201cThis is a serious public safety concern for the nation,\u201d Mr. Gordon said at a recent conference in Washington held by the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cWe are all trying to figure out to what extent this is the new normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Said to Create Censorship Tool to Get Back Into China", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byInside Facebook, the work to enter China runs far deeper.The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people\u2019s news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social network has been blocked, these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, the people added.Facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it would offer the software to enable a third party \u2014 in this case, most likely a partner Chinese company \u2014 to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network, the people said. Facebook\u2019s partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users\u2019 feeds.The current and former Facebook employees caution that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering China and, like many experiments inside Facebook, it may never see the light of day. The feature, whose code is visible to engineers inside the company, has so far gone unused, and there is no indication that Facebook has offered it to the authorities in China.A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country.\u201d She added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into China.Still, some officials responsible for China\u2019s tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of Facebook\u2019s operating in the country. It would legitimize China\u2019s strict style of internet governance, and if done according to official standards, would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic. Even so, resistance remains at the top levels of Chinese leadership.Some analysts have said Facebook\u2019s best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor. Finding a partner \u2014 and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in Facebook\u2019s China operation \u2014 would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the Silicon Valley company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company\u2019s government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with Beijing.Facebook and Chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few years about the social network\u2019s entering the market, according to employees who were involved in the discussions, though the two sides have been unable to reach a compromise.Facebook currently sells advertising for some Chinese businesses from its Hong Kong office. Among its customers are state-media sites that act as the propaganda arm of the Chinese government, and that operate official accounts where they post articles. Chinese citizens who wish to gain access to Facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network, or VPN.It\u2019s unclear when the suppression tool originated, but the project picked up momentum in the last year, as engineers were plucked from other parts of Facebook to work on the effort, the current and former employees said. The project was led by Vaughan Smith, a vice president for mobile, corporate and business development at Facebook, they said. Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Smith speaks a smattering of Mandarin.Over the summer, several Facebook employees who were working on the suppression tool left the company, the current and former employees said. Internally, so many employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forum that, in July, it became a topic at one of Facebook\u2019s weekly Friday afternoon question-and-answer sessions.Mr. Zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience about the tool. He told the gathering that Facebook\u2019s China plans were nascent. But he also struck a pragmatic tone about the future, according to employees who attended the session.\u201cIt\u2019s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it\u2019s not yet the full conversation,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said, according to employees.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Workplace Is Agile, and Nonstop. Can You Keep Up?", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byWhether you like it or not, your boss may want you to start acting more like a programmer.In offices ranging from a museum in Sydney, Australia, to a car dealership in Maine, to the tech department at the insurance giant Allstate, the work force is adopting a tech industry concept called agile computing.No doubt, Silicon Valley has changed how we work, for better or worse. Our smartphones keep us connected to the office all the time while internet searches bring the world\u2019s information to our fingertips.But people may not realize that it is the subtler aspects of how tech companies operate that often have a more lasting effect on other industries.The \u201cagile\u201d part of this increasingly popular management concept is simple: Rather than try to do giant projects that take months or even years, create small teams that do a bit at a time. This way, small problems don\u2019t balloon into enormous ones hidden inside a huge bureaucracy. And progress can be measured in small steps \u2014 one little project at a time.The idea has been around for at least 15 years. It is used by the small tech company Twilio, for example, to turn out 40 changes to its product every day. But it wasn\u2019t until recently that this sort of employee organization found its way into other industries or even into the technology departments of other companies.\u201cFolks want to talk about the Airbnb and Uber, but this is like when the assembly line showed up,\u201d said Douglas Safford, Allstate\u2019s vice president of technology innovation. \u201cAll the layers and specialization are breaking down. Instead of a year, we want to put an idea in front of a customer in a week.\u201dTech culture finding its way into other industries is nothing new. Decades ago, Intel\u2019s founders tried to create an egalitarian culture where the chief executive sat among his employees, and everyone at the company shared in the risks and rewards through stock options.In more recent years, Google\u2019s drive to take care of employees\u2019 everyday needs, like commuting or dry cleaning (all so they could focus on work), has been adopted with mixed success in other industries.Now cloud computing \u2014 putting your data or your software on the servers of a giant data center that is accessible through the internet \u2014 is having an outsize influence. Cloud computing (a technology) and agile computing (a management concept) have proved to be a strong combination for creating and tweaking products faster than the competition.New technologies and the management ideas that come with them have always presented risks to rank-and-file workers. Email improved communications and helped do away with a layer of management that was responsible for that communication inside big companies. Global fiber networks tied the world together and made it easier for jobs to be outsourced to other countries. And automation and robotics have wiped out countless manufacturing jobs.With cloud computing, the risk \u2014 at least for now \u2014 appears more subtle. The average worker may have more flexible hours. What that can really mean is they are expected to work all the time. And they are expected to react faster to bosses\u2019 demands with more varied skills.\u201cWork has changed, and everyone needs more expertise, more consultation,\u201d said Pamela Hinds, a professor of management science and engineering at Stanford. \u201cThere\u2019s more speed with which projects have to get out, because of competition, and people are pulled on and off projects much more.\u201dAt the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney, a government-mandated transition from traditional computers to cloud-computing systems now has everyone planning exhibitions and raising money on Jira, a software development tool for managing cloud projects quickly.\u201cWe change light bulbs on Jira. It\u2019s how we plan all our exhibitions,\u201d said Dan Collins, head of digital and media at the museum. \u201cThings move a lot faster, with fewer meetings. Tools are more important than organizational charts.\u201dAt Newcastle Chrysler, a car dealership in Newcastle, Me., a former coder named Alex Miner installed a coding product called Hipchat throughout the family business. Like Jira, Hipchat is made by Atlassian, a company known for software development tools.\u201cEverything\u2019s a lot more audited by sensors. I can tell one PSI off pressure in a tire from anywhere in the company and react to that,\u201d he said, a reference to pounds per square inch. \u201cThe older guys in sales don\u2019t want to adopt the new tech, but the service guys, they work together and they get it; the velocity is advancing everywhere.\u201dTech industry coders are known for their all-night binges, so it is not surprising that copying the way they operate is leading to concerns about work taking over the rest of one\u2019s life.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk around the water cooler about how easy it is to pick up more work when you get home,\u201d said Mr. Collins. Some of the museum workers have found other cloud-based tools to compensate \u2014 ones that shut off access to work after, say, 7 p.m.There is also a question of identity in this new workplace: If you are asked to be flexible and jump from one little project to another without hesitation, what sense of ownership do you have of your work?\u201cIt\u2019s like you have to constantly walk through walls, producing fast, with no chance to regroup,\u201d said Ms. Hinds. \u201cAs humans, we crave being known for something. If you\u2019re constantly moving in and out of teams, what\u2019s your identity?\u201dIf agile-type work is the new organizational pattern, it will be in a long tradition of companies styling themselves after the technology they consume. Standard corporate organization charts looked something like assembly-line factories, with strictly defined jobs moving up narrow silos of production. Those factory-style organizations displayed power with corner offices and doors.Now, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to figure out the right ways to collaborate,\u201d said Ryan Mullenix, an architect based in Seattle with NBBJ, a global corporate architecture and design firm. \u201cBrief periods of personal control become a huge thing, stuff like individual lighting or heat, or a quiet corner where you can sit alone.\u201dChef, a maker of tools for building cloud software, now sends consultants to its customers to explain to employees how all this is going to work.\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about work/life balance anymore,\u201d said Barry Crist, Chef\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s work/life mix. If you need to be home at 4, then put your kid to bed and make up for it at 10 p.m., that\u2019s fine. Younger people now want flux in their day, and they don\u2019t want to turn off the information, ever.\u201dAnd if you don\u2019t want to live like a coder for life, perpetually crashing on a project? Good luck, says Mr. Safford of Allstate.\u201cA third jump in, a third resist but come onboard, and a third try to hide,\u201d he said of employees. \u201cI have conversations that amount to, \u2018Do you want to die on the hill?

{"Headline": " What 10 Actors Wore to a Spike Lee Casting Call in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byFew filmmakers are linked to a borough the way that Spike Lee is to Brooklyn. So when Mr. Lee, the 59-year-old director, announced that he was having an open casting call for a coming Netflix series based on \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d last month, Brooklynites of all stripes turned out. The line of actors and performers at the Masonic Temple was so long that it wrapped around an entire block in Fort Greene. Despite the wait, the crowd was in good spirits and, naturally, smartly dressed. Where did you get that jacket?Tell me about the hat.I\u2019m a Brooklyn boy, born and bred. I\u2019ve got to always represent. I always wear this out to auditions. It\u2019s kind of like my lucky hat.Tell me about these glasses.They came from American Apparel, I got them when I worked there a few years ago. They help simplify outfits. I can wear something crazy and then just some plain glasses.You\u2019ve got the goatee going.I used to have a high-top fade. I cut it off when I graduated because for auditions, it put me in too much of a box. So since my top hair went missing, I was like, I\u2019m going to start doing facial things. I don\u2019t like to look plain. I love your hat.I got this on eBay for like, $4. They had one at Urban for like, $32, and I was like, maybe not. I found an image of the hat and looked it up through Google Image. I just got it in the mail, so I\u2019ve been wearing it to death.Your lipstick and pants match.I\u2019m feeling fall vibes. The color is called saddle, which I guess makes sense.You have a strong layering game going on with the cardigan, the jacket, and the top.I have no bodily climate control. If it\u2019s below 75 degrees, then I\u2019m freezing. And if it\u2019s above 75 degrees, I\u2019m sweating profusely, so I have to dress in layers pretty much all the time.What did you want your outfit to project for this audition?Lately, not just for this audition, I\u2019ve been feeling fall goddess-y. October is my prime. I\u2019m from New England, so this is peak fall, so I\u2019m trying to channel that. Plus, I ran straight here from work.You have a lot of different jobs.They all relate to each other, so why not just do it all? You can meet new people, network. I met someone over here through a fashion designer, and now they\u2019re acting.So is your jacket and hat of your own design?I make jackets and hats, based here in New York, really Brooklyn. All the styles really come from Brooklyn. That\u2019s where all the inspiration comes from. There\u2019s Biggie Smalls, as you can see. He\u2019s from Brooklyn.What\u2019s your company called?TruckingFlyWear. Like a trucker\u2019s hat. If you take the \u201cc\u201d out, it\u2019s true king wear. It has a double meaning.How would you classify your style?I don\u2019t like to curse, so I\u2019ll say trucking fly.Why are you here today?Spike Lee helped Martin Lawrence, and I\u2019m a big fan. Huge. The TV show, the stand-up, his personality. That\u2019s who I grew up with, and Spike Lee gave him an opportunity. I came out here with hopes and dreams like everyone else.Tell me about your hat.I picked it up in a consignment shop in Phoenix last summer. It was a one-of-a-kind piece, and I just had to have it.Your glasses are great.I liked the classic frame, the cat eye. They frame everybody\u2019s face well. It\u2019s all vintage minus the jeans. They\u2019re from Uniqlo.You have a retro look going on.Well, I\u2019m from Baltimore.How do you approach dressing for an audition like this? You want to be a blank slate, but you want an edge. You want to have a certain twist to it, you want to have a bit of glam to it if you\u2019re a girl, because you want to stand out.Where\u2019d you get your hat from?I believe I got it from T.J. Maxx. It was a neutral color, and I thought it was stylish. Everyone asked me about it. I have a lot of hats, some brims, some baseball caps.Where are your glasses from?I got these from a little stand in Union Square. Because I have a fuller face, I always look for something bigger. Smaller frames, they just, like, sink in.Tell me about your outfit.I think my jacket\u2019s from Old Navy and the button-up is from Nordstrom Rack. And my shoes are from Ralph Lauren Chaps.You\u2019ve got a great beard.You were in a K-pop band?Yes, it was called EXP. They are now overseas, and I\u2019m no longer with them. I started acting, so I had to make a decision. We were shown on some Indonesian show and interviewed by a Korean magazine, and we almost had an MTV show, but that didn\u2019t work out.I love your hoodie.It\u2019s from H&M. For some reason, I was wearing a black hoodie earlier but because everything was kind of light, I went with this one because it maybe evens things out.And you went with classic Converse.They\u2019re fake leather, like pleather? I needed white because I was tired of my black ones. And I needed something to pull together my almost-preppy look.Are you dressing more as yourself or for the audition?I never really dress for auditions. I kind of just dress the way I feel. Like I know you\u2019re not supposed to wear ripped jeans, but I would wear ripped jeans or a scoop-neck T-shirt. Today I wanted to be kind of preppy, but not. It depends on the day.That\u2019s a unique name.My mom actually named me that. And then the last name is like a vacuum cleaner. (Laughs.)I love your jacket.This is actually my grandmother\u2019s. She was very stylish. Tell me about your necklaces.I made one of these, and these two I bought from this couple who sells jewelry on the street. They travel around the world collecting items from Indonesia and different parts of Africa, and over the years I talk to them like surrogate parents.Your hair is amazing.Well, I\u2019m a Gemini, but I guess I\u2019m a Leo rising, so there\u2019s a part of me that likes to look like a lion with a mane. So some of it is my own and some of it is not, but I added it in myself. I love the idea of have your aura be something that shines out but you\u2019re giving a few clues.What made you come out today?I\u2019ve been following Spike Lee for most of my life. I grew up around the corner from \u201cDo the Right Thing Way.\u201d I\u2019m black and it\u2019s Spike Lee. You just go.Where\u2019s your jacket from?What does your shirt say?Bloodlinefresh. I got it from the thrift as well. It\u2019s a vintage company. I didn\u2019t know about it before I bought it.Is this how your normally dress or is this for the audition?Both. It\u2019s how I normally dress but I also feel like it\u2019s a nice aesthetic to visualize me for a role.Where\u2019s your coat from?It\u2019s vintage from Goodwill. I saw that it was extra, extra large and I love large clothing. I wanted that stump look.I like that you\u2019re wearing a man\u2019s shirt.I want a uniform look. I didn\u2019t want to do too much. I wanted to be plain today, and I thought this was simple but chic.What\u2019s going on with your jeans?My friend made these. It says \u201cMind Your Business, Summer Spring.\u201d I just told her to put these roses on it, and she added all these extra details.I\u2019m extremely eclectic. I might wear a minidress one day or something oversized the next. It depends on what I\u2019m feeling and how I want to express myself. Tell me about your necklace.How do you dress for an audition, especially since Spike has a distinct visual style?I did think that Spike\u2019s about Brooklyn, he\u2019s Afro-centric, which is why I have the kente bit of my shirt. I\u2019m not the best actor when it comes to dressing for the role. I just tried to do nouveau Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn and his mentality.Why did you come out today?I have an agent and a manager, and I almost didn\u2019t come. But I thought that\u2019s not really the spirit. I have a shot to get into a Spike Lee film, one of my lifelong heroes, why not stand out here with everyone else? You\u2019ve got to be in it to win it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Acts to Restore Trust After Overstating Video Views", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byFacebook is moving to restore confidence among advertisers and publishers that it is accurately measuring how often and how long users see videos, news articles, ads and corporate messages on its social network.The steps, announced on Wednesday, followed the company\u2019s apology in September for an error that resulted in considerably overstating how long, on average, users spent watching videos on Facebook.Facebook said that it would increase its use of outside measurement services for display and video ads. The company said it is expanding its use of metrics services like comScore, Moat, Nielsen and Integral Ad Science, and looking to add others.Facebook said it would form a \u201cmeasurement council\u201d of ad agency executives and marketers to develop metrics suited to the needs of advertisers.\u201cThis is an important evolution for Facebook,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group of media and technology companies, including Facebook. \u201cThis is Facebook saying, Yes, we know that we need to be and are getting more involved in advertising transparency.\u201dThe Facebook data analysts also found that the time spent on what are known as instant articles \u2014 fast-loading news items tailored for easier reading on smartphones \u2014 was overstated on average by 7 to 8 percent, the blog said.But another bug resulted in undercounting a video metric. The Facebook research found that the number of people viewing video ads from beginning to end was 35 percent higher than it had previously calculated.Facebook emphasized that that newly uncovered flaws involve only a few of the more than 220 metrics Facebook deploys.The impact of the disclosure of further calculation miscues, after the September apology, is uncertain. Advertisers and publishers have little choice but to embrace Facebook given its huge audience and its dominance, with Google, of online advertising. Early this month, Facebook reported that its third-quarter profits surged 166 percent from a year ago to nearly $2.4 billion.But analysts said concerns about the accuracy of Facebook\u2019s metrics could prompt some to question whether they should invest so much time, money and resources with the company.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can not use Facebook as an advertiser or as a publisher,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cBut it is a question of who do you prioritize and how many resources do you send that way?\u201dThe moves Facebook has taken are intended to quell such doubts and restore its credibility among advertisers and publishers.\u201cOur goal going forward,\u201d Facebook said in its web post, \u201cis to communicate more regularly about our metrics, so that our partners can focus on doing what they do best \u2014 servicing their customers \u2014 with the best insights possible.\u201dYet a more skeptical view of digital advertising is emerging, not only for reasons of measurement but some major advertisers wonder if it is as effective as they had assumed.\u201cThe ascendant view had been \u2018if it\u2019s digital, it\u2019s better,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cAnd I think with every passing incident, those who have not been appropriately skeptical or appropriately critical have come down to earth a bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now try telling that to Facebook.And those numbers do not even include Facebook\u2019s other properties, such as the photo-sharing service Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.That gives Facebook the major advantage of a giant and still fast-growing audience, an edge that Sheryl K. Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, acknowledged in an interview.\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased at the strong growth of the Facebook community,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty exciting to us.\u201dThe company\u2019s strength in users, which is a major draw to advertisers, also fed Facebook\u2019s financial performance. The company said on Wednesday that sales totaled $6.82 billion for the third quarter, up 59 percent from a year ago. Mobile advertising revenue was particularly strong, accounting for 84 percent of all ad sales. Total profit was $2.38 billion, nearly three times as much as a year ago.Even so, investors were spooked by Facebook\u2019s warning of a likely slowdown in revenue growth next year because of a decrease in what the company calls advertising load, or the number of ads that are inserted into the news feed. Facebook also said 2017 would be an \u201cinvestment year,\u201d with the possibility of increased costs in areas like hiring workers and spending on data centers. The stock sagged 7 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.Much of Facebook\u2019s recent advertising success has been driven by its video ad business, which has experienced tremendous growth over the last year. Facebook can command a premium on video ads. SocialCode, a digital advertising agency, said video ads accounted for some 47 percent of its clients\u2019 Facebook and Instagram spending.\u201cPeople are creating and sharing more video, and we think it\u2019s pretty clear that video is only going to become more important,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re putting video first across our apps.\u201dYet the misstep does not appear to have slowed Facebook down.

{"Headline": "Samsung Takes Sensible Course in Bid for Harman International", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSamsung is riding a stallion instead of a unicorn into the driverless revolution. Despite no stated cost savings, the 28 percent premium the Korean electronics group agreed to pay for Harman International, a connected-car supplier, is reasonable. Companies like Google are investing heavily to invent the automotive future as General Motors and others bet on risky start-ups. This deal suggests there are safer ways to play a mega-trend in the making.The $8 billion price looks opportunistic and fair for a company that will jump-start Samsung\u2019s presence in what it expects to be a $100 billion market by 2025. Harman\u2019s shares hit a three-year low in June, reflecting concerns that car suppliers face tougher times as the long post-crisis boom in American auto sales fades. General Motors last week underscored the worries by announcing a reduction of 2,000 jobs at factories in the United States, after news of similar cuts by Ford Motor.Despite the turn, Harman has been trying to position itself for the longer term. While it is best known for its JBL speakers, features like navigation, infotainment, communications and car safety accounted for nearly half of Harman\u2019s sales in the last year. They are likely to grow in importance as computers take over from humans at the wheel.A lack of advertised cost cuts probably means that Samsung, which plans to run Harman as an independent subsidiary, will have to rely on revenue gains to recoup its investment. It would only take slashing costs equivalent to 4 percent of next year\u2019s sales to cover the premium, but it is also reasonable to think that combining Samsung\u2019s products with Harman\u2019s brands and customers could result in faster growth than either company could manage separately.That makes Harman a more sensible way to gain exposure to the next generation of cars than building technology from scratch the way Google, Apple and Uber are doing. Similarly, investments such as the $500 million GM made in Lyft, the ride-sharing company, and its $1 billion-plus acquisition of Cruise Automation, the software venture, offer huge upside, but with accompanying risk. Harman should be a good ride down the middle of the road.Kevin Allison is a columnist at Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.Advertisement"}

It is possible you are a tryborg.The company that makes my leg calls it a C-Leg, a cruel name, since it is vulnerable to salt water and cannot go anywhere near the sea. I\u2019ve been wearing prosthetic legs for over 30 years. In the last decade, I\u2019ve been wearing a leg with a computerized knee. The knee weighs 2.8 pounds and lasts 40 to 45 hours on a charge. I vacuum seal into my leg, so the boundary where I end and computer begins is imperceptible to me.The tryborg is always distanced by metaphor, guesswork and desire. When my leg suddenly beeps and buzzes and goes into \u201cdead mode\u201d \u2014 the knee stiffens; I walk like a penguin \u2014 the tryborg is alive without batteries. When I sound like a bomb in a liquor store, the tryborg hurries on, nonelectronic.Tryborgs want to be cyborgs. This is why they go to bed with Fitbit, brag about gigabit and buy kit with Bitcoin. They have an affinity for the it or the Id. But even when they find a mate by swiping right, and then tell that mate how many steps they walked since Sunday, still they are not cyborgs. To mistake them for cyborgs is to confuse the figurative with the literal.If you are thinking, No, no, no, cyborgs do not exist, they are theoretical creatures, then you are likely a tryborg.Tryborgs rely on the nonexistence of actual cyborgs for their bread and butter. If cyborgs exist, how will the tryborg remain relevant? Wouldn\u2019t we just ask the cyborg for her opinion? The opinions of cyborgs are conspicuously absent from the expert panels, the tech leadership conferences and the advisory boards. The erasure is not news to us. We have been deleted for centuries, and in the movies, you will often see us go on a long, fruitful journey, only to delete ourselves in the end.But anyone with a hard drive can tell you: Even when you delete something, it is not really gone. So it is with us cyborgs. We remain in the periphery, un-scrubbed and un-snuffed out.I know it will take time, but things will change. For a while, all the experts on African-Americans were white. All the experts on lesbians were Richard von Krafft-Ebing. All the experts on cyborgs were noninterfaced humans.\u201cYou just have a chip on your shoulder,\u201d says the tryborg, smiling down from Google headquarters (the futurist factory) in Mountain View, Calif.I will be your cyborg laureate.Take my C-Leg. It gives me the muscular calf of a man-cyclist. I have a ruler, and the company name, on my shin. I can choose between the colors Volcano Shadow or Desert Pearl, which is to say, gray or brownish-gray. I cannot choose a female option because there are none. I have no complaint about androgyny. But I\u2019m just a regular femme who likes to show her legs. Yes, I have come this far, to beg that you make a leg look like a woman\u2019s leg.Second, why place the outlet on my calf? How many women do you know who want their outlets exposed? To plug myself in, I must decide between uncomfortable positions. Either I remove my leg and kneel beside it as if in prayer to the tryborg creation. Or I leave my leg on and plug in by making a certain kind of pose absent from all the yoga charts. Is it tree? Is it boat?Finally, I do not like the way I must maintain a specific weight, not to exceed 110 pounds, if I want to walk on two legs. I would like to get fatter like the rest of you.

{"Headline": "Secret Back Door in Some U.S. Phones Sent Data to China, Analysts Say", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For about $50, you can get a smartphone with a high-definition display, fast data service and, according to security contractors, a secret feature: a backdoor that sends all your text messages to China every 72 hours.Security contractors recently discovered preinstalled software in some Android phones that monitors where users go, whom they talk to and what they write in text messages. The American authorities say it is not clear whether this represents secretive data mining for advertising purposes or a Chinese government effort to collect intelligence.International customers and users of disposable or prepaid phones are the people most affected by the software. But the scope is unclear. The Chinese company that wrote the software, Shanghai Adups Technology Company, says its code runs on more than 700 million phones, cars and other smart devices. One American phone manufacturer, BLU Products, said that 120,000 of its phones had been affected and that it had updated the software to eliminate the feature.Kryptowire, the security firm that discovered the vulnerability, said the Adups software transmitted the full contents of text messages, contact lists, call logs, location information and other data to a Chinese server. The code comes preinstalled on phones and the surveillance is not disclosed to users, said Tom Karygiannis, a vice president of Kryptowire, which is based in Fairfax, Va. \u201cEven if you wanted to, you wouldn\u2019t have known about it,\u201d he said.Security experts frequently discover vulnerabilities in consumer electronics, but this case is exceptional. It was not a bug. Rather, Adups intentionally designed the software to help a Chinese phone manufacturer monitor user behavior, according to a document that Adups provided to explain the problem to BLU executives. That version of the software was not intended for American phones, the company said.\u201cThis is a private company that made a mistake,\u201d said Lily Lim, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., who represents Adups.The episode shows how companies throughout the technology supply chain can compromise privacy, with or without the knowledge of manufacturers or customers. It also offers a look at one way that Chinese companies \u2014 and by extension the government \u2014 can monitor cellphone behavior. For many years, the Chinese government has used a variety of methods to filter and track internet use and monitor online conversations. It requires technology companies that operate in China to follow strict rules. Ms. Lim said Adups was not affiliated with the Chinese government.At the heart of the issue is a special type of software, known as firmware, that tells phones how to operate. Adups provides the code that lets companies remotely update their firmware, an important function that is largely unseen by users. Normally, when a phone manufacturer updates its firmware, it tells customers what it is doing and whether it will use any personal information. Even if that is disclosed in long legal disclosures that customers routinely ignore, it is at least disclosed. That did not happen with the Adups software, Kryptowire said.Samuel Ohev-Zion, the chief executive of the Florida-based BLU Products, said: \u201cIt was obviously something that we were not aware of. We moved very quickly to correct it.\u201dHe added that Adups had assured him that all of the information taken from BLU customers had been destroyed.The software was written at the request of an unidentified Chinese manufacturer that wanted the ability to store call logs, text messages and other data, according to the Adups document. Adups said the Chinese company used the data for customer support.Ms. Lim said the software was intended to help the Chinese client identify junk text messages and calls. She did not identify the company that requested it and said she did not know how many phones were affected. She said phone companies, not Adups, were responsible for disclosing privacy policies to users. \u201cAdups was just there to provide functionality that the phone distributor asked for,\u201d she said.Android phones run software that is developed by Google and distributed free for phone manufacturers to customize. A Google official said the company had told Adups to remove the surveillance ability from phones that run services like the Google Play store. That would not include devices in China, where hundreds of millions of people use Android phones but where Google does not operate because of censorship concerns.Because Adups has not published a list of affected phones, it is not clear how users can determine whether their phones are vulnerable. \u201cPeople who have some technical skills could,\u201d Mr. Karygiannis, the Kryptowire vice president, said. \u201cBut the average consumer? No.\u201dMs. Lim said she did not know how customers could determine whether they were affected.Adups also provides what it calls \u201cbig data\u201d services to help companies study their customers, \u201cto know better about them, about what they like and what they use and there they come from and what they prefer to provide better service,\u201d according to its website.Kryptowire discovered the problem through a combination of happenstance and curiosity. A researcher there bought an inexpensive phone, the BLU R1 HD, for a trip overseas. While setting up the phone, he noticed unusual network activity, Mr. Karygiannis said. Over the next week, analysts noticed that the phone was transmitting text messages to a server in Shanghai and was registered to Adups, according to a Kryptowire report.Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency \u201cwas recently made aware of the concerns discovered by Kryptowire and is working with our public and private sector partners to identify appropriate mitigation strategies.\u201dKryptowire is a Homeland Security contractor but analyzed the BLU phone independent of that contract.Mr. Ohev-Zion, the BLU chief executive, said he was confident that the problem had been resolved for his customers. \u201cToday there is no BLU device that is collecting that information,\u201d he said.Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s Impact Will Follow You", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byIt has become a reflexive pledge, often half-joking, after an election: Worried about the next president? Move to another country.After the news of Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election was confirmed early Wednesday, many Americans apparently considered doing just that.Remi Lariviere, a spokesman for the Canadian immigration agency, confirmed Wednesday morning that the cause was \u201ca significant increase in the volume of traffic.\u201dBy then, the site was taking about half a minute to load but was accessible shortly before 8 a.m. Eastern. \u201cMove to Canada\u201d remained among the top trending search topics on Google.There is no way, of course, to be sure how serious these queries are. And experts point out that anyone seeking refuge in another country would be hard-pressed to escape the global effects of a new American administration or outlook on the world.Stephen J. Farnsworth, a co-author of the 2013 book \u201cThe Global President: International Media and the U.S. Government\u201d and a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, said that escaping to Canada would not shield you from the influence of a President Trump.\u201cAmerica\u2019s global reach being what it is, the impacts that America has in the world will also follow you wherever you go,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions that the U.S. makes with respect to NATO policy, for example, would be part of your experience if you move to say, a NATO country.\u201d(Canada is one of the founding members of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)Of course, many of those exploring their options would be fleeing not just the new president and his policies, but also the America that voted for him. And Canada was not the only country people appeared interested in checking out.Many people who already have or are close to achieving dual citizenship in other countries and the United States said they were considering staying in, or leaving for, their alternate homelands.And some of those without citizenship considered returning to one of the many nations \u2014 including Israel, China and Ireland \u2014 that offers \u201cright of return,\u201d an easy path to citizenship for those with some form of heritage related to that country.(For Jews, moving to Israel is known as making Aliyah.)Julian Edward Toles, 27, an essayist living with his girlfriend in Barcelona, said that while he had already started to look into the benefits of Spanish citizenship, which he could obtain were he and his girlfriend to marry, he was now thinking \u201cmuch more seriously\u201d about getting residency rights.\u201cTrump and his promises to uphold \u2018law and order\u2019 frankly scare me,\u201d Mr. Toles, who is black, said in a Facebook message. \u201cI fear for my personal safety as the worst of what we\u2019ve seen from his campaign becomes a daily reality.\u201dOscar Barajas, a 36-year-old with Mexican citizenship living in Chicago, said that while he was about to get his American citizenship, he \u201cwas not so happy to join after Trump\u2019s election.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t plan to leave because Trump won, but I can say I at least would be fortunate to go back to my country if he makes the U.S. a place where I wouldn\u2019t like to start a family,\u201d he said. \"I know so many people who are noncitizen and are scared about this situation.\u201dOthers advised that those upset about the election stay and ensure that their rights are upheld.Asked about what he would tell a Muslim mother of three who was worried about her future in the United States, Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights group, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think leaving the country is what anyone would recommend.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re Americans like all other Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re not going anywhere, and we\u2019re going to defend our rights and the rights of all Americans regardless of who\u2019s in the highest office in the land.\u201dHe did say, though, that he had been getting emails of friendly concern from Muslims in Canada.They\u2019re \u201csaying, \u2018what\u2019s going on down there?\u2019 \u201d he said, chuckling at the emails. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s chillier up here but it\u2019s nice.\u2019 \u201dAlexandra Andreeva, 27, a dual citizen of Bulgaria and the United States, said that her \u201cfirst instinct after learning the results of the election\u201d was to return to the European Union. But she said her strong identity as an American made her feel responsible to the United States, where she moved from Bulgaria when she was 6 years old.\u201cBecause I was born under communism, which is the opposite of liberal democracy, I would say that I feel even more compelled to stay here and to continue the fight,\u201d she said.Mr. Farnsworth said, \u201cEvery four years, people talk about leaving the U.S., but it\u2019s really striking how few do.\u201dIt is not necessarily easy to become a Canadian citizen, despite the country\u2019s reputation for niceness. The country is in search of university students and highly skilled workers; for those who do not fit into those neat categories, it would be far more difficult to find a place in the country.\u201cI\u2019m often amazed by people who describe themselves as patriotic being so willing to move away if they don\u2019t like the outcome of a presidential election,\u201d Mr. Farnsworth said. \u201cThe consolation for losers every four years is the recognition that there is no permanent majority and no permanent minority in American politics.\u201dIf you don\u2019t like the political outcome, it\u2019ll probably change in two years or four, he added. \u201cAnd then a whole \u2019nother set of people can talk about moving to Canada.\u201dFollow Jonah Engel Bromwich on Twitter @Jonesieman.Advertisement"}

He has been working on the third one for 11 years. (It will be available for PlayStation Dec. 6.) Whether it\u2019s another masterpiece, a disaster or something in between, The Last Guardian, about the relationship between a boy and a mysterious creature, is sure to be one of the year\u2019s most interesting games.The year\u2019s most important game might be That Dragon, Cancer, an interactive memoir by a husband and wife about the death of their young son. If you want to expose someone to a less powerfully sad game that still demonstrates the medium\u2019s ability to tell grown-up stories without elves or space marines or gangsters, try Firewatch, an interactive drama about a lonely fire lookout in Wyoming.Nathan Drake, the charming rogue of the Uncharted games, is often compared to Indiana Jones. But his video-game mother is surely Tomb Raider\u2019s Lara Croft, another globe-trotting, puzzle-solving treasure hunter with guns. A new creative team has taken over the fourth game in this highly cinematic series, and has kept the exhilarating action set pieces while adding quieter moments about aging, family and marriage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catfishing Strangers to Find Myself", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byModern LoveMy nonsexual feelings for Pamela were just one of the things that made me an outcast. Another was that I preferred computers to people. And so, as a child who loved playing board games, I soon discovered I could play them online with strangers on a Finnish gaming website.To access the site, you typed your user name in the blank field, waited for a slot to open and then found yourself in the main chat room, where you could challenge people to a round of blackjack, keno or billiards. Except it seemed no one else was there to play those games seriously. The screen was a constant stream of dirty messages.I realized no one wanted to message with a boy in his early adolescence, but many were clamoring to chat with an attractive woman. And that\u2019s where Pamela came in. To interest fellow gamers, I needed to become a woman.Using Pamela\u2019s age and some of her defining features to create my new persona, I logged in to the chat room as \u201cCharlottaDD35.\u201d Then the messages came pouring in.I accepted an invitation to play billiards from Jarkko25. A screen popped up, and we were escorted to a private room, where a question from him appeared in the message box: \u201cAre you feeling frisky?\u201d\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d I typed.\u201cIs it tight?\u201d he asked.I didn\u2019t entirely understand what he meant, but I knew it was dirty.I waited a moment and then wrote, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNice,\u201d he replied. \u201cAge?\u201d\u201c35,\u201d I wrote. \u201cBut I love younger men.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hot. What do you look like?\u201dI quickly Googled \u201cPamela+Anderson\u201d and described what I saw in the search results: \u201c179 cm, blonde. I like to wear heels and tight dresses.\u201d\u201cMmmh. Do you have big breasts?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cD-cups?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d I was determined to give him everything he wanted.\u201cWhat sort of men do you like?\u201d he asked.Thinking of James Bond movies, I said: \u201cSomeone like Pierce Brosnan. Someone who takes charge. Someone stylish.\u201d\u201cI can definitely take charge,\u201d he said.I took a sip of my Kool-Aid. \u201cSix-pack?\u201d I asked. Now was the time for me to be demanding; otherwise it wouldn\u2019t seem real. Having a six-pack was a thing I\u2019d heard was desirable.\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have one in the fridge.\u201dI laughed. Maybe this guy was nice.What followed was my first-ever cybersex session, with him typing suggestive remarks and me typing, \u201cMmmh,\u201d which seemed to work for him.My masquerade went on for months. I became a master of giving men what they wanted. The sheer number of interested men meant I could be picky, too. I wanted a conventionally handsome and sexy young man. And since I was a woman of such high caliber, I didn\u2019t think it was too much to ask.I tailored my story to suit the other participants\u2019 interests. I was married with two children. I had a rich husband who couldn\u2019t satisfy me sexually. We lived in an enormous glass house with a private beach in one of Helsinki\u2019s most exclusive suburbs. And since I was a bored, lonely housewife, I always needed someone to come over and take care of things.I found amateur photos of naked women online to send to the men and patched up whatever incongruities emerged: \u201cThe picture doesn\u2019t have a face because I don\u2019t want my husband to find out I\u2019ve been posting my photos online\u201d or \u201cI never give my number to strangers until I\u2019ve gotten to know them well enough.\u201dThe back story also allowed me an escape in case my parents got home. \u201cMy husband just walked in, so I have to go now,\u201d I would say. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to talk to you soon.\u201dI liked this online seduction much more than I imagined I would. I told myself it was the danger: of getting caught, of fooling the men, of breaking rules. Whatever the case, I\u2019d become addicted. Every day after school, I would continue my quest for the perfect man.That\u2019s when I came across Jussi. He described himself as a man who was 23, loved the gym and had a six-pack. He played ice hockey and basketball, masculine sports I\u2019d always wanted to be good at. But he was emotive too. He sent me messages such as, \u201cYou sound like an incredible woman\u201d and \u201cI can sense such warmth in these messages of yours.\u201dHe asked me the usual questions: What are you wearing? Where do you like to do it? How do you like it?I provided my usual answers: I was wearing nothing (\u201cI just got out of the shower and like to cool my body naturally\u201d). I liked doing it on every surface of the house and particularly in public places. All the yoga I did made me incredibly flexible, and I loved being lifted up and twisted into adventurous sexual positions.But then he began to talk about what he hoped to find on the site: namely, a relationship that was real and meaningful. I agreed I was tired of sleeping around too. Usually I blocked a man once he began to insist on meeting in person, but Jussi was patient and sweet. I wanted to continue talking to him.We logged in at the same time, day after day. I adjusted the schedule around my school days by saying, \u201cI\u2019ll need to drop off the kids first, so I won\u2019t be home until 3 p.m. tomorrow.\u201d He worked night shifts as a security guard, so he was always online when I needed him to be.After a few weeks, he said: \u201cCan we meet already? Please Charlotta.\u201d He told me that he was tired of chatting and that if I didn\u2019t say yes, he wouldn\u2019t believe I was a real person.What we had was real to me, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. So I agreed.We set a date for 7 p.m. a week later. We agreed to meet on a street corner in the center of Helsinki, mere blocks from where I lived. I hoped we would recognize each other simply because we had been talking for so long and had such a strong connection.As the days passed, however, the impossibility of it began to dawn on me. Even if I were to go meet him and get past the initial explanations, I could never become what he imagined me to be. And something else dawned on me as well: I was starting to realize I might be gay, and that\u2019s why I was different from everyone else.At 7 p.m. that evening, my mother put sausages and French fries on the table for dinner. I sat in silence, answering her questions with an absent-minded yes or no. Looking at the clock, it hit me: Jussi was now standing out in the cold night, alone.I wondered how long he would wait: Twenty minutes? Thirty? A full hour? Would he camp out at a nearby cafe while wistfully looking out of the window, searching the passing crowd for Charlotta\u2019s face?I imagined him sitting on the bus on his way home to the suburbs, hoping there\u2019d been a mix-up: I\u2019d either forgotten the day or mistaken the time. I imagined him logging on to the chat room and scanning the list for my user name, only to come up empty: I\u2019d blocked him to make sure I didn\u2019t have to read through any excruciating messages.A couple of hours after dinner, my mother came to knock on my door to tell me it was bedtime. As I lay alone in the dark, I felt the same loneliness Jussi must have been feeling.I wish there had been a way for me to tell him what his online companionship meant to me: That he had made it possible for me to be myself in a strictly gendered world of Pamela Andersons and James Bonds. That he had helped me believe I was funny, interesting and worth talking to. That he had, if only by his presence, made it possible for me to begin to process my sexuality.By pretending to be someone I was not, I had shown him my true self, one I had been too afraid to reveal to anyone else. And ultimately, I was able to embrace that true self, an acceptance that would allow me \u2014 years later, as an adult in New York City \u2014 to find real love as a real person.Kalle Oskari Mattila, a Finnish writer living in New York City, recently completed a memoir.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

Born near Liverpool in 1964, Mr. Leckey came of age as Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Marc Quinn and others found fame under an umbrella designation as Young British Artists. But Mr. Leckey preferred rave nights and obscure vinyl, and sat out that media-confected jamboree. After a few years in New York, he returned to London and was invited to contribute to a show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts on music videos, a genre he found more engaging than most visual art.Recently, Mr. Leckey has veered back to autobiographical territory. A room-filling sculpture of a Liverpool highway overpass, and a hallway illuminated by sallow yellow lamps used to illuminate British motorways, transform the galleries of PS1 into memory palaces of his northern English childhood. There is also a crepuscular LED display of Britain\u2019s national power grid; watching the lights go out across the island gives a frisson of the Brexit-induced ruin to come.Most impressive is \u201cDream English Kid 1964-1999 AD,\u201d which limns the artist\u2019s youth primarily through scraps of video discovered online. We see record shops, washed-out public housing, a shadow walking through London\u2019s Soho; we see clips of Joy Division, the Manchester-born band Mr. Leckey worships; we see the same highway overpass we encountered as sculpture, which on screen appears in a fog-bestrewn black-and-white like something out of \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d As in \u201cFiorucci Made Me Hardcore,\u201d this aching new video gains its power through shrewd editing and a lightly worn nostalgia. Unlike \u201cFiorucci,\u201d this one was made largely through YouTube and other digital sources; what appears to be first-person is actually made of others\u2019 lives.The melancholy \u201cDream English Kid\u201d may not have the outward-facing joy of \u201cFiorucci,\u201d nor the exacting wit of his cabinet of curiosities. But it\u2019s one of Mr. Leckey\u2019s best works. It captures, more than anything before, the gravid, intoxicating atmosphere of Britain in the 1990s that nurtured the most consequential generation of British artists of the last century. Brexit has made the video doubly nostalgic, not only for the last days of analog culture, but for an open, imaginative Britain that has not yet shot itself in the foot.Advertisement"}

But on Thursday, the American search giant tried to portray itself as a stalwart of online competition as it responded to European antitrust charges that it had restricted consumers\u2019 choices and hamstrung its competitors.Google responded on Thursday to two European antitrust charges, saying that its services helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find the digital information they seek online. The company said that the strength in Europe of other American technology companies, like Amazon, showed that Google had not restricted the local digital market.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cWe\u2019re confident these cases will ultimately be decided based on the facts,\u201d he wrote, adding that Google\u2019s products \u201cbenefited consumers and merchants, and expanded competition.\u201dGoogle worries that Europe\u2019s antitrust efforts may eventually hurt its lucrative business model, particularly if it is forced to open up some of its dominant digital services to rivals.For the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, the standoff with Google has become a litmus test for its ability to rein in a dominant technology company, one that has a roughly 90 percent market share in online search in the region.

The company can then appeal, prolonging the legal wrangling.But for Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, an online marketplace for Android smartphone apps, who has filed a complaint against Google, the antitrust cases are necessary to give European companies the space to compete against their much larger American rival.\u201cOur growth is being slowed down because of Google\u2019s dominant position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s at stake.

{"Headline": "Narendra Modi Bans India\u2019s Largest Currency Bills in Bid to Cut Corruption", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi fired a direct shot at India\u2019s endemic corruption with a surprise move on Tuesday to ban the country\u2019s largest currency bills, starting the next morning.The ban is intended both to curb the flow of counterfeit money and to take aim at terrorist organizations that rely on unaccounted-for cash. It is also expected to help the government clean up a system that has relied on cash to pay bribes and to avoid taxes.But the announcement, made on national television in both Hindi and English, led to an immediate upheaval in the country. Abolishing the current version of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, worth about $8 and $15, will effectively remove 80 percent of the currency in circulation.Mr. Modi said banks would be closed on Wednesday. After that, people can exchange the banned notes through the end of the year for those of smaller denominations or new bills that are being created.We want to hear from those living in India on Mr. Modi\u2019s move, and the impact it has had on you and your family.A.T.M.s around the country were overrun Tuesday night with people confused about the plan and trying to complete financial transactions before the machines closed the following day. In some places, hundreds stood in line in front of a single A.T.M.Cash is so prevalent in Indian society that the ban came with a 72-hour exception for paying for hospital bills and airline tickets. India\u2019s low-cost carrier, IndiGo Airlines, sent an email warning customers that banned notes could not be used to purchase in-flight services or to pay excess baggage charges.The decision amounted to a \u201csurgical strike\u201d on the country\u2019s vast amount of unaccounted-for cash, said Manish Kejriwal, founder of Kedaara Capital Advisors, a Mumbai private equity firm, using a military term.\u201cThis is Modi\u2019s transformational reform,\u201d said Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of India\u2019s largest mortgage lenders.\u201cIt will be disruptive, it will be inconvenient, but in the medium term, it will be very good.\u201dMr. Modi was elected in 2014 after running on an anticorruption platform that included a pledge to fight unaccounted-for cash, also referred to as \u201cblack money.\u201d The results have been mixed.Under one tax amnesty program, Indians owned up this year to about $10 billion in income on which taxes had not been paid, the Modi administration said last month. But another effort encouraging people to declare hidden assets and income abroad met with limited success.\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that whatever he has done on the corruption front is not enough,\u201d said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King\u2019s College London, noting that elections in India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, were expected to take place early next year. \u201cPolitically he probably felt he needed to do something more visible.\u201dWhile the currency plan had been under discussion for some time, few had expected such a bold step. Mr. Modi kept the decision quiet to prevent holders of vast amounts of unaccounted-for cash from outwitting the ban.The problems run deep.Global Financial Integrity, a Washington think tank, has estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit outflows of money in the decade leading up to 2011.But it is unclear what the full impact of the ban will be. Studies have shown that corruption can be curtailed by reducing cash transactions, but it is unlikely to be eliminated by the move.\u201cIt is regrettable this will inconvenience\u201d 1.29 billion people, said Pradip Shah, the founder and former managing director of Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited, one of India\u2019s first credit-rating agencies, without stopping \u201cthe flow of black money.\u201dEven so, the ban on large bills is very likely to hasten India\u2019s transition away from cash. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent to 25 percent in the United States, Britain and other countries, according to a report by Google India and the Boston Consulting Group.The new policy puts India at the \u201cleading edge of countries restricting the use of high-denomination currency notes that are now seen as mostly fueling illegal activities rather than legitimate commerce,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell.As the ban works its way through the system, the real estate market could face a shock.Indian politicians, among others, not only hold vast amounts of cash, but they are also heavily invested in real estate, where it has historically been easy to convert unaccounted-for money into legal currency. A large percentage of real estate deals are done in unaccounted for cash.Without that cash, real estate prices could fall sharply. And developers holding large amounts of unaccounted for cash would find it suddenly rendered virtually useless, making it hard for them to pay their bills and finish their projects.\u201cCan you imagine what\u2019s going happen in real estate tomorrow?\u201d said Mr. Kejriwal, who also anticipated a drop in the prices of gold and luxury items.The exchange process, too, could prove problematic.For the next two weeks, people will be able to exchange only 4,000 rupees a day, or about $60. People holding vast sums of unaccounted for cash will find it hard to exchange the money at banks because they will need to explain where they got it, risking tax investigations, experts said.\u201cIf I walk in with two crores,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal said, using the Indian term for 20 million rupees, or about $300,000, \u201cpeople will be worried that the government will be tracking my name and address.\u201d\u201cPeople will be scared,\u201d he added.Mr. Modi, in his speech, addressed the inconveniences the public would most likely experience in the coming days.\u201cBrothers and sisters, in spite of all these efforts, there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cExperience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make the sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The audience is invited to imagine a long-ago time \u2014 1986, to be precise \u2014 before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar), who accidentally travels more than 1,000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta.Saroo\u2019s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an out-of-service train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language.With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo\u2019s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling.But memories of his long-ago life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It\u2019s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you\u2019re not familiar with the true story behind \u201cLion,\u201d that the fairy tale will come true.Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O\u2019Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child \u2014 or a mother \u2014 this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent.At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I can\u2019t complain too much about that; for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also can\u2019t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don\u2019t-be-evil fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But we\u2019ve lost something, too, and we can\u2019t even see what it is.\u201cLion\u201d is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity.

This cultural movement is especially seen in the boutique gym market and the devotion of its members. Health food has been a cornerstone of the wellness movement as living a healthy lifestyle has become a kind of cultural movement. Healthy food is also impacting the environment as people look to \u201ceat clean.\u201dBicycles are more than just an evironmentally friendly way to get around. They have become a cultural explosion, with the boutique gym culture latching on to their popularity.Personal robotics are another area of technology looking to make our lives easier. This burgeoning marketplace is set to grow even more in upcoming years.Smart homes are using Internet of Things technology to make our lives easier, while also using less electricity and alternate electricity sources to create fewer emissions.Financial technology is turning banking on its head and will continue to grow as individuals look for smarter, faster and better ways to interact with their finances.In addition to their improved safety, self-driving cars will be a cultural phenomenon that yields environmental benefits as well.Wearables started out as fitness trackers, but as their technology gets more complex with each new iteration, their popularity has exploded within the fashion world.See how the experiences you love lead to surprising connections.Karla Dascal, a Miami-based entrepreneur who owns wellness center Sacred Space Miami, often travels to India for yoga retreats \u2014 and invests in companies she wants to see grow. For Dascal, health is a way of life. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have your health, you have nothing,\u201d she says.Dascal started investing in health-and-wellness companies before most of her peers. Now, though, many of her friends are also buying wellness products, adopting healthier lifestyles and seeking rejuvenating experiences. \u201cPeople are now very interested in this,\u201d she says.The rise of small, high-end gyms supports that perception. In 2016, boutique gyms accounted for 42 percent of the total U.S. fitness-club market, double what it was in 2014. Members typically paid $80 to $140 a month for access to these gyms in 2014, significantly more than the $52 average for overall gym memberships. Organic foods and immersive wellness experiences \u2014 including healthy-eating retreats, outdoor fitness challenges and expert seminars on wellness-related topics \u2014 are also doing well. This growth is being seen in the uptick in IPOs of health and wellness companies over the past couple of years, including well-known gyms and healthy-snack makers.Investing in sustainability is another way people are putting their values to work \u2014 installing solar panels on their roofs, holding shares or making direct investments in renewable-energy technology, buying organic foods and purchasing electric cars. One indicator of the strength of the market for environmentally friendly products is the revenue gains enjoyed by electric-car manufacturers, who have built their business on the premise that people will pay a significant premium for sustainable products. From 2013 to 2015, Tesla\u2019s revenue doubled, to about $4 billion.And with individuals now building more environmentally friendly homes, interest in Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Powerwall is growing. The home battery will use electricity generated by solar panels to power the house. In some setups, homeowners will even be able to sell unused power back to the grid.Another area attracting investors with a purpose: water. David Wilson, head of the strategic analysts group at Capgemini, which tracks the habits of affluent individuals, says he\u2019s seeing people make direct investments in technology firms that support water purification or companies aiming to improve water sustainability in emerging markets. \u201cThey\u2019re making investment choices based on clearly defined objectives,\u201d Wilson says.As a result, desalination companies are likely to become a major focus. As droughts have become more frequent and widespread, there\u2019s greater urgency to develop cheaper and more efficient ways to remove the salt from seawater to make it drinkable. Once that technology is up and running, investors in these projects are likely to want to travel to see the results of their efforts in action.40% of high-net worth individuals consider themselves early adopters of technologyMany investors are also passionate about technology \u2014 they want everything from mobile gadgets and smart-home devices to optimized financial technology and personal robots. Some 40 percent of individuals in this income bracket say they are early adopters of technology, according to a study by Accenture.The same report found that 87 percent of investors with a net worth of at least $750,000 are using digital products to handle their financial needs. They\u2019re also upping their investments in FinTech-related endeavors \u2014 895 projects in 2015, four times more than in 2010. Meanwhile, venture capital firms have poured more than $4 billion into wearable-technology players in the past two years, up from just $333 million in 2011.Then, of course, there\u2019s the investment that has beckoned the heart and the portfolio of the affluent from time immemorial: art.The value of the online art market is estimated to increase by 193 percent between now and 2020In 2015, financial advisors surveyed by Knight Frank\u2019s Wealth Trends reported 63 percent of their clients were becoming more interested in buying paintings and sculpture. Wilson says he\u2019s seen a rise in art collecting among the wealthy, noting that \u201cpeople buy art for the aesthetic value \u2014 they can get a personal benefit from it every day, while at the same time it\u2019s an uncorrelated asset.\u201dThe difference today is that it\u2019s so much easier for potential collectors to explore what\u2019s out there than it used to be. Galleries are everywhere \u2014 not just in major international hotspots. But perhaps even more important has been the rise of online purveyors of paintings and sculpture, all vying to disrupt the closed and secretive global network of high-end art exchange. Online art sales rose 24 percent year-over-year in 2015, and the value of the online art market is forecast to soar 193 percent by 2020.Finding the best ways to invest in your values and passions isn\u2019t easy, but a financial advisor with experience counseling the wealthy can help, says Corley. \u201cThe good ones are continuously updating their knowledge (of investment options.)\u201dMeanwhile, investors\u2019 determination to use their money to express who they really are will no doubt continue to spread and strengthen. \u201cPeople are living longer,\u201d says Argyropoulos. \u201cSo they want to make a difference while they\u2019re alive. They want to be able to realize their dreams while they can.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "For Today\u2019s Giver, \u2018Robo-Advisers\u2019 Streamline Philanthropy", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byGiving Special SectionCharitable planning and giving is going \u201crobo.\u201dNew services are emerging that not only make giving automatic, but help you screen and select charities online that match your objectives. These \u201crobo-donors\u201d are also helping those who are tech-attuned to target their donations.Scott Yak, 27, a software developer with Google in New York City, came across a relatively new digital charity adviser called AgoraforGood.com, which screens more than one million nonprofits.Instead of just offering reports analyzing specific charities, Agora for Good creates customized, mutual-fund-like portfolios of nonprofits. The charities are grouped together based on 17 United Nations global development goals. Users can then assemble portfolios based on their specific objectives.\u201cI thought the fund concept was good,\u201d Mr. Yak said. \u201cI saw some charities that I never heard of and liked them. They were going in a direction I cared about.\u201dServices like Agora for Good join a new wave of online platforms that automate and streamline the donation process. They do much of the work for those looking to give by screening thousands of charities for the ones that align with a user\u2019s concerns and charitable mission. They are more data-driven and analytic as well, providing benchmarks for gauging how well the platform helped a user meet his or her goals.Other services are transaction-oriented such as AmazonSmile, which donates 0.5 percent of eligible purchases to a preferred charity. Other services that directly channel donations include Bright Funds, Google Wallet and PayPal.Angela Campbell, 32, chief executive of Agora for Good, said she started her venture to \u201cbring data and sophistication to online giving platforms.\u201dStarted in 2015, the service partners with donor groups that have cumulatively given more than $160 million per year to nonprofits. Ms. Campbell\u2019s goal is to channel more than $1 billion a year \u201cto address global poverty.\u201d To date, her service has handled more than one million transactions.Agora for Good, Ms. Campbell says, is targeting donors who seek a more tech-savvy, effective way of interacting with their philanthropy \u2014 many of whom are millennials \u2014 without middlemen like philanthropic advisers. There is a payment processing fee associated with the service of 1 percent to 5 percent; it is retained by Agora.There are also transaction fees such as 25 cents for donations from a bank account, and up to 3.25 percent for donations made via credit card.\u201cThe digital platform makes giving easier and more focused on progress,\u201d said Ms. Campbell, who, before joining Agora, had advised donors on investing more than $300 million in global development projects. She plans to enhance Agora for Good to make it friendlier for mobile devices and \u201cprovide push notifications on the charity\u2019s achievements to remind you to make regular donations.\u201dDespite the technological advances, though, how do users discern which nonprofit is going to best serve their specific charitable interests? Which is the most effective group trying to end the malarial scourge, for example? What are the strongest groups in the environmental or social justice arena?There is no lack of online information to rate charities based on their spending, mission and transparency. Some online services even group charities by their objective \u2014 such as environmental, international development and religious missions. But it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of charities and rankings available.All this information can be tough to review if you do not know exactly what to look for to gauge a charity\u2019s effectiveness. If you need more hand-holding, you could consider a donor-advised fund. While it is much less automated, you can work with a major mutual fund company to pool your donations in cause-oriented mutual funds.Fidelity Charitable, for example, offers a \u201cGiving Account\u201d that makes Fidelity the administrator for your donations to specific charities. You can donate cash, stocks or other assets to the account and write off from 30 percent to 50 percent in deductions from your taxable income.As with other donor-advised services, Fidelity levies annual fees based on a percentage of assets under management: 0.06 percent for administration and up to 1.23 percent for investment management. Any money not donated is invested and can grow over time. The Vanguard Group offers a similar service, along with other major mutual fund managers.Whether millennials or older generations will adopt the digital charity screeners remains to be seen. Millions of donors still give on impulse \u2014 in reaction to a natural disaster, for example.For a giver, streamlining charitable planning does take time and thought, although the technology is not perfect at screening millions of nonprofits for overall effectiveness, which is often hard to measure.\u201cThere\u2019s a data challenge,\u201d said Evan Paul, vice president of products for GuideStar. \u201cThere are no standard metrics or common math for evaluating charities.\u201dSimplifying and automating the charitable process is a game changer for those who want to give but do not want to or cannot devote much time to sorting through their objectives and vetting individual charities. It may speed their donations to the right charities with considerably less frustration.\u201cI\u2019m able to align my actions with my values,\u201d Mr. Yak said of his current philanthropic strategy. \u201cIt makes my life more meaningful over all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that offers a \u201cGiving Account.\u201d It is Fidelity Charitable, not Fidelity Investments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Election Surprise, Marketers Rethink How to Study Consumers", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe presidential race was not far from the minds of executives from America\u2019s biggest brands and advertising agencies last month in Orlando, Fla., at the annual conference held by the Association of National Advertisers. The industry leaders had traveled from cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco, and any political conversation seemed to be premised on the assumption that Hillary Clinton would win.There was some talk about how to best market to Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters after Nov. 8 and debate about what a potential Trump media organization might look like. Many were aghast that the race was close at all, criticizing aspects of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s branding and messaging for holding her back in what they thought should have a no-brainer for voters.So when Mr. Trump won the election last week, an industry that prides itself on always knowing what motivates and excites the American public was in a state of shock. Marketers now find themselves asking serious questions about how they study consumers, use data and quantify the value of facts \u2014 questions about the fundamental nature of their business.Advertisers, like many others, \u201cmay have found ourselves in bubbles of our own making,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist for the Publicis Groupe.That information should now be supplemented with \u201csocial listening\u201d on Twitter, Reddit and other parts of the internet, and behavioral data including what people are searching for online, said Ms. Hofstetter, whose agency has worked with brands like Oscar Mayer and Toyota.\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d she said. \u201cOne data set is not going to give you the full picture, because with people, what people say is not always what they think or what they do, whether intentional or not.\u201dAt the same time, advertisers are prepared for a new period of second-guessing any customer data, whether it has been gathered internally or supplied by the brands they work with. Some of that is rooted in recognizing the one-sided nature of the world they experienced on Facebook and Twitter during the election.\u201cIn a world of social and filtered media, we are not getting enough signals that we might be wrong,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said. \u201cAll marketers must actually look for evidence and actually search out why they may not be right.\u201dRob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be scrutiny on data and a big demand from clients saying, \u2018Yes, there\u2019s data, and what do we really know? Who\u2019s been to Kansas to understand what they\u2019re consuming in Kansas, and is it the same in Nebraska? And don\u2019t just Google it.\u2019\u201dSome marketers have been left wondering if facts and reason matter less than they expected \u2014 a counterintuitive discovery in the age of information.\u201cFacts are sort of, \u2018I might take them or I might not,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly discretionary now, so there is that notion as a marketer and advertiser of understanding we live in a postfactual democracy.\u201dMr. Tobaccowala remarked that \u201cemotion brings people out, reason probably doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou had a candidate who was more experienced and probably had a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 better than anyone to be president of the United States defeated by a candidate with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 who is least likely to be president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cOne spoke to reason and the other spoke to emotion.\u201d\u201cThe story of \u2018I\u2019m taking on big government\u2019 was more compelling at this point in history than the story of, \u2018I\u2019m going to keep this thing going and make it incrementally better\u2019 and the story of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the story of experience can be really soothing for people and really be the thing that captures people\u2019s imaginations. The Bernie narrative and the Trump narrative is the same.\u201dSome see a broader lesson in the rejection of experience by the electorate. Richard Edelman, the chief executive of the public relations company Edelman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter \u2014 which he often used to forcefully attack Mrs. Clinton and the news media \u2014 and reduced reliance on traditional TV ads showed the power of \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d communication.\u201cThe more effective messaging might be from the mass population as opposed to using celebrities and using media and academics,\u201d he said.Ms. Clark said on Thursday that she was eager for people to \u201clean back into being Americans,\u201d especially after \u201cthe level of dialogue that took place,\u201d a reference to the often ugly nature of the campaign. She anticipates more ads highlighting values like the importance of diversity as the nation works to find common ground.\u201cBrands can shape culture, so I think in that sense brands have a responsibility to represent their values and talk about them,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re an inclusive brand \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more democratic to me than inclusion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Expected to Seek Deep Cuts in Business Regulations", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe unwinding of Dodd-Frank. The firing up of shuttered coal plants. The rollback of rules that increase overtime pay for low-wage workers.Hours after Donald J. Trump won the race for the White House, scores of regulations that have reshaped corporate America in the last eight years suddenly seemed vulnerable.While many questions remain about how Mr. Trump will govern, a consensus emerged Wednesday in many circles in Washington and on Wall Street about at least one aspect of his impending presidency: Mr. Trump is likely to seek vast cuts in regulations across the banking, health care and energy industries.\u201cThis is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan,\u201d Stephen Moore, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThere are just so many regulations that could be eased.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump is a maverick politician, his anti-regulation stance is that of an old-school Republican. It is driven by a belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from the long arm of the federal government.Or at least that is what some analysts and economists say they think is Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale. Even after a long campaign of endless rallies and debates, Mr. Trump and his closest advisers have disclosed relatively few specific economic policy proposals.And some of what he has proposed seems contradictory. For example, he has said he would roll back the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, while his party platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Trump will probably find common ground with many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, on cutting regulation. They clashed during the campaign over Mr. Trump\u2019s past conduct toward women and inflammatory statements about ethnic groups, and many Republicans do not see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on immigration and trade.\u201cBut Ryan and Trump are like-minded on regulation in a way they are not on trade and immigration,\u201d said Ted Gayer, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThat is red meat for both of them.\u201dHere is a rundown on how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could gut regulations from Wall Street to Silicon Valley:A clean Republican sweep of the White House and Congress would normally be greeted by loud cheers across Wall Street.But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is not a clear boon for bankers and financiers in the way that past Republican wins have been.On paper, many of his campaign proposals appear to favor banks and investors, including a promise to undo Dodd-Frank, which was passed after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet repealing the law and its many rules seems unlikely to gain much traction in Congress. And even many banks admit they have spent so much time and money complying with the law, they would rather keep it.Several Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that they did not expect Congress to completely repeal Dodd-Frank. Instead of undertaking such a costly and controversial effort, one likely possibility is that the Trump administration and Congress would take aim at a handful of specific rules that most irritate the banks, including what is known as the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of Dodd-Frank that prohibits banks from placing risky bets with their own money.Otherwise, many of the expected changes would benefit small and midsize banks rather than Wall Street banks. Regulators, for example, could raise the size at which a bank is subject to Dodd-Frank\u2019s enhanced oversight.Other pieces of Dodd-Frank could be picked off, like reining in the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a hallmark of the Obama administration.Mr. Trump could prune other low-hanging financial regulations, including a newly enacted Department of Labor rule that holds investment advisers liable for certain advice to their clients.He also promised on the campaign trail to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that increases the wealth of private equity executives.And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign took aim at the honey pot of global banking revenue: free trade. For decades, banks have benefited from facilitating deals and lending to companies worldwide.\u201cProbably more so than any president in modern history it will be difficult to predict what issues he latches onto,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official in the Obama administration, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.MICHAEL CORKERY, BEN PROTESS and LESLIE PICKERIn the energy industry, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first targets, according to Mr. Moore, an economic adviser, is President Obama\u2019s effort to limit carbon emissions at coal-fired utilities.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say the rule drove coal companies into bankruptcy, even though the industry says that its problems are mostly caused by waning demand.It is unclear whether the election of Mr. Trump can help struggling coal miners get back their jobs, but it will almost certainly upend the world\u2019s efforts to curb the impact of global warming.While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete dismemberment of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, a Trump administration could significantly weaken or slow them.Mr. Trump has said that he would do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. The rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and not arguing for the rules, Mr. Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.A Trump administration could weaken, or even repeal, the rules governing fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for new cars and trucks.Oil and natural gas executives are hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver for them, too. They want a loosening of methane emission standards for existing oil wells and the opening of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a big difference,\u201d said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, an Oklahoma company.CORAL DAVENPORT, CLIFFORD KRAUSS and HIROKO TABUCHIAs income inequality and stagnant wages became a major preoccupation among voters, the Obama administration brought regulations and enforcement actions intended to increase the leverage of workers. Most of these efforts are now endangered by the prospect of a Republican president and Republican Congress.In theory, the regulation could be undone by the Trump administration through a rule-making process similar to the one that produced it. But this could take months, if not years. Instead, some lobbyists expect Congress to pass a legislative compromise that would rein in the overtime rule, by phasing it in over a number of years, and by limiting or undoing the automatic upward adjustment in the salary threshold every three years.Mr. Obama enacted a number of other policies through executive order rather than a more involved rule-making process, and these could be undone by a President Trump almost immediately, with the stroke of a pen. These include rules that increased the minimum wage and granted paid sick days to workers hired by federal contractors.Trump administration appointees could quickly reject such interpretations and enforce the law differently, said Marc Freedman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the N.L.R.B. could easily reverse such rulings.NOAM SCHEIBERThe idea of a Trump presidency triggered a sense of dread among many people in the liberal-leaning technology business.Mr. Trump is seen as less favorably disposed toward the concentration of power among the handful of large companies that dominate the internet, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate firm\u201cI think Donald Trump may be facile with Twitter but mostly feels hostility towards these companies and their size,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.During the campaign, Mr. Trump told an audience in May that \u201cwe\u2019re going get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\u201dMany technology executives have called that idea far-fetched since most of Apple\u2019s supply chain, including many of its parts makers, are in Asia.Mr. Trump also blasted Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, saying that he was using the political influence of The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns, to discourage government action against Amazon on tax and antitrust issues.And Mr. Trump has called for the rejection of AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner.Still, analysts expect that he will appoint antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department who will largely follow traditional Republican approaches to the free market.Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment.Mr. Trump will be under pressure by major telecom and cable firms to roll back aspects of net neutrality. The rule inhibits how broadband providers manage traffic on their networks to ensure any website is equally accessible to consumers.Telecom and cable firms continue to challenge the rules in court and Mr. Trump, with the encouragement of Republicans in Congress, may seek to abandon the regulation.NICK WINGFIELD, VINDU GOEL and CECILIA KANG\u201cThe truth is, who knows?\u201d said Ron Cohen, chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics and the chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry trade group. \u201cWe still have to deal with the basic issues that are confronting us as an industry, and those have not changed just because of an election.\u201dOutrage over the rising cost of prescription drugs has spiked in recent years as Americans struggle to pay for their medicines. Egregious examples of price increases, like those on Mylan\u2019s EpiPen and older drugs sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, prompted congressional hearings and investigations.At the same time, the drug industry has gone to war with insurers and employers who pay for their workers\u2019 health coverage. Those dynamics, several people said, have not changed, and outrage over high drug prices is seen as a bipartisan issue.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump placed less emphasis on the issue than Mrs. Clinton did during the campaign.KATIE THOMASAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byIt was a rough night for number crunchers. And for the faith that people in every field \u2014 business, politics, sports and academia \u2014 have increasingly placed in the power of data.Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory ran counter to almost every major forecast \u2014 undercutting the belief that analyzing reams of data can accurately predict events. Voters demonstrated how much predictive analytics, and election forecasting in particular, remains a young science: Some people may have been misled into thinking Hillary Clinton\u2019s win was assured because some of the forecasts lacked context explaining potentially wide margins of error.The election prediction business is one small aspect of a far-reaching change across industries that have increasingly become obsessed with data, the value of it and the potential to mine it for cost-saving and profit-making insights. It is a behind-the-scenes technology that quietly drives everything from the ads that people see online to billion-dollar acquisition deals.But data science is a technology advance with trade-offs. It can see things as never before, but also can be a blunt instrument, missing context and nuance. All kinds of companies and institutions use data quietly and behind the scenes to make predictions about human behavior. But only occasionally \u2014 as with Tuesday\u2019s election results \u2014 do consumers get a glimpse of how these formulas work and the extent to which they can go wrong.This year, Facebook\u2019s algorithm took down the image, posted by a Norwegian author, of a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs. The software code saw a violation of the social network\u2019s policy prohibiting child pornography, not an iconic photo of the Vietnam War and human suffering.This week\u2019s failed election predictions suggest that the rush to exploit data may have outstripped the ability to recognize its limits.\u201cState polls were off in a way that has not been seen in previous presidential election years,\u201d said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who is a co-founder of the Princeton Election Consortium. He speculated that polls may have failed to capture Republican loyalists who initially vowed not to vote for Mr. Trump, but changed their minds in the voting booth.Beyond election night, there are broader lessons that raise questions about the rush to embrace data-driven decision-making across the economy and society.The enthusiasm for big data has been fueled by the success stories of Silicon Valley giants born on the internet, like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The digital powerhouses harvest vast amounts of user data using clever software for search, social networks and online commerce. Data is the fuel, and algorithms borrowed from the tool kit of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, are the engine.The early commercial use for the technology has been to improve the odds of making a sale \u2014 through targeted ads, personalized marketing and product recommendations. But big-data decision-making is increasingly being embraced in every industry, and to make higher-stakes decisions that crucially affect people\u2019s lives \u2014 like helping to make medical diagnoses, hiring choices and loan approvals.The danger, data experts say, lies in trusting the data analysis too much without grasping its limitations and the potentially flawed assumptions of the people who build predictive models.Mr. Brynjolfsson said that people often do not understand that if the chance that something will happen is 70 percent, that means there is a 30 percent chance it will not occur. The election performance, he said, is \u201cnot really a shock to data science and statistics. It\u2019s how it works.\u201dSo, what happened with the election data and algorithms? The answer, it seems, is a combination of the shortcomings of polling, analysis and interpretation, perhaps both in how the numbers were presented and how they were understood by the public.Mr. Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, and Mr. Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium said state polling errors were largely to blame for the underestimates of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning.In addition to the polling errors, data scientists said the inherent weakness of election models might have caused some forecasting errors. Before an election, forecasters use a combination of historical polls and recent polling data to predict a candidate\u2019s chance of winning. Some may also factor in other variables, such as giving higher weight to a candidate who is an incumbent.But even with decades of polls to analyze, it is difficult for forecasters to predict accurately a candidate\u2019s chance of winning the presidency months or even weeks ahead of time. Dr. Mutalik of Yale compared election modeling to weather forecasting.\u201cEven with the best models, it is difficult to predict the weather more than 10 days out because there are so many small changes that can cause big changes,\u201d Dr. Mutalik said. \u201cIn mathematics, this is known as chaos.\u201dBut, unlike weather prediction, current election models tend to take into account only several decades\u2019 worth of data. And changing the parameters of that data set can also significantly affect calculations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Helped Create Trump, and That\u2019s Bad for It", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the election of Donald J. Trump, technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency.Facebook and Google, for example, have both carried fake, frequently incendiary, articles that were highly shared by their users; Twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well, while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far-right hate groups organize and recruit, frequently targeting women and minorities on the site.The leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldn\u2019t try to police political debates. Facebook explains that it can\u2019t be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization.Nice try. These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels. They see America as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The American auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia. Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, said on Twitter that \u201cDetroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity. That is what is to be avoided.\u201dHere is the explanation from Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn\u2019s founder and a Clinton supporter, for Detroit\u2019s failures: \u201cThe overriding problem was this: The auto industry got too comfortable,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cThe Start-Up of You\u201d (the title alone speaks volumes). \u201cThe moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular.\u201d He also attacked any notion of continuity: \u201cInstead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst, they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism.\u201dMr. Hoffman goes further, arguing that it\u2019s not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world. People must harness them, as well.\u201cThe conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Information is limited. Resources are tight. Competition is fierce. The world is changing. And the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking. This means you need to be adapting all the time. And if you fail to adapt, no one \u2014 not your employer, not the government \u2014 is going to catch you when you fall.\u201dIt\u2019s an exhausting, Darwinian life he is describing \u2014 endlessly adapting to a changing, pitiless world. And it\u2019s precisely the opposite kind of life that Mr. Trump was espousing. His voters wish to return to the inefficient, enthusiastically nepotistic (you might call it family-based) factory life of the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 when America was great. Mr. Trump promised to bring his supporters\u2019 jobs back; the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy.It\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy. But at least he wasn\u2019t publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working Uber driver.There is one final irony. Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals. In the election, the biggest beneficiary of disruption was Mr. Trump, who defied all rules around decency, responsibility, truthfulness, consistency and even social custom, like releasing tax returns. And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied. Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalism also threatens the global consensus that is so important to the expansion of the tech giants. Yesterday, Russian authorities blocked LinkedIn over a data storage law.How do you like your disruption now?Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why \u2018Locker Room Talk\u2019 is No Excuse", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorThe news at Harvard broke late last week, when the university canceled the rest of the men\u2019s soccer season after discovering that team members had been rating their female counterparts based on various physical characteristics, using a numerical scale and lewd sexual terms. Team members called it their \u201cscouting report,\u201d and they circulated it online as a Google Doc. The swift punishment from the university came after an investigation found that the practice originated several years ago but continued into this season.That headline caught the attention of several readers, and for good reason. Stephen Benson, of Melbourne, Fla., put it well.This story was not about a casual comment tossed off without thinking. These were written, detailed descriptions of women\u2019s bodies and sexual positions. They were written by men who had been accepted to the premier university in the country. To call it locker room talk is to dismiss it as Trump has with his own recorded comments. It minimizes the men\u2019s actions and demeans the women\u2019s experience that resulted.I couldn\u2019t agree more. Calling it locker room talk, by most any standard usage, is a way of diminishing the offensive language or behavior of those being drawn into question. That\u2019s precisely why Trump rushed to use the phrase, and it\u2019s why others reach for the term too: It signifies that the behavior in question is normal, harmless and nothing to fret over.I asked Charles Knittle, the editor who wrote the headline, what his thinking was in choosing this expression. Here is his rather elaborate reasoning:My task in this headline was to convey a snapshot of the story that summarized what happened and suggested why we thought it was worth the front page. Obviously, I did not succeed completely or unanimously. But I actually think it was a very good headline. It took the phrase that Donald Trump used to dismiss and rationalize his own vulgar and patronizing speech and moved it out of Billy Bush\u2019s bus and onto the campus in Cambridge. It conveyed the message that this kind of arrogant and misogynistic attitude is not confined to the entertainment world but extends well into our supposed American elite.And Knittle added:The headline was couched in the diplomacy of Page 1, but its point was to cry out against the very complacency and dismissiveness that your letter writer is accusing us of. But I still think its point was clear: The phrase \u2018locker room talk\u2019 became a pejorative in the American vernacular as soon as the Trump tape exposed it.Got that? Perhaps if headlines came with footnotes, more readers would be wise to The Times\u2019s reinterpretation of the term. Until then, we\u2019re left with current usage, which to my mind is pretty clear: When someone refers to men\u2019s behavior as \u201clocker room talk\u201d it is a means of relegating it to the harmless, the playful, that which should not be taken too seriously by those who might claim offense.If the men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s actions were simply viewed as \u201clocker room talk\u201d by Harvard officials, I suspect they wouldn\u2019t have shut the team out of a chance to win its division title and go to the N.C.A.A. tournament. A chance to publicly and bluntly scold them.Under New York Times usage, it indeed seems to be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Automated Pro-Trump Bots Overwhelmed Pro-Clinton Messages, Researchers Say", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 An automated army of pro-Donald J. Trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting Hillary Clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election, according to a report published Thursday by researchers at Oxford University.The chatbots \u2014 basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills \u2014 would send messages on Twitter based on a topic, usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol, like #Clinton.\u201cThey\u2019re yelling fools,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cAnd a lot of what they pass around is false news.\u201dIn some cases, the bots would post embarrassing photos, make references to the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server, or produce false statements, for instance, that Mrs. Clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail.Because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers, it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign, except for a handful of \u201cjoke\u201d bots created by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, they noted.However, there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort.\u201cThere does seem to be strategy behind the bots,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cBy the third debate, Trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing Clinton hashtags.\u201dA hashtag is used to indicate a Twitter post\u2019s topic. By adopting hashtags relating to Mrs. Clinton, the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among Clinton supporters.After the election, the bot traffic declined rapidly, with the exception of some pro-Trump programs that gloated, \u201cWe won and you lost,\u201d Dr. Howard said.Trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags.\u201cAnyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the U.S. election had an effect on voters\u2019 opinions or influenced the national Twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how Twitter works,\u201d said Nick Pacilio, a Twitter spokesman.The researchers based their study on a collection of about 19.4 million Twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of November. They selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least 50 times a day.\u201cFor example, the top 20 accounts, which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts, averaged over 1,300 tweets a day and they generated more than 234,000 tweets,\u201d the researchers noted. \u201cThe top 100 accounts, which still used high levels of automation, generated around 450,000 tweets at an average rate of 500 tweets per day.\u201dThe Oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote.The researchers have coined the term \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.The bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well. During the British campaign, they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around Israeli-Palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro-Brexit. After the vote, the bots returned to their original issue.In the case of the American election, the researchers noted that \u201chighly automated accounts \u2014 the accounts that tweeted 450 or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period \u2014 generated close to 18 percent of all Twitter traffic about the presidential election.\u201dThey also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports.One of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call \u201cselective affinity.\u201d\u201cClinton supporters will cut the Trump supporters out of their network, and Trump supporters will do the same,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cThe polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self-groom our news networks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Social Media\u2019s Globe-Shaking Power", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtYet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news. In fact, the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the world: With billions of people glued to Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, Twitter, Weibo and other popular services, social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political force, to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events.The election of Donald J. Trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the planet, social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society. They have subsumed and gutted mainstream media. They have undone traditional political advantages like fund-raising and access to advertising. And they are destabilizing and replacing old-line institutions and established ways of doing things, including political parties, transnational organizations and longstanding, unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia.Most important, because these services allow people to communicate with one another more freely, they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among once-marginalized groups. These ad hoc social movements range widely in form, from \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacists in the United States to Brexiters in Britain to ISIS in the Middle East to the hacker collectives of Eastern Europe and Russia. But each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable power, resulting in unpredictable, sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms.\u201cYou now have billions of people on the internet, and most of them are not that happy with the status quo,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a research firm that forecasts global risks. \u201cThey think their local government is authoritarian. They think they\u2019re on the wrong side of the establishment. They\u2019re aggrieved by identity politics and a hollowed-out middle class.\u201dMany factors accounted for Mr. Trump\u2019s win: middle-class economic anxiety in the industrial Midwest; an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national direction; and some mix of latent racism, xenophobia and sexism across the electorate. But as even Mr. Trump acknowledged in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired Sunday, social media played a determining role in the race.\u201cThrough this new technology, people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their grievances,\u201d Mr. Bremmer said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for social media, I don\u2019t see Trump winning.\u201dFor people who like an orderly, predictable world, this is the scariest thing about Facebook; not that it may be full of lies (a problem that could potentially be fixed), but that its scope gives it real power to change history in bold, unpredictable ways.But that\u2019s where we are. It\u2019s time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the world-shattering forces that their boosters long promised they would be \u2014 and to be unnerved, rather than exhilarated, by the huge social changes they could uncork.This should come as no surprise. In a way, we are now living through a kind of bizarro version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media.Over much of the last decade, we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world. There was the Green Revolution in Iran and the Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa. In the United States, we saw the Occupy Wall Street movement and the #BlackLivesMatter protests.Social networks also played a role in electoral politics \u2014 first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of Howard Dean in 2003, and then in the election of the first African-American president in 2008.The Islamic State has used social networks to recruit jihadists from around the world to fight in Iraq and Syria, as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas.And in the United States, both Bernie Sanders, a socialist who ran for president as a Democrat, and Mr. Trump, who was once reviled by most members of the party he now leads, relied on online movements to shatter the political status quo.Why is this all happening now? Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University who has studied the effects of social networks, suggested a few reasons.\u201cWhen the technology gets boring, that\u2019s when the crazy social effects get interesting,\u201d Mr. Shirky said.\u201cWhite ethnonationalism was kept at bay because of pluralistic ignorance,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cEvery person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the TV about immigrants or was willing to say white Christians were more American than other kinds of Americans \u2014 they didn\u2019t know how many others shared their views.\u201dThanks to the internet, now each person with once-maligned views can see that he\u2019s not alone. And when these people find one another, they can do things \u2014 create memes, publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview, and then break into the mainstream. The groups also become ready targets for political figures like Mr. Trump, who recognize their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for real-world victories.Mr. Shirky notes that the Overton Window isn\u2019t just shifting on the right. We see it happening on the left, too. Mr. Sanders campaigned on an anti-Wall Street platform that would have been unthinkable for a Democrat just a decade ago.Now, after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, the way forward for Democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on Facebook as by elites in Washington \u2014 and, as a result, we\u2019re likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past.The upshot is further unforeseen events. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely going to get more of these insurgent candidates, and more crazy social effects,\u201d Mr. Shirky said.Mr. Trump is just the tip of the iceberg. Prepare for interesting times.Advertisement"}

(The buses were, in fact, hired by a company called Tableau Software, which was holding a conference that drew more than 13,000 people.) \u201cI did think in the back of my mind there could be other explanations, but it just didn\u2019t seem plausible,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he had posted as a \u201cprivate citizen who had a tiny Twitter following.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m also a very busy businessman and I don\u2019t have time to fact-check everything that I put out there, especially when I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going out there for wide consumption.\u201d Sean Hughes, the director of corporate affairs for the bus company Coach USA North America, said he learned about the rumor involving its vehicles after receiving a couple of curious emails and hearing from a friend in New Jersey who had seen the claim on Facebook and wanted to know if it was true.\u201cThat reporter said, \u2018You\u2019re probably going to get a lot more phone calls because it\u2019s all over the place,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hughes said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019re the second journalist to actually call me to see what was going on, no bloggers or anything, and we\u2019re easily accessible on our website,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.He added, \u201cI just kind of wish people looked into facts before they go ahead and do something like that, because it could be easily debunked based on a quick phone call or two, or a couple emails.\u201d Mr. Tucker considered deleting his tweet about the buses, but Mr. Trump\u2019s message emboldened him. \u201cI figured if he were to say something like that, I might be barking up the same tree,\u201d Mr. Tucker said. When asked if Mr. Trump might have been relying, at least tangentially, on the erroneous message he had sent about the buses, Mr. Tucker said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say why Trump tweeted when he tweeted. I just don\u2019t know and I truthfully don\u2019t think any of us will ever know.\u201dDoreen Jarman, a spokeswoman for Tableau, said the company issued a statement to the local television station KVUE and The Austin American-Statesman on Nov. 11, saying that the buses were connected to the company\u2019s conference. After midnight, Mr. Tucker deleted his original tweet, then posted an image of it stamped with the word \u201cfalse\u201d for posterity. It did not receive much attention. After a week, that message had 29 retweets and 27 likes. The Snopes article has been shared about 5,800 times according to its website, a fraction of the number for the fake version of the news. Faced with the impact of his initial tweet, Mr. Tucker, who now has about 960 Twitter followers, allowed himself a moment of reflection. \u201cAnytime you see me in the future going out there where I think there\u2019s going to be a big audience, I can assure you I\u2019m going to try my best to be balanced with the facts and be very clear about what is opinion and what is not,\u201d Mr. Tucker said. If he could go back, he said, \u201cI might have still tweeted it but very differently. I think it goes without saying I would have tried to make a more objective statement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It suggested that she had died, at age 45, leaving us without \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite news reporter.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a news story written by a Times reporter. And it isn\u2019t true: Kelly is alive and prosperous, exceptionally so. But it has appeared, with some regularity, on the Times website, as an advertisement pretending to be a news story.In other words, it\u2019s fake news, or at least a version of it.Harvey, a Times reader from Reno, Nev., has been noticing the ad awhile now, and wrote me this week to complain. \u201cThis ad, or \u2018clickbait,\u2019 keeps popping up on various New York Times pages online,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is unacceptable. Please stop these ads, which frankly make me feel like the NY Times is no better an outlet than the horrifying Facebook feeds with all of their fake news clickbait items.\u201dHow could such fraudulent content wind up on the Times website? Through something called programmatic advertising, which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people. It\u2019s machine to machine, like a stock market matching buyers with sellers.Both The Times\u2019s newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid false, misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site. But it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads automatically, without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits.Sebastian Tomich, a senior vice president in advertising, says The Times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false Megyn Kelly claim. But the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact \u2014 once the ad has already appeared.Thus, the Kelly ad has now been reported and taken down. Tomich says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently.Tomich says The Times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business. I agree. Relative to the size of the site and the volume of advertising, The Times doesn\u2019t have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about weight-loss remedies.As measured by sheer impact, there is no comparison between a handful of fake-news ads on the Times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on Facebook. One is a brook, the other is an ocean.But there are similarities too. Both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys readers, and that can diminish a brand.Fake-news ads like the Megyn Kelly one may not be rampant at The Times, but it\u2019s still worth taking a good look at whether The Times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them. That\u2019s particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash point, and when The Times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Beauty Means Bleached Skin", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "A multibillion-dollar industry of skin-whitening products dominates the West African cosmetics market, creating a world of mixed messages for the women who live there.Supported byACCRA, Ghana \u2014 Semiratu Zakaru was standing in the hot sun on a crowded noontime street explaining why Ghana\u2019s new ban against certain skin-bleaching creams was unlikely to work, when her friend, Desmond Kwamina Odonkor, walked up and interrupted our conversation, oozing confidence and game.\u201cYou have to stop bleaching,\u201d he said, sotto voce. Then he winked at her and sauntered off.Ms. Zakaru, a 23-year-old hairdresser, rolled her eyes. His advice, in her view, was rubbish for the simple reason that \u201call of his girlfriends are light-skinned.\u201d She said she wasn\u2019t about to stop using the Viva White cream and Clinic Clear lotion that had, over the last year and a half, made her skin several shades lighter than her original chocolate-milk complexion.Here in the heart of the multibillion-dollar industry of products in West Africa that are meant to whiten skin, it is a world of mixed messages. Women are now being told that it is wrong, and even illegal, to bleach their skin. At the same time, they are flooded with messages \u2014 and not even subliminal ones \u2014 that tell them that white is beautiful.On Aug. 1, Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority began a ban on certain skin-whitening products that include hydroquinone, a topical ingredient that disrupts the synthesis and production of the melanin that can protect skin in the intense West African sunshine.But the ban in Ghana hasn\u2019t extended to removing the countless billboard advertisements on how to get \u201cperfect white\u201d skin. Nor have the creams and lotions disappeared from stores.In the Makola Market here, endless shops and stalls had walls filled with potions dedicated to the lightening of skin. There is Ultra Fair Super Whitenizer by Caring Chemistry promising \u201crestorative ultrafast action whitening\u201d and Grace White 100% Double Action Whitening Body Lotion by Grace White Cosmetique that even features helpful before-and-after photos; the \u201cbefore\u201d photo is a light-brown pair of legs, crossed, while the \u201cafter\u201d shot shows white legs.Nor, for that matter, have men here suddenly abandoned their decades-long pursuit of light-skinned women. Most of them won\u2019t say so. But it\u2019s long been the case here that the higher in society the man, the more likely his wife or girlfriend will have light skin. Do a Google-image search of \u201cwives of African presidents\u201d (\u201cprofessional football players\u201d and \u201cwealthy businessmen\u201d can also be substituted).In Accra, one of the authority representatives sent to speak to reporters about the ban sparked hilarity among cameramen over what they said was her own artificially lightened skin.Not long after, the Ghanaian government\u2019s chief officer in charge of putting the ban in place, during an interview at his office, expressed relief that his 3-year-old daughter\u2019s skin is not as dark as his own. \u201cLuckily,\u201d said Emmanuel Nkrumah, \u201cshe\u2019s lighter than me.\u201dIn expressing a father\u2019s natural wish that his child will not face the racism that he has faced, Mr. Nkrumah, in one word, captured the inherent conflict in what Ghanaian officials are trying to do. They are banning the products that give women lighter skin (although no one believes the ban will work) without banning the social messaging that tells women they should have lighter skin.Walking out of Mr. Nkrumah\u2019s office after our interview, my two colleagues and I kept tripping over his use of the word \u201cluckily.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe he said \u2018luckily,\u2019\u201d I said to Eugenia Tenkorang, a Ghanaian who came along with me to the interview.But I knew what he meant.\u201cLuckily\u201d because his daughter was less likely to be told that she was too dark-skinned to be beautiful. \u201cLuckily\u201d because his daughter wouldn\u2019t see billboards in Accra and wonder why no one up there looked like her. Mr. Nkrumah\u2019s \u201cluckily\u201d was an acknowledgment of a fact of life without the filter of the politically correct.That fact had been made clear to Eugenia and me as we reported this situation.For my part, I am a native of Liberia, but a descendant of the freed American slaves who colonized the country in 1822 and who had mated at one point or another with American whites, so I\u2019m more of a coffee with milk, considered light-skinned by West African standards. Eugenia, from Larteh in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, has a deep chocolate bark complexion. She is a head-turner.And yet the three of us were told repeatedly that Jane and I had the preferred skin tones. \u201cWe wear it to look nice like you,\u201d Beatrice Lampty, a market woman in the Jamestown neighborhood, had told me and Jane hours before.\u201cWhen I had a fair lady here as my secretary, people were trooping into my office all the time,\u201d said Dr. Edmund Nminyem Delle, a dermatologist who for three decades has campaigned against skin bleaching, in acknowledging that women are pressured to bleach. \u201cShe was a half-caste lady. I wanted to marry her.\u201d He ended up marrying a different light-skinned woman, and says that his sons, one dark and one light, both prefer light-skinned women.\u201cPlease excuse what I\u2019m about to say,\u201d Mr. Nkrumah, the authority official, had apologized to Eugenia during our interview, before gesturing toward me and Jane. \u201cBut if you find 10 men, you will find only two who will say you are more attractive than these two ladies.\u201dEugenia, who doesn\u2019t bleach, exhibits a supreme sense of self-confidence. \u201cI see them,\u201d she said, referring to all the ads and messaging. \u201cDo they bother me? No. I\u2019ve grown to appreciate me.\u201dBut many women don\u2019t have Eugenia\u2019s innate sense of self-worth.\u201cMy younger sisters were light-skinned and I was dark,\u201d said Comfort Arthur, 31, an animated filmmaker. \u201cThe whole while we were growing up, people always said how beautiful they were.\u201d When her mother gave her a black Barbie doll, she remembers crying that \u201cI want the white one.\u201dAs a child, the constant comparisons to her sisters became singed into her psyche and stayed; at 23, she started bleaching her skin and turned several shades lighter until a close friend sat her down and gave her a lecture. Ms. Arthur\u2019s looks had completely transformed; in addition to the lighter skin, she had a shoulder-length hair weave. \u201cWhat have you done to yourself?\u201d her friend asked her.Ms. Arthur eventually stopped bleaching and got rid of the weave. \u201cI realized I had low self-esteem,\u201d she said. Which was crazy; in addition to being naturally beautiful, Ms. Arthur had two master\u2019s degrees.It took her skin a year to return to its natural chocolate hue, and Ms. Arthur has been working since then on coming to terms with her view of herself. She wrote an animated film, \u201cBlack Barbie,\u201d that touches on her childhood experience.Her mother, Agnes Arthur, 55, said she is proud of how far her daughter has come. But Mrs. Arthur, who is lighter-skinned than Comfort, acknowledged that she, too, used to bleach. \u201cI stopped,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen a friend told me, \u2018Why are you being stupid? You are light enough already.\u2019\u201dIn the United States, the election of Donald J. Trump, who largely won on the strength of the white vote, has deeply unsettled many African-Americans, raising in the black community dormant questions about how great a role in daily life skin color still plays.The Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, in a New Yorker essay called \u201cMourning for Whiteness\u201d that was written after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, explored long-running assumptions that even Americans believe that white is better. As an example, Ms. Morrison wrote of simple day-to-day assumptions that accompany whiteness, including the \u201cconfidence that you will not be watched in a department store.\u201dAnd people bleach in Asia \u2014 lightening creams and lotions are as ubiquitous in drugstores in Seoul as eye shadow. They do it in Europe, despite the restrictions there on sales of hydroquinone. You can walk into any number of black beauty salons in London and find bleaching creams and lotions.But Africa? If you can\u2019t be dark-skinned in Africa, then where can you?The \u201cwhy\u201d goes back centuries, and says much about the searing effects of colonization that lingers today. When the Europeans colonized Africa, they brought with them centuries of belief that they were racially superior, and established a class structure that exists today, 50 years after African countries regained their independence.In many West African countries, at the top of that class structure, sit white expats, whether they are European diplomats in affluent neighborhoods, the United States Embassy staff members in their walled compounds or Lebanese merchants in electronic shops.Next in the hierarchy are the mixed-race people. The European colonists who came to Africa mated with Africans and produced mixed-race offspring, who were then deemed to be of a superior class to the full-blooded Africans. South Africa\u2019s apartheid system went so far as to legally enshrine mixed-race people, called \u201ccoloureds.\u201d\u201cAnyone in this country could see that the mulattos were given precedence everywhere,\u201d Dr. Delle said. \u201cThey were more educated, they were viewed as superior.\u201d In many African countries, the word \u201cmulatto\u201d does not have the negative connotation that it has in the United States.The view that the lighter your skin, the \u201cbetter\u201d you are did not leave the continent with the Europeans, and eventually, science caught up, as skin-lightening products became available throughout the continent.And it is not just women who lunged for bleach creams. Braimah Kamoko, the heavyweight boxer from Accra better known as Bukom Banku, caused a huge stir this year when he confirmed to reporters what everyone could already see: that he was obviously bleaching his naturally chocolate skin. Mr. Kamoko, in a few months, went from dark brown to a yellowish tan, courtesy, he said, of lightening cream.\u201cI am bleaching my skin because when John Mahama wins 2016 elections, he will make me Ghana ambassador to Germany,\u201d Mr. Kamoko told Radio Gold, referring to the Ghanaian president. Having lighter skin, he said, would enable \u201cGerman people to know that German people and Bukom Banku are one.\u201dMr. Kamoko got a lot of public ridicule for his disclosure, and by the time Eugenia, Jane and I tracked him down near his house in the Jamestown neighborhood, he had apparently stopped bleaching, as his complexion was dark again. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk. He gave us the slip, but not before saying that in his opinion, Ghana\u2019s ban was not going to stop people from bleaching.It\u2019s certainly difficult to see how the government is going to enforce the ban without addressing the advertising. Accra \u2014 Lome, Monrovia and Lagos as well \u2014 are teeming with ads that depict beauty as light-skinned. It\u2019s not just the bleach cream ads, and there are plenty of those \u2014 including one on Liberation Road, less than a kilometer from the Accra airport as you make your way into the city, that says \u201cPerfect White,\u201d under a photo of a smiling, light-skinned model with a ponytail. \u201cYour dreams can come true,\u201d the billboard promises.But regular advertisements for computers, for clothing, for banking services all show light-skinned women playing and frolicking and cooking and being otherwise \u201cfresh\u201d (another code word for lighter-skinned). Two side-by-side billboards on Oxford Street for a casino show African men surrounded by and having fun with white and light-skinned women.In fact, if you go by the billboards in Accra, you would be hard-pressed to believe that Ghana has any dark-skinned people.\u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d said Ama K. Abebrese, an actress. \u201cThere\u2019s not a day I don\u2019t drive into town and see a billboard that tells me I need perfect white skin. We are here in an African country, and it\u2019s like someone just hit you in your gut.\u201dMr. Nkrumah acknowledged that the ban is a micro step, and that adjustments will need to be made in education and social marketing to change the way society views black skin. But as a food and drug official, his job, he says, is to try to protect people from the harmful affects of skin bleach in the hot sun. \u201cWhen you bleach, it takes off the outer layers of your skin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this part of the world, the sun is always on. So there\u2019s more skin cancer.\u201dHe said there is a grace period until the end of the year, during which time there will be no prosecution of companies and merchants selling bleach creams with hydroquinone. After that, he said, enforcement authorities and even police officers will be going after sale of the creams.Over in Jamestown, Lydia Neequaye, 46, a biscuit seller who started bleaching her skin when she was 21, said that she is happy the government is banning the creams. \u201cWhat has it done for me?\u201d she said. Her face is discolored, with dark spots in some places and light spots in others.A few years ago, she stopped bleaching when she saw how discolored her skin was getting. Eventually, some parts of her skin returned to its original color.But many light spots still remain.Advertisement"}

But as the start-up world continues to move away from easily definable consumer or corporate products and services, investors have had to take less-charted paths.And so Spark, which formally announced on Monday its two latest investment funds, with a combined $1 billion in capital, has backed Cruise as well as some other eclectic companies: an upstart stock exchange called IEX, and Mark43, whose software helps police departments organize their records. Those investments sit alongside bets on more recognizable companies like Slack, the popular messaging software, and Wayfair, the online home furnishings retailer, which is now publicly traded.\u201cNo one knows what the next big platform is,\u201d Nabeel Hyatt, a Spark partner, said. \u201cNow is a new market time.\u201dThe firm, which has expanded to San Francisco and New York from its home base in Boston, has had some big wins. Tumblr, one of the firm\u2019s first investments, was acquired by Yahoo for almost $1 billion. Twitter, where Spark also got in on the ground floor, went public in 2013 with a market valuation of over $14 billion. And Oculus, the maker of virtual reality headsets, sold itself to Facebook for $2 billion.Not all of Spark\u2019s bets have paid off. The firm was an early backer of Foursquare, a location-based start-up that has lost much of its popularity and whose valuation was cut in half by January.Many of the best-known venture capital firms live on the fabled Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., but Spark was born in Boston in 2005. Two veteran venture capitalists, Santo Politi and Todd Dagres, said they believed that as the dot-com bust receded from memory, the time had come to make bets on consumer internet companies once more. And they persuaded Bijan Sabet, a longtime acquaintance and entrepreneur, to come on board.Relatively few firms, such as Union Square Ventures in New York, were ready to jump back into the consumer internet field, even as Facebook and Myspace were on the ascent.\u201cI think the lesson drawn from 2005 was, \u2018That\u2019s crazy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Politi said.In founding Spark, Mr. Politi and Mr. Sabet said, the idea was to create a firm that was different from many traditional venture capital shops, where partners specialized in, say, enterprise software or clean energy investments. Instead, each partner can bring any idea to the table, and after debate, the partners decide whether to pursue the opportunity.\u201cMost firms are market-first; they\u2019re in a market or not,\u201d Mr. Hyatt, a serial entrepreneur who joined Spark in 2012, said of other firms\u2019 focuses.Investing decisions are often made by reaching consensus, without strict voting. (The partners briefly tried formal voting on investment decisions \u2014 via Slack \u2014 but quickly scrapped the idea.)\u201cWhen entrepreneurs get married to us, you get married to the whole family,\u201d Mr. Sabet said.The firm\u2019s earliest and best-known bets were grounded in what Mr. Politi and Mr. Sabet called an appreciation for good product design. That has remained a constant, the two said, whether applied to a computer security start-up or the automated investments firm Wealthfront.\u201cIn my view, they\u2019re very smart and helpful investors, and really thoughtful about products and technology,\u201d John Lilly, a partner at Greylock Partners who worked with Mr. Sabet as a fellow investor in Tumblr, said in an email.All told, Spark oversees $3 billion in investment funds and has expanded the number of partners. One, Kevin Thau, is a former senior executive at Twitter, while another, Megan Quinn, came over from Kleiner Perkins.Like other venture firms, Spark broadened its focus and added a growth fund aimed at older companies in need of bigger sums of money. To lead the effort, Spark hired Jeremy G. Philips, a serial entrepreneur who got his start at McKinsey, to work out of its New York office, and later Ms. Quinn, to be based in San Francisco and offer her insight as a former product designer for Google and the payments company Square.The firm will now have more money to invest. Its fifth venture fund, announced Monday, will have $400 million under management, and its second growth fund will have $600 million.Spark\u2019s partners insist that the firm is unafraid of pushing into new industries, without slavish regard for whether there is an existing, easily defined market for a start-up\u2019s products. The Twitter investment, Mr. Hyatt argued, would not have been made if the firm had been focused that way.He also said that Spark tried to avoid investment fads.\u201cWe\u2019re not ambulance chasers,\u201d Mr. Hyatt said, though he added that the firm has invested in what became hot deals.On the flip side, some of its picks have been more esoteric. In June 2013, Spark invested in the first major round of Oculus, then just a promising virtual-reality start-up that subsequently became a sensation on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. Other venture firms joined in, and Oculus surprised many by selling itself to Facebook a year later.Spark was also one of the first venture firms to pour money into IEX, which was explicitly designed as the opposite of modern-day high-speed trading and gained fame as the subject of Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys.\u201d Alex Finkelstein, the Spark partner who led the investment and who learned about IEX from Mr. Lewis\u2019s book, praised the start-up\u2019s ambitions to shake up the world of stock market trading and the quality of its founders.And then there is the start-up Cruise. Kyle Vogt, one of its founders, recalled meeting several times with Mr. Hyatt and forming a personal connection. Several days after their third or fourth meeting, Mr. Vogt recalled, Mr. Hyatt came back with a \u201cridiculously complex\u201d financial model and analysis that proved to be accurate.\u201cThey \u2018got\u2019 the business, and they took the time to go deep,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.An article on Tuesday about the venture capital firm Spark gave an outdated name for the firm of John Lilly, who commented on Spark\u2019s track record. It is Greylock Partners, no longer Greylock Ventures.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elite Runners Ryan and Sara Hall Add Parenting to Their Workouts", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byWhen the elite distance runners Sara and Ryan Hall adopted four sisters from Ethiopia in October 2015, it was the start of a year of seismic changes for them.Ryan, 34, the fastest American distance runner ever, announced his retirement in January, and began zealously lifting weights, replenishing testosterone levels diminished by years of 100-mile weeks. Sara, 33, will race in the professional field of the New York City Marathon on Sunday, her third in a year.Their daughters have not only adapted to life in the United States but to life as children of some of the best runners in the world. The Halls, who met as All-Americans at Stanford, say over all their personal and professional transitions this year have intersected neatly, and building their new family has been as rewarding as any race.\u201cI keep saying to Ryan I can\u2019t believe how smooth this has been, they act like biological kids would, and I feel really thankful,\u201d said Sara. \u201cI think with adoption, you hear a lot of the negative stories about kids who have been through a lot and don\u2019t adapt well, which is good because you need to go in with eyes wide open, but sometimes you don\u2019t hear enough about the good things.\u201dIt was an integration of cultures that was eased in large part through running. Although the girls were not runners \u2014 they had been confined to the grounds of their Ethiopian orphanage for most of their lives \u2014 they had watched Ethiopia\u2019s celebrity distance runners on television. And many of the Halls\u2019s training partners were Ethiopian. At the Mammoth Lakes training camp in California, they lived down the street from the American Olympian Meb Keflezighi, who was born in Eritrea, which borders Ethiopia, and whose family had the Halls over for dinners of traditional injera flatbread, spicy stews and tea.Now their daughter Lily, 6, is in kindergarten; Jasmine, 8, is in third grade; Mia, 12, is in sixth grade; and Hana, 16, is a high school freshman, all in their local public schools. (Because they don\u2019t have birth certificates, the girls\u2019 ages were initially estimates. Dental X-rays now suggest that some of the girls are younger than originally thought, so the Halls have adjusted their birth dates accordingly.)Though the Halls\u2019s Northern California community of Redding is small, they know at least 30 other Ethiopians in the area, including four Ethiopian children adopted by another family four years ago who are now good friends of the Halls\u2019s children. The families shared the same social worker to help with the adoptions.The Halls say their strong Christian faith helps bond them. The children grew up in the Ethiopian Christian tradition and have integrated into the Halls\u2019s charismatic evangelical church.\u201cThey love our church and are thriving there,\u201d said Sara. \u201cFaith is a huge part of every aspect of life, like getting over trauma, and we use our faith in that process.\u201dAnd the girls have embraced their parents\u2019 athletic lifestyle. After watching the Olympics with her family this summer, Lily decided she wanted to start gymnastics, while Jasmine is playing soccer, just as Sara did as a child. The oldest two girls have both started running; when they ran track together last spring their retired Olympian father coached the team. They had a photo finish in the mile.The Halls often watch live feeds of races with some of their top East African competitors and their daughters react like it\u2019s the Super Bowl, picking out the runners from their home country. Sara showed them a picture of her racing with Tirunesh Dibaba, the Ethiopian outdoor 5,000-meter world-record holder, inspiring respectful acknowledgment from her children.\u201cI think they have a better attention span than a typical American child,\u201d Sara said. \u201cThey can watch an entire 10K from start to finish and stay riveted.\u201d\u201cWhen we told them what we do, they\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s not a real job, you have to be writing stuff in an office,\u2019\u201d Sara said, though the girls relish the free foods that come from their parents\u2019 eclectic sponsors. Their father prepares pancakes laced with Muscle Milk every morning, and packages of sponsor-sent Alaskan salmon are a lunchbox favorite. \u201cMy 8-year-old will pray, \u2018Please keep mom strong, not like dad, so she can keep running, and we can keep getting free fish\u2019\u201d Sara said.Sara makes them the Ethiopian food they grew up with as well, infusing it with the healthy cooking approaches she\u2019s taught herself to fuel her training. \u201cI make doro, or sometimes it\u2019s just the shiro, or split peas and lentils and kale,\u201d she said. \u201cMy daughter told me I should open an Ethiopian restaurant, and I thought it was such an exciting compliment.\u201dThey now speak in both English and Amharic; the girls call Ryan \u201cPoppy-o,\u201d and in addition to \u201cMommy\u201d they call Sara \u201cMammu,\u201d or \u201cAnanti,\u201d meaning Mom in Amharic. Just as the couple continues to teach their children English, their daughters help them brush up on Amharic \u2014 with the help of the new Amharic edition of Google Translate.There are still some adjustments to work through. \u201cMy daughter will use 10 paper towels to pick up a stray dog hair,\u201d Sara said. \u201cBut she\u2019s never had paper towels, and she doesn\u2019t understand about the environment. There are so many layers you forget they don\u2019t know yet.\u201dMeanwhile, Ryan has begun running again, gradually building up his speed to the point where he can keep pace with Sara. He helped coach her before the Olympic marathon trials and paced her or biked with her in tempo runs this summer.\u201cRyan and I are both really driven, and that\u2019s something we really want for our kids,\u201d said Sara. \u201cBut we expect the initiative to come from them. We don\u2019t tell them to run; if they want to run, we wait for them to say they want to. But of course we\u2019ll support them, we\u2019ll be out there on the bike.\u201dNow the Halls\u2019s oldest daughter, Hana, is hoping to make it to her first state meet with her new team, where she will race on the California course where her parents first established themselves.\u201cSome of my best memories are the team aspect of cross country and going to the meets, it is so much fun,\u201d said Sara. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be a part of that again, through them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He went on to graduate from Stanford and intern at Google and the White House, before going into politics.Speaking on Thursday, he said he was \u201ca little overwhelmed\u201d by his victory.\u201cComing from where I\u2019m from, living in poverty, not coming from a political family, it\u2019s an incredible honor,\u201d he said.Asked what his political future might hold, Mr. Tubbs said he was focused on the job at hand.As a 17-year-old, however, he was more candid. In 2008, Mr. Tubbs was part of a team that won a national debate competition sponsored by the N.A.A.C.P.As a result, he got to meet Senator Barack Obama, then the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.People on San Francisco\u2019s sidewalks this week have been encountering kindness in an unusual way.Posters have appeared on poles across the city with little dangling paper slips that can be torn off and taken away.

{"Headline": "New Research Center to Explore Ethics of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byCarnegie Mellon University plans to announce on Wednesday that it will create a research center that focuses on the ethics of artificial intelligence.The ethics center, called the K&L Gates Endowment for Ethics and Computational Technologies, is being established at a time of growing international concern about the impact of A.I. technologies. That has already led to an array of academic, governmental and private efforts to explore a technology that until recently was largely the stuff of science fiction.In the last decade, faster computer chips, cheap sensors and large collections of data have helped researchers improve on computerized tasks like machine vision and speech recognition, as well as robotics.\u201cWe are at a unique point in time where the technology is far ahead of society\u2019s ability to restrain it,\u201d Mr. Suresh noted.But at the same time, he said some people are a bit too optimistic about their claims of A.I. advances, particularly when it comes to autonomous vehicles.Mr. Suresh said he personally did not think self-driving cars would be in widespread use in the next three years.The Uber laboratory has been a sensitive spot for Carnegie Mellon. The field of artificial intelligence emerged in part at Carnegie Mellon in the 1950s in the work of faculty who developed software that showed how computer algorithms could intelligently solve problems.University officials said the departing faculty have been replaced and 13 additional professors have been hired since the defections. They also said that between 2011 and 2015, Carnegie Mellon faculty and staff created 164 start-up companies.University officials pointed to a partnership the school entered into last year with Boeing to use machine-learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data generated by modern aircraft such as the Boeing Dreamliner.The new center is being created with a $10 million gift from K&L Gates, an international law firm headquartered in Pittsburgh. It will draw from several academic disciplines and will initially add two faculty and three positions for graduate students. It will also establish a biennial conference on ethical issues facing the field.K&L Gates is one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates\u2019s father, William H. Gates Sr., was involved in the firm until his retirement in 1998. Peter J. Kalis, chairman of the law firm, said the potential impact of A.I. technology on the economy and culture made it essential that as a society we make thoughtful, ethical choices about how the software and machines are used.\u201cCarnegie Mellon resides at the intersection of many disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a synthesis of the best thinking of all of these disciplines for society to define the ethical constraints on the emerging A.I. technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: \u2018This Is All About Income\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byTBILISI, Georgia \u2014 Jobless and with graduation looming, a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia decided early this year that money could be made from America\u2019s voracious appetite for passionately partisan political news. He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it did not work,\u201d said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real \u2014 and completely fake \u2014 news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.\u201cIt\u2019s all Trump,\u201d Mr. Egan said by telephone. \u201cPeople go nuts for it.\u201dWith Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?Some analysts worry that foreign intelligence agencies are meddling in American politics and using fake news to influence elections. But one window into how the meat in fake sausages gets ground can be found in the buccaneering internet economy, where satire produced in Canada can be taken by a recent college graduate in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and presented as real news to attract clicks from credulous readers in the United States. Mr. Latsabidze said his only incentive was to make money from Google ads by luring people off Facebook pages and onto his websites.To gin up material, Mr. Latsabidze often simply cut and pasted, sometimes massaging headlines but mostly just copying material from elsewhere, including Mr. Egan\u2019s prank story on Mr. Obama. Mr. Egan was not amused to see his satirical work on Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s website and filed a copyright infringement notice to defend his intellectual property.Yet Mr. Egan conceded a certain professional glee that Mr. Trump is here to stay. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got him for four years,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dIn Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America\u2019s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)\u201cMy audience likes Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.\u201dSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that \u201cthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.\u201d Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: \u201cStop it Liberals\u2026Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here\u2019s Why.\u201d That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people\u2019s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)Then the notice arrived from Mr. Egan in Canada, which prompted the company that hosts Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites, including departed.co, to shut them down for two days until he removed the offending story.\u201cIt was really bad for me,\u201d Mr. Latsabidze recalled. \u201cTraffic dropped and I had to start everything all over again.\u201dMr. Egan, for his part, said he did not like others making money unfairly off his labor. And he estimated that \u201cprobably half\u201d the readers of his stories believe they are true because of the widespread theft by other websites.\u201cA lot of that was conservative readers who see it picked up on other sites and believe it,\u201d Mr. Egan said. \u201cIn many cases, they haven\u2019t actually read it, they\u2019re just reacting to a headline.\u201dMr. Latsabidze said he was amazed that anyone could mistake many of the articles he posts for real news, insisting they are simply a form of infotainment that should not be taken too seriously.\u201cI don\u2019t call it fake news; I call it satire,\u201d he said. He avoids sex and violence because they violate Facebook rules, he said, but he sees nothing wrong otherwise with providing readers with what they want.\u201cNobody really believes that Mexico is going to close its border,\u201d he said, sipping coffee this week in a McDonald\u2019s in downtown Tbilisi. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201dAll the same, the Mexico-closing-its-border story proved so popular after it appeared on his site that he hunted around on the web for other articles on the same theme. He found a tall tale about Mexico planning to call back its citizens from the United States if Mr. Trump won. This, too, generated huge traffic, though not quite as much as the first one, which Mr. Latsabidze described as \u201ca really great story.\u201dHe insisted he has nothing against Mexicans or Muslims, whose exclusion from the United States is requested by an online petition that often appears on his websites and who are invariably presented in a negative light in the stories he posts.\u201cI am not against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw that there was interest. They are in the news.\u201d Nor, he added, is he particularly against Mrs. Clinton, though he personally prefers Mr. Trump.If his pro-Clinton site had taken off, he said, he would have pressed on with that, but \u201cpeople did not engage,\u201d so he focused on serving pro-Trump supporters instead. They, he quickly realized, were a far more receptive audience \u201cbecause they are angry\u201d and eager to read outrageous tales.\u201cFor me, this is all about income, nothing more,\u201d he added.The income comes mostly from Google, which pays a few cents each time a reader sees or clicks on advertisements embedded in one of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites. His best month, which coincided with the hit bogus story about Mexico closing the border, brought in around $6,000, though monthly revenue is usually much lower.While Facebook does not directly provide Mr. Latsabidze any revenue, it plays a central role in driving traffic to his websites. He initially established several fake Facebook pages intended to steer traffic to his websites, including one supposedly set up by a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka. This woman, he acknowledged, does not really exist. \u201cShe is me,\u201d he said.He discovered, however, that such pages were ineffective compared with legitimate Facebook pages from real people, particularly Trump supporters, because they have so much energy and love promoting stories they like.Departed.co \u2014 named after Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s favorite movie, \u201cThe Departed,\u201d and recently redirected to usatodaycom.com \u2014 published dozens of stories daily, many of them similar to one posted on Nov. 17 with the headline, \u201cThis Is Huuge! International Arrest Warrant Issued By Putin For George Soros!\u201d The story was not true and had already been published on scores of other fake news sites around the web.In the prelude to the election, bogus reports about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health and highly favorable ones about Mr. Trump were promoted with gusto by Russian state-controlled news media outlets and legions of pro-Russian internet agitators. This has stirred suspicions that the Kremlin has had a hand in the fake news industry, prompting American researchers to assert in recent studies that the online blurring of the boundary between truth and falsehood is in part the result of Russian manipulation.But Mr. Latsabidze and others here say they serve only their bank balances, not Russia or anything else.He insisted that his team operated entirely on its own and that it did not want or need outside help. He said that it took him just two hours to set up a basic website and that anyone with a modicum of computer savvy could quickly start hawking news \u2014 real or fake \u2014 online.\u201cI did not invent anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has all been done before.\u201dMr. Latsabidze, who apparently has broken no laws, said that any crackdown on fake news might work in the short term but that \u201csomething else will come along to replace it.\u201d\u201cIf they want to, they can control everything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this will stop freedom of speech.\u201dFor now, the postelection period has been bad for business, with a sharp fall in the appetite for incendiary political news favoring Mr. Trump. Traffic to departed.co and affiliated websites has plunged in recent weeks by at least 50 percent, Mr. Latsabidze said.\u201cIf Hillary had won, it would be better for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI could write about the bad things she was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not write to make Trump win. I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.\u201dIn the months since he got into the fake news business, Mr. Latsabidze has landed a day job as a programmer with a software company, which he sees as a better future. \u201cThis is more stable work,\u201d he said.But he seemed reluctant to quit altogether.\u201cAre there any elections coming up in the U.K.?\u201d Mr. Latsabidze asked.He was disappointed to hear that none were scheduled soon. But, advised that France will hold a hotly contested presidential election next April featuring a Trump-like candidate in the form of Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist, he perked up.\u201cMaybe I should learn some French,\u201d he said.Andrew Higgins reported from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Mike McIntire and Gabriel J.X.

{"Headline": "Fake News Onslaught Targets Pizzeria as Nest of Child-Trafficking", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWithin hours, menacing messages like \u201cwe\u2019re on to you\u201d began appearing in his Instagram feed. In the ensuing days, hundreds of death threats \u2014 one read \u201cI will kill you personally\u201d \u2014 started arriving via texts, Facebook and Twitter. All of them alleged something that made Mr. Alefantis\u2019s jaw drop: that Comet Ping Pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta.When Mr. Alefantis discovered that his employees were getting similar abusive messages, he looked online to unravel the accusations. He found dozens of made-up articles about Mrs. Clinton kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant\u2019s back rooms. The articles appeared on Facebook and on websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen, with one headline blaring: \u201cPizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington\u2019s Occult Elite.\u201d\u201cFrom this insane, fabricated conspiracy theory, we\u2019ve come under constant assault,\u201d said Mr. Alefantis, 42, who was once in a relationship with David Brock, a provocative former right-wing journalist who became an outspoken advocate for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Alefantis suspects those relationships may have helped to make him a target. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing for days but try to clean this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized,\u201d he said.But Mr. Alefantis\u2019s experience shows it is not just politicians and internet companies that are grappling with the fake news fallout. He, his staff and friends have become a new kind of private citizen bull\u2019s-eye for the purveyors of false articles and their believers.For more than two weeks, they have struggled to deal with the abusive social media comments and to protect photos of their own children, which were used in the false articles as evidence that the pizza restaurant was running a pedophilia ring. One person even visited Comet Ping Pong to investigate the allegations for himself.To combat the fake news tide, Mr. Alefantis has contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local police, and he has asked Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit to remove the articles. Yet the misinformation has continued to spread, growing into a theory known as #pizzagate that has traveled to Ireland. At one point, Comet\u2019s staff counted five #pizzagate Twitter posts a minute. As recently as Sunday night, the Twitter message \u201cDon\u2019t let up. #PizzaGate EVERYWHERE\u201d was reposted and liked hundreds of times.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to shoot a swarm of bees with one gun,\u201d said Bryce Reh, Comet\u2019s general manager, whose wife asked him to leave his job because of the threats and vulgar messages they both have received on their social media accounts.Mr. Alefantis, an artist born and raised in Washington, co-founded Comet Ping Pong 10 years ago as a casual spot for clay oven pizza. The restaurant has kid-friendly features like Ping-Pong tables and a craft room. Famous natives like members of the band Fugazi have held small shows there. The eatery, which seats 120, is a mash-up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of Mr. Alefantis.The 4Chan users immediately speculated about the links between Comet Ping Pong and the Democratic Party. Some posited the restaurant was part of a larger Democratic child trafficking ring, which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs. That idea jumped to other social media services such as Twitter and Reddit, where it gained momentum on the page \u201cThe_Donald.\u201d A new Reddit discussion thread called \u201cPizzagate\u201d quickly attracted 20,000 subscribers.Glen Caplin, a former campaign official for Mrs. Clinton, did not comment directly about Comet Ping Pong but said, \u201cWikiLeaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked.\u201d Mr. Podesta did not respond to requests for comment.Last week, one supporter of the Pizzagate theory shot a live video from within the restaurant during a busy dinner shift. Local police, who had parked across the street after Mr. Alefantis filed a report about the fake news stories and threats, told the man to leave.In a statement, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department said it was monitoring the situation and is \u201caware of general threats being made against this establishment.\u201d The F.B.I. said it \u201cdoes not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.\u201dMost troubling for Mr. Alefantis and staff has been the use of children\u2019s images, pilfered from the restaurant\u2019s social media pages and the personal accounts of friends who had \u201cliked\u201d Comet Ping Pong online. Those photos have been used across dozens of websites. Parents, who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution, have hired lawyers to get the photos removed.Musicians who have performed at Comet Ping Pong have been pulled in, too. Amanda Kleinman, whose band, Heavy Breathing, has performed there several times, deleted her Twitter account after the abusive comments became overwhelming. Similar comments have flooded her YouTube music clips.\u201cWe are at a dangerous place in American culture where a good percentage of people aren\u2019t distinguishing what is a real news source based on real reporting and fact-checking and only reinforcing pre-existing ideas they have,\u201d Ms. Kleinman said.The frustration has been compounded by the lack of recourse for Mr. Alefantis, his friends and employees. Yelp blocked the comments sections of Comet Ping Pong\u2019s review page after reports of abusive comments and fake news in reviews. YouTube said it prohibits threats, harassment and hate speech and has tools for flagging violations and filing complaints for the site to take further action, but has largely not blocked comments on these videos. Twitter declined to comment, and Facebook did not have any further comment.After employees and Mr. Alefantis complained to Reddit about how Comet Ping Pong was being targeted on the site, the #pizzagate discussion thread posted a warning that revealing personal information about individuals was prohibited.\u201cWe know that we have more work to do and we take our responsibility to address online abuse seriously,\u201d Reddit said in a statement.Little relief appears in sight. Over the weekend, Comet Ping Pong received dozens of calls from people screaming obscenities and threats. Mr. Alefantis got 50 nasty Instagram direct messages, including one that warned, \u201cThis place should be burned to the ground!\u201dOn Monday morning, when Mr. Alefantis picked up his phone, he saw a text from a staff member warning that an individual might protest in front of the restaurant.\u201cIt\u2019s endless,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Al Brodax, Who Steered the Beatles\u2019 \u2018Yellow Submarine\u2019 to the Screen, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byThe death was confirmed by his daughter, Jessica Harris.In the 1960s, Mr. Brodax (pronounced BROH-dax) ran the motion picture and television division of King Features Syndicate, where he produced hundreds of \u201cPopeye\u201d cartoons for television.He approached Mr. Epstein again, this time with some trepidation; the Beatles did not like \u201cThe Beatles.\u201dBut there was an opening. The group owed United Artists one more film after \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and \u201cHelp!,\u201d but had lost interest in acting. An animated film, Mr. Brodax argued, would require virtually no participation by the Beatles and satisfy the conditions of their contract.\u201cAll they had to do was sign a piece of paper,\u201d he told the website 21st Century Radio in 1994. \u201cI\u2019d do the work.\u201dA deal was struck. Mr. Brodax put together a team of writers and animators who, despite constant friction and turmoil and a slender budget of $1 million, created a small miracle: a Popsicle-colored fantasia devoted to peace, love and the thrilling pulse of the Beatles\u2019 music.Songs from the albums \u201cRubber Soul,\u201d \u201cRevolver\u201d and \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d as well as four new songs, provided much of the soundtrack. The dialogue was spoken by actors from Liverpool.The film, which The Boston Globe in 1987 called \u201ca big post-Summer-of-Love rainbow head trip,\u201d appealed to adults and children alike. Directed by George Dunning with a swirling, pulsating psychedelic visual style created by the Czech-born illustrator Heinz Edelmann, it sent the four Beatles on a submarine voyage to idyllic Pepperland while being threatened by the music-hating, color-draining Blue Meanies.Apple Bonkers, Snapping Turks and the Dreadful Flying Glove menaced the group, but, disguised as Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the Beatles vanquished the enemy with their music. Once the Beatles saw the final version, they warmed to it and filmed a brief live-action coda.The film critic Roger Ebert, writing about a restored version released in 1999, called it \u201ca music-based animated film for the ages,\u201d with \u201ca freedom of color and invention that never tires.\u201dAlbert Philip Brodax was born on Feb. 14, 1926, in Manhattan. His father, Herman, was a coat manufacturer. His mother, the former Lillian Joss, was a homemaker.He grew up in Washington Heights and, after the family moved to Brooklyn, attended Midwood High School.He enlisted in the Army in 1943 and served as a medic. He was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge, earning a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star and a Combat Medical Badge.After returning to the United States, he studied English literature at the University of Wisconsin. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1948.He found work in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency in New York and rose to become a television writer and producer, assigned to \u201cYour Show of Shows\u201d and \u201cOmnibus.\u201d He also helped produce a Broadway adaptation of Sherwood Anderson\u2019s book \u201cWinesburg, Ohio\u201d in 1958.In 1951, he married Joan Greenberg, who survives him. In addition to her and his daughter, he is survived by his sons, Daniel and Douglas; a sister, Myrna Kurtz; and six grandchildren.Mr. Brodax was hired by King Features Syndicate in 1960 to run its new motion picture and television division. After producing 220 \u201cPopeye\u201d cartoons, he collaborated with Bob Kane, the creator of \u201cBatman,\u201d on the animated spy spoof \u201cCool McCool\u201d and produced television versions of the comic strips \u201cKrazy Kat,\u201d \u201cBeetle Bailey,\u201d \u201cSnuffy Smith\u201d and \u201cBarney Google.\u201d\u201cYellow Submarine\u201d was fraught with difficulties. Mr. Epstein, notoriously difficult to work with in his later years, rejected every script that Mr. Brodax presented to him, including one by the novelist Joseph Heller, objecting to the colored binders they came in.Mr. Brodax commissioned a young playwright, Lee Minoff, to come up with a new script, which underwent radical revisions but included some of the basic elements of the final product. The script doctors called in for revisions included Erich Segal, who later wrote \u201cLove Story,\u201d and the Liverpool writer and musician Roger McGough, who added the absurdist puns sprinkled throughout the film.The members of the visual team, for their part, took creative license, adding their own plot elements and more or less running amok. Mr. Brodax, to his credit, went with the flow.\u201cAl was a real innocent who didn\u2019t know how he got what he got,\u201d Peter Sander, one of the animators, told The Toronto Star in 1987. \u201cBut he got it.\u201d\u201cYellow Submarine\u201d won an award from the New York Critics Circle for achievement in full-length animation.Mr. Brodax went on to produce a short-lived live-action television series based on the comic strip \u201cBlondie\u201d before leaving King Features for ABC. There he produced the Sunday-morning children\u2019s shows \u201cMake a Wish\u201d and \u201cAnimals, Animals, Animals.\u201dIn the 1980s, he worked as a consultant for Marvel Comics and Computer Graphics Laboratories.His book \u201cUp Periscope Yellow: The Making of the Beatles Yellow Submarine\u201d was published in 2004.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Projections Before the Polls Close: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceIn the history of the Obama campaign\u2019s storied analytics operation, the effort to model the results live on Election Day, before the votes were tallied, was undoubtedly a low point.This year, Election Day could be the worst 12 hours for all of us.It might make you want to throw up.A lot can go wrong, as it did for the Obama team.In 2012, the Obama campaign brought in top talent from Google and Catalist, a Democratic data firm, to estimate the results of the election in real time. The early results did not look good for Mr. Obama. At first, the Obama team had dismissed the data pointing toward a low turnout among young, nonwhite and Democratic-leaning voters.In a telephone interview, Mr. Issenberg described the history of these efforts somewhat differently, saying he\u2019s heard \u201chorror stories\u201d about Election Day efforts to model the results.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.For readers unaccustomed to live Election Day forecasting, the VoteCastr effort could be a horror story as well. This is not because the VoteCastr effort is unserious or doomed to fail. It takes many of the steps needed to do the job well, or at least as well as it can be done.The VoteCastr team will monitor 100 precincts \u2014 a good number \u2014 in each battleground state, periodically reporting on the turnout in real time. The data will be used to infer whether turnout is higher or lower than expected in certain areas or among certain groups.But even a serious effort like this one \u2014 let alone the Obama campaign\u2019s effort in 2012 \u2014 faces big challenges.One obstacle is that turnout varies over time: Younger voters don\u2019t usually vote in the morning, and many voters in nine-to-five jobs might surge to the polls in the evening.This was one of the big challenges for the Obama campaign in 2012. By 10:30 a.m., its model had concluded that young and nonwhite voters weren\u2019t showing up in Ohio. These trends worked themselves out by the end of the day, but not before causing considerable consternation in the Cave.The VoteCastr model makes no effort to adjust for this. It will treat turnout as if it\u2019s uniform throughout the day: If 10 percent of the day has passed, it will expect 10 percent of the vote to be counted. This can cause considerable variance in the estimates as the hours go by.It\u2019s also hard to infer what shifts in turnout by precinct mean for certain groups. If the turnout in a well-educated precinct is down 5 percent, does that mean that the turnout among well-educated voters, who tend to support Hillary Clinton, is down? Or does it mean that well-educated Republican turnout is down?The VoteCastr model\u2019s approach is defensible, if ham-handed: If it believes that 500 voters in a precinct will vote, it will assume that the 500 likeliest voters have turned out. There\u2019s a danger here: Some of the less likely voters will indeed show up, and they tend to lean Democratic.Another challenge is estimating vote preferences in the first place. The turnout by precinct doesn\u2019t say much about how people voted \u2014 just who voted. The estimates for how people voted come from polling data, and the models deduced from it.Many of the problems facing polls \u2014 like the possibility that undecided voters or the supporters of minor-party candidates will break one way \u2014 apply to the models as well.The Upshot\u2019s Senate election forecast for 2016, updated daily with the latest polls.Readers have one advantage in the case of our early-voting tracker: You know that our North Carolina poll was very positive for Mrs. Clinton.In the case of the VoteCastr effort, readers won\u2019t have any idea whether its estimates were strong or weak for Mrs. Clinton heading into the election. It\u2019ll be difficult for readers to untangle the real news \u2014 whether Election Day turnout has deviated from expectations \u2014 from the other factors that drive VoteCastr\u2019s estimates.Election night forecasting, based on actual results, is a different challenge. Forecasters don\u2019t have these issues (though they have their own). The Upshot will be forecasting the results based on actual returns once there\u2019s a sufficient amount of data.The VoteCastr team will supply Slate with some of the data necessary to help untangle it. For instance, readers will know whether turnout is up or down in Democratic or Republican precincts. But it will probably be hard for readers to make these inferences.Julia Turner, Slate\u2019s editor in chief, said the goal was \u201cto make it impossible to separate numbers from the context.\u201d There will be contextual language embedded in the graphics and in social media. The Slate team members will de-emphasize the horse race number. Josh Voorhees, a Slate political writer, will provide commentary throughout the day.Parts of the experiment have the potential to be extremely valuable and to improve the future coverage of elections. The estimates for the early vote in states like Colorado, North Carolina, Florida and Nevada \u2014 where individual-level data on turnout is available \u2014 will be informative and more useful than many pre-election polls. By the end of the evening, the estimates of turnout by precinct should be a valuable complement to deeply imperfect exit-poll-based estimates of the composition of the electorate.But the live estimates and projections could be a wild ride. In 2012, the Obama team had the top analysts in politics, and plenty of previous experience on Election Day. Its model had formal measures of uncertainty.

{"Headline": "How Furniture Makers Are Catering to Millennials", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Burrow is on an enviable trajectory right now. The company is a graduate of the prestigious Bay Area tech accelerator Y Combinator; it also has a healthy list of pre-orders for its product\u2019s planned debut in January. But given that pedigree, the product is an unusual one: couches. Not cloud-connected couches or remote-controlled couches \u2014 just couches. Technically, the company makes a couch, singular, available in a few different colors and configurations. The one I was sitting on belonged to Jess Goodman, a friend of the founders and an early supporter. Its design was midcentury modern unexceptional, and it was perfectly nice. But the couch is not Burrow\u2019s main attraction. Burrow is selling a couch experience.When customers order a Burrow couch online, the standard model will ship to their apartments in three or four boxes. A human of average size should be able to take those boxes up the stairs (if they have stairs) and build the couch alone, without tools and within minutes.Chopra and Kuhl tell me that for urban professionals between 25 and 35, the physical process of buying a sofa and moving it into an apartment is a series of \u201cpain points.\u201d Some of these points are literally painful, like carrying a large sofa up a flight of stairs. But the term is business speak for any kind of friction, however abstract, between a customer and a new couch. Burrow doesn\u2019t claim to have improved upon the couch itself: It\u2019s a pain-management company.It helps that furniture sales in the United States are unusually fragmented. It\u2019s a $100 billion annual market, but giants like Ashley HomeStore and Ikea take less than 5 percent each, while regional chains like Rooms to Go and Havertys still account for significant sales. Unlike with, say, office supplies, the industry hasn\u2019t become concentrated in a few huge companies \u2014 the field remains competitive.All of which is to say millennial entrepreneurs could pick a worse thing to sell than a deconstructable couch. As they disrupt our living rooms, these businessmen move us one step closer to a different world. But are we sure we want to live there?As they say, however, nothing in this life is free \u2014 certainly not shipping couches. Burrow manufactures its boxed-up sofas-to-be in Mexico City, then freight-forwards them to warehouses in Cincinnati and New York. Because they\u2019re boxes, rather than constructed furniture, they can stack all the way to the ceiling. The boxes are FedEx and UPS compliant, and they ship from the warehouses like normal packages. The process is advertised as free, but the founders estimate that it will cost them $75 per sofa, or about 10 percent of the $745 purchase price for the two-seat base model. Chopra and Kuhl also figure that if they can ease all the \u201cpain\u201d around obtaining and installing a couch, customers will be happy enough with what they get to refrain from sending it back, which Burrow says it will allow them to do for 100 days. It occurs to me that the kind of person who would order a couch online to reduce logistical hassles is also the kind of person least likely to then pack up that couch and send it back. When I ask the founders about this, they offer angelic smiles. \u201cWe think our model works for almost everyone,\u201d Kuhl says, \u201cbut there are some people who like Ikea.\u201dIkea hardly dominates the market from a numbers perspective, but it\u2019s been a cultural phenomenon for as long as Burrow\u2019s target demographic has been alive, to the point that it\u2019s essentially a default furniture-acquisition source. In a case study well known to those with M.B.A.s, Youngme Moon of Harvard Business School described how the company made a home in America. From the 1985 opening of its first American store, Ikea emphasized everything except the attribute that had been the industry\u2019s sole sales strategy until that point: durability. At Ikea\u2019s prices, furniture didn\u2019t need to be seen as a future heirloom; young adults could furnish their homes with new objects, rather than trawling through thrift stores or taking hand-me-downs from upgrading relatives. Attractive Swedish particle board gave Americans an excuse to jettison their parents\u2019 commitment to lifelong furniture and go shopping more often.\u201cIkea is an amazing company,\u201d says Maxwell Ryan, the chief executive and co-founder of the influential interior-design site Apartment Therapy. \u201cThey have great designers, infrastructure, product variety. They\u2019re very hard to compete with.\u201d Ikea furniture also packs into boxes \u2014 the industry term is \u201cK.D.,\u201d or \u201cknock down\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s based on a very different value proposition from Burrow\u2019s. By turning its stores into theme parks and fitting the warehouse right inside, Ikea bet that it could get customers to tote purchases all the way home by themselves. The pain points of couch shopping are still there, but so are the pleasures of dining out and free child care. Burrow\u2019s experience, on the other hand, is online and low-friction.Burrow isn\u2019t the only company that sees an opening here. \u201cTwenty-four-to-33-year-old career-driven, upwardly mobile people\u201d is how John Humphrey \u2014 a founder and chief executive of the furniture company Greycork \u2014 describes his customers. \u201cThey tend to be in the tech and design fields.\u201d With a Greycork living-room set, you can take a space from zero to furnished in five to 10 days, with free shipping. If a consumer\u2019s main complaint with Ikea furniture is the Allen wrenches, the trip to the store or just the fact that it\u2019s identifiably Ikea, Greycork could be a good alternative.\u201cThe way Ikea is based around the shipping container, we\u2019re based around FedEx,\u201d says Brad Sewell, the founder of the furniture maker Campaign. The ex-Apple engineer\u2019s company sells a chair, a love seat and a sofa \u2014 all the same design in varying widths. Based on the online view, they are not especially distinguishable from the Ikea Norsborg line and are a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. This next generation of couches uses web copy that\u2019s heavy in compound adjectives (\u201claser-cut, powder-coated steel frames\u201d) to project a premium feel onto goods that most buyers can\u2019t touch for themselves. The fact that the furniture folds is more than a logistical accommodation; it\u2019s a key feature.Kyle Hoff is a founder of Floyd, a furniture start-up that ships metal legs \u2014 they adjust to turn any flat surface into a desk or a table \u2014 alongside adjustable shelf brackets and frameworks for platform beds. The initial concept was \u201cjust add boards\u201d; Floyd products bind them into functional furniture. \u201cI wanted to make furniture for people like me,\u201d Hoff says. \u201cI was in my early 20s, moving from city to city, and I needed things that could move with me.\u201d Though Floyd is based in Detroit, Hoff says most of his customers are young professionals in New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. And maybe in is the wrong way to think of it; Floyd customers exist between these (and a few other) metropolitan areas. All the furniture is designed to move as part of a roving lifestyle.If a company can get to market first and establish itself as the singular way to buy a particular necessity online, it can clean up \u2014 even if it\u2019s appealing to a relatively small millennial luxury market. Most of the founders I spoke with mentioned Casper as an inspiration, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The venture-funded company was an overnight success in 2014 selling foam mattresses online and delivering them compressed into manageable boxes. Last year the company was valued at over half a billion dollars. It stands out even among Silicon Valley fairy tales, which makes \u201cCasper for couches\u201d a self-explanatory business pitch.The best thing about this whole product category is that it might represent a step away from Ikea\u2019s disposability without going all the way back to Grandma\u2019s antique sofa. If consumers are already thinking about moving, portability is at least as big an obstacle to maintaining furniture as mediocre craftsmanship and cheap materials. These companies want to make a couch that will last for 10 or 20 years, even if the buyers have no idea where they\u2019ll be or what they\u2019ll be doing that far down the line. Buying a piece of furniture that you will realistically hold onto longer is a kind of forward-thinking thrift.But this new approach also hints at something more sinister, more bad-future. Different furniture suggests different ways of being in the world: A heavy table says one thing, and a mattress on the floor beside a folding chair says another. Campaign takes its name from the furnishings that British colonial functionaries would take on assignments, ready to pack up if recalled by the Crown. It\u2019s an apt fit with one version of upwardly mobile millennial living, which involves reducing all \u201cpersonal\u201d needs to an efficient minimum. It\u2019s a style beloved by Silicon Valley \u2014 which finances accessories like the liquid food replacement Soylent \u2014 and exemplified by the Google engineer who blogged about the time he spent living in a small truck near the office.This Silicon Valley lifestyle and the Silicon Valley business model are caught in a chicken-and-egg dialectic. Each holds that whatever work can be automated, eliminated or subcontracted to others should be, thus leaving all our valuable code ninjas and management rock stars free to do more work, pursue expensive enriching experiences and watch Netflix. This is the luxury that some of the valley\u2019s most successful products are offering; there are now niche online services for doing your laundry, chopping your food, driving you around and delivering your toilet paper. The entire app-services economy can serve as a dispersed and techno-mystified mother, a caretaker who dotes on the implied bachelor user.The various furniture founders \u2014 Burrow\u2019s, Greycork\u2019s, Campaign\u2019s, Floyd\u2019s \u2014 experienced the same series of pain points when it came to couch ownership. All are city-dwelling men with at least some postgraduate education; four of them are 29, the fifth is 28. It\u2019s not surprising that they should encounter similar hassles or, because most attended business school, think of comparable entrepreneurial solutions. But given that investors and customers have encouraged them, it\u2019s worth asking exactly what kind of pain they plan to remove from our world.Maxwell Ryan, of Apartment Therapy, is not optimistic about the prospects of companies like Burrow. \u201cThere\u2019s this Silicon Valley mind-set where they solve a problem and so they think they\u2019re going to make a million dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cBut just because it\u2019s a problem for them doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem for everyone. I haven\u2019t seen that kind of thinking translate over well to the design space.\u201d Nor is he particularly impressed with the plain, one-size-fits-all style they tend to adopt (\u201cit\u2019s ugly\u201d). Ryan says customers want a good narrative to go with their furniture, like Crate and Barrel\u2019s origin story of a young couple\u2019s return from their honeymoon abroad with boxes of cheap imported fineries.But not everyone cares that much about expressing individual style, and Ryan could be underestimating how popular it is these days to stay inside and not talk to anyone. In our emerging economic order, the exertion of emotional energy is a kind of pain \u2014 a red entry in the accounting book of our lives \u2014 and there are new services every day to help us avoid it. Soon it will be possible to build and maintain a complete household full of goods without having to look anyone else in the eye.When my roommate and I moved to Philadelphia this year, we left our giant vintage couch in our fourth-floor Brooklyn walk-up. It was a nice piece of furniture \u2014 solid and soft, in light green floral \u2014 and we were sad to lose it. After we moved into our new place, my brother, who lives nearby, showed us to a neighborhood secondhand store called Jinxed. Inside we found a couch that looked shockingly like our old one. A little smaller, in better condition and orange instead of green, but remarkably similar. It\u2019s not what I would have picked online, but the coincidence was too striking to ignore.From a certain perspective, this was all suffering, insofar as it would have been easier not to do it. I\u2019m not unsympathetic; I\u2019m in the target demographic for a product like Burrow. I am a person who has bought flour on Amazon. But risk and hassle and pain are big parts of interacting with other people on terms that aren\u2019t yours alone. There\u2019s value in having to sustain a mind-set that accounts for other humans and their interests and needs, a value to always remembering that there are people between the apps and our fulfilled desires. If there exists a market incentive to smooth every friction a young businessman can think of \u2014 even something as mundane, low-tech and intrinsically social as a couch \u2014 we risk a very slippery world. \u2666Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer in Philadelphia.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}

Perhaps you thought you had made up your mind and cast your ballot early, only to have a last-minute change of heart.It happens.We\u2019re sorry to say it\u2019s probably too late to do anything about it. With the exceptions of absentee voters in three states \u2014 New York, Pennsylvania and Mississippi \u2014 people who have already voted cannot still change their minds.Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said 3,027 voters had voided their ballots as of Friday afternoon. The state is expecting 3.1 million votes.Those people are not necessarily changing their votes. Several people have said they don\u2019t trust that their absentee ballots will be accurately counted and have decided to vote in person, he said.Still, there is a small window for a few voters to change their minds.Absentee voters in Mississippi can also void an absentee ballot by voting in person, according to Leah Rupp Smith, a Department of State spokeswoman.Absentee voters in New York have the same option, according to John Conklin, a spokesman for the state\u2019s board of elections.Connecticut voters can void an absentee ballot until 10 a.m. on Election Day by making a request at the municipal clerk\u2019s office.In other states, early voters could have pulled a switcheroo a little earlier, but at this point their civic duty has been recorded, no take-backs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Puts Slack in Cross Hairs With New Office Chat App", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byREDMOND, Wash. \u2014 In the last couple of years at Microsoft, some old habits have been tossed away, like obsessively placing Windows software at the center of all the company\u2019s big bets. But the company would still dig trenches to protect Office, its $23-billion-a-year software franchise.Microsoft on Wednesday took the wraps off Microsoft Teams, an addition to the Office package that will allow professionals to huddle virtually with colleagues in private chat rooms to talk about anything from work projects to where to get lunch.If you think Microsoft Teams sounds a little like Slack, the relatively new chat service that has pulses pounding among Silicon Valley investors and customers, you would be correct.In fact, if this were 1997, a more bellicose time at Microsoft, people inside the company would be whispering that the new application was a Slack killer. But the tone is different these days, even if the intent is essentially the same.\u201cLook, my job No. 1 is to make sure that the 85 million users I have on Office 365, we go meet their needs and keep growing that base,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference room last week on the Microsoft campus. \u201cThis is not to take away any success anyone else has. We\u2019ve always had lots of tools out here that have competed and also coexisted.\u201dMicrosoft Teams is the most significant new addition in years to Office 365, the current name of the Microsoft software suite, which has over the years migrated from the PC to become a product delivered over the internet that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other applications. Bill Gates, a Microsoft co-founder and now technology adviser, even had a hand in its creation.The reception to Microsoft Teams will help determine whether Mr. Nadella, who became chief executive of the company in early 2014, can extend his recent run of success.Microsoft plans to use distribution, an old standby, to get people using Microsoft Teams, bundling it with the business version of Office 365 at no additional cost.\u201cWe are orders of magnitude bigger in terms of the users we serve,\u201d said Rajesh Jha, executive vice president of Office Engineering at Microsoft.Customers generally pay $5 to $20 a month to subscribe to Office 365. Mr. Nadella\u2019s 85 million figure is the number of active monthly business users of the software.\u201cThat\u2019s where Microsoft has an inherent advantage around security,\u201d Mr. Diwan said.\u201cThe moral of the story is if you\u2019re a large incumbent with many lines of business, it is incredibly difficult to take on a smaller, focused start-up that has traction in the market,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive of Slack, which took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on Wednesday welcoming Microsoft to the market.What\u2019s more, most people are using Slack because they want to, not because it is being shoved down their throats by a corporate I.T. department. Slack has been embraced by many as a more efficient way for teams to communicate than email, which is not designed for real-time conversations.Messages in Slack are archived and searchable, and people can use it on mobile devices and PCs. Mr. Butterfield said Slack had particularly helped create more transparency across boundaries inside companies, allowing, for example, marketing teams to see what sales staff are talking about and engineers to eavesdrop on product designers.In a demonstration last week at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters, executives showed how Microsoft Teams both resembles Slack and adds to its innovations. Like Slack, the software lets people pepper their messages with GIFs and emojis. There are also ways of connecting Microsoft Teams with other applications and services like Twitter and GitHub.The most noticeable difference is that Microsoft Teams organizes conversations into threads, grouping messages on the same topic to make conversations easier to follow than they are in Slack\u2019s unthreaded message streams. It has customizable tabs for making it simpler to get to commonly used services and files, like budget spreadsheets.Mira Lane, principal architect of Microsoft Teams, demonstrated how people could spontaneously start videoconferences inside the software if they would rather hash things out face to face. \u201cIt\u2019s a really low-friction way of having an ad hoc meeting,\u201d Ms. Lane said.Mr. Butterfield of Slack said the service had plans to support both threaded conversations and videoconferencing in the future.Microsoft began working on Microsoft Teams about 18 months ago, after Mr. Gates encouraged Brian MacDonald, a respected Microsoft engineer credited with creating Outlook, the company\u2019s flagship email application, to come up with a new take on productivity applications.\u201cWe\u2019d have pretty frequent conversations, sometimes group reviews, sometimes one-on-ones,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said. \u201cHe\u2019d send me big, long memos to consume. I\u2019d send him a few ideas back. It was great.\u201dMicrosoft does not always build a new product when it wants to expand the range of Office. About four years ago, it paid $1.2 billion to acquire Yammer, a social networking app that had found a following in the tech industry. So did Microsoft consider buying Slack?\u201cIt\u2019s not something that I looked at,\u201d Mr. Nadella said, adding that he did not know if others who work for him seriously considered it.Mr. Butterfield declined to say whether he was approached by anyone from Microsoft about a deal, but it would not have mattered if someone had. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been pretty clear publicly, and in private conversations with everyone else in the industry, that we have no interest in being acquired,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Rajesh Jha. He is executive vice president of Office Engineering, not corporate vice president. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a picture caption.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google and Facebook Take Aim at Fake News Sites", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOver the last week, two of the world\u2019s biggest internet companies have faced mounting criticism over how fake news on their sites may have influenced the presidential election\u2019s outcome.On Monday, those companies responded by making it clear that they would not tolerate such misinformation by taking pointed aim at fake news sites\u2019 revenue sources.Google kicked off the action on Monday afternoon when the Silicon Valley search giant said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service. Hours later, Facebook, the social network, updated the language in its Facebook Audience Network policy, which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites.\u201cWe have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \u201cOur team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\u201dBy Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to No. 2 in a search for those terms. Google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories.\u201cThe goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\u201d Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, we clearly didn\u2019t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\u201dFacebook\u2019s decision to clarify its ad policy language is notable because Mark Zuckerberg, the social network\u2019s chief executive, has repeatedly fobbed off criticism that the company had an effect on how people voted. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 percent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount is fake news and hoaxes.\u201cOver all, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.Facebook\u2019s ad policy update will not stem the flow of fake news stories that spread through the news feeds that people see when they visit the social network.Facebook has long spoken of how it helped influence and stoke democratic movements in places like the Middle East, and it tells its advertisers that it can help sway its users with ads. Facebook reaches 1.8 billion people around the globe, and the company is one of the largest distributors of news online. A Pew Research Center study said that nearly half of American adults rely on Facebook as a news source.Google\u2019s decision on Monday relates to the Google AdSense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers. More than two million publishers use Google\u2019s advertising network.\u201cMoving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher\u2019s content or the primary purpose of the web property,\u201d Ms. Faville said.Ms. Faville said that the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election.It remains to be seen how effective Google\u2019s new policy on fake news will be in practice. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake. Although satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is not clear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humorous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google\u2019s change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Officials Defend Integrity of Vote, Despite Hacking Fears", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byThe statement came as liberal opponents of Donald J. Trump, some citing fears of vote hacking, are seeking recounts in three states \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 where his margin of victory was extremely thin.A drive by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, for recounts in those states had brought in more than $5 million by midday on Friday, her campaign said, and had increased its goal to $7 million. She filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday, about an hour before the deadline.In its statement, the administration said, \u201cThe Kremlin probably expected that publicity surrounding the disclosures that followed the Russian government-directed compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations, would raise questions about the integrity of the election process that could have undermined the legitimacy of the president-elect.\u201dThat was a reference to the breach of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system, and the leak of emails from figures like John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.\u201cNevertheless, we stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people,\u201d it added.In Michigan, Ms. Stein must wait for a Monday meeting of the state\u2019s Board of Canvassers to certify the results of the Nov. 8 balloting before filing for a recount. In Pennsylvania, where paper ballots are used only in some areas, election officials said that the deadline to petition for a recount had passed, but that a candidate could challenge the result in court before a Monday deadline.The recount efforts have generated pushback by experts who said it would be enormously difficult to hack voting machines on a large scale. The administration, in its statement, confirmed reports from the Department of Homeland Security and intelligence officials that they did not see \u201cany increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day.\u201dThe administration said it remained \u201cconfident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out.\u201d It added: \u201cAs a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.\u201dHowever, intelligence officials are still investigating the impact of a broader Russian \u201cinformation warfare\u201d campaign, in which fake news about Mrs. Clinton, and about United States-Russia relations, appeared intended to influence voters. Many of those false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik, two state-funded Russian sites.Those fake-news reports were widely circulated on social media, independent studies, including one set for release soon, have shown, sometimes in an organized fashion by groups that appear to have had common ownership. Individuals, conservative talk-show hosts and activists recirculated them, often not knowing, or apparently not caring, about the accuracy of the reports.But the misinformation effort is far from black-and-white. Many people who spread false news have no connections to any foreign power, including a man in Austin, Tex., who posted a Twitter message saying that paid protesters were being bused to an anti-Trump demonstration there. Though the report quickly went viral, the buses, it turned out, were there for a corporate conference.That single reference was enough to create a fake story suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was being treated for Parkinson\u2019s.The allegation was quickly shot down by several news organizations. It made little difference: Propaganda or Not, made up of former national security, intelligence and other professionals, and some workers at Google and other technology firms, concluded that it was reproduced tens of thousands of times, sometimes by botnets, and viewed millions of times.But it is not known whether that news was circulated under Russian government direction, or simply by Russian sympathizers, or Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents.The barrage of online efforts to influence the election this year has prompted broader concerns that similar attempts, directed by the Kremlin or its surrogates, could now be focused on elections next year in Germany and France. The goal, intelligence officials and outside experts fear, is to undermine the cohesiveness of the Western alliance, particularly NATO members, by calling into question the validity of democratic elections.\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what the effects of the \u2018fake news\u2019 and other disinformation was,\u201d said Jason Healey, an expert on cyberconflict at Columbia University. \u201cIf they were able to influence in favor of Trump by one or two percentage points in some places, they will be encouraged to try again for the French and the Germans.\u201dThe efforts have also prompted debate inside Facebook and other social media firms about their responsibility to filter out false news. But doing so is a complex task, akin to editing a news operation, and it comes with complex political calculations: Once social media firms begin editing here to American standards, they will be under pressure from authoritarian regimes to do the same to their standards.In its statement, the administration focused chiefly on the threat of Russian manipulation of the vote on Election Day, not on the proliferation of propaganda and fake news.Ms. Stein, of the Green Party, acknowledged on Thursday in an interview with the PBS \u201cNewsHour\u201d that it was unlikely that recounts could change the results. Still, she said that \u201cthis was an election in which we saw hacking all over the place,\u201d and that \u201cat the same time, we have a voting system which has been proven to basically be wide open to hackers.\u201dTrip Gabriel contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Slow Ride Toward the Future of Public Transportation", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byHELSINKI, Finland \u2014 A small electric bus chugged along at a slow but steady seven miles per hour when a white van, entering the street from the side, cut in front of it. The bus slowed, as if its driver had hit the brakes, and got back up to speed after the van moved out of the way.But this bus has no brake or accelerator pedal. It has no steering wheel, either. In fact, it doesn\u2019t have a driver \u2014 it operates using sensors and software, although for now, a person is stationed on board ready to hit a red \u201cstop\u201d button in an emergency.A driverless car, after all, is still a car, carrying at best a few people. By transporting many passengers on what could be very flexible routes, driverless buses could help reduce the number of cars clogging city streets.It\u2019s no surprise that the bus is being tested in Helsinki, which has been at the forefront of efforts to use technology to rethink public transportation.Driverless buses like this one are being used in private, controlled settings, for example to shuttle students around a campus or employees on the grounds of an industrial plant. Helsinki is one of the first cities to run so-called autonomous buses on public roads in traffic; another project, in Sion, Switzerland, has been operating for several months, although the service was suspended in September for two weeks after a minor accident.\u201cWe chose this as a first route because we can study a huge amount of different traffic issues depending on the time of day,\u201d Mr. Santamala said.The buses, made by a French company, are \u201ctaught\u201d a route by having operators drive them using steering and acceleration controls on a small box. The route is then fine-tuned with software. In operation, the buses have laser sensors and GPS to keep them on the route, and can deviate only if alternate routes have been \u201clearned\u201d as well.While the buses are designed to travel at about 15 m.p.h., or 25 kilometers pe hour, they are running at half that for the Helsinki trials. Lateral movement is also restricted; if a car is double-parked along the route, for instance, the bus must wait until the car moves or the bus operator steers around it using the control box.\u201cWe have to be very keen about safety,\u201d Mr. Santamala said.Those restrictions provide an underwhelming experience for now. The most excitement occurs when a vehicle like the white van crosses too closely, or when a motorist approaches from the rear and, impatient with the bus\u2019s tortoiselike pace, swerves around it.Mr. Santamala said the project aimed to establish a real bus route \u2014 probably a seasonal one \u2014 in the next two years. And there\u2019s no reason self-driving technology could not be applied to bigger buses eventually.For now, the project is focusing on so-called last mile service \u2014 taking riders from a stop on a more conventional bus line to a point closer to their homes, shops, offices or schools. An autonomous bus, presumably going faster, could be useful, especially because of a quirk in Finland\u2019s motor vehicle laws.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t state anywhere that we need to have a driver holding the steering wheel or even inside the vehicle,\u201d Mr. Santamala said. \u201cA legal driver can be observing the operation through a computer.\u201dThat means a number of buses could run autonomously, with one operator in a central office intervening remotely as needed. Reducing the number of operators could make it financially feasible to run routes that serve only a few customers, or to vary routes throughout the day based on ridership.\u201cIt was a good experiment,\u201d said Sami Sahala, who advises the city on \u201cintelligent transportation\u201d issues. \u201cBut it was a little bit ahead of its time.\u201d Kutsuplus was heavily subsidized by the city, and although the service was popular and gaining riders, it was doomed by budget cuts at the end of last year.\u201cYou used to pay for all the calls you made,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the advent of mobile phones, the business model started to change. Now you pay a fixed price, and everything is included.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re covered,\u201d said Sampo Hietanen, the chief executive of MaaS Global. \u201cYou can just concentrate on going.\u201d The monthly fees vary depending on how much transportation is needed.Mr. Hietanen said that to be successful, the service should provide the same feeling of independence that owning a car does.Cars are expensive, and studies have shown that most urban car owners rarely use them, so there\u2019s a potential market in people who give up their cars and spend some of the savings on a service like Whim.Self-driving cars and buses may eventually help to make services like MaaS Global\u2019s widely affordable, Mr. Hietanen said.For now, the bus trials continue. Last month, the project moved to a more complex route in Espoo, on Helsinki\u2019s outskirts, and is now operating in Tampere, 111 miles (179 kilometers) to the north.Mr. Santamala and his colleagues analyze each trip to learn how a self-driving bus differs from one operated by a human, and how motorists and pedestrians interact with it. One difference was apparent to everyone aboard the bus after the white van cut in front of it: There was no driver to yell at the driver of the van, which had pulled into a nearby parking space.So Helena Bensky, a Helsinki resident who was giving the bus a try, offered to fill in.\u201cShould I go give that guy a telling off?\u201d she asked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Wish We All Could Be Californian", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Francisco \u2014 THIS is going to sound very California, but here goes: I drowned my election sorrows by surfing. It didn\u2019t help, but I was struck by something afterward. All my life, I\u2019ve seen strangers on California beaches \u2014 bearded bodysurfers drinking local Bourbon, Republican volleyball players eating vegan energy bars \u2014 trade warm glances that say, \u201cI salute your lifestyle choices and respect your privacy.\u201d After the election, those furtive nods implied nausea, terror and a compassion born of confidence that others felt much the same. Within that compassion, I sensed the emergence of something new in California public life: an awareness that we Californians are bound together as one people by the shared values of our increasingly tolerant and pluralistic society.Everybody knows by now that California tacked left on Election Day: 61.5 percent of our voters choose Hillary Clinton for president; we made Kamala Harris the first Indian-American (and second African-American woman) to be elected a United States senator; we reaffirmed overwhelming Democratic majorities in state politics; and we voted to legalize marijuana, ease parole for nonviolent criminals, raise taxes on cigarettes, extend income-tax increases on the wealthiest few, boost school spending, restore bilingual education, encourage the reversal of the Supreme Court\u2019s noxious Citizens United ruling and ban single-use plastic bags.The national outcome made our progressivism feel so threatened and precious that a pre-election video of Gov. Jerry Brown saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to build a wall around California to defend ourselves from the rest of this country\u201d went viral. He was joking, but the mental image helped us all see in physical terms \u2014 Pacific on one side, Sierra Nevada on the other \u2014 what has become obvious in cultural terms. Namely, that California is now both a place and a body politic apart.Secession goes by different names \u2014 Calexit, Califrexit \u2014 and there is a group called Yes California that aims to put an exit referendum on the 2019 ballot for all the obvious reasons. California, for example, pays many billions of dollars more in taxes annually than it gets back in federal spending and has every year since 1987, despite our own crumbling infrastructure and underfunded public schools. Then there\u2019s our relative impotence in shaping the federal government, given an Electoral College that makes one vote for president in Wyoming worth more than three in California, and the fact that Wyoming gets one United States senator for every 291,000 people, roughly speaking, while California gets one for every 19.2 million. Each of California\u2019s 53 congressmen have to represent over a hundred thousand people more than Cynthia Lummis, a Republican who is Wyoming\u2019s lone representative.On Election Day, Shervin Pishevar, the multimillionaire Uber investor and Hyperloop One co-founder, promised to bankroll a campaign \u201cfor California to become its own nation\u201d if Mr. Trump won. He moderated that position a week later with a tweet that advocated \u201ca new Federalism where state and local governments are empowered to determine their destinies while bonded together in a United States of America.\u201d Still, nearly everyone I know would vote yes tomorrow if we could secede peacefully and get security guarantees while we annex Oregon and Washington, join the Canadian health care system and claim Brooklyn in the same way that West Germany once claimed West Berlin.Then there is the joint statement released on Nov. 9 by the State Senate leader, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, and Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon: \u201cToday, we woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land, because yesterday Americans expressed their views on a pluralistic and democratic society that are clearly inconsistent with the values of the people of California. We have never been more proud to be Californians. By a margin in the millions, Californians overwhelmingly rejected politics fueled by resentment, bigotry and misogyny.\u201d They went on to call California a refuge of justice and opportunity \u201cfor people of all walks, talks, ages and aspirations \u2014 regardless of how you look, where you live, what language you speak, or who you love,\u201d and promised that, as they put it, \u201cWe will not be dragged back into the past.\u201dThis last bit matters because California\u2019s past is not pretty. The genocide of indigenous Californians was remarkable among North American Indian wars for its sheer scale and evil. California resentment of Chinese laborers in the Gold Rush mines and on the railroads helped produce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first federal law to restrict immigration by people of a specific ethnicity. During World War II, Californians incarcerated thousands of law-abiding American citizens of Japanese descent while leaving those of German and Italian descent unmolested.After that war ended, African-American migrants to California were surprised to find racist real-estate redlining and a virulent West Coast version of Jim Crow. Tim Watkins, president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Los Angeles, told me that his father was sent out here alone from Mississippi at age 13 because a lynch mob was after him. \u201cWhen my father got off a train in L.A., the first thing he saw was a \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign on a restaurant,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. \u201cWhen he married my mother, a white woman, he could not marry her here, so their marriage certificate is in espa\u00f1ol because they went down to old Mexico.\u201dThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped, but not enough to stop the violent Watts uprising of 1965 or the Rodney King riots of 1992, both of which expressed collective fury over systemic racism. As recently as 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, revived a flagging re-election bid by backing Proposition 187, which barred the state from providing public services to undocumented immigrants. Proposition 187 passed, but was never really implemented. According to Senator de Le\u00f3n, Wilson\u2019s re-election did for California what Mr. Trump\u2019s election and promised deportations might yet do for America: It woke up the Latino vote and ushered in the deep-blue politics that have since helped to legalize same-sex marriage, make Obamacare work, turn virtually the entire state into one big sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants and enact far-reaching climate-change regulations.Anyone who doubts that progressivism is good business has to reckon with the fact that California is now the sixth largest economy in the world, ahead of France, Russia and India, with $2.46 trillion in gross domestic product.It\u2019s not all sunshine, of course. California\u2019s $54 billion agriculture industry thrives on the exploitation of migrant workers, and our poverty rates and income inequality are among the nation\u2019s worst, thanks partly to a technology economy that makes millionaires in coastal cities but does little for the hinterlands except raise the cost of living. That helps explain why 3.7 million Californians \u2014 33 percent of the vote \u2014 chose Donald Trump and why California\u2019s electoral map resembles the national one, with red counties in the rural white interior and blue mostly on the coast.Many Californians are also casting a gimlet eye at the two big industries whose leaders talk a liberal game but sell products that arguably undermine civil society: entertainment and technology. In Los Angeles, that conversation includes movies and TV shows that, in the words of the actor and author Robinne Lee, \u201coften extend the perception that it\u2019s a white man\u2019s world and everyone else is just a guest star.\u201d In Silicon Valley the obvious culprits are Twitter, which has become a hate-speech superhighway, and Facebook and Google, both of which capture eyeballs by tailoring news feeds and search results to make us feel good. In so doing, and especially by supporting the mass dissemination of fake news and outright lies, they radically reinforce the biases that drive Americans into dangerously oppositional camps of red and blue.But the overwhelming \u2014 and novel \u2014 sentiment coming out of Nov. 8 remains one of common identity, which is remarkable in a place that is 38.8 percent Hispanic, 38 percent non-Hispanic white, 14.7 percent Asian and 6.5 percent African-American, and where just about everybody knows both steady churchgoers and at least one loving and stable family with two moms or two dads. Paola Martinez-Montes, director of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment in San Diego, says that California\u2019s African-American and Latino communities no longer see themselves as oppositional and that she has also been in touch with the A.C.L.U. and Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to understand that we are going to walk in this together, and that\u2019s really positive,\u201d she told me.Senator de Le\u00f3n, by the time I caught up with him, was on an airplane bound for a climate-change conference in Morocco.\u201cI\u2019m going to be mobbed \u2014 everybody is going to be asking me what the hell happened,\u201d he said by telephone, just before the plane took off. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t want to go our direction, we\u2019re going it alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is all provided by businesses looking to get a bit of publicity by encouraging everyone to fulfill their civic duty.The only problem? All those giveaways are technically against the law.\u201cThe basic line on this is in an election where a federal candidate is on the ballot, you cannot give anyone any reward \u2014 anything of any value \u2014 for turning out to vote,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a civic pride thing or if it\u2019s not about any one candidate.\u201dBut companies are rarely penalized for Election Day freebies, he said. That means these kinds of giveaway offers pop up every four years, including today.\u201cThis comes up every election because businesses have this civic-minded idea that they can promote their business and be patriotic,\u201d Professor Hasen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intuitively obvious that it\u2019s illegal to give things away to people who exercise their civic pride. I certainly understand the confusion.\u201dSome giveaways are acceptable, however. The big one is transportation: It is common for political groups, churches and others to provide voters a free lift to the polls on Election Day.Lyft is offering a 45 percent discount on one ride (because the nation is electing its 45th president) between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. in almost two dozen cities. Zipcar, a vehicle-sharing service, is providing free use of its cars so people can drive themselves to the polls.Arrangements like that shouldn\u2019t pose a legal problem, experts said. But when it comes to an election, everything is up for debate.\u201cYou can have an extended law school class discussion about exactly what is the difference between driving someone to the polls when it would cost them several dollars to get there versus just giving them $5 outright,\u201d said Edward B. Foley, a professor of law and the director of the Election Law Program at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s a slippery slope, to use a term law professors like to use a lot.\u201dHe urged his employees to stay positive and be kind to one another and the people around them.\u201cIn the face of this epic, unseemly election and the concern we all share about the direction of our country and the lack of truth and void of leadership, we can still make a difference in the lives of the people we touch and influence every day,\u201d he wrote.But will it be giving anything away? A spokesman on Monday night said the answer was no.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Home With the Macabre", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byOn the way to show an apartment in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, the real estate agent turned to the prospective renters and said something unnecessary.\u201cBefore we get here, I should tell you that the guy who lived here before committed suicide.\u201dThe renters, Julia Dahl and her boyfriend, Joel Bukiewicz, shared an uneasy glance but decided to view the rental anyway. Besides, in 2007, it was a steal: a one-bedroom in a prewar walk-up for $1,250 on the southern lip of Prospect Park. Despite the broker\u2019s disclosure, and the portentousness of their move-in date, the couple signed the lease and settled in that Halloween.A short while later, neighbors introduced themselves, made the couple feel welcome, and talked about the former tenant, who had killed himself in the apartment a few weeks before it came on the market.\u201cThey did a good job cleaning it up,\u201d one neighbor told the couple.Ms. Dahl, 39, who writes crime fiction, and her now-husband, Mr. Bukiewicz, lived in the cozy apartment for four years. Their situation was unusual, not because someone had died in the space, but because their broker had alerted them to it. Ms. Dahl and her husband might never have discovered the apartment\u2019s grisly history had someone not told them about it.And prospective buyers and renters often come to the negotiating table already knowing everything about an apartment or home, brokers say, having conducted their own internet searches and reviewed public records online.Of course, death has not always been a cause for real estate stigma. In fact, dying did not move out of family homes and into hospitals until the early 20th century.But today, \u201cWe\u2019re removed from death,\u201d said Karen S. Sonn, a real estate lawyer and founder of Sonn & Associates in Manhattan. Some people, however, might be more averse to the idea of living with the dead because of religious or cultural beliefs, Ms. Sonn said. But she added that clients are coming to her more prepared because, in the age of information, an apartment\u2019s history is easy to discover.\u201cI have young, smart people who ask me everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey Google names. Everything\u2019s available. When they come to me, they\u2019re so well-informed; they know what they\u2019re buying.\u201dAre utilities included? Is there a lien on the property? Are pets allowed? These are the questions commonly asked by renters and buyers and expected by brokers. But some questions \u2014 Has anyone died in this apartment? Were felonious crimes committed here? \u2014 often go unasked, so unanswered.Disclosing a property\u2019s macabre past may seem like the ethical thing to do, and buyers or renters are likely to discover it on their own anyway, but some argue that when marketing a home, brokers should keep certain things secret.Randall Bell, an economist and an author of \u201cReal Estate Damages\u201d who has consulted on the appraisals of notorious properties, like the homes of O. J. Simpson and JonBenet Ramsey, said that a stigma can erase up to 25 percent of the value. He added, though, that as time passes and memories fade, the value eventually returns.\u201cMy advice for brokers is to tell the truth,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cI generally advise to get the properties occupied. Don\u2019t let them sit empty.\u201dMedia reports \u2014 especially on a story covered nationally \u2014 can draw unwanted attention to a property. And simple pedestrian traffic generated by curiosity seekers can cut into home value. If a residence becomes a public showcase \u2014 like the house on Long Island that inspired the \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d book and movies chronicling murders that happened there in 1974 \u2014 privacy concerns might drive away potential owners and cause the property value to plummet.\u201cThe gawking question impacts both low- and high-profile cases, but it is more pronounced in the high-profile situations,\u201d Mr. Bell said. His advice: \u201cJust let it happen. Just let people get it out of their systems.\u201dTaking an apartment regardless of its history is a notable shift from renters\u2019 mentality before the recession and the burst housing bubble in 2008, according to brokers. New York\u2019s latest scramble for affordable housing has softened expectations, even as rents have increased.\u201cWhen the market is very tight, these sort of things get overlooked,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Most renters or buyers won\u2019t think twice if they stumble onto a hard-to-pass-up deal; besides, death and whatever stigma surrounds an apartment wane with time.\u201cIn a couple of years, it goes away, in terms of the stigma,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s an apartment that hasn\u2019t been touched in 30, 40 years; they\u2019re going to gut it no matter what.\u201dEmma Grady, a writer living in Brooklyn, moved to New York in November 2008 after college. After living in a \u201ccloset-sized room\u201d in Chelsea, she decided to move into what seemed like a typical Bank Street apartment in Greenwich Village.\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about the neighborhood or its reputation,\u201d Ms. Grady said. \u201cI was completely new to New York.\u201dShe didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. For one, she did not know who Sid Vicious was. Second, she knew that it had happened more than 20 years before, and other people had lived in that space without issue.\u201cThe apartment was renovated, so it didn\u2019t feel like it was the same apartment it had been years before,\u201d Ms. Grady said.During the six months she lived there in her early 20s, Ms. Grady, now 30, changed the room where she slept a couple of times. Each time, she recalled the death and wondered whether she was then sleeping in the place where the performer had died.\u201cBut I never felt like the apartment was haunted,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are plenty of people living in New York apartments that someone passed away in, they just don\u2019t know it.\u201d She added, \u201cI also think you have to accept a bit of the unusual on a daily basis to live in New York, so perhaps that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\u201cIf I was an uninformed person, I\u2019d think it was the spirits talking to me \u2014 but it\u2019s just the building,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Ghosts\u2019 are probably just noise pollution. And history is based on people\u2019s collective misconception.\u201cJust because there\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Fedak said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s haunted.\u201dThough Ms. Dahl and her husband have since moved to the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn and started a family, she credits her success as a writer to that Windsor Terrace apartment tainted by suicide. Had it not been for that, she never would have delved into Hasidism, which the former tenant had practiced, and which continues to figure prominently in her novels.Ms. Dahl felt her apartment in Windsor Terrace would have been a surefire place to meet a ghost, if ghosts were real. She did relish the hunt for spirits whenever the opportunity presented itself: when the cat was acting weird, or she was alone in a darkened apartment and found herself standing in front of her bathroom mirror.But nothing happened, and life moved on.\u201cI never saw anything abnormal at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he was a ghost, he was a friendly ghost.\u201dA cover article last Sunday, about properties with a grisly history, misstated the number of adults killed by Adam Lanza at a school in Newtown, Conn.

{"Headline": "Inside the 21st-Century Craze for Redesigning Everything", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "1. The ProblemIn theory, the redesign begins with a problem. The problem might be specific or systemic or subjective. A logo makes a company\u2019s image feel out of date. A familiar household object has been overtaken by new technology. A service has become too confusing for new users. And so on. The world is, after all, full of problems.The human desire to solve problems fuels brand-new inventions too: The wheel, for example, eased conveyance significantly. But the redesign tends to address problems with, or caused by, dimensions of the human-designed world, and identifying such problems may be the designer\u2019s most crucial skill. Redesigns fail when they address the wrong problem \u2014 or something that really wasn\u2019t a problem in the first place. While progress may entail change, change does not necessarily guarantee progress. But a clever redesign, one that addresses the right problem in an intelligent fashion, improves the world, if just by a bit.Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Simons was so impressed that she signed two students, Amy Wu and Luke Stern, to a three-month contract that summer. The two of them soon zeroed in on a particularly thorny design problem: the big, instructional decal on Citi Bike\u2019s kiosks. Annual members used a key fob and had no reason to interact with the decal, but it was the gateway for casual users. Consisting mostly of text, the decals were dense and off-putting, especially to tourists uncomfortable with English. Some failed to understand that they were supposed to type in a code from a printed receipt to unlock a bike; instead, they tried to figure out how to insert the receipt itself into a slot on the docking station.There was another, more prosaic reason that Stern and Wu focused on the decal: It was something they could actually change. Citi Bike is operated by a private firm, but New York\u2019s Transportation Department oversees it, too, and the technology involves an external vendor. The decal, however, was produced in-house. So Stern and Wu proposed refashioning it, using a set of instructional pictograms loosely inspired by Ikea booklets. They tested several prototypes and endured baffled responses from Citi Bike users until eventually landing on a gridlike arrangement of visuals that people found intuitive. Simons and the Transportation Department signed off on a final version, and it was installed on the city\u2019s 300-plus Citi Bike stations. Wu checked the service\u2019s publicly available user data a month later and discovered that casual ridership had increased about 14 percent. \u201cIt was a little bit surreal,\u201d Stern recalls. \u201cWe can actually make a difference.\u201dIndeed, this is the platonic ideal of the redesign: A designer sees a problem, proposes a solution, makes a difference. Such tidy narratives fuel a reigning ideology in which every object, symbol or pool of information is just another design problem awaiting some solution. The thermostat, the fire extinguisher, the toothbrush, the car dashboard \u2014 all have been redesigned, whether anybody was clamoring for their alteration or not.This hunger for change has been a boon for firms like IDEO. Tim Brown, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, has overseen IDEO\u2019s steady expansion from product design to interactive and service design for businesses like Bank of America and Microsoft, and in more recent years even for municipalities and governments. He has been a vocal proponent of the idea that \u201cdesign thinking\u201d can be applied to just about any problem. \u201cThere are two takes on the redesign,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThe glass-half-empty take on redesign is, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re unnecessarily redesigning a chair,\u2019 or a lamp, or whatever.\u201dProblem: not enough casual users. Solution: reworking the instructions for newcomers from a text-heavy approach to something more pictorial, reminiscent of Ikea instructions.The glass-half-full take requires a broader perspective: \u201cThe need to redesign is really dependent on how fit for purpose the thing in question is,\u201d Brown says. In his thinking, much of our world is built around systems designed to respond to the social structures and technologies of the industrial age. Everything from systems of education and health care to the design of cities and modes of transportation, he says, all trace their roots to a drastically different era and ought to be fundamentally rethought for the one we live in now. \u201cI think we\u2019ve potentially never been in a period of history where there are so many things that are no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore the idea of redesign is entirely appropriate, I think \u2014 even though it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d2. What to ChangeYou don\u2019t have to listen to Karim Rashid for very long to get a sense that he thinks pretty much every single manifestation of the built environment needs to be redesigned. Known for his colorful personal and professional style, he has had a long run as one of the most famous industrial designers in America. He believes design is a fundamentally social act that makes the world a better place. But it is also, he points out, a business. So in practice, most redesigns begin with a client; without one, not much happens. He has worked with many of them \u2014 on furniture, packaging, gadgets, housewares, luxury goods, even condos and hotels. But he has learned that even having a client does not guarantee that any given redesign will ever make it out of renderings and prototypes and into the real world. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m prolific,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine if all the other stuff got to go to market?\u201dAs Rashid sees it, so many of the things that surround us bear cumbersome vestiges of the past. \u201cThe world is full of this kind of kitsch history \u2014 history that has nothing to do with the world we live in now,\u201d he says. He points to a redesign project of his that fizzled, a complete rethinking of the business-class tableware for Delta Air Lines. His proposal was bold: His bowls had sharp angles that echoed Delta\u2019s triangular logo, his trays had subtle recesses that anchored dishes in place and his wineglasses skipped the stem in favor of a tapered shape with a wide base.\u201cThe stem on a wineglass is meaningless,\u201d Rashid says. He dismisses the conventional argument that it prevents the drinker\u2019s hand from interfering with wine\u2019s ideal temperature; to have the slightest such effect, he claims, you\u2019d have to wrap your palm around the bowl for 20 straight minutes. The stem is actually a leftover artifact, he says, from centuries ago, when goblets made of metal had high stems to signal status and wealth. This design quirk remained after we switched to glass, Rashid says. Making wineglasses look a certain way because that\u2019s how they have always looked is a classic example of privileging form over function. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in first class or business class on an airplane with turbulence,\u201d Rashid says, \u201cwith a wineglass with a stem on it \u2014 do you understand? It\u2019s so stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHis proposed redesigns were striking, but they had to pass muster with the service-item maker, the flight attendants\u2019 union and Delta itself \u2014 which ultimately declined to move forward with the concepts Rashid proposed. \u201cIt was all rejected,\u201d he tells me, with a sigh. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t look like domestic tableware.\u201dRashid loves to \u201cbreak archetypes,\u201d in effect redesigning a whole object category. But the hurdles to doing so involve practicality as well as taste. More recently, he designed the Solarin mobile phone for Sirin Labs. It is equipped with extreme encryption capabilities and made with wealthy, privacy-obsessed customers in mind. It costs an eye-popping $12,000 and up. The client had a sky\u2019s-the-limit attitude about imbuing the phone with a truly distinct form.The payment giant\u2019s top priority in revisiting its logo for the first time in decades: Don\u2019t mess it up. The result, released earlier this year, is a version of the familiar interlocked-circles symbol streamlined for the digital era.3. What to KeepSituations like this can unnerve clients, and this knowledge was certainly relevant to Mastercard when it decided this year to update its logo for the first time in more than 20 years. Raja Rajamannar, the global chief marketing and communications officer, says that the first parameter he gave his designer, Michael Bierut at Pentagram, \u201cwas not to mess things up.\u201d The online crowd can get \u201cpretty nasty,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get mired in unnecessary controversy and negativity.\u201dThis conservatism among clients can frustrate designers. \u201cI was kind of brought up in this tradition that, you know, there\u2019s nothing more inspiring than the blank slate, the open brief,\u201d Bierut says. But over the years he has come to appreciate the challenge of \u201cstarting with a given,\u201d particularly now.\u201cThe last big period of redesign was the postwar era,\u201d Bierut says. \u201cThere was this mania to make older companies look new and modern.\u201d As a more corporate world emerged, the visual vernacular of mom-and-pop businesses looked quaint, and so design shifted from an emphasis on manufacturing things to selling more abstract forms of value. A railroad doesn\u2019t run trains, the thinking went; it provides transportation \u2014 so instead of a representation of a locomotive, its more modern logo might rely on arrows and italic typography. More broadly, idiosyncratic or hand-drawn lettering gave way to stylized and minimal iconography and type treatments that projected far-flung and trustworthy power. \u201cCorporate design was done as a command-and-control exercise,\u201d he says, resulting in a master solution laid out in \u201ca thick binder\u201d prescribing how every branding element would appear.By the \u201980s and \u201990s, that approach started to feel dated, suspicious and at odds with a vogue for more agile management theories. So in the last two decades, there has been a fresh wave of redesigns as companies have repositioned themselves in a more globalized, technologized marketplace. Mastercard is one of many examples of a company looking to update visual strategies designed with billboards and brick-and-mortar stores in mind for the age of social media and a transnational customer base.Nevertheless, the specific dimensions of Mastercard\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t mess it up\u201d parameter included keeping the interlocking circles \u2014 one red, one yellow \u2014 that the brand has used for more than half a century. Bierut believes that this was wise: Unlike a book cover or a poster, a brand mark is \u201cmore like a building,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t unveil it thinking it\u2019s going to work once and then be on its way. It\u2019s supposed to accrue value the longer it\u2019s invested in.\u201d The raw familiarity that builds up over years, which marketers refer to as \u201cequity,\u201d probably plays a bigger factor in our assessment of a supposedly great logo design than we realize. Bierut is tickled, for instance, by how many people seem to admire Target\u2019s logo. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine if you went to your client whose name was Target and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea,\u2019 then you went away for a few weeks and came back with a circle with a dot in the middle, and an invoice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe client would be skeptical \u2014 and the world at large would destroy you.\u201dFor Mastercard, Pentagram got as creative as the brief allowed, offering dozens of yellow-and-red-circle variations \u2014 adding additional colors to suggest inclusivity, or a superminimal take presenting only the outlines of the interlocked rings. Rajamannar (and others at Mastercard, crosschecked by multiple rounds of market research) passed on those, opting for a treatment that amounted to a kind of reiteration of the existing mark. The colors became a little brighter, a set of stripes in their overlap was eliminated in favor of a single orange-y color and the name moved below the circles. Ultimately, in fact, the new symbol is designed to be able to stand alone, with no name at all; Rajamannar says testing conducted across 11 countries found 81 percent of respondents recognized the wordless version of the logo as Mastercard\u2019s.In short, the not-messing-it-up mission was deemed a success \u2014 and there was no notable backlash. \u201cThis kind of brand mark has become more ubiquitous than the designers of the \u201960s and \u201970s ever would have dreamed,\u201d Bierut says, and that may explain a public interest in design that would have been a shock in that era. It should not be so surprising today; the design profession has been on a decades-long mission to have its work taken seriously across the culture. But now, having achieved what they wanted, many designers seem to wish the public would be more deferential \u2014 something Bierut finds amusing. \u201cIf designers claim to want people to be interested and invested in and care about design,\u201d he says, \u201cthey sort of have to accept that interest on the terms of, you know, the audience.\u201d4. Where to CompromiseIn 2011, Jamie Siminoff had just sold a start-up and was spending most of his days in his garage in Pacific Palisades, Calif., determined to come up with a new business concept. Tinkering with ideas including a gardening business and new conference-call technology, he soon became annoyed, because he could never hear his doorbell, and he kept missing visitors. So he \u201chacked together\u201d a system that linked the bell to his phone. His wife told him that it was far more useful than the notions he was chasing in the garage. The idea evolved to include a camera and a motion detector \u2014 and thus the ability to monitor your front door from anywhere, with a smartphone, making the object as much about security as convenience.The product he ended up with, Ring, is a good example of a broader phenomenon in the world of industrial design. The technology shifts that Brown and Rashid cite have quickened the pace of redesigns in more mundane, less grandiose ways. Thanks to the proliferation of cheap sensors, circuit boards, cameras and other components, practically every consumer good now seems susceptible to reinvention as a \u201csmart object.\u201d Even the path Siminoff traveled from concept to design was made easier by technology and start-up mania, first with the aid of a crowdfunding campaign, then with an unsuccessful but profile-raising appearance on \u201cShark Tank.\u201dSometimes such a path results in a version of what the tech critic Evgeny Morozov calls \u201csolutionism\u201d \u2014 starting with a supposed breakthrough and then seeking out a supposed problem that it can hypothetically solve. And at times the presumed innovations in these tech-centric redesigns seem to run well ahead of their potential privacy and security pitfalls. (\u201cYes,\u201d the tech site Motherboard reported last year, \u201cyour smart dildo can be hacked.\u201d) But sometimes it results in a hit, like the widely celebrated update of the thermostat in internet-connected, app-controlled form created by the start-up Nest, which was ultimately bought by Google for $3.2 billion.By his own account, Siminoff\u2019s first stab at the product was a bit off. He called it Doorbot, and its look matched the geeky name: a vaguely sci-fi, curved object with a camera concealed by a spooky, bulbous protrusion. \u201cThat was the pride of the design,\u201d Siminoff says now, laughing. He prototyped it in his garage with a couple of recent college graduates; none of them had a design background. The marketplace set him straight, he says: \u201cNo one wanted this big HAL 9000 thing on the front door.\u201d He still believed in the object\u2019s utility, but he realized he would need to redesign his redesign.Siminoff found his way to Chris Loew, an industrial designer in Silicon Valley, with a long record in technology hardware; he worked on early versions of tablet products and spent 16 years at IDEO helping clients including Samsung and Oral-B. In more recent years he has been hired by a number of start-ups. Impressed by Siminoff, Loew also recognized the issues with Doorbot. \u201cIt was very gadgety,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if you were being shot with radiation or \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not offensive, but you didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d In short, it didn\u2019t look like a doorbell, and even the most impressive technical capabilities have to be presented in a form that makes sense to the consumer.The original version of this reimagined doorbell (equipped with a camera and intercom) had such a sci-fi look that visitors often didn\u2019t know what it was. A redesign of that redesign has placed it in the realm of functional home d\u00e9cor \u2014 and it has been installed in hundreds of thousands of homes.In this case, that meant a design that resonated with basic home architecture. There were already serious technologized constraints: It had to accommodate a fairly large battery, a camera, a circuit board and a motion detector that required an opening of a specific size. And from a purely aesthetic perspective, the architectural setting imposed limits that might not apply to a free-standing product: Nobody really wants to tack a wild experiment in product design to a front door. Loew settled on a rectangular shape that would visually echo molding. \u201cEverybody\u2019s house is really just extruded shapes and planar shapes,\u201d says Loew, who is now Ring\u2019s lead product designer. The product comes in various finishes informed by classic door hardware, and is meant to be notable but not flashy.The company has grown to 500 employees, with hundreds of thousands of installations already done. The only holdover from Doorbot is a circle around the button that glows blue when pressed.5. When to Start OverSmiedt paused on one image of a carry-on bag with a side pocket containing a flask-shaped plastic bottle outfitted with a strong microfilter. This accessory popped up during the luggage-design process as a useful alternative to buying bottled water after every airport security check. \u201cSo no matter what country,\u201d Rashid explained, \u201cI go across and to the bathroom and fill it up with clean water. Because it\u2019s absurd, this idea of drinking bottled water \u2014 the landfill is enormous, 18 million bottles are thrown away a day in America.\u201d Both men immediately saw its appeal. Smiedt promptly \u201cdisappeared,\u201d Rashid continued, \u201cand six months later came back and said: \u2018You know, forget the luggage. We\u2019re doing the water bottle.\u2019\u2009\u201dOn its own, the flasklike form seemed off, so Smiedt pushed for alternatives, something more like what was on Rashid\u2019s product shelf \u2014 but not exactly. An hourglass-like, squeezable shape that Rashid eventually dreamed up was perfect. But it required making a lengthy search to find a capable manufacturer \u2014 \u201cNobody had made a blow-molded bottle that was thinner in the middle,\u201d Smiedt said \u2014 and committing to a huge production order for the product, which they called Bobble.\u201cCompanies are often risk-averse,\u201d Smiedt continued, \u201cand don\u2019t get design\u2019s possibilities. But designers do what they want to design, and it often doesn\u2019t connect with the consumer,\u201d at least not the mass scale he had in mind. \u201cFor me,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe key to design is that it can\u2019t polarize.\u201d Many designers would recoil from that assertion, but as a mass-market-oriented entrepreneur, Smiedt\u2019s goals are different. He thinks a lot about who is not going to like a new take on a useful object, as a way to \u201cget to something that\u2019s really understood.\u201dThis new take on the reusable water bottle started out as an accessory to a luggage redesign. The luggage was scuttled \u2014 but Bobble, with a distinct shape and a strong microfilter, has sold millions.The Bobble bottle sold 15 million units in its first three years on the market. Smiedt sold Bobble to Seventh Generation and has gone back into business with Rashid, this time in a partnership. They want to redesign more travel-related accessories, so they started by dumping their luggage onto a table and talking about what they carried, and what they needed. Their first idea involved finding a way to keep smeary touch-controlled gadgets clean. Rashid designed a travel-size spray bottle, arriving at an elliptical form, more like a worry stone than a bottle. They both loved the object\u2019s shape and feel but wondered about the breadth of its appeal. Ultimately, they shelved it, though not entirely.They went back to the results of the bag-dump experiment and zeroed in on the most bothersome objects: the dull-colored, blocky, careless-looking power adapters and portable chargers and their various entangled wires. What if you combined a wall charger and mobile battery in a single object? What if it had a more appealing aesthetic? Smiedt sourced the technology, and Rashid designed around it to create an object they called Bump. Sifting through a box of prototypes, Smiedt pointed out that this completely different product has almost the same elliptical shape as the discarded cleaner idea. This \u201cfun\u201d form (it comes in magenta, red, black and blue) will carry through the entire product line, he explained. Rashid also devised a matching cable, and a clever silicone sleeve that is used both to store the cable and to protect Bump when it\u2019s tossed into a bag.Of course, there was a hitch. Market testing found that consumers were often happy to use Bump with the (less attractive) power cable they already owned, and didn\u2019t bother with the sleeve. So as Bump goes on sale online and rolls out across big retailers, starting with the Container Store in late October, the cord is now sold separately. And that clever silicone sleeve may also be sold separately \u2014 or it may be on its way to a prototype box somewhere.6. The SolutionAll redesigns have something in common: They end. This does not happen at the moment the redesigned symbol, object or interface is implemented. It happens when that redesign is replaced. Maybe that\u2019s the lofty logic of progress, or just the workaday logic of capitalism. But it\u2019s certainly the logic of the redesign, and perhaps design in general, in the early 21st century. When IDEO\u2019s Tim Brown talks about updating all that is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d today, he\u2019s talking about entire systems, not just their individual and tangible components and manifestations.IDEO started out as an industrial-design firm working on consumer products; it expanded further into interaction design as the digital world took hold, and then it went into services. Now its projects include \u201credesigning\u201d such abstractions as the school lunch (for the city of San Francisco) or the vote (for Los Angeles County), experimenting with how to lace in 21st-century technology elements and shed out-of-date practices. These are incremental efforts that play out over years. There is no momentous before-and-after unveiling, just a continuous process of researching, trying and replacing ideas. This, after all, is how designers work: in an ongoing system of study, hunches, prototypes, tests and do-overs.The inevitability of re-redesign is something that Amy Wu (now part of a Microsoft design team in San Francisco) and Luke Stern (now a designer for Intersection, a firm focused on civic spaces) encountered in their work for Citi Bike. A few months after the triumphant installation of their redesigned kiosk decals, the company that operated Citi Bike was bought by another bike-share operator, Motivate, which runs similar programs for several other cities. They got an email from Citi Bike saying they might be needed again, but then never heard back.The new owner promptly set about a broader upgrade of Citi Bike\u2019s system involving new software and changes to the hardware in those kiosks. This meant that the decals needed to be redesigned yet again. The new ones incorporated some of Wu and Stern\u2019s thinking, but in a new look that, among other things, visually announced to the world that Citi Bike had been updated.Stern and Wu are philosophical about this turn. \u201cThe logistics had changed,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThey had to update the system. Our design wasn\u2019t actually relevant any more. That\u2019s reality, right?\u201d Right. And it was certainly a useful final lesson for an effort that started out as a student project: All redesigns end, but the redesign never does. \u2666Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}

Across two centuries\u2019 of texts, they found that people\u2019s preference for positive words varied with national mood, and declined during times of war and economic hardship.Many theories have been proposed: Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re social creatures, and affirmative language promotes group bonding and cooperation.

{"Headline": "The Election Highlighted a Growing Rural-Urban Split", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byThe Great DivideDonald J. Trump fared very poorly in American cities in Tuesday\u2019s election. Hillary Clinton did just as badly among rural voters. The political divide between the two groups has been growing more stark in America for years, and 2016 showed an even sharper split than 2012.Mr. Trump\u2019s own Manhattan gave him just 10 percent, a new nadir for a G.O.P. presidential candidate in the borough. His soon-to-be home, Washington, gave him just 4 percent.Most of the change, though, occurred not around the big cities \u2014 where Democratic candidates have only so many votes left to pick up \u2014 but far outside them. Just 15 counties tilted by more than five percentage points in favor of Mrs. Clinton relative to how they voted in 2012. By contrast, 1,826 moved by at least that much away from the Democratic candidate.The counties that swung the most drastically toward Mr. Trump, by 15 points or more, were nearly all in the Midwest. That abrupt shift was probably driven by numerous factors that are hard to untangle: weak economic prospects; Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lack of attention to those places on the campaign trail; Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobic message to voters anxious about change.But the widening political divergence between cities and small-town America also reflects a growing alienation between the two groups, and a sense \u2014 perhaps accurate \u2014 that their fates are not connected.\u201cIn a sense, the high-end economy in these urban areas is disconnected from the success from the rest of the country,\u201d Mr. Renn said. And the very things that drive success in Silicon Valley\u2019s tech industry, or New York City\u2019s financial sector, are what worries rural America: globalization, foreign trade, immigration. \u201cGoldman Sachs and Google do not really need America to be a broad-based middle-class success in order for them to be personally successful.\u201dThose economic forces will probably grow only stronger, even as the effects of an election that pushed urban and rural America further apart recede.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Spends Big to Build a Computer Out of Science Fiction", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Microsoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today\u2019s digital computers.There is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible \u2014 and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics.Microsoft\u2019s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs.In the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company\u2019s approach is based on \u201cbraiding\u201d particles known as anyons \u2014 which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions \u2014 to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles.Leading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today\u2019s digital systems.Unlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an \u201centangled\u201d state \u2014 physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined \u2014 with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of qubits.\u201cOnce we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,\u201d Mr. Holmdahl said.There is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created.Mr. Holmdahl\u2019s project will also include the physicists Leo Kouwenhoven of Delft University, Charles M. Marcus of the University of Copenhagen, David Reilly of the University of Sydney and Matthias Troyer of E.T.H. Zurich.Microsoft\u2019s newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the last two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable qubits.\u201cThe magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and superconductors,\u201d Dr. Marcus said. The researchers recently made a \u201cremarkable breakthrough\u201d in their ability to control the materials used to form qubits, he said. Most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures.So far, there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than today\u2019s digital computers. One early effort, known as Shor\u2019s algorithm, would be used to factor numbers, giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes.That would potentially have world-shaking consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers. Other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning algorithms, which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition.More immediately, however, these tools might advance the basic understanding of physics, a possibility the physicist Richard P. Feynman mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in 1982.For his part, Dr. Kouwenhoven said, \u201cMy dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum physics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Hong Kong\u2019s Kowloon, the Markets Rule", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerMy grandmother and I walked along Kweilin Street in Kowloon, near the Sham Shui Po rail station, where the open-air market was a scene of controlled chaos.Along a stretch of five or six blocks, vendors selling everything from wristwatches to dish towels to pirated DVDs began their operations on the sidewalk and bled into the street. Hundreds of people walked along the street as if it was a pedestrian promenade, which it isn\u2019t \u2014 every now and again a car would patiently maneuver through.In Hong Kong, the market rules. The former British colony has thrived as an economic powerhouse under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy developed under Deng Xiaoping.I focused my energy on the Kowloon peninsula, which is a bit grittier and less touristy than Hong Kong Island, just a few thousand feet away across Victoria Harbor.The biggest expense when staying in Kowloon will inevitably be housing. I confess that I cheated, as I have family members who live about an hour out of the city center, and with whom I stayed for most of my trip.Beyond lodging, travel essentials include a SIM card for your phone and an Octopus pass, a rechargeable card used to get around on public transportation. I bought my SIM card at one of the ubiquitous 7-Elevens in the city. For 140 dollars (less than $20), I got a local calling plan and five gigabytes of data \u2014 plenty for a short trip. I primarily used the data for maps and train and bus schedules (Google Maps does a decent job).The winding, narrow streets of Kowloon can be difficult to navigate, but I was lucky enough to have a resource in Daisann McLane, a former Frugal Traveler columnist who now lives most of the year in Hong Kong.We met on a slightly brisk evening in Tsim Sha Tsui, the glittering, shopping-heavy (and fairly tourist-laden) area of Kowloon near the harbor. She immediately led me out of the neighborhood farther north, promising me a more local experience.\u201cWhen the weather starts to chill, everyone lines up for bo zai fan,\u201d she said, referring to clay pot rice, a traditional Cantonese dish. We exited the Yau Ma Tei M.T.R. station after a short ride (4.50 dollars) and almost immediately saw a line down Arthur Street at the popular Four Seasons Pot Rice.We lined up at the slightly less popular, but still excellent, Hing Kee Claypot Rice, dodging an imperious dishwasher carrying a load of bowls as we joined the line. \u201cIn Hong Kong,\u201d Ms. McLane said, \u201cthe dishwashers get paid more than the cooks.\u201d If the dishwasher stops working, the whole restaurant shuts down.I ordered a bowl of clay pot rice with white eel (58 dollars), and we shared a fried pancake dotted with fat, juicy oysters (35 dollars). The clay pot emerged perilously hot, the rice audibly crackling under slices of bone-in eel. We crunched on the slightly burned bits of rice from the bottom of the bowl. It was simple, warm and comforting.Afterward, we walked over to the Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market, in the shadow of crumbling, rickety old shophouses. The market, which is active throughout the night, really ramps up in the early morning hours. Some of the fruit is outrageously expensive, and that helps explain why fruit is such a common gift in Chinese culture. A beautiful imported Japanese watermelon was an absurd 350 dollars \u2014 nearly $50. I bought a few apples for my grandmother and paid a more reasonable 12 dollars each.On another day, I went for a walk through Kowloon City, a section of town that partly includes an actual walled city with a history that can be traced back centuries and was demolished in the 1990s (it\u2019s now a public park).From there, I strolled through the Kowloon Walled City Park, stopping to look at the ruins of the original south gate of the city.Ultimately, though, the markets are what truly capture the essence of Hong Kong. As my grandmother and I walked that afternoon among the busy vendors on that not-really-pedestrianized Kweilin Street in Sham Shui Po, I asked her about Hong Kong\u2019s huge, distinctive apartment blocks, the facades of which are dotted with air-conditioners and drying clothing. \u201cPeople were living in shanty towns in the hills after the war, so the government built all of this housing,\u201d she said.We took a turn into the multilevel Pei Ho street market, a sobering, indoor scene of fresh produce, live chickens, quivering pig carcasses, slithering eels in Styrofoam crates and nearly anything else you could think to eat.On the top floor of the market, we grabbed a very good lunch of steamed pomfret with black bean sauce, greens and a half chicken for 165 dollars at the New Kam Dor Po Kitchen on the top floor of the market, then tried to find her childhood home on Kweilin Street.We reached the address, only to find that the building had been torn down long ago. \u201cOh, of course it\u2019s gone,\u201d said my grandmother, unsurprised. Everything had changed so much, she said, but the spirit of the place was more or less the same. And with that, she happily posed for a picture in front of the new building that stood at her old address.The Frugal Traveler column last Sunday, about the Kowloon area of Hong Kong, characterized Hong Kong incorrectly. It is a city, not a country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While We Weren\u2019t Looking, Snapchat Revolutionized Social Networks", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSnap Inc., the parent company of the popular photo-messaging and storytelling app Snapchat, is having a productive autumn.And yet, even when it\u2019s grabbing headlines, it often seems as if Snap gets little respect.This is all wrong. If you secretly harbor the idea that Snapchat is frivolous or somehow a fad, it\u2019s time to re-examine your certainties. In fact, in various large and small ways, Snap has quietly become one of the world\u2019s most innovative and influential consumer technology companies.Snap, which is based far outside the Silicon Valley bubble, in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, is pushing radically new ideas about how humans should interact with computers. It is pioneering a model of social networking that feels more intimate and authentic than the Facebook-led ideas that now dominate the online world. Snap\u2019s software and hardware designs, as well as its marketing strategies, are more daring than much of what we\u2019ve seen from tech giants, including Apple.Snap is still relatively small; its 150 million daily user base pales in comparison to Facebook\u2019s 1.2 billion, and its success is far from assured. In its novelty, it can sometimes veer toward the bizarre and inscrutable. And it\u2019s not obvious that all of its advances are positive. (For instance, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s always better for our relationships to lose a record of our chats with friends.)Yet it\u2019s no wonder that Facebook and its subsidiaries appear obsessed with imitating Snap. As a font of ideas that many in the tech industry hadn\u2019t considered before, Snap isn\u2019t just popular, but also increasingly important.\u201cRegardless of what happens, they\u2019ve reshaped the social media landscape,\u201d said Joseph B. Bayer, a communications professor at Ohio State University who has studied Snapchat\u2019s impact on how people communicate. \u201cThey\u2019re making risky moves, trying to rethink what people want online as opposed to taking what\u2019s already been done and adding a new flash.\u201dTechies value disruption, and it\u2019s difficult to think of another online company that has shuffled the status quo as consistently as Snap has over the past few years.Before Snapchat, the industry took for granted that everything users posted to the internet should remain there by default. Saving people\u2019s data \u2014 and then constantly re-examining it to create new products and advertising \u2014 is the engine that supports behemoths like Google and Facebook.The diminution of personalization algorithms and virality also plays into how Snapchat treats news. Snapchat\u2019s primary format is called a Story, a slide show of a user\u2019s video clips that are played in chronological order. This, too, is an innovation; before Snapchat, much online content, from blogs to tweets, was consumed in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the oldest. Snapchat\u2019s Stories, which have since been widely copied, ushered in a more natural order \u2014 start at the beginning and go from there.A few years ago, insiders at Snapchat noticed that Stories were an ideal vehicle for relaying news. They could be crowdsourced: If a lot of people were at a concert or sporting event or somewhere that breaking news was occurring, a lot of them were likely to be snapping what was happening. If Snapchat offered them a way to submit their clips, it could spot the best ones and add them to a narrative compilation of the event.While Silicon Valley was shunning editing and curation done by humans, and instead relying on computers to spot and disseminate news, Snapchat began hiring producers and reporters to assemble clips into in-depth pieces.The company calls these Live Stories, and they have been transformative, unlike any other news presentation you can find online. Every day, Snapchat offers one or several stories about big and small events happening in the world, including football games, awards shows and serious news.For instance, this summer, while the rest of the media were engulfed by Hurricane Trump, Snapchat\u2019s news team spent days following the devastating floods in Louisiana. That in itself was unusual, but Snap\u2019s presentation was also groundbreaking: Rather than showing the overhead shots or anchor stand-ups that are conventional on TV news, Snapchat offered video from inside people\u2019s houses, from shelters, from schools. It mixed the macrostory of an impending natural disaster and the government\u2019s response to it with the microtragedies of personal loss, and even the lighter moments of humor and boredom in between.Snapchat has said that it thinks of itself as a camera company rather than a social network. This sounds like marketing puffery (after all, it only just started making its first actual camera, Spectacles), but I think its determination to set itself apart from the rest of the tech industry is important to note.Snap can free itself from Silicon Valley\u2019s accepted norms because it doesn\u2019t think of itself as just another Silicon Valley tech company. It\u2019s time we all started to see it that way, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Reels After Trump\u2019s Election", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley\u2019s luminaries woke up Wednesday morning to a darkened new global order, one that the ceaseless optimism of their tech-powered visions seemed suddenly unable to conquer.\u201cThe horror, the horror,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist at the firm Sherpa Capital who, like just about every leading light in tech, had strongly supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThere were too many people in the tech industry who were complacent. They waited and waited and waited to get engaged in this election. And now we have this nightmare.\u201dOthers were more succinct in their devastation. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of the corporate messaging service Slack.For some, buried in the visceral reaction was also a realization that the tech industry\u2019s relationship with government \u2014 not to mention the public \u2014 looks bound to shift in a fundamental way.Mr. Trump\u2019s win promises to rip apart that relationship. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during the interminable campaign that led to his victory. Mr. Trump promised to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon, repeatedly vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States, and then called for a boycott of the company when it challenged the government\u2019s order to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration plans are anathema to just about every company in tech.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft offered no immediate comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s win, or how the new administration\u2019s stated policy goals would affect their businesses.But it seems clear that a shift is in the offing. Leaders of these behemoths have long spoken in ambitious, gauzy sentimentalities about a broadly progressive future. Their goals weren\u2019t simply financial but, they said, philosophical and democratic \u2014 they wanted to make money, sure, but they also wanted to make the world a better place, to offer a kind of social justice through code. Theirs was a tomorrow powered by software instead of factories, and offering a kind of radical connectivity that they promised would lead to widespread peace and prosperity.In private, during the campaign, many tech leaders were positive that their vision would prevail over Mr. Trump\u2019s. When asked about whether they were preparing in any way for a Trump victory, bigwigs at many of the industry\u2019s leading tech and financial firms were bemused by the notion. They thought it would never happen.The deeper worry is that tech is out of step with the national and global mood, and failed to recognize the social and economic anxieties roiling the nation \u2014 many of them hastened by the products the industry devises.And then you get to the economic problems. Unlike previous economic miracles, the tech boom has not led to widespread employment. Much of the wealth generated by the five biggest American tech companies flows to young liberals in California and the Pacific Northwest, exactly the sort of \u201cglobal elites\u201d Mr. Trump railed against in his campaign.\u201cWe need to figure out how to connect more Americans to the economic engine of technology,\u201d said John Lilly, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners.On Wednesday, some in Silicon Valley worried about their disconnection from the mass of voters who chose Mr. Trump.\u201cIn tech, we need scale, so we look at the world through the lens of aggregate metrics like page views, active users and even revenue,\u201d Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of a start-up called Mattermark, wrote in an email. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we understand the people on the other side of the screen as individuals. That\u2019s the danger, and the opportunity.\u201dOthers weren\u2019t as high-flying, but were nevertheless resolute.Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, an online document storage company, suggested that the tech industry promote specific policy issues.\u201cTo shift to an economy driven by innovation from tech-enabled businesses, we need to get ahead on the issues we\u2019ve been talking about in Silicon Valley for years, like education, patent reform and immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, minus taxes and some tax repatriation issues, much about Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been antithetical to most of the big businesses that are driving the economy.\u201dMark Suster, a venture capitalist at Upfront Ventures, echoed the idea.\u201cTech needs to take a deep breath, and then reflect on how this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd have policy proposals that can realistically address the inequality in our country.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.comKatie Benner contributed reporting.Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

Bertolini, chief executive of the large health insurer Aetna, described the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president. He was speaking with me last Thursday on stage at The New York Times\u2019s annual conference, DealBook: Playing for the Long Term.\u201cWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday. We had no idea how to approach it,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said.Business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how Mr. Trump\u2019s election and Republican control of the White House, Senate and House \u2014 which may make Washington\u2019s notorious gridlock a memory \u2014 will reshape economic policy.The stock market has jumped, taking many prognosticators by surprise, in anticipation of the seismic changes Mr. Trump has promised: a repeal or refashioning of the Affordable Care Act, a dismantling of the Dodd-Frank regulations for Wall Street, a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax rates, and a major infrastructure spending program, among other things.While the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive change, the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board.Take, for instance, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the law, its view is more nuanced. Most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law. So it\u2019s hard to see how even the law\u2019s die-hard opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that Mr. Trump said he would pursue.\u201cThat omelet has been made; that toothpaste is out of the tube,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at the conference.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want regulation to be repealed in toto,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want to be good for bankers, you have to have policies that would be good for economic growth.\u201d\u201cThe C.F.P.B. probably won\u2019t be eliminated,\u201d Ian Katz, a research analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little guy.\u201dMr. Katz predicted that the Trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied for: a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission.Mr. Trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than $10 billion in assets. Currently, such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory category, one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements. This rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition.As for the return of Glass-Steagall \u2014 something Mr. Trump has talked about \u2014 don\u2019t bet on it. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously,\u201d Mr. Katz wrote. \u201cThat was part of a campaign document. Big banks are useful as a populist scapegoat, and Trump may continue to use them in that way. But neither he or his top aides are interested in Glass-Steagall 2.0.\u201dPiecemeal change may also be true of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to undo Obamacare, which was one of his bedrock campaign promises.Mr. Bertolini of Aetna predicted: \u201cThere will be a repeal first, and I think the repeal will be at a minimum in name.\u201dIt\u2019s nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch. \u201cBecause what\u2019s going to happen in the next year?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people signed up; we have to honor that through 2017. We\u2019ll have to work quickly to have something for 2018.\u201dMr. Bertolini said that whatever replacement plan might materialize, the government was not going to just stop insuring the 20 million or so people who are covered under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cYou can\u2019t put them out on the street without insurance,\u201d he said. His expectation is that Medicare Advantage will be expanded.Of course, the biggest question is how Mr. Trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in America. He has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade agreements, increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants \u2014 both for security reasons, he contends, and because they take jobs from Americans. How those ambitions ultimately play out is anyone\u2019s guess.One issue that Mr. Trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking American jobs.\u201cThe jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by technology,\u201d Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said at the conference.That\u2019s a truth that may be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitions.Still, Mr. Schmidt had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits.\u201cManufacturing jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take that for granted.\u201dDespite all of the hand-wringing among C.E.O.s surprised about the outcome of the election, there was a sense of optimism \u2014 or at least a sense of hope \u2014 that pervaded their words.\u201cWe all know a lot about Trump the campaigner \u2014 now we have to find out about the Trump who needs to get things done,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said.\u201cHe will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to be,\u201d he continued. \u201cI assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things change.\u201dMr. Blankfein added, \u201cI\u2019m going to see how it goes before I become mournful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(The type of advertisement you might see in late-18th-century America: \u201cPractitioner of Surgery and Physick at the Women\u2019s Shoe Store on Beaver Street.\u201d) Gradually, medicine professionalized, but at times, the discipline seemed anything but civilized: Doctors were among the earliest and most enthusiastic grave robbers \u2014 a good corpse was hard to find \u2014 and the experiments they conducted walked a narrow line between improvisation and barbarism. One involved injecting heated tobacco juice into the suffering patient. It went as poorly as you might expect.It takes special intestinal fortitude to read about surgery in the age before anesthesia. \u201cThe best that could be done,\u201d Mr. Oshinsky writes, \u201cwas to dose the patient with laudanum or whiskey and then stuff his ears with cotton to muffle the sound of the instruments slicing through flesh and bone.\u201dThose days are long behind us. But other parts of \u201cBellevue\u201d remain depressingly relevant. The book offers an eye-opening lesson, for example, on how the two-tiered system of health care started in this country. As far back as the 1830s, dispensaries were making distinctions between the \u201cworthy poor\u201d and the unworthy, based on whether the prospective patients had recommendations from their employers. Eerie takeaway: Employers were responsible for providing better-quality health care, if indirectly, even then.New York Hospital, established in 1791, was founded in the opposite spirit of Bellevue\u2019s, catering mainly to the moneyed class. By the early 1900s, it was offering rooms with fresh-cut flowers and Persian rugs to the patients who could afford them. That meant fewer rooms for the poor. Bellevue stepped in.Usually, my complaint about books is that they\u2019re too long \u2014 where are the editors with their machetes? \u2014 but there are places where \u201cBellevue\u201d feels too tightly compressed, like an accordion snug in its case.We know from reading \u201cBellevue\u201d that the hospital has a long, rich history of treating the mentally ill. At some point toward the end, we suddenly learn that the institution has a criminal psychiatric ward. I could have read a whole chapter about that.From its ramshackle beginnings, Bellevue has ministered to penniless immigrants, and it still does today. \u201cWhites,\u201d Mr. Oshinsky writes, \u201cnow rank last in the category of \u2018patient race.\u2019\u201d Yet we\u2019ve just elected a president who regards illegal immigration as a national threat. When Mr. Oshinsky submitted his book, his greatest concern for this population was the stinginess of Obamacare. But we are about to enter a new world order. It may turn Bellevue into a very different kind of asylum.The Books of The Times review on Nov. 17, about \u201cBellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America\u2019s Most Storied Hospital,\u201d by David Oshinsky, misspelled the surname of a doctor who worked with AIDS patients at Bellevue during the early years of the epidemic.

{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionDo you panic easily? Do you often feel blue? Do you have a sharp tongue? Do you get chores done right away? Do you believe in the importance of art?If ever you\u2019ve answered questions like these on one of the free personality quizzes floating around Facebook, you\u2019ll have learned what\u2019s known as your Ocean score: How you rate according to the big five psychological traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset.For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans. A spinoff of a British consulting company and sometime-defense contractor known for its counterterrorism \u201cpsy ops\u201d work in Afghanistan, the firm does so by seeding the social network with personality quizzes. Respondents \u2014 by now hundreds of thousands of us, mostly female and mostly young but enough male and older for the firm to make inferences about others with similar behaviors and demographics \u2014 get a free look at their Ocean scores. Cambridge Analytica also gets a look at their scores and, thanks to Facebook, gains access to their profiles and real names.In the age of Facebook, it has become far easier for campaigners or marketers to combine our online personas with our offline selves, a process that was once controversial but is now so commonplace that there\u2019s a term for it, \u201conboarding.\u201d Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographics \u2014 age, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership \u2014 from consumer-data giants.No data point is very informative on its own, but profiling voters, says Cambridge Analytica, is like baking a cake. \u201cIt\u2019s the sum of the ingredients,\u201d its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, told NBC News. Because the United States lacks European-style restrictions on second- or thirdhand use of our data, and because our freedom-of-information laws give data brokers broad access to the intimate records kept by local and state governments, our lives are open books even without social media or personality quizzes.Ever since the advertising executive Lester Wunderman coined the term \u201cdirect marketing\u201d in 1961, the ability to target specific consumers with ads \u2014 rather than blanketing the airwaves with mass appeals and hoping the right people will hear them \u2014 has been the marketer\u2019s holy grail. What\u2019s new is the efficiency with which individually tailored digital ads can be tested and matched to our personalities. Facebook is the microtargeter\u2019s ultimate weapon.The explosive growth of Facebook\u2019s ad business has been overshadowed by its increasing role in how we get our news, real or fake. In July, the social network posted record earnings: quarterly sales were up 59 percent from the previous year, and profits almost tripled to $2.06 billion. While active users of Facebook \u2014 now 1.71 billion monthly active users \u2014 were up 15 percent, the real story was how much each individual user was worth. The company makes $3.82 a year from each global user, up from $2.76 a year ago, and an average of $14.34 per user in the United States, up from $9.30 a year ago. Much of this growth comes from the fact that advertisers not only have an enormous audience in Facebook but an audience they can slice into the tranches they hope to reach.One recent advertising product on Facebook is the so-called \u201cdark post\u201d: A newsfeed message seen by no one aside from the users being targeted. With the help of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital team used dark posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, aiming to push the exact right buttons for the exact right people at the exact right times.Imagine the full capability of this kind of \u201cpsychographic\u201d advertising. In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together.In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201csuper predator\u201d line. It targeted Miami\u2019s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see \u2014 and no one else sees \u201cI\u2019m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.\u201dWhile Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump\u2019s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. One day in August, it flooded the social network with 100,000 ad variations, so-called A/B testing on a biblical scale, surely more ads than could easily be vetted by human eyes for compliance with Facebook\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards.\u201dPerhaps out of necessity, the Trump team was embracing a new-media lesson: It didn\u2019t have to build everything from scratch. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. When \u201cTrump TV\u201d went live on Facebook before and after the second debate it raked in $9 million in donations in 120 minutes.In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election, so many polls and experts were so wrong that it became fashionable to declare that big data was dead. But it isn\u2019t, not when its most obvious avatar, Facebook, was so crucial to victory.On Monday, after a similar announcement from Google, Facebook said it would no longer allow fake-news websites to show ads, on their own sites, from Facebook\u2019s ad network \u2014 a half-step that neither blocks what appears on your newsfeed nor affects how advertisers can microtarget users on the social network.There are surely more changes to come. Mr. Zuckerberg is young, still skeptical that his radiant transparency machine could be anything but a force for good, rightly wary of policing what the world\u2019s diverse citizens say and share on his network, so far mostly dismissive of Facebook\u2019s role in the election. If Mr. Zuckerberg takes seriously his oft-stated commitments to diversity and openness, he must grapple honestly with the fact that Facebook is no longer just a social network. It\u2019s an advertising medium that\u2019s now dangerously easy to weaponize.A Trump administration is unlikely to enforce transparency about who is targeted by dark posts and other hidden political ads \u2014 or to ensure that politicians take meaningful ownership of what the ads say. But Facebook can.Advertisement"}

These steps would help, but Facebook, in particular, owes its users, and democracy itself, far more.Facebook has demonstrated that it can effectively block content like click-bait articles and spam from its platform by tweaking its algorithms, which determine what links, photos and ads users see in their news feeds. Nobody outside the company knows exactly how its software works and why you might see posts shared by some of your friends frequently and others rarely.

{"Headline": "Nonprofit Employees, Already Underpaid, Face Special Challenges in Retirement", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byPublic SacrificeHer cause is the tens of thousands of diocese employees who are saving money in workplace retirement plans. That issue may not have attracted a lot of attention, but it is a serious problem nonetheless. That is because many of the plans not only cost too much, they also invest in companies that do not align with the church\u2019s values.Ms. Brunson spends her days tracking down local church officials, one by one, trying to persuade them to do things differently.It\u2019s an uphill struggle, and it is one that is shared by any nonprofit shopping the market for 403(b)\u2019s, the 401(k)-like retirement plan that nonprofits usually adopt. Insurance companies that have traditionally sold the plans often try to include complex savings vehicles with unclear terms. Harried executives of short-staffed charities or religious organizations often do not have the time or expertise to pick the details apart.Given the difficulties, many smaller organizations simply throw up their hands and let their employees fend for themselves with individual retirement accounts at whatever brokerage firm they can find. But nonprofit workers, who are already underpaid, may put themselves at severe financial risk by not saving for retirement at all if they don\u2019t have an easy option to do so at work.\u201cOther directors and I have had the conversation where we talk about the irony that some of our own employees may need our services,\u201d said Ms. Poag, who did manage to add a 403(b) plan recently. \u201cIt\u2019s an irony that is painful.\u201dEmployees and leaders of smaller nonprofits, however, are left to fend for themselves, and they muddle through in a variety of ways.Some of them are fortunate to happen across investment advisers like Ms. Brunson. About a decade ago, she was a stay-at-home mom with a side job ghostwriting financial newsletters for investment advisers.He worked with Ms. Brunson, becoming one of 11 dioceses so far that have done so. She had helped persuade Dimensional to expand its offering of funds to satisfy those like Mr. Burnham who wanted their dollars aligned with their religious principles. In practice, this meant avoiding investments in the manufacturers of military weapons, companies in the pornography business and others that have anything to do with abortion or contraceptives.The Orange County diocese moved to its new plan in September, lowering its costs from about $1.30 for every $100 in the plan to about 60 cents.Eventually, Ms. Gartman Rogers and her colleagues were able to switch to a plan with a lineup of basic index funds; they pay Mr. Carmody a flat fee to handle a variety of administrative tasks. \u201cThis is what\u2019s supposed to be going on,\u201d Mr. Carmody said. \u201cI go down there now and we\u2019re having a party.\u201dWhile many nonprofits never consider starting a 401(k) plan or switching to one from a 403(b), a growing number are beginning to do so. One reason for the move is a desire among growing nonprofits to attract workers from the for-profit sector, where 401(k) plans reign.\u201cIf you\u2019re a small nonprofit with very few assets, nobody really cares,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can often tell by their websites if they have any interest in you, and it was clear they weren\u2019t looking at brand-new plans.\u201dIn Austin, Texas, 22 nonprofits have spent the last few years banding together to create the kind of negotiating leverage they lacked on their own. They originally came together in search of a better health insurance plan. But insurers wanted them tied together in other ways, too, so that it would be harder for the coalition to break up later, which could cause the insurance companies to lose business.It got messier before it got easier. A lawyer working on plan documents for the group disappeared with some of its money, which led Mr. Pottichen to show up at her home to try to get it back. \u201cIt was one of the houses where you can\u2019t tell if anyone lives there at all, with all the shades down,\u201d he said.He also reviewed the 403(b) plans of the nonprofits that had them. People who worked there were not sure how they had ended up with their incumbent providers, some of whom had sold them high-cost annuities. But he was pretty sure he knew why the insurance companies were interested in their business in the first place.\u201cThey\u2019re only selling to the nonprofits to get to the board members and get their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe salesmen use the retirement plans as a prospecting tool.\u201dThe new joint plan will be mostly index and similar funds, and overall costs will have dropped by over one-third, with Mr. Pottichen\u2019s firm collecting a continuing fee for its work. Newly emboldened, he now hopes that others will be inspired to dig deep on the details and move their 403(b) plans from the likes of Mutual of America, Axa and other insurance companies if necessary.\u201cI can only imagine,\u201d he said, \u201chow many annuity professionals would be at my door waiting to burn my house down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were planning an attack for Dec. 1, Mr. Molins said, while adding that it was not yet clear what their target was \u201camong all those that the group envisaged.\u201dReferring to news reports this week that militants were targeting the Disneyland Paris amusement park outside the capital, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, and several other places, Mr. Molins said that the information was \u201cdetrimental to the ongoing investigations,\u201d but he did not deny the reports.\u201cIt appears on one hand that the offenders were in possession of, or searching for, weapons and money, and on the other hand that they were about to take action and were looking for targets,\u201d Mr. Molins said.Mr. Molins identified the suspects arrested in Strasbourg as Yassine B., 37, a school employee; Hicham M., 37, a warehouse worker; Sami B., 36, a French-Tunisian father of three who worked in a grocery store; and Zacaria M., 35, a French-Moroccan whose employment status was not disclosed.The four men were longtime friends who saw \u201ceach other on a regular basis\u201d and communicated via a dedicated telephone line, Mr. Molins said.The fifth suspect, arrested in Marseille, was identified as Hicham E., a 26-year-old Moroccan citizen who left his country in 2013 to emigrate to Portugal, from where he took multiple trips back and forth within Europe using fake identification papers. (The prosecutor earlier gave his age as 46.)The arrests followed an eight-month investigation led by France\u2019s domestic intelligence service, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Monday. A tip by a \u201cpartner country\u201d led to the arrest of Hicham E., officials said.The team in Strasbourg and the suspect in Marseille were given \u201ccommon instructions\u201d by a commander in the \u201cIraq-Syria zone\u201d on how to obtain weapons, Mr. Molins said. They received their orders via encrypted mobile apps.Mr. Molins did not identify their commander.Hicham M. and Yassine B. went to the Turkey-Syria border in March 2015 via Cyprus, while Hicham E. was turned back in the summer of 2015 when he attempted to enter Turkey, Mr. Molins said.On a USB memory stick found at Yassine B.\u2019s house, the authorities found a document mentioning the \u201cdelivery of a sum of money,\u201d as well as GPS coordinates and detailed instructions on how to obtain weapons and ammunition.Investigators also found Google Maps screenshots of searches of different places in Yassine B.\u2019s laptop and phone, which Mr. Molins said amounted to \u201ca clear will to find and spot targets, to take action in the very short term.\u201dThe suspect arrested in Marseille, Hicham E., had 4,281 euros, or $4,539, on him when he was apprehended, money that investigators believe was intended to buy weapons.Mr. Molins said that arms, documentation on potential targets and pledges to the Islamic State were found at the houses of members of the Strasbourg team. Guns and bullets were found at the homes of Yassine B. and Zacaria M.; it was not clear how they were obtained.The authorities also said writings glorifying martyrdom and \u201copenly\u201d referring to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were found in a notebook in Yassine B.\u2019s house, and several documents mentioning \u201cthreats against the integrity of our country\u201d were contained in a notebook found in Hicham M.\u2019s house.Mr. Molins said it appeared from the investigations that Yassine B. and Hicham M. had downloaded the Periscope app onto their phones, possibly to record themselves committing violence.Five people suspected of having links to the same network as the seven men were arrested on June 14 \u2014 a few days into the Euro 2016 soccer tournament being held in France \u2014 and two of them were kept in custody.\u201cThe attacks or attack plots which we have been, currently are, or will face again are shape-shifting,\u201d Mr. Molins said.Advertisement"}

When one conferencegoer inquired about his chances of getting his own emoji onto the keyboard, Mr. Davis said that Unicode had committed to ushering in about 70 emoji symbols a year and that about half of all public proposals made the cut. The dumpling is scheduled to show up on devices next year.Later, academics took to the stage to critique Unicode\u2019s ultimate control over emoji; an Adobe typeface designer and font developer campaigned for more androgynous ones to complement the proliferation of female and male glyphs; and regular users advocated on behalf of their own emoji. Pitches included a person meditating, a peacock, a pretzel and a hijab. \u201cI really just wanted a hijab emoji of me that I could use with my friends across social media,\u201d said Rayouf Alhumedhi, a 15-year-old Saudi girl who came to Emojicon to push for a glyph that looks like her. \u201cIf there are four emoji of a mailbox, why isn\u2019t there one for the 50 million hijabi women around the world?\u201dAnd in perhaps the bluntest speech of the conference, Keith Winstein, a professor of computer science at Stanford, proposed wresting the creation of emoji from Unicode\u2019s grasp entirely. He called Unicode\u2019s control over modern visual expression \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d He praised communication platforms like Slack that allow users to upload their own emoji, no Unicode encoding required. To make the point, he called up Slack on a big screen behind him and conjured an emoji showing a woman wearing the hijab. \u201cI didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission,\u201d he said. \u201cI just did it!\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated Mark E. Davis\u2019s role in the creation of Unicode. He is a co-founder, not the founder.Because of an editing error, a Critic\u2019s Notebook article on Wednesday about Emojicon, an event in San Francisco billed as a \u201ccelebration of all things emoji,\u201d misidentified the job at Adobe held by the speaker who campaigned for more androgynous emojis. He is a typeface designer and font developer, not a software engineer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Importance of Facial Equality", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byDisabilityAs a child, I was often asked why my eyes were shaped the way they were, so crooked and far apart.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I would shrug. \u201cI just came that way!\u201d Sometimes this question bothered me, because I didn\u2019t understand why everyone felt the need to ask it. Most of the time, I just didn\u2019t know how to respond.I was born with a craniofacial disease \u2014 Crouzon syndrome, a condition where the bones in the head do not grow. A condition that required too many surgeries and procedures to count, so I grew accustomed to being cut open, pulled apart, and put back together. Though I quickly learned that once something is taken apart, it\u2019s never quite the same.\u201cDoes it hurt to be an idiot?\u201d I would sometimes respond.I did a lot of growing up during my time at the local children\u2019s hospital, where the bones of my head and face were routinely broken and restructured, rectifying the premature fusion of my skull. After surgeries, during my extended stays in the intensive care unit, I would tell myself that pain was not real. That it was imaginary and only in my mind. If I concentrated hard enough on the throbbing pain throughout my body, I could convince myself, if only for a moment, that I was numb. I would lie there, unable to sit up, my eyes swollen shut. Nurses and visitors bestowed words of comfort upon me, trying to ease my terror, but over time, I grew used to it. What was once horrific became normal.Even with the physically traumatic surgeries I was required to undergo, the physical aspect of my condition was nothing compared with the emotional toll of living with an appearance-altering condition. The everyday stares, comments, and subhuman treatment acted as a constant reminder of my painful medical history and my perceived shortcomings.I lived much of my early life in survival mode. The priority was to keep me alive.Because salvaging my physical health was so crucial, the emotional aspect of living with a facial disfigurement was overlooked by health professionals. While my mother and father did their best to offer support, there was only so much they could do. I tried therapy, but therapists always seemed to ask the wrong questions and never seemed to understand what it was like to have my physical appearance change drastically time and time again. \u201cIt\u2019s like in \u2018Freaky Friday,\u2019 \u201d I would tell them. \u201cExcept I never get my body back. I never get my face back.\u201d Despite their best efforts, they simply could not relate.To make matters more challenging, I never had anyone who had been through the same experiences to turn to for advice and support. I would search the internet for others like me, trying to find personal stories and tips and advice for how to get through it, but was never able to find anything. I felt alone. To get through it, I told myself I would grow up to be the stereotypical definition of beautiful. With each surgery I had, I assured myself I was getting one step closer to being able to walk down the street in peace. People would no longer stare at me in confusion and disgust, wondering why I looked the way I did. Instead, they would admire my beauty. I would finally be happy. Nobody told me happiness was an inside job.The Americans with Disabilities Act classifies facial disfigurement as a form of disability, recognizing the fact that individuals with facial disfigurements encounter discrimination and prejudice because of their appearance. I face discrimination and prejudice when I apply for jobs, when I\u2019m on a date, when I walk down the street. The judgment is everywhere. Still, I refuse to live my life in seclusion, because other individuals are uncomfortable with my existence.There is no standard when it comes to the language and the representation surrounding facial disfigurements. I often use the word \u201cdisfigurement\u201d in my work, because I find it packs more of a punch. It feels more powerful. Harsh, even. Terms like \u201cfacial difference\u201d and \u201cfacial diversity\u201d never feel adequate in describing my experiences.While, it may imply that there is an existing standard in terms of physical appearance that individuals with conditions like Crouzon syndrome do not measure up to, I choose the word \u201cdisfigurement\u201d because of the power it holds. I\u2019m viewed as having a disfigurement, not just a difference. I believe the intensity of the term \u201cdisfigurement\u201d allows individuals to become more aware of their own prejudice and more mindful of how they treat others.Through this and other methods, I am working toward creating a world where those who are not disfigured recognize those who are as equals, where a person with Crouzon syndrome is given a role in a popular television show or is hired to appear in an ad or fashion campaign. In that world, I\u2019d be able to go about my business or show up to a job interview without having my entire being called into question by strangers, and others with facial disfigurements would be truly viewed as a valuable addition to society. Because we are.Advertisement"}

In San Francisco, Trump won less than 10 percent of the vote. In Santa Clara County, home to Google, Facebook and Apple, he got barely over 20 percent.What we should talk about is whether the tech business\u2019s distance from so much of the country is a bad thing, and something that can be solved in some way.For what it\u2019s worth, the so-called secession plan is little more than a few tweets and a website at the moment, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere. But it did create an instant tech angle!Back to tech. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great that so much of the tech business swims in the same waters. I\u2019m not saying people in tech should be more open-minded toward Trump. I\u2019m not saying it would be better if 50 percent of Facebook employees voted for Trump.But I do think this election underscores a problem for the tech industry. It works on scale. The whole premise of a software business is that a few people can make something that the entire world can use. But the flip side of that magic is that the whole world ends up using products that only a small group of people control. It\u2019s not just Trump voters. Tech giants are making products that are being used by subsistence farmers in India, taxi drivers in China, bankers in London and schoolteachers in Brazil, to name a few random people off the top of my head.The election emphasizes how crazy that task is. How can a 24-year-old white male engineer at Google who graduated from Stanford ever hope to empathize with the vast majority of people who use the products he\u2019s working on?There is no way a recent, extremely well-paid Stanford graduate can be expected to empathize with the rest of the country if the extent of his or her worldliness means knowing the best time to cut out of work to beat traffic from Silicon Valley back to San Francisco.Not only do these employees have no personal incentive to travel to the Midwest, but they aren\u2019t forced to do so by those in upper management, who also live in a bubble largely of their own making.By the way, I am self-aware enough to recognize the irony of this criticism coming from a coastal media type who has lived in New York and California while working for The New York Times. But I will say, I grew up all around the country, including largely in the South, so I don\u2019t feel as out of touch as, say, someone who has lived their entire life in the 100-mile radius of the Bay Area.I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think the tech companies are either. The facile answer is to work much harder on diversity \u2014 not just racial and gender diversity, but also geographic diversity and diversity of thought. I hope they do that. But that goes only so far. After all, Apple can\u2019t go out and recruit a bunch of workers just because they like Trump.Why not hire a more diverse candidate pool? Those with liberal arts degrees and students of history? People from across the country? I think that would be a start. And Mark Zuckerberg himself said on Facebook\u2019s earnings call that 2017 would be a big year for recruiting investment.I\u2019ve seen many techies offer to work with the White House to get talented people on board with the next administration. And to the opposite effect, I\u2019ve seen some who will fight the Trump administration tooth and nail, against any injustices they may see.I admire both impulses, though I think what\u2019s most important is to have an actual opinion rather than, I don\u2019t know, blandly letting the next four years go by while doing one\u2019s own thing inside the island of California. Be civic-minded, both locally and nationally. Don\u2019t let public relations and company statements speak on your behalf.That\u2019s what I plan on doing. At least until I get canned someday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 14, 2016Joshua WrightMatt StollerThe proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger is a watershed moment for our political system. Will we continue to allow the further concentration of economic power at the top, or will this be the moment when democracy fights back?ATT-Time Warner would be a giant in pay-TV, wireless service, broadband, news and entertainment \u2014 it could certainly shape the media to its advantage in a myriad different ways. But most people don't need these studies to know they are being ripped off by their cell phone, broadband, and cable providers, and that medicine and air travel, for example, cost too much. But the U.S. has a model for de-concentrating power in order to lift up the middle class. More interesting still: The concentration bill was approved by all parties in Israel, from the extreme right to the extreme left \u2014 a rare feat in a country with fractious politics. Starting with AT&T-Time Warner, perhaps stronger anti-monopoly policy is something all Americans can agree on.\u201cBig is bad\u201d is perhaps the only thing this year's presidential candidates agreed upon.  Too many big mergers, too little enforcement, goes the narrative.Sometimes a concentrated industry is noncompetitive. Consider hospitals, where the Federal Trade Commission has successfully challenged proposed mergers with convincing economic evidence that greater concentration would lead to increases in price and reduced quality of service. What's more, the evidence that supports the conclusion that markets are actually becoming more concentrated is  exceptionally weak.  The Council of Economic Advisors concluded that we have a monopoly problem because, in a handful of industries, the combined market shares of the top 50 firms have seen a modest increase over the past few decades. But a closer look shows that the council found that the combined market shares of the top 50 firms is below 50 percent in nearly all industry sectors.  The average market share for a firm in these industries is less than 1 percent. That is certainly not evidence of a monopoly problem. Economists have long rejected the \u201cantitrust by the numbers\u201d approach.  Indeed, the quiet consensus among antitrust economists in academia and within the two antitrust agencies is that mergers between competitors do not often lead to market power but do often generate significant benefits for consumers \u2014 lower prices and higher quality. Sometimes mergers harm consumers, but those instances are relatively rare. Because the economic case for a drastic change in merger policy is so weak, the new critics argue more antitrust enforcement is good for political reasons. Big companies have more political power, they say, so more antitrust can reduce this power disparity. Big companies can pay lower wages, so we should allow fewer big firms to merge to protect the working man. And big firms make more money, so using antitrust to prevent firms from becoming big will reduce income inequality too.  Whatever the merits of these various policy goals, antitrust is an exceptionally poor tool to use to achieve them. Instead of allowing consumers to decide companies\u2019 fates, courts and regulators decided them based on squishy assessments of impossible things to measure, like accumulated political power.  The result was that antitrust became a tool to prevent firms from engaging in behavior that benefited consumers in the marketplace. The antitrust agencies are full of talented economists and lawyers who use the most up-to-date and sophisticated techniques to identify mergers worthy of challenge on behalf of consumers.  Economic analysis has more often than not trumped ideological politics in antitrust policy for the past 35 years.  Let\u2019s keep it that way.Does the government need to more proactively pursue antitrust cases? Is it time to bring back trust-busting?"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Hard to Make a Website for the Government?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.O\u2019Farrell, who has been involved with government food programs since graduating from college nearly three decades ago, understood why his office would be a promising target for this kind of tech push. California\u2019s food-stamp participation rate, roughly 50 percent of eligible residents, was one of the lowest in the country, and the bureaucratic friction in the application process deserved at least some of the blame. Enlisting technology\u2019s aid made a lot of sense: More than three-quarters of Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year now use the internet, and Obamacare has ushered in a new generation of social-service clients who grew up on their smartphones and expect to interact with government the same way they do everything else. Yet CalFresh \u2014 in contrast to the Silicon Valley companies in the neighborhood, where teams of designers, product managers and data scientists cater to their online users with intense precision \u2014 offered a poor \u201cuser experience\u201d for clients on its digital channels. It lacked text or email support; its website didn\u2019t work well on mobile devices. These were just the sorts of problems that Code for America fellows figured they knew how to solve.The fellows soon discovered that an external vendor, Hewlett-Packard, had been contracted for years to maintain the site. A bigger obstacle to remaking MyBenefits CalWin would have been negotiating the cooperation of all 18 counties that used it. But one fellow, Jake Solomon, had an idea. The only information legally needed to submit a complete food-stamp application, he had learned, was a name, an address and a signature. Code for America could work around MyBenefits CalWin and build its own simple website just for CalFresh applicants. At the very least, this would make for a good proof of concept, a way to show various government officials that social-service delivery could be, in Solomon\u2019s words, \u201cdead simple.\u201d In 2014, after his fellowship had ended \u2014 he was still affiliated with Code for America \u2014 Solomon pitched this idea to his colleague Dave Guarino one afternoon, and they coded a prototype over the next few days.The following week, Solomon and Guarino gave a demonstration at O\u2019Farrell\u2019s office. Guarino handed a phone with the prototype on it to O\u2019Farrell, who filled out an application in a few minutes. With its clear language and big buttons, it felt slick, like Twitter or Facebook, not kludgy, like most .gov sites. O\u2019Farrell was impressed. \u201cThis could be a game changer,\u201d he said. \u201cGo for it. We like it.\u201d\u201cMy biggest lesson this year was that local governments are constrained,\u201d Solomon wrote in a blog post. \u201cThey\u2019re constrained by a complex web of local politics, state legislation and federal laws. The constraints cascade downhill, as does the responsibility.\u201dIn 2013, Code for America had nearly 30 fellows \u2014 selected by competitive application \u2014 working on behalf of 10 partner cities. Its annual operating budget was $7 million, more than half of which came from private grants. Pahlka often found herself on the road, giving talks and courting donors. Her pitch was simple: Use technology to make government better. What exactly she meant by that could be hard to parse, but the apps she cited and the anecdotes she shared were compelling, with a folksy, community-driven appeal. (Take care of your neighborhood storm drain!)Solomon, Guarino and Williams, part of the 2013 class of fellows, were initially assigned to different cities and themes. Solomon went to the Human Services Agency of San Francisco. Before Code for America, he worked for the RAND Corporation on health policy; before that he was at Palantir, a Silicon Valley data-analytics start-up that created software for intelligence services and other clients. Guarino, a software developer and policy wonk who had spent time at the California Health Benefits Review Program, devoted his fellowship year to building an app that allowed residents in South Bend, Ind., to report on the conditions of vacant and abandoned properties. Williams, a designer, built digital trail maps for parks in northeast Ohio. As a junior at Tulane during Hurricane Katrina, he had seen the storm sweep across Lake Pontchartrain and then flood much of New Orleans. \u201cI watched government fail on so many levels,\u201d Williams says. \u201cIn this very visible, physical way, where levees failed, but also the soul-crushing process that people went through afterward to get FEMA support.\u201dThe three young men had an easy rapport from the start. None of them fit the stereotype of the Silicon Valley engineer. Each majored in a social science \u2014 Solomon in economics, Guarino in political economy, Williams in English and political science. I saw them at their most animated in long conversations over Mexican takeout, talking about John Rawls and social contracts and the unfortunate amount of discretionary power wielded by street-level bureaucrats. For them, and for many of their Code for America colleagues, technology was a means more than an end, a lever with which they could move people\u2019s lives toward the good. While their peers in Silicon Valley wanted to play with cool new programming languages for the sake of playing with cool new programming languages, Solomon, Guarino and Williams, it seemed, found their motivations elsewhere. \u201cI care about helping people, period,\u201d Guarino told me.The normal process worked like this: Once an application was received \u2014 whether delivered in person, online or via fax \u2014 and entered into the database, the CalFresh office in the applicant\u2019s county would schedule an interview, to be held either over the phone or in person. At these sessions, eligibility workers, whose job is to determine whether clients qualify for social services, review documents like pay stubs, utility bills and identity cards. Eligibility is set at 200 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $41,000 in gross income for a family of three, but subject to a host of caveats; in granting exceptions to these caveats, eligibility workers exercise a great deal of discretion. They can choose to overlook missing documentation or demand additional receipts. They can verbally elicit information omitted from the application.The Code for America team\u2019s plan had always been to leave the scarier stuff off the website \u2014 questions like, \u201cHave you ever traded food stamps for explosives?\u201d or \u201cHave you ever committed a felony?\u201d Those questions could be answered during the live interview. The key was to settle on how much information to ask for at the start. Require too much, and users would be put off and give up; too little, and the eligibility workers, who preferred more details rather than fewer, would complain. In the end, the team settled on a compromise. After the user submitted a name and an address, two choices would present themselves: to continue filling out the rest of the application or to \u201cStop working and submit application now.\u201d Clicking the second option would lead to another page and the warning: \u201cAre you sure you want to submit right now? Since we only know your name and address, it will be hard to process your application. Instead of finishing it on the phone, we will have to send you paperwork in the mail.\u201dThe main technical challenge confronting the team followed directly from Solomon\u2019s initial flash of insight to create an independent site. Because GetCalFresh wasn\u2019t actually replacing MyBenefits CalWin, but was instead just offering an alternative point of access, they still needed to work with its existing infrastructure, which lacked an A.P.I., or application programming interface. Modern websites consist of a front end, or web page (what a user sees on the computer screen); a back end (a database and a server that hosts it); and usually an A.P.I. that sends data between them. We all regularly rely on things that function like A.P.I.s in the physical world. Say, for instance, you want to get takeout from your favorite Chinese restaurant. In this analogy, the front end would be your phone, the back end is the kitchen and the A.P.I. is whichever restaurant employee relays your order to the cooks. She\u2019s how you place an order of dumplings, cancel that order or modify it to include sweet-and-sour soup.In software development, A.P.I.s allow coders to change front-end or back-end components easily, while leaving the core of a program intact. The lack of an A.P.I. for MyBenefits CalWin meant that GetCalFresh, however great it looked, couldn\u2019t actually put any information into the earlier site\u2019s database. The state would not officially know about any of the applications it received; it wouldn\u2019t even know where to send a check. So the Code for America team\u2019s members, when they received an application through GetCalFresh, needed to figure out a way to get that information into the MyBenefits CalWin system.In April 2015, Guarino, while on a trip to Utah with Solomon and Williams, finally came up with a workaround. If the problem they faced was relying on people to manually enter information into the database, why not just write some code to take care of that part? Guarino used a technology called Selenium WebDriver that mimicked a user\u2019s activity on a website. Playing the role of the applicant, the webdriver would go to MyBenefits CalWin\u2019s front end and fill in each question using the information collected through GetCalFresh, then click \u201cnext.\u201d This was not exactly best practice when it came to coding: Webdrivers are used primarily in testing web applications, not in their actual operation. Because the webdriver couldn\u2019t catch all errors, when someone mistakenly submitted an impossible birth date, for example, or a nonexistent ZIP code, that information would trigger an error when it was entered into the legacy system. A human being would then have to correct the information from that faulty entry by hand.Williams worried, when giving demonstrations to county representatives, that the whole process would seem amateurish to them, the way it sometimes did to him. But he came to realize that the existing systems used by CalFresh staff members tended to be far more cumbersome and time-intensive than his inelegant webdriver. They didn\u2019t see the absence of tests and logs, the redundant code, the inability to deal with errors like missing information gracefully. He recalled a presentation at which the projector was broken, so the audience gathered around his computer. When he ran the webdriver, a new browser window opened up straight away to the legacy website, and the applicant\u2019s data automatically appeared, as if typed in by unseen fingers. Williams describes it as \u201ca magical moment.\u201d The genius of the webdriver was that it didn\u2019t require clerical workers to do anything different: no encryptions, no new data entry or software systems to deal with. It did exactly what workers at food banks and community-based organizations already did \u2014 fill out the legacy application on behalf of clients \u2014 except faster. It reinforced technology\u2019s most basic power: the ability of automation to eliminate boring and repetitive tasks.No one had a good answer, including the executives at Code for America. By many measures, GetCalFresh had surpassed all of the nonprofit\u2019s previous projects, and Code for America now found itself in unfamiliar territory. It had typically presented its projects as proofs of concept, but many of them, as one of the organization\u2019s officials later admitted in a blog post, lacked \u201cconsistent paths to sustainability.\u201d By that fall, out of the many dozens of apps created by Code for America fellows, fewer than 10 had found enough support to justify being spun off into start-ups. Many of them had not been updated on Github, the website where most collaborative coding projects are hosted, in months.As Solomon, Guarino and Williams saw it, a couple of obvious paths lay before them. The first was to solicit funds from traditional philanthropic sources. The second was to become a government I.T. vendor and sell to other counties and states. Neither path appealed to them. Donor funding, while probably necessary in the short term, seemed unsustainable in the long term \u2014 especially because, under the reigning Silicon Valley ethos, even philanthropic tech projects are expected to present a business model. Government I.T. vending work, on the other hand, was self-sufficient but uninspired. It was limited, by definition, to what was imagined under any given contract. \u201cIt abdicated responsibility for anything outside the software,\u201d Williams says. And for all of Code for America\u2019s beliefs that tech could serve as a lever for good, the bad code plaguing the public sector was rarely the only problem with a particular program; it would be a hollow improvement to give CalFresh a better application site without, say, making sure that reminder letters were sent out before an appointment or that the customer-support lines were adequately staffed.As the months passed and the financing remained unresolved, the team submitted proposals to several organizations \u2014 including Molina Healthcare in Long Beach, Calif., from which they sought $3 million over three years, characterizing their project as a preventive-health measure. But their reluctance to work for the government seemed to come from some deeper motivating force. In the beginning, I wondered whether it had to do with prestige. Public employees can get stuck working in rooms with ugly linoleum floors writing memos that may never be read; I.T. vendors, meanwhile, are the equivalent of enterprise software sales. Perhaps either fate seemed at odds with the team\u2019s self-image.But in talking to them, I found that their worries seemed to revolve less around social standing than around effectiveness. Having been exposed to the way government operated, they saw a decision-making system in which the status quo always wins. The lengths to which the team would have had to go to modify the legacy site, MyBenefits CalWin, was one example. The process to amend a notice of action \u2014 a letter informing CalFresh clients of changes in their eligibility, for example \u2014 was another. \u201cWhen you work for the government, ties go to the county, ties go to the state,\u201d Solomon told me. At the moment, the Code for America team controlled almost every aspect of GetCalFresh: If they wanted to, say, experiment with live chat for customer support, they could. That freedom would be curbed if they began collecting paychecks from the state.\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Cantonese, do you?\u201d he asked me as soon as I entered. I did not, alas. Many of the clients of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank were non-English speakers, and among them Cantonese was the most common native tongue. But the Cantonese-speaking employee who was supposed to be on duty that morning had called in sick. Liliana Sandoval, the food bank\u2019s senior program manager, was scrambling to find a replacement.A half-hour later, Sandoval and the replacement arrived, dragging a large file folder between them. His name was Calvin Yan, he worked for the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and, thankfully, he spoke Cantonese. They pulled out a pair of Microsoft Surface tablets. \u201cGo to demo.GetCalFresh.org,\u201d Solomon instructed. The landing page for GetCalFresh showed a glossy image of an Asian woman holding a toddler and standing in front of the produce aisle in an unidentifiable grocery store. At the top, it read: \u201cGet extra money for groceries every month. Take the first step. Apply for CalFresh in 10 minutes.\u201d In the footer: \u201cGetCalFresh.org is a service delivered by Code for America on behalf of the people of California.\u201d The favicon, the tiny image that appeared in the browser tab space when you navigated to the site, was a federal building with Corinthian columns and the symbol for Wi-Fi overlaid on the roof.Yan flipped through the screens. \u201cOh, this is really short,\u201d he said.\u201cYup,\u201d Solomon said, satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d Yan said, before asking if eligibility was still at $1,900 per month.\u201cNo,\u201d Sandoval chided. She tossed him a San Francisco-Marin Food Bank resource guide. \u201cYou should be fine. The only thing might be sponsors.\u201d Sponsors backed immigrants, making them financially responsible for the new arrivals, but in practice they could be difficult to track down. Sometimes food-stamp applicants said they hadn\u2019t had contact with their official sponsors in years.At 10 a.m., the doors opened, and the first clients arrived: an attractive young couple, the man blond and beefy, the woman dark and wide-eyed. Each wore a backpack. Sandoval began speaking to the woman in Spanish. What was her monthly income? How many people in her household did she regularly shop for groceries with? Were any of them students? The woman reached out and touched her boyfriend\u2019s arm. Sandoval switched to English. How many classes was he taking at city college? Three, he said. Did he know how many credits that was? He didn\u2019t. There was a meek, quiet pause. \u201cWould it be helpful if I found out?\u201d he asked.The issue, Sandoval told him, was that full-time students were ineligible for CalFresh, although there was a long list of exceptions \u2014 he could be eligible, for instance, if he had kids. He shook his head. No kids. Then he should probably go to the registrar and confirm his status, Sandoval said. Meanwhile, she would submit a CalFresh application for his girlfriend and refer them to a food pantry in their neighborhood.Sandoval turned to Yan. \u201cCan you pull up the food-pantry locator?\u201d she asked. Another in-house civic-tech team had put together a search tool for food pantries.\u201cWhich neighborhood?\u201d Yan replied, typing on the Surface.\u201cNorth Beach,\u201d the woman answered.Yan flashed her a smile. \u201cMy neighborhood. O.K., the bad news is that there aren\u2019t too many options. But the good news is that there is a food bank just around the corner from your building. It\u2019s not in the search tool.\u201d He tapped his temple. \u201cBut I know it because it\u2019s just down the street from me. I\u2019ll write down the address for you.\u201dSandoval continued: \u201cOnce a week, you can go and pick up a bag of groceries.\u201d\u201cYou can pick what you want?\u201d the woman asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a 30-pound bag, more than 15 pounds of which is fresh produce, and then the rest, staples.\u201d She said they would hear back about their application in a few weeks. The couple shrugged on their backpacks. They thanked Sandoval.After the couple left, everyone waited. A good 45 minutes went by. No one else showed up. After noon, Solomon and I went to grab lunch. In all of our previous meetings, Solomon had projected an unrelenting positivity bordering on pretense. Today he seemed tired, less guarded. \u201cJust think about if every person from all those organizations \u2014 their energy were redirected toward software development,\u201d he said. I pointed out that not everyone had the skills for software development. And in any case, the event suggested the limits of technology. Sandoval\u2019s Spanish skills, Yan\u2019s local knowledge \u2014 these were the things that the technology, at least as of now, had yet to replace, and their softening effect called to a mind an earlier line from Solomon himself, that \u201cstigma was created or eroded at the point of service delivery.\u201dAs we waited for our sandwiches, Solomon got some bad news he\u2019d begun to expect: The $3 million they were seeking from Molina Healthcare \u2014 which could have kept their effort to expand GetCalFresh going \u2014 had been rejected because of restrictions on what the company could support.\u201cWhat else do you have in the pipeline?\u201d I asked.\u201cRight now, nothing,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cC.F.A. has been extremely generous, but they can\u2019t just let us carry on without strategic funding and strategic partners.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe need to figure out whether this model\u201d \u2014 digital nonprofits in the social-services sector \u2014 \u201cactually works or not.\u201dAs in the private sector, the GetCalFresh team\u2019s work would apparently be judged by people\u2019s willingness to pay for it. To me, this seemed absurd: Wasn\u2019t the whole purpose of government to fund collective projects that are irrational for individuals to take on alone? But Solomon and his team seemed to be caught between a public sector unwilling to finance them and a private philanthropic culture that didn\u2019t see enough value in what they did.Williams and Jaime-Alexis Fowler, then director of marketing at Code for America, joined Solomon for lunch. The waiter who came up to take the orders greeted them like old regulars. \u201cHey! I thought one of you guys was done.\u201d\u201cThis is his new office,\u201d Fowler quipped.\u201cMy new H.Q.,\u201d Solomon said.Fowler told me that in the last couple of weeks, a few significant individuals and foundations in Silicon Valley had come forward as sources of funding for GetCalFresh. The money wasn\u2019t in the bank yet, but things were looking promising, despite all the stresses and doubts of the previous months. Some people still believed in improving digital delivery by government \u2014 \u201cpeople who are saying what you are doing is really important and it\u2019s O.K. that you haven\u2019t figured out all the ins and outs of it.\u201dAfter the kale salads arrived, I asked Solomon what he was going to do now. GetCalFresh was his brainchild, and this creation process, he had told me before, represented the best job he ever had.His plan was to dream up similar projects, he said, but as a kind of social entrepreneur. \u201cIt just became increasingly apparent that moving forward we were going to be working for the government, which is great. There\u2019s a lot that can be done there. But I think my interests are closer to advocacy work than enterprise software. I need to set up a situation where I\u2019m working for my clients, my users.\u201d He paused. \u201cOne of the first things I\u2019m going to do is figure out whether there\u2019s a market for an intermediary in food stamps, the way that people are willing to pay $50 not to deal with the I.R.S.\u201d At the high end, these intermediaries were attorneys and financial advisers. In the middle, they were TurboTax, travel agencies, real-estate brokers. At the low end, of course, there was nothing.If government interactions are so unpleasant that intercessors are necessary, I suggested, then perhaps we should reform government instead of creating another go-between.\u201cBut I think intermediation is often \u2014\u201d Solomon began.Williams threw up his hands. \u201cYes!\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes!\u201d\u201cIn many cases it is those intermediaries who are the strongest pressure for reform,\u201d Solomon said.\u201cThey\u2019re also the strongest opponents of reform in some cases.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Solomon admitted. \u201cIntuit is a great example.\u201d Several years ago, California proposed simplifying tax returns for some taxpayers, but it was opposed by Intuit lobbying.Williams prodded his food with his fork. \u201cSo who\u2019s the most powerful actor?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the intermediaries oftentimes. And that can be a force for good, or a force for self-serving interest.\u201dAs lunch wound down, I asked where Dave Guarino was. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. \u201cDave is coding,\u201d Williams said.Now that things on the funding side were looking up, feature development could begin again. The GetCalFresh team was replacing Solomon with an engineer, Andrew Hyder, who was a Code for America fellow with Solomon, Guarino and Williams in 2013. And once the money arrived, there would be resources for hiring more people too. Williams looked meaningfully at Solomon when he said that.As it happened, the money would come in, and then some. In April, California declared its intent to award GetCalFresh a two-year \u201coutreach\u201d contract, federal money designed to reimburse nonprofits that helped clients through the application process for social services. It would be the first time California had made an award for web-based application assistance. \u201cWe see this as a major first piece of a client-based revenue model \u2014 since we will receive reimbursement based on the number of people we help,\u201d Williams told me. He credited, above all, the support of people like Leo O\u2019Farrell and Kim McCoy Wade, who became the state\u2019s new head of CalFresh in 2015. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who really pulled for us,\u201d Williams said. The team\u2019s immediate financial future secured, its members \u2014 Williams, Guarino and Hyder (three new hires were planned) \u2014 steeled themselves for a long summer leading up to a Code for America summit meeting in Oakland, where they hoped to persuade the various CalFresh directors to try them out.In my last conversations with Williams, the tone was one of cautious optimism. While the California contract kept GetCalFresh going for another two years and gave the team a sense of momentum, it hardly solved all their problems. A real A.P.I. needed to be built and additional county CalFresh directors won over. Above all, the team needed to show impact \u2014 in terms of numbers of users, applications and food-stamp approvals \u2014 on the scale that everyone had come to expect from tech ventures. Everything they had done until now \u2014 all the prototyping, hand-holding, cajoling, fund-raising \u2014 was just preparation. Now the work would really begin.It\u2019s hard to predict whether GetCalFresh will become the vanguard of a new movement in social services or a forlorn entry in the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. But GetCalFresh has made it further than the vast majority of civic-tech projects. It has overcome every kind of crisis \u2014 technical, financial, existential \u2014 while exposing the distance between the current fetishization of innovation and the reality of implementing even the best ideas within intransigent organizations. Perhaps most important, its team has demonstrated a commitment that goes beyond Silicon Valley opportunism.\u201cFor the longest time, if someone asked me what I did at a party or something,\u201d Williams told me, \u201cI would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a product designer,\u2019 or \u2018I work in tech.\u2019 Now I say I work in social services.\u201d Even Solomon, the prodigal son, hasn\u2019t strayed far. Back at the lunch at Citizen\u2019s Band, it occurred to me that despite his qualms, the public sector built so little of its own software that even so-called in-house projects were often procured from vendors. So in the end, you could either pay $30 to have someone outside the government handle the food-stamp application process for you, which is what Solomon wanted, or the government would pay a contractor $30 per successful food-stamp application, which is what Williams and the team wanted: a system in which government contracting outside the I.T. world could align with users\u2019 interests. This seemed a distinction without a difference \u2014 maybe they\u2019d all work together again at some point.Solomon smiled at that. \u201cI think over the next year, he\u2019s going to continue to try to recruit me, and I\u2019m going to continue to try to recruit him, and we\u2019ll probably meet somewhere in the middle.\u201d \u2666Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer based in New York.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chipping Away at a List of Goals, and Bonding Over Cupcakes", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byThe Neediest Cases FundAndie Gratereaux sat under the autumn leaves at DeSalvio Playground in Manhattan a year ago, peeled away the wrapper from a salted caramel cupcake and started to put her life back together.With the help of a mentor she had met that day, Andie, 12, started a list in a spiral notebook of what she wanted to do over the coming year. Visit a park, try to sew, play music, learn to bake, go ice skating.The list became a road map for a girl uprooted from her home in Virginia after her stepfather threw her and her mother, Arlene Gratereaux, out of the house one night in 2011. He did so during one of his fits of rage, episodes during which he would get so angry he would punch holes in the apartment walls that Ms. Gratereaux covered with her daughter\u2019s drawings.Ms. Gratereaux\u2019s brother drove from Manhattan that night to Petersburg, Va., near Richmond, and took mother and daughter immediately back to his place on the Lower East Side. They were safe then, but they had left everything behind.Without a permanent home, Ms. Gratereaux and Andie have shuffled since then between her brother\u2019s apartment and her parents\u2019 place in the East New York section of Brooklyn.They were not used to this lifestyle, especially Andie. It led Ms. Gratereaux to Catholic Big Brothers and Big Sisters, an affiliate of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. She worried about their depressing circumstances and thought Andie needed a mentor, someone who could show her a world that seemed beyond her grasp.Andie was matched with Darragh Wright, 33, who had turned to Big Brothers and Big Sisters about the same time. \u201cI was looking for a way to get connected to the New York community in a long-term way,\u201d Ms. Wright, who grew up in Atlanta, said.At DeSalvio Playground, Ms. Wright decided to break the ice over cupcakes. Together, she and Andie worked on the list of goals, and Ms. Wright snapped a photograph of it with her phone so that she would always have it with her.In the year that followed, she would refer to that photo to cross items off the list.She and Andie traveled to Garrison, N.Y., where they hiked in Arden Point State Park. \u201cWe had sore feet at the end,\u201d Ms. Wright said.Andie sewed, making two blankets for homeless people as part of a community service project. And she got to bake \u2014 banana bread. \u201cMy uncle took two helpings,\u201d she said.Ms. Wright and Andie see each other every other weekend, and their meetings start with a game of three questions. On a brisk afternoon in Prospect Park in Brooklyn a few days before Halloween, as children in princess and Spiderman costumes roamed around, Ms. Wright retrieved her questions for Andie from a plastic bag in her purse.What is your favorite food? (Cheeseburger with fries and ketchup.) What is your favorite day of the year? (Her birthday. Ms. Wright\u2019s is Thanksgiving.) They also discussed Andie\u2019s Halloween costume. (A zombie bride, with black eyes, a pale face and bloodied lips.)Then and now, the questions are never too serious.They do not discuss the trip Andie and her mother must make every week from the Lower East Side to East New York to stay for the weekend. They do not talk about the stress weighing on Ms. Gratereaux, a 34-year-old college graduate who most recently found work as a poll worker on Election Day and is receiving job training through Grace Institute, another program affiliated with Catholic Charities.Andie also has lessons when she is with Ms. Wright.On the October day in Prospect Park, they got up from under a tree, and Ms. Wright handed Andie her phone with Google Maps open on it. They wanted to get a cup of hot cocoa, but it was up to Andie to navigate.\u201cAndie, you lead us,\u201d Ms. Wright said, bending over to look at the phone. \u201cCan you find east? Show me on the map.\u201dAndie shuffled into position and began to walk.\u201cLearning your way around a map is an important thing,\u201d Ms. Wright said as they reversed course after a wrong turn under a bridge.The young girl looked back at the map, and they made their way out of the park. Soon, they would return to another park, the playground in Manhattan where their friendship was forged, to mark their one-year anniversary.\u201cWe\u2019ll do the cupcake thing again,\u201d Andie said.Ms. Wright agreed. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll make another list,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

We are living in an era when some advertising executive gazes at the moon and sees not beauty, or a humbling reminder of his insignificance, but the Earth\u2019s most unignorable billboard.The history of the slow, steady annexation and exploitation of our consciousness \u2014 whether by television commercials, war propaganda or tweets \u2014 is the subject of Tim Wu\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201d He starts with the penny press newspapers of New York City, moves on to the heyday of radio and television, and concludes with the chaotic online bazaar of the present, surely better suited to bugs with eyes all over their heads than to ordinary human beings. En route, he covers snake oil, commercial psychology, Timothy Leary, AOL chat room Gomorrahs. His bandwidth is broad.\u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d is more survey than treatise. Few chapters offer startling new arguments, though Mr. Wu is well attuned to paradoxes and ironies. His tone is measured, careful.Only in the last 50 pages, when he appraises the excesses of the modern internet \u2014 which mutely scrapes our data and stalks us with weight-loss ads; which narcotizes us with listicles and hands to preening no-talents their own micro-platforms on which to strut their micro-stuff \u2014 does Mr. Wu turn savage, sinking enough venom into Twitter and Instagram to kill a baby monkey: \u201cFame, or the hunger for it, would become something of a pandemic, swallowing up more and more people and leaving them with scars of chronic attention-whoredom.\u201dThroughout his book, Mr. Wu explores \u201cthe fundamental, continual dilemma for the attention merchant \u2014 just how far will he go to get his harvest?\u201d Almost inevitably, these merchants run afoul of our core sense of privacy. But over time, that sense has eroded.By the end of the 1920s, most Americans were accustomed to being \u201ccajoled and sold to\u201d in print and on billboards. By the end of the 1950s, advertisers had wormed their way into the family living room, with television and radio networks \u201cowning\u201d times of the day that were previously sacred, like dinner hour. Then came the personal computer, the internet and, finally, the \u201cfourth screen\u201d: our mobile phones. They devoured every morsel of attention we had left, \u201crather in the way fracking would later recover great reserves of oil once considered wholly inaccessible.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s chapters about the early days of advertising are some of this book\u2019s most enjoyable, easily serving as a reader\u2019s companion to \u201cMad Men.\u201d (They contain great product trivia, too: Listerine was once marketed as a floor cleaner.) But it\u2019s the last third of \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d in which Mr. Wu charts the rise and fall of the utopian internet, that is truly memorable.\u201cOnce a commons that fostered the amateur eccentric in every area of interest, the web, by 2015, was thoroughly overrun by commercial junk,\u201d he writes. And the most pathetic part? That commercial junk barely generates a profit. All those clicks amount to \u201crounding errors in the scheme of commerce.\u201dIn other words, the internet has become Vegas without the revenue.Mr. Wu is plenty aware of the web\u2019s virtues, not least of which is that it connects us to others. But we pay a price for our gmail and social media habits. Google and Facebook keep track of our purchases and wishes and fears \u2014 we\u2019ve become their product, their content. A number of commercial entities, including news organizations, subject online visitors to \u201cextraordinary surveillance,\u201d too, collecting data about them without their awareness or explicit consent. \u201cIt is a more thoroughly invasive effort,\u201d he writes, \u201cthan any N.S.A. data collection ever disclosed.\u201dAnd how connected are we, really, under the new terms and conditions of our lives? When we all gathered around the boob tube, Mr. Wu writes, we at least had \u201ca new degree of shared awareness, even shared identity.\u201d But we\u2019ve since become a nation of niches, each of us vanished into our customized, ego-enlarging, time-thieving worlds.And so Mr. Wu concludes his book with a cri de coeur, imploring us to regain custody of our attention. It is written so rousingly that it just may make you reconsider your priorities. He brings up the work of the psychologist and philosopher William James, who \u201cheld that our life experience would ultimately amount to whatever we had paid attention to.\u201d He also quotes James\u2019s quasi-palindromic complement, the ethicist James Williams: \u201cYour time is scarce, and your technologies know it.\u201dWe are what we choose to focus on, the sum of our concentrations. What will we choose? This is an age of glorious individualism. Yet never, it seems, have we belonged less to ourselves.The Attention MerchantsThe Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our HeadsBy Tim Wu403 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teslas in the Trailer Park: A California City Faces Its Housing Squeeze", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byThe town of Mountain View, Google\u2019s home, wants to do something about that. Given new marching orders from a reform-minded City Council that was swept into office here two years ago, Mountain View is looking to increase its housing stock by as much as 50 percent \u2014 including as many as 10,000 units in the area around Google\u2019s main campus.\u201cWe need to provide housing because there\u2019s a housing shortage,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a Mountain View councilman. That may seem an obvious tautology, but it turns out to be highly contentious in a state where most cities and suburbs are still dominated by anti-growth politics that seek to maximize the construction of tax-generating offices while minimizing the number of budget-depleting residents.Mountain View\u2019s political evolution, combined with some limited cases elsewhere, suggests that as rent and home prices have reached the point where even highly paid tech workers are struggling \u2014 the median home here costs $1.4 million, according to Zillow \u2014 the tide is slowly shifting away from resisting growth at all costs and instead trying to channel it.This Silicon Valley city of about 80,000 people is also a reminder that, despite the outsize attention given to big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, any solution to California\u2019s housing crisis is going to rely heavily on suburbs as well.This was underscored by the results of last week\u2019s election, when voters across California passed various affordable housing measures along with new transit funding, and, in some cases, rejected efforts to restrict or cap development. In Palo Alto, several pro-housing candidates were elected to the City Council. Residents in Mountain View approved rent control.\u201cHousing used to be about \u2018them\u2019 \u2014 like poverty or unemployment,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cBut it has become so expensive in the Bay Area that housing now touches enough people to win elections.\u201dMany employees say they would prefer to live closer to work. But these companies reside in small cities that consider themselves suburbs, and the local politics are usually aligned against building dense urban apartments to house them.Take Palo Alto, the Silicon Valley city that has become emblematic of the state\u2019s reputation for rampant not-in-my-backyard politics. Palo Alto has one of the state\u2019s worst housing shortages. With about three jobs for every housing unit, it has among the most out-of-balance mixes anywhere in Silicon Valley.But instead of dealing with this issue by building the few thousand or so apartments it would take to make a dent in the problem, the city has mostly looked to restraining a pace of job growth that the mayor described as \u201cunhealthy.\u201dFarther up the peninsula near San Francisco, the small city of Brisbane told a developer that its proposal for a mixed-use development with offices and 4,000 housing units should have offices for about 15,000 workers, but no new housing.Play that out a thousand times over and the crux of the state\u2019s housing crisis is clear: Everyone knows housing costs are unsustainable and unfair, and that they pose a threat to the state\u2019s economy. Yet every city seems to be counting on its neighbors to step up and fix it.The results are strange compromises like the one made by Rebecca and Steven Callister, a couple in their late 20s who live in a double-wide trailer in a Mountain View mobile home park whose residents are retirees and young tech workers.Mr. Callister is an engineer at LinkedIn, the sort of worker who, in most places, would own a home. But given the cost of housing in Mountain View and the brutal commute times from anywhere they could afford, a trailer makes the most sense and lets him spend more time with the couple\u2019s two young children.\u201cWe joke that it\u2019s the only mobile home park with Mercedeses and Teslas in the driveway,\u201d Mrs. Callister said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the new middle class in California.\u201dIn contrast to Palo Alto, Mountain View is trying to wedge new apartments into its office parks. Much of the action centers on the North Bayshore area, a neighborhood of low-slung office buildings surrounded by asphalt parking lots.Each weekday morning, North Bayshore fills up with cars and young Google employees. They pack the narrow sidewalks and zip around on multicolored bikes. But then the day ends, everyone goes home and there is not much left besides sounds from the nearby freeway and overachievers working late.Mr. Siegel, the city councilman, wants to turn this prototypical example of sprawl into a bustling urban neighborhood. The city has plans for nearly 10,000 new apartments and hopes that businesses like a grocery store, bars and retail shops will follow them.Here in Mountain View, as in many places, residents are mostly aligned against putting too many apartments near the city\u2019s core single-family-home neighborhoods. The city is looking to create new neighborhoods by pushing growth to areas like North Bayshore, where there are already a lot of jobs and few neighbors to complain.Versions of that strategy are taking hold across the Bay Area.Sunnyvale, where Yahoo is based, is looking to transform an older industrial area near one of its rail stations into a new development that would include offices and housing. Menlo Park is studying how to allow for up to 4,500 housing units to be built on industrial land near Facebook\u2019s headquarters.Chris Meany, a partner at Wilson Meany, a real estate development firm in San Francisco, recently headed up a project in San Mateo, about a half-hour south of San Francisco. There, a defunct horse-racing track is being redeveloped into a mixed-use project that sits along a train stop and will eventually comprise five office buildings and 1,000 houses, apartments and condos.Given the political resistance to new housing and the cascade of lawsuits that are a good bet to follow any new proposal, Mr. Meany said he and other developers were more likely to focus on mega-projects with a bigger payoff.\u201cA planner would go out and say, \u2018We should do things regionally and scatter housing throughout the area,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the developer who has to actually get it done, it is better to go off and find large areas of problematic land than trying to choose the smartest location.\u201dNorth Bayshore was historically farmland and the site of the city dump, but in the 1970s, when tech first started booming, Mountain View looked to develop it into a low-density office park.The area has since become a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s booms and busts. Early tenants included faded giants like Silicon Graphics. Then came the 1990s and the dot-com boom and bust.In 1999, just before the bust hit, a little start-up named Google moved from Palo Alto to North Bayshore when it had only a few dozen employees. Today, Google has about 20,000 workers here, and the crush of daily commuters leads to long backups at the three freeway exits into the area.Four years ago \u2014 as Google was swelling, rents were exploding and eviction stories were becoming commonplace \u2014 Mountain View started looking to redevelop North Bayshore. The acrimonious debate over whether to add housing included both predictions that the neighborhood would fill up with the tech equivalent of Chinese factory dorms and worries that residents would disturb a habitat for local burrowing owls.Since then the Council has approved about 2,000 new units elsewhere in town. In all, Mountain View is studying how to add a total of 17,000 units. Mr. Siegel said developers submitted more proposals for housing than the city could process, so the town was looking to hire more planners.There are plenty of desks and a budget to pay them, but few want to take the job.\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: A Face-Off of Smart Speakers", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixTO get an idea of how annoying it can be to say \u201cO.K., Google\u201d multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand.O.K., Pepsi. O.K., Chipotle. O.K., Skittles. You get the picture. It\u2019s difficult to utter \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d the phrase used to control Google\u2019s new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool.That is too bad because Google\u2019s Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon\u2019s Echo.So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both Alexa and Google side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories that they shared in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home.What I found was that while Echo is currently more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google\u2019s product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years.Home\u2019s link to Google\u2019s database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase.Just give them both a pop quiz to see. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap?Amazon declined to comment.Occasionally there are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google\u2019s Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent.Most of the time, however, Google has answers when Alexa fails.Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won\u2019t offer a guess.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to presume an answer that may not be right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being really cautious with this feature.\u201dGoogle\u2019s speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone\u2019s residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on Day 1, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies.Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung\u2019s smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue.Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo.With Home, I managed to get Google\u2019s Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn\u2019t able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google\u2019s lack of support for the devices.Google said that for Home\u2019s release, it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come.One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior.For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film \u201cDrive\u201d resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album \u201c2014 Forest Hills Drive\u201d by J. Cole.For podcasts, both speakers were adequate \u2014 but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like \u201cFresh Air\u201d or \u201cRadio Lab,\u201d but it failed to play \u201cThe Sporkful,\u201d a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for.Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf.On the down side, Alexa and Home are fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment.The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino\u2019s, but otherwise can\u2019t do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby.Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants are.One task Alexa can pull off that Google can\u2019t is list showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Mr. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance.\u201cIf you verbally spit out what\u2019s on the screen, then it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said.Echo and Home are largely the same in the basic tasks they can perform. The capabilities that Home currently lacks, like movie showtimes or support for other smart home accessories, will probably show up in software updates or future partnerships.So what really distinguishes one from the other? Right now, Echo\u2019s major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you.But if you aren\u2019t big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google\u2019s speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player. Home, priced at about $130, is also cheaper than Amazon\u2019s $180 Echo.Let\u2019s just hope Google eventually gives people more ways to talk to its speaker other than \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d (The only other option is \u201cHey, Google.\u201d) It gets so tedious that you may eventually say, \u201cO.K., I\u2019m over this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When A.I. Matures, It May Call J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber \u2018Dad\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byIn a visit with him in this idyllic Swiss city in the mountains near the Italian border, it is easy to understand why he believes that his pioneering work in the field often, as the comedian liked to say, gets no respect.Far away in Silicon Valley, on the other side of the world, the tech industry is building cars that drive themselves and household appliances that respond to your voice commands and even try to predict what you will do next.In certain circles, the people who did the early work that made this technology possible are stars. There is Sebastian Thrun, a roboticist who did groundbreaking research on self-driving cars at Google. Adam Cheyer and Tom Gruber worked on the A.I. program Siri, later acquired by Apple. And Facebook hired Yann LeCun, an expert in \u201cneural networks\u201d who left New York University to start a research program at the social media giant.On a recent train ride to Zurich, Dr. Schmidhuber, an athletic 53-year-old who is co-director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research here, reflected on how he believed his early research was often overlooked or ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s like much of the rest of society,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s postfactual.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber\u2019s complaints are well known within the fraternity of researchers who have turned what until a half-decade ago was an academic backwater into a multibillion-dollar industry. He has been accused of taking credit for other people\u2019s research and even using multiple aliases on Wikipedia to make it look as if people are agreeing with his posts.\u201cJ\u00fcrgen is manically obsessed with recognition and keeps claiming credit he doesn\u2019t deserve for many, many things,\u201d Dr. LeCun said in an email. \u201cIt causes him to systematically stand up at the end of every talk and claim credit for what was just presented, generally not in a justified manner.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber counters that criticism with a bigger point: He is not the only one who is not getting due credit among A.I. researchers. In fact, he says work going all the way back to the 1960s is regularly ignored by today\u2019s research luminaries.Although he insists he doesn\u2019t harbor ill will toward those better-known researchers, it grates on him that history hasn\u2019t been kinder. \u201cCertain researchers in my field have acted as if they invented something, although it was invented by other people whom they did not even mention,\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber said.But understanding the disconnect between his early work and his lack of celebrity isn\u2019t easy \u2014 and cannot be entirely explained by the fact that he lives thousands of miles from the tech industry\u2019s center of gravity.The dispute is about the roots of neural networks, which allow machines to learn by recognizing patterns that can then be applied generally. Applications include recognizing speech and language, visually identifying objects, navigating in self-driving cars and making robot hands grasp more deftly. As a scientific field, it dates to the 1940s. But only in recent years have researchers in this area made striking progress.For decades, neural networks were laboratory curiosities, often met with skepticism. But in the 1990s, with faster and cheaper computers as well as new ideas about how to design neural nets, there was finally progress.Just as humans do not restart learning from scratch every second, a certain type of neural network adds loops or memory that interpret each new word or observation in light of what has been previously observed. LSTM strikingly improved these networks, leading to huge jumps in accuracy.It may be that Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s misfortune is that he was simply too early \u2014 a few years ahead of the powerful and more affordable computers we have today. It was not until recently that his concepts started to pan out.But between Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s and Dr. Hochreiter\u2019s research and today\u2019s progress there was a big gap \u2014 and that\u2019s the rub. Other researchers say it took many contributors to get from Point A to Point B, where we are today.\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of seminal stuff,\u201d said Gary Bradski, an A.I. scientist who created a popular computer vision system known as OpenCV. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t the one who made it popular. It\u2019s kind of like the Vikings discovering America; Columbus made it real.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber also has a grand vision for A.I. \u2014 that self-aware or \u201cconscious machines\u201d are just around the corner \u2014 that causes eyes to roll among some of his peers. To put a fine point on the debate: Is artificial intelligence an engineering discipline, or a godlike field on the cusp of creating a new superintelligent species?Dr. Schmidhuber is firmly in the god camp. He maintains that the basic concepts for such technologies already exist, and that there is nothing magical about human consciousness. \u201cGenerally speaking, consciousness and self-awareness are overrated,\u201d he said, arguing that machine consciousness will emerge from more powerful computers and software algorithms much like those he has already designed.It\u2019s been an obsession since he was a teenager in Germany reading science fiction.\u201cAs I grew up I kept asking myself, \u2018What\u2019s the maximum impact I could have?\u2019\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber recalled. \u201cAnd it became clear to me that it\u2019s to build something smarter than myself, which will build something even smarter, et cetera, et cetera, and eventually colonize and transform the universe, and make it intelligent.\u201dToday, he will not be pinned down on when such thinking machines might arrive, saying only that given the vast improvements in computing power it will be soon.In 2014, he and others founded a company to commercialize some of the technology that he helped create and to work on \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d artificial intelligence.Nnaisense\u2019s chief executive is an American computer scientist, Faustino Gomez, who has been Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s research collaborator for many years. He defends both his partner\u2019s claims of having done pioneering work and his optimism about the field that has begun shaking up industries and economies around the world.\u201cWe are at the beginning of the end of the beginning in A.I.,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weyerhaeuser Moves Out of the Woods and Into Urban Seattle", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetSEATTLE \u2014 The new headquarters of Weyerhaeuser seem an exception to other office buildings in this waterfront city. Instead of a tower on a busy street, this new corporate base is a horizontal structure with a front door that opens onto a public park.Tucked inside a group of 19th-century buildings, the steel-and-glass home of Weyerhaeuser, a wood products and timberlands company, is almost hidden by a row of trees.Weyerhaeuser, founded in 1900, moved from a forested 400-acre spread in suburban Federal Way, about 22 miles south of Seattle\u2019s central business district. Since October, the company\u2019s 700 employees have worked in the new building, which has a half-acre footprint and is in the historic Pioneer Square district, just south of Seattle\u2019s downtown area.The old building \u201cwas too big for us,\u201d said Jack Evans, a company spokesman. At the same time, he added, the company also recognized the recruitment value of an in-town headquarters. \u201cSeattle is the center of gravity,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Developed by Urban Visions, based in Seattle, the seven-story Weyerhaeuser building is a bit of an outlier in the explosive Seattle office market, which is centered on the downtown area to the north, and a second neighborhood, South Lake Union, a former light industrial area just north of downtown. Currently, at least 13 office buildings are rising in these central Seattle markets.\u201cSeattle is one of the busiest markets in the country right now,\u201d said Jake Bos, an office leasing agent who is a senior associate with Kidder Mathews, a local commercial real estate brokerage firm that is not connected to the Weyerhaeuser development.Central Seattle, in fact, is among the leading markets for new office space in the Western United States. In the first nine months of this year, 822,000 square feet of new office space were completed in central Seattle, and 4.93 million more square feet were under construction, according to Kidder Mathews research. In comparison, the financial district of San Francisco, one of the fastest-growing West Coast office markets, reported 1.07 million square feet of office space completed in the same period, and 3.77 million square feet under construction.\u201cAmazon was the catalyst of the office boom, which has been fueled by tech,\u201d Mr. Bos said.In South Lake Union, at least four new office buildings are expected to open before the end of the year; two of them are fully leased to Amazon. Separately, Vulcan Inc., a company owned by Paul G. Allen, a Microsoft founder, recently received permission to build a four-building complex for Google in the same district. Covering two city blocks, the master plan calls for housing, shopping and 607,000 square feet of office space.The interest in central Seattle is a sign of a changing culture. With natural beauty and plentiful waterways in the region, Seattle has a high hip factor and has long been a magnet for millennials. Corporations are returning to urban markets in part because of the ease of attracting younger workers and city dwellers.Mr. Evans of Weyerhaeuser said the new location was a positive for recruitment. The new neighborhood \u2014 unlike one isolated in the woods \u2014 offers amenities including a bakery, a combined bookstore-gallery and a craftsman bookbinder.Access to public transportation also played a large role in Weyerhaeuser\u2019s choice of the historic district, which is within walking distance of nearly every type of transit available in Seattle, including light rail, regional rail, streetcars and ferries. Ninety percent of the employees are transit users.Within an attractive neighborhood, the building itself is a recruitment tool, said the developer, Greg Smith, the founder and chief executive of Urban Visions. \u201cThe emphasis in this building is on wellness and health, including mental health,\u201d he said.A big attraction is the exterior deck on top of the seventh floor. This green roof has a Ping-Pong table, a fire pit, a barbecue grill and an elevated walking path circling the building. From the roof deck, employees have a postcard-worthy view of Elliott Bay, the orange cargo cranes of Seattle harbor directly ahead and the skyline of the central business district.Replacing a parking lot in Pioneer Square, a designated historic district, required the developer to clear many hurdles. The design went through several versions before it won the approval of city officials, who vetted materials, signage and even color choices. In one concession, the sides of the Weyerhaeuser building were made of hand-laid brick, to help the structure blend with its neighbors.\u201cThe design had to pay homage in the neighborhood without trying to appear to be a historic building,\u201d said Leslie Smith, the executive director of the Alliance for Pioneer Square, a nonprofit group. Ms. Smith, who is not related to Mr. Smith, the developer, said she was pleased with the result: \u201cThe building is beautifully understated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama, With Angela Merkel in Berlin, Assails Spread of Fake News", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byBut instead of basking in the glow of his valedictory tour of Europe, Mr. Obama used the moment to make a passionate and pointed attack on bogus news stories disseminated on Facebook and other social media platforms, twice calling such false reports a threat to democracy in his hourlong news conference.Mr. Obama also warned Mr. Trump of the need to take the job of the presidency seriously and to be tough on Russia.\u201cThe extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States not just by its own people, but by people around the world \u2014 that forces you to focus,\u201d Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency. \u201cThat demands seriousness.\u201d\u201cAnd if you\u2019re not serious about the job, then you probably won\u2019t be there very long,\u201d Mr. Obama added.But it was on the subject of false information coursing through social media and television that Mr. Obama was most impassioned, so much so that at one stage he lost track of the question he was answering.\u201cBecause in an age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect.\u201d\u201cI got all caught up in that one,\u201d he said.Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, recently said fake news on the social network was rare, and dismissed notions that such reports might have swayed the election as \u201cpretty crazy.\u201dIn the three months before Election Day, the most popular stories produced by hoax sites and \u201chyperpartisan blogs\u201d generated more engagement \u2014 likes, shares and comments \u2014 on Facebook than the most popular articles by major news websites, the analysis found.Among the 20 most popular fake election stories identified by BuzzFeed, all but three favored Mr. Trump or denigrated Hillary Clinton.In Berlin, Mr. Obama pointed a second time to the potential dangers of false news reports.\u201cIn the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened,\u201d he said in response to a question about the recent election.\u201cIf we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.\u201dMs. Merkel offered her own warnings about the disruptions associated with digitization, likening the present period to the social disruptions that occurred during the Industrial Revolution.Germans have shown deep ambivalence toward social media, worried that global companies fail to respect the country\u2019s strict laws protecting personal privacy. Facebook has also come under scrutiny from the German government for allowing the spread of hate speech in postings that would be illegal in traditional media.The chancellor thanked Mr. Obama for putting \u201cpersonal privacy on the agenda,\u201d a nod to the strain in relations between the two after it emerged in 2013 that the National Security Agency had been monitoring Ms. Merkel\u2019s cellphone, prompting outrage among Germans.Mr. Obama urged Mr. Trump to cooperate with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when the Russians behave, but said he hoped \u201cthat the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.\u201d\u201cAnd I don\u2019t expect that the president-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cThat will be something we\u2019ll learn more about as the president-elect puts his team together,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump has repeatedly complimented Mr. Putin and has sought to improve ties with Russia. The United States has accused Russia of hacking emails of Democratic Party officials in order to influence the election, and Mr. Putin warmly welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.Mr. Obama said he spoke to Mr. Trump last week about ensuring that his actions help to unify and not divide the country.\u201cAnd what I said to him was what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn\u2019t support him,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s indicated his understanding of that.\u201d\u201cThat has to reflect itself not only in the things he says but also in how he fills out his administration,\u201d Mr. Obama said, apparently referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as a senior adviser. Mr. Bannon has been criticized for his association with racist, nationalistic and anti-Semitic views.\u201cMy hope is that that\u2019s something he is thinking about,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cBecause not only is the president of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction, but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways.\u201dMr. Obama said Mr. Trump had reassured him that he would remain committed to the NATO alliance once in office, and that he was encouraged by that.Yet the Europeans, including Germany, have failed consistently over the years to uphold their financial commitment to supporting the alliance, long a sore point with Washington.Germany has fallen short of its contributions over the past several years, and in 2015 made good on only about half its pledge, despite record tax income for the government.Ms. Merkel vowed that this would change in the future, crediting Mr. Obama with delivering the message that Germany needed to increase military spending.\u201cIn the long term, the imbalance over defense spending cannot be maintained, and Germany has understood this message and already begun to react,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.Mr. Obama added that Germans should appreciate what the United States had done for the country since World War II.\u201cBut I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cHas looked out for Germany.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Hacksaw Ridge\u2019 Has the Guts and the Glory. But Where\u2019s the Gun?", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byAnd also in graphic and gruesome detail. Mr. Gibson\u2019s appetite for gore is without equal in modern Hollywood. Maybe that\u2019s saying a lot, or maybe it goes without saying, but the man is an aficionado \u2014 a connoisseur, an epicure, a gourmand \u2014 of exploding heads, shattered limbs and burst abdomens. As he did most famously in \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d he once again plunges a man of peace into a charnel house of cruelty, testing the fortitude of protagonist and audience alike.\u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d opens with a taste of hell, a battleground that belongs more in a horror movie than in a combat picture. Rupert Gregson-Williams\u2019s jarring, minor-key score plays under a slow-motion tableau of spurting blood, splintering bones, burning flesh and general agony.Then the music changes, the light shifts, and we are in paradise: a hilly, pastoral corner of Virginia years before Pearl Harbor. Young Desmond (Darcy Bryce) and his brother, Hal (Roman Guerriero), chase each other over rocks and streams. Not that they dwell in a perfect Eden. There is a whiff of Cain and Abel in their relationship, and more serious trouble from their father, Tom (Hugo Weaving), a bitter, alcoholic World War I veteran. Though he hates war, the elder Doss is hardly a pacifist, and his violent behavior toward his sons and their mother (Rachel Griffiths) helps push Desmond toward peace-loving piety.Played as a young man by Andrew Garfield, Desmond is a happy anti-warrior, with a goofy grin and wide, trusting eyes. He courts a nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), and their romance is so sweet and squeaky clean \u2014 he kisses her; she slaps his face; he proposes \u2014 that you might think the old production code was still in effect. And until the fighting resumes about halfway through, \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d often feels like a throwback to an earlier era, a work of careful and calculated nostalgia.When Desmond arrives at basic training, he is introduced to a platoon whose composition \u2014 one guy from Brooklyn, another from Texas, a Pole, an Italian, a pretty boy and a hothead \u2014 would have looked corny back in the \u201940s. And let\u2019s not forget Sarge, a fountain of colorful insults played by Vince Vaughn, who stands out among the mostly Australian and British cast members for his effortlessly flat vowels and the equal effortlessness of his scene-stealing.Sarge does not much care for Desmond. Neither does his commander, Captain Glover (Sam Worthington). Desmond\u2019s refusal to bear arms strikes these officers as a potential threat to morale, and they try to get rid of him \u2014 encouraging the other soldiers to harass and beat him, trying to arrange a psychiatric discharge and finally convening a court-martial. This parade of indignities leads to scenes of quiet defiance; a few rousing, tear-streaked speeches; and a bit of mildly interesting philosophical reflection. Mr. Gibson is too impatient to linger over the nuances of patriotic duty and religious devotion. He and the screenwriters, Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, are content to remind us that both are very important. Then it\u2019s time to get back to Okinawa and deal with the Japanese Army.Ever since \u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d Hollywood has been eager to revisit World War II, partly to explore gray areas and narrative corners neglected in earlier eras and partly to have a high-minded reason to try out advances in bloody special effects. Realism is less a principle than an excuse to concoct vivid fantasies of battle for the benefit of noncombatants, to rub our faces in details that our fathers and grandfathers were famously reluctant to discuss.And \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d uses the moral dilemma of its hero \u2014 who is sometimes tempted to forsake his vows and pick up a rifle in the heat of battle \u2014 as a pretext for its own ethical sleight of hand. The film pretends to be a grim reckoning with the horrors of war, but it is also, true to its genre, a rousing celebration of the thrills of battle. Desmond Doss was calm, humble and courageous, qualities Mr. Gibson honors but does not share. It is possible to be moved and inspired by Desmond\u2019s exploits while still feeling that his convictions have been exploited, perhaps even betrayed.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

But what was there, in those dozens of stickies, was so captivating that Mr. Patel knew he had to have the role. Based on Saroo Brierley\u2019s best-selling memoir, \u201cA Long Way Home,\u201d the film tells the true story of a 5-year-old Indian boy who fell asleep on a train and ended up in Kolkata, thousands of miles from home. Lost and unable to tell authorities the name of his mother or hometown, he was soon adopted by a couple in Australia. Years later, Mr. Brierley searched for his family back in India with only help from Google Earth and a smattering of memories.What Mr. Davis was looking for in the character of Saroo, it seemed, was someone a bit less \u2026 Dev Patel. \u201cHis acting style wasn\u2019t necessarily what I had in mind,\u201d the director conceded.It was clear Mr. Patel would have to fight for this one. You seem like a lovely guy, the director and screenwriter told him, but you\u2019ve got to throw your hat in the ring with everyone else. \u201cActually, they were very sweet about it,\u201d Mr. Patel said with a laugh.That film, co-starring Freida Pinto, went on to win eight Academy Awards, including for best picture and best director, and forever changed the way Mr. Patel looked at India and his place in it. At school in London, he remembered, \u201ca lot of kids were bullied, and I spent a lot of time repressing my culture just to fit in.\u201d When he traveled to India, the experience was life-changing. \u201cWe went to the most incredible places you wouldn\u2019t see in a package holiday, and it blew away all the clich\u00e9s I had in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell in love with my co-star. Everybody I met was listening to Led Zeppelin.\u201dIf the shoot changed his life, the film itself initially did little to alter Mr. Patel\u2019s prospects in Hollywood. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting cast after \u2018Slumdog,\u2019\u201d he said. At times, the breakthrough film even worked against him. He wasn\u2019t allowed to audition for the South Asian title character of \u201cLife of Pi,\u201d Ang Lee\u2019s 2012 adventure fantasy, he said, because the filmmakers thought he had become overexposed. Suraj Sharma, who eventually landed the role, \u201cdid an amazing job, and the film blew me away, but there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s like, damn, I wish I could have at least taken a shot at it.\u201dFor the role of Saroo, Mr. Patel met with the director for six hours, plowing his way through every scene. He did a full screen test, capped off by a request from Mr. Davis to scream his guts out. \u201cHe goes, \u2018I want you to lose your mind,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it if you don\u2019t want to, but I knew in my head that if I said no, that was it. So I lost it. I completely went somewhere.\u201dTo better connect with the character, Mr. Patel rode trains across India \u2014 \u201cJust so I could understand what it would be like to be on a train that long\u201d \u2014 and visited orphanages.Mr. Patel also worked with a dialect coach for eight months to recreate Saroo\u2019s Australian accent. \u201cI think everyone was stunned by his accent work,\u201d Mr. Davis, who is Australian, said. \u201cIt\u2019s flawless, really. Australian accents are very hard \u2014 they\u2019re kind of ugly and complicated \u2014 but the guy never stopped working.\u201d\u201cIt was very difficult,\u201d Mr. Patel acknowledged. An Indian accent is easier for him, he said \u2014 \u201cIt feels less strange in the mouth\u201d \u2014 but even that didn\u2019t come overnight. \u201cIf you look at my Indian accent in \u2018Slumdog,\u2019 it was very messy,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cNot the best at all.\u201dThe gym, the accent, even a longer, newly grown mane: \u201cIt was all part of becoming a bit more alpha,\u201d Mr. Patel said. \u201cHow could I look more masculine and grown up now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other White People", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported bySince the election, the West Coast has been abuzz with talk of breaking away from Donald Trump\u2019s America \u2014 a Calexit, or a linking of the nation\u2019s most populous state with Oregon, Washington and British Columbia to form a Cascadia by the sea.It\u2019s a fantasy, of course, fueled by Trump\u2019s drubbing on the West Coast, where he got less than 10 percent of the vote in some cities. But it would also be a monumental mistake for the most prosperous and progressive part of the United States to even consider abandoning a country that could be dominated by the old Confederacy.A better idea is to reach out across a yawning class divide. People in the West could listen to their fellow Americans in the old industrial heartland. And people in struggling towns could learn something from the workable policies of the left coast. Difficult as that conversation may be, it could start with some white-on-white dialogue.In Portland, Ore., often called the whitest city in America, Trump pulled barely 17 percent of the vote in the county covering most of the metro area, and even less in the city proper. In Seattle, which is nearly 70 percent white, Trump is on track to get only 8 percent of the vote \u2014 a historic low for a major party nominee. Denver, which is 63 percent white, didn\u2019t even give Trump one in five votes. And in San Francisco, with a black population of 6 percent, Trump finished in single digits.This fortress of the forward-looking is not all white, certainly; California, after all, has no ethnic majority. But for the sake of preventing a certain clueless conventional wisdom from taking hold, let\u2019s consider the other white people.This West Coast majority cares about climate change, tech and trade. They care about where their food comes and want family-friendly policies that don\u2019t knock women out of their career trajectories. They aren\u2019t afraid of raising taxes to make their cities more livable \u2014 in fact, they just raised taxes to build new infrastructure. They don\u2019t think lunatics should be able to buy assault rifles. And their issues were completely forgotten in the presidential campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re a nation state,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s lieutenant governor, after the election. \u201cIn so many ways we are America. But we\u2019re just ahead of the curve.\u201dCalifornia, which went Democratic by a nearly two-to-one margin and is one big reason Hillary Clinton will win the popular tally by well over a million votes, feels particularly left out. People in the state are beating drums to the spectral rhythms of the old Bear Flag Revolt, which briefly produced an independent California Republic in 1846.Instead, California should leverage its political clout \u2014 with almost one-in-eight members of the House hailing from the Golden State \u2014 to stop Trump\u2019s backward ideas.The biggest lesson from the West Coast is about job and wage growth. Trump wants to return to the 19th century of dirty energy. But coal\u2019s biggest enemy is cheap natural gas, not environmental regulation. No sane company wants to build a new coal-fired electrical plant.In September, 42 percent of all new jobs created in the country were in California. At the same time, Oregon posted a job creation rate that was double the national average. And earlier this year, Washington State was ranked No. 1 for combined job and wage growth.Yes, wage growth. The West Coast has consistently voted to make minimum wage a livable wage \u2014 something opposed by Republicans in the capital. But even better jobs are there for the making in infrastructure.Trump claims he\u2019ll put people to work building roads, bridges and airports, while lowering taxes on the rich. He can no more make Flint tap water into Trump wine. But there is a simple solution, adopted on Election Day throughout the West Coast: targeted tax increases. Voters approved of them because the money will be dedicated to new infrastructure \u2014 expanded and ambitious light rail systems in Seattle and Los Angeles, for example. No burger flipping there.It was absurd and unpatriotic when Texans talked of secession rather than be led by Barack Obama. Apparently, they couldn\u2019t handle all the job growth that came with his historic presidency. It\u2019s equally absurd for Californians to talk of taking their Macs and walking out after Trump\u2019s barbarians move into the White House. The United States, without the innovative West Coast, would be a yesterday country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Leaders Examine a Post-Election World", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byThe interview lineup included:One billionaire investor has come out in support of another billionaire businessman.William A. Ackman told an audience on Thursday that he woke up Wednesday morning \u201cbullish on Trump.\u201dIt was somewhat of a twist for Mr. Ackman, who is known for his support of liberal causes. Mr. Ackman, who runs a $11.6 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, said he liked the idea that the president-elect would run the country like a business.\u201cWe are going to get a lot done,\u201d Mr. Ackman said in the final segment of the DealBook conference in Manhattan.Mr. Ackman had harsh words to say about what he called the \u201cfraudulence of the media,\u201d taking a swipe at a recent portrayal of him in Vanity Fair and coverage of the election.As for his hedge fund firm, he conceded it had been a difficult year; his Pershing Square Holdings are down 20.7 percent so far this year. But Mr. Ackman sought to explain it away by saying the poor performance was largely caused by just one bad trade.\u201cWe\u2019ve had one problem: Valeant,\u201d Mr. Ackman, 50, said.Shares of the troubled pharmaceutical company have plunged to $17 a share from the average $190 a share his firm paid in 2015, Mr. Ackman said. Pershing has a roughly 10 percent stake in the Valeant. While he acknowledged the stock was unlikely to get back to $190 anytime soon, he outlined what he said was a plan for the company and share price to recover.Mr. Ackman also brushed off suggestions that investors might lose patience with him given the poor performance this year. He said the other stocks Pershing owns had performed better, adding that the firm had a \u201cgood batting average.\u201dAs for his best-known bearish stock call \u2014 Herbalife \u2014 Mr. Ackman said he would still be proved right and the stock would eventually go to zero. But he also struck a humble note, saying he had learned his lesson and would have been \u201cbetter off staying in the shadows\u201d and not going public with claims that the nutritional supplements company was a pyramid scheme.He added: \u201cThis is my last public short.\u201d\u2014 ALEXANDRA STEVENSON and MATTHEW GOLDSTEINLloyd Blankfein may be known for making winning investment calls, but like so many on Wall Street the Goldman Sachs chief made the wrong bet in the presidential election.During the campaign, Mr. Blankfein had voiced support for Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and had been personally featured in a television ad portraying the Democrats as puppets of the global financial elite.But on Thursday the Goldman chief sounded willing to see how Donald J. Trump governs.\u201cI know a lot about Trump the campaigner,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said. \u201cYou go into that office and think about your place in history.\u201dMr. Blankfein said he was not surprised by the two-day rally in the stock market, even as some analysts had predicted a big dip if Mr. Trump was elected, because the Republican\u2019s policies \u2014 most likely a mix of corporate tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks \u2014 will be \u201cmarket supportive.\u201dHe was asked about a media report on Thursday indicating Mr. Trump was considering JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, for Treasury secretary.\u201cHe would be a great Treasury secretary,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein of Mr. Dimon.He said Mr. Trump\u2019s finance chairman during the campaign, Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman executive, is \u201da highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\u201dOn Wall Street issues, Mr. Trump has put forth seemingly contradictory proposals. He has said he will repeal the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, though his party\u2019s platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Blankfein said he thought that neither proposal would gain much traction. \u201cIf you want to be good for bankers you have to have policies that drive economic growth,\u201d he said.Even as Mr. Blankfein struck a relatively optimistic tone about the impending Trump administration, he had sought to assure Goldman employees about the election results.On Wednesday, Mr. Blankfein left a voice mail with employees globally, seeking to reassure the firm in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, which he said \u201csurprised many of us, similar to what we saw earlier this year in the U.K. Brexit vote.\u201dHe told employees he couldn\u2019t predict whether the outcome of Mr. Trump\u2019s election would be \u201cgood or bad in the long run\u201d but that Goldman Sachs would need to \u201ccontingency plan for all scenarios,\u201d according to a transcript of the voice mail reviewed by The New York Times.In his voice mail, Mr. Blankfein also addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic words that at times during his campaign had racist, sexist and xenophobic undertones.\u2014 MICHAEL CORKERY and ALEXANDRA STEVENSONAs the boards of CBS and Viacom weigh re-merging, the scion of the family that controls both companies believes that, in the media business, bigger is better.Shari Redstone, whose family\u2019s corporate vehicle controls the voting power at both CBS and Viacom, argued that now more than ever, the companies that produce content need to get larger to negotiate against distributors like Comcast and AT&T.The matter is becoming more acute after huge acquisitions by some of the biggest television providers in the country, including AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner. (Ms. Redstone said on stage that she believed the deal made sense.)Ms. Redstone and her father have pushed both CBS and Viacom to weigh a reunion, putting together businesses that have been apart for a decade. Since then, CBS has thrived while Viacom \u2014 home to Paramount, MTV and Comedy Central \u2014 has struggled.\u201cScale matters because it is going to give us leverage,\u201d Ms. Redstone said, \u201cand we are going to need leverage with some partners.\u201dAt the moment, special committees at both CBS and Viacom are weighing the merger option. Though media investors and analysts believe that the two companies will go forward, DealBook\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Ms. Redstone if it was possible that the two could stay independent and thrive.\u201cThey are two strong companies, and they both will survive,\u201d Ms. Redstone said. Referring to the presidential election, she added, \u201cEverything is possible \u2014 we just saw that this week.\u201d\u2014 MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and EMILY STEELThe day after Donald J. Trump was elected, traffic to HealthCare.gov surged.More than 100,000 people signed up for coverage on Wednesday, often with federally funded subsidies, through the health care law that Mr. Trump and his party have vowed to repeal, according to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services.Ms. Burwell stuck to a sunny set of talking points on Thursday, emphasizing the changes the law has brought about \u2014 such as guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing health problems \u2014 and how unpopular undoing some of them would be.\u201cWhen the conversation comes to the point of reality, I think it\u2019s going to be a very different conversation,\u201d Ms. Burwell said.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has cast a shadow over the health care marketplace\u2019s open enrollment period, which began Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31.\u201cI\u2019m already starting to get the calls where people are fearful about what is going to happen,\u201d said Bernard J. Tyson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente. \u201cThe questions are now coming: Should I renew? What does this mean? Am I going to get kicked out of Kaiser Permanente after Jan. 20?\u201d(The answer is no. Any 2017 marketplace health insurance plan that a customer signs up for during open enrollment will remain in force for the year.)But both Ms. Burwell and Mr. Tyson see opportunities for reform where, they hope, bipartisan forces can align, especially around shifting the health care industry\u2019s business model away from high-volume, fee-for-service transactions and toward paying for higher-quality outcomes.Kaiser Permanente is succeeding in its initiatives to move more care out of expensive settings like hospitals and into places like patients\u2019 homes, Mr. Tyson said. Half of its 100 million physician visits last year were done virtually, through tools like videoconferencing and smartphones.\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up, in the 21st century, with the home operating as a medical center,\u201d he said. Wearing a Jawbone fitness tracker, he also predicted that wearables would increasingly become medical devices \u2014 a technological change that could usher in significant advances in preventive care.\u201cI got a picture this morning of a swastika,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, Thursday morning.Mr. Schultz, an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton, said he had seen some disturbing things happening in America recently. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand,\u201d he said.Mr. Schultz said that he felt that much of the country and the world were in a state of shock and disbelief about the outcome of the election, but added that Donald J. Trump\u2019s win was likely the result of years and years of many people in America feeling that no one was listening to them.In September, after Mr. Schultz endorsed Mrs. Clinton, Trump supporters called for a boycott of Starbucks. On Thursday, at a conference held by The New York Times, Andrew Ross Sorkin reminded Mr. Schultz that Mr. Trump had once said that one of the most successful Starbucks cafes was located in Trump Tower.\u201cNot true,\u201d he shot back.Starbucks has been involved in political activism for years. In September 2013, the company asked customers to leave firearms behind when they were in its stores or using its outdoor seating \u2014 a policy change that was made days after a shooting spree at the Washington Navy Yard that left 13 people, including the gunman, dead.And over the summer, Starbucks garnered media attention as customers ordered drinks under \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d rather than their names, so that baristas would shout out the phrase when a drink order was ready.At the conference on Thursday, Mr. Schultz defended Starbucks\u2019s role in activism.\u201cShould we hide behind and not take advantage of the platform we have?\u201d he asked.But when asked whether he would run for political office, Mr. Schultz refused to say yes or no.\u201cI don\u2019t think today\u2019s the day to answer that question,\u201d he said.And, upon being asked whether he would accept a position in the Trump administration (on the off-chance that it were offered to him), Mr. Schultz replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me.\u201d\u2014 DANIELLE IVORYRichard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, may not have predicted the outcome of the presidential election correctly, he admitted on Thursday \u2014 but he remains convinced that combining his parent company, Time Warner, with AT&T remains the right move.One of the main reasons the $85 billion combination makes sense, he contended, was that it would yield even better data on viewers, which HBO could then use to do a better job of figuring out what those subscribers want to watch. Nearly half of HBO subscribers watch only movies available on the service, and if AT&T is better able to figure out what those people like to watch, HBO can then do better at serving up the content that would keep them watching.What the data won\u2019t be used for, he said, is to dictate the kinds of shows that will be made.\u201cThe more we get, the more we learn, the more we can micro-target,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cNo one is telling a writer, \u2018Write this based on the data.\u2019\u201dHis counterpart on stage and the chief executive of the cable operator Charter Communications, Thomas M. Rutledge, was more circumspect about the deal. Charter \u2014 which struck its own megadeal by buying Time Warner Cable \u2014 spends about $10 billion a year on content already, which Mr. Rutledge says accounts for much of the expense of cable packages.So putting Time Warner under the aegis of AT&T and potentially charging even more for HBO, CNN and other Time Warner properties remains a concern.\u201cIs there a box of tissues here?\u201d Indra Nooyi said with a smile.Ms. Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo and a Hillary Clinton supporter, had just been asked how she was feeling after the election.She offered her congratulations to President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2014 but then professed a deep sadness and sense of disappointment about the outcome.\u201cI had to answer a lot of questions, from my daughters, from my employees \u2014 they were all in mourning,\u201d she said. \u201cOur employees are all crying and the question that they are asking, especially those that are not white: \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 Women are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 L.G.B.T. people are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 I never thought I\u2019d have had to answer those questions.\u201dAsked about the coarseness of the language used during the election as well as the domestic violence issues confronting the National Football League, which Pepsi sponsors, she said: \u201cForget the Pepsi brand \u2014 how dare we talk about women that way? Why do we talk that way about a whole group of citizens?\u201dShe said she did not think there was a place for a type of language that has sometimes been dismissed as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d \u201cNot in locker rooms, not in football players\u2019 homes, not in any place.\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t nip it in the bud,\u201d Ms. Nooyi added, \u201cthis is going to be a lethal force that takes over society.\u201d\u201cIt has got to stop,\u201d she said \u2014 at which point the auditorium, packed with business leaders, academics and others, erupted into applause.Ms. Nooyi emphasized the need to offer reassurances, as a nation, to women, racial minorities and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.When Aetna ran through post-election expectations, the idea that Donald J. Trump would win the presidency and that Republicans would control both chambers of Congress seemed so implausible that it was not even in play.\u201cWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday \u2014 we had no idea how to approach it,\u201d Mark T. Bertolini, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said Thursday morning at the DealBook conference. \u201cWhat we would have spent months doing if we thought it was even remotely possible, we had to do in a day.\u201dSo what happens now? Mr. Bertolini said he assumed that the Affordable Care Act, the landmark bill that reshaped the health care market, would be repealed but perhaps some parts would survive.In particular, he named three changes mandated by the law that he thinks will endure: allowing young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until they turn 26, the expansion of Medicaid to cover many low-income people and \u201cguaranteed issue,\u201d the rule that requires insurers to offer policies to all applicants, regardless of their health conditions.\u201cI think those are all very important positions that we need to continue,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said.But other provisions are very likely dead, Mr. Bertolini forecast, including the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost plans that was scheduled to take effect in 2020. What happens to premiums in 2018 and beyond is also an open question, he said.The National Football League is considering ways to shorten games, including cutting some advertising from broadcasts, to keep the action moving, says Roger Goodell, the league\u2019s commissioner.Responding to shifts in the way fans watch games, the league is looking at whether games should be shorter, including reducing the amount of time spent not playing and speeding up instant replay reviews, to \u201ckeep our games exciting.\u201dFans often complain about the games being too long and frequently express annoyance at the number of commercial breaks and referee video reviews.The league has been plagued with declining ratings this season as fans find nontraditional ways to view games, including online. At Thursday\u2019s DealBook conference, Mr. Goodell said ratings wax and wane in cycles, but he acknowledged that there had been fundamental shifts in the way people use media. The league\u2019s response is to make sure fans are engaged no matter how they see the games.Most public figures should assume that information about them will be leaked. At least, that\u2019s what Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, thinks.Mr. Schmidt, whose emails with members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign were stolen and recently published online by WikiLeaks, spoke at length about the importance of tightening digital security at a conference held by The New York Times on Thursday, and said that President-elect Donald J. Trump should create a division within the federal government that spends its time auditing the security of its systems.\u201cWe live online now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you grab someone\u2019s smartphone, it\u2019s equal or worse than grabbing their wallet.\u201dHe said Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, once told him that, because \u201cgovernments are capable of systemic evil, which requires planning,\u201d leaking any form of activity at that level would prevent government from getting \u201ctoo far into that evil.\u201d Mr. Schmidt punctuated that story, however, by saying, \u201cThe problem, of course, with this argument, is that he appoints himself the judge of that.\u201dMr. Schmidt added that the United States government had not yet figured out how to deter digital attacks from other countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How LinkedIn Drove a Wedge Between Microsoft and Salesforce", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Once so close they flirted with a merger, the software giants became archrivals when they realized the value of the data amassed by social networks.Supported byThis is a story of love lost after a fight over social media.Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn \u2014 hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople. When Microsoft won, Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European antimonopoly laws.But not long ago, the two software giants were tight. They even talked about merging their businesses \u2014 not once, but twice. The second round of talks hasn\u2019t previously been reported.A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce, which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model, and Microsoft, which is racing to adjust, exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter. The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.There are big personalities behind the battle. At Microsoft, the job of adjusting course has fallen to Satya Nadella, a poetry-quoting chief executive who is trying to aggressively remake the company in hot areas like the cloud business applications where Salesforce is a leader.\u201cMicrosoft decided it could go ahead and recreate the best parts of Salesforce,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures who has spoken with Mr. Nadella and other business-development executives at Microsoft.Marc Benioff, a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, is considered a self-assured visionary. But he had doubts about staying independent around the time he understood that Microsoft was getting serious about competing with his company.At the time, software used by businesses was usually sold through huge licensing deals for software that would be installed directly on company PCs. Mr. Benioff\u2019s idea was to undercut that model: He would offer the same thing over the internet, without expensive installations, and customers would pay by the month.The idea proved prescient. Though it only recently began turning a profit, Salesforce is on track to have more than $8 billion in revenue this year, representing annual growth of about 25 percent. The total market value of the company is over $50 billion. Salesforce is the largest tech employer in San Francisco, and the company will move into the city\u2019s tallest building, Salesforce Tower, when it is completed.It took Microsoft years to see the potential in what Salesforce was doing. Microsoft had its own C.R.M. product, Dynamics, but it took a back seat inside an empire that, under the former chief executive Steven A. Ballmer, was consumed with battling more prominent competitors like Apple, Google and Sony.Mr. Nadella, a longtime Microsoft executive whose career odyssey at the company included overseeing its C.R.M. product, was less combative than his predecessor. He began reaching out to leaders of many rival companies after he became chief executive in early 2014, with a special goal of improving Microsoft\u2019s standing in Silicon Valley.John W. Thompson, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who had recently become chairman of Microsoft\u2019s board, arranged a dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., for Mr. Nadella to meet other tech executives, including Mr. Benioff, the Salesforce chief said in a 2015 interview. \u201cAt the end of dinner, I really gave Satya a number of areas I thought we could work closely on,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in the interview. \u201cHe took me up on all of them.\u201dMr. Nadella and Mr. Benioff declined to be interviewed for this article.At one point, Mr. Benioff offered to buy the Dynamics business that Salesforce competed with, but Mr. Nadella turned him down, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Several people briefed on the talks said that account was accurate, though two of them said another factor was that Mr. Benioff thought Microsoft was not respectful enough of his accomplishments in building Salesforce. It was unclear whether Mr. Benioff would be happy in a subordinate role at Microsoft after building Salesforce from the ground up, and it was equally hard to imagine a successful Salesforce without him.Quickly, there were signs that Microsoft planned to get its act together in the C.R.M. business. As part of a broader shake-up, Mr. Nadella moved Dynamics under Scott Guthrie, one of Microsoft\u2019s most respected engineering leaders. This telegraphed that it intended to go after Salesforce\u2019s business.\u201cThey\u2019re serious in a way they haven\u2019t been before,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, an angel investor in Seattle and a former Microsoft manager who occasionally consults with the company.Salesforce did not sit idle. In November, it hired a former head of Dynamics, Bob Stutz, to oversee its data analytics products.Still, Microsoft and Salesforce had reasons to keep the peace. Mr. Nadella wanted Salesforce to use Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure, called Azure, to run its internet applications. A marquee customer like Salesforce could lend credibility to Azure as Microsoft tried to catch Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure provider.In the months after, Mr. Benioff met privately with Mr. Nadella to talk business. Mr. Benioff discussed using Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens augmented reality headset in a Salesforce presentation; that never panned out. And he again brought up the idea of Microsoft\u2019s acquiring Salesforce, according to several people briefed on the talks.Microsoft seemed less receptive to the idea than before, partly because of Salesforce\u2019s price tag and also because Microsoft had decided to compete more aggressively with its own product, these people said. By last February, the discussions were dead, they said.The conversations became contentious enough to place a strain on the longtime friendship between Mr. Benioff and Mr. Thompson, according to two people with knowledge of the relationship. The two men did not speak for months (although things have since thawed). That\u2019s around the time Mr. Benioff seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by Microsoft \u2014 a well-capitalized competitor, many times the size of Salesforce \u2014 according to people who discussed the issue with him.The most alluring acquisition target for both companies, though, was LinkedIn.The business social networking site has become an indispensable tool for people to advertise their employment histories and professional achievements. LinkedIn\u2019s enormous database of profiles could be coupled more tightly with C.R.M. systems to help sales representatives close deals, both companies believed. LinkedIn\u2019s data could also be used to strengthen Microsoft products such as Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s most lucrative products. And LinkedIn comes with a steady revenue stream.For the next several months, Microsoft and Salesforce privately made competing offers for LinkedIn, each sweetening their bids as the competition increased. Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a board member, wooed Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and chairman, according to the LinkedIn filing. Salesforce code-named its LinkedIn effort Project Burgundy.In mid-June, Microsoft won LinkedIn with a bid of $196 a share, all of it in cash, which provided more certainty for LinkedIn shareholders than the combination of cash and stock that Salesforce was offering. Microsoft has more than $136 billion in cash and short-term investments. Salesforce has less than $1.2 billion.\u201cWe were closer than we realized \u2014 maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it!\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cBut we were definitely over our skis!!!!\u201dAs the prospect of a LinkedIn deal began to dim for Salesforce, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, Burke Norton, sent an email to the board saying the company, as result, could contemplate a number of other acquisition targets, one of which \u2014 Demandware \u2014 it ended up buying. Other possibilities, including Adobe, Box, Tableau and Workday, remain independent, according to a presentation attached to the email, which was published on DCLeaks.com.Mr. Benioff has bought at least 10 companies in all. His most expensive purchase, at $2.8 billion, was Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. One big acquisition, the document software company Quip, took direct aim at Microsoft Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s cash cows.There is, of course, no guarantee that LinkedIn will give Microsoft the edge it seeks in data analytics, machine learning and C.R.M. software. The company has a history of fumbling big acquisitions, including its disastrous acquisition of Nokia, which ended in a $7.6 billion write-off, after which Microsoft backed away from mobile phones.While Salesforce\u2019s acquisitions and war chest are relatively small, the company highlighted in a presentation to analysts this fall that it had acquired Quip in part to land its co-founder, Bret Taylor, a former Facebook and Google executive. Analysts view Mr. Taylor as someone who can weave Salesforce\u2019s pieces into a more competitive company.In the meantime, Mr. Benioff cut a deal in May to use primarily Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, not Microsoft\u2019s. The deal was worth $400 million over four years for Amazon.Microsoft wooed away a big Salesforce customer, HP, in September to use Dynamics.\u201cGiven Microsoft\u2019s history and existing monopolies, it is sometimes necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to intervene to ensure that Microsoft is operating in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\u201d said Mr. Norton, Salesforce\u2019s chief legal officer.It\u2019s not clear if the complaints will be a problem for the deal, which has already been approved in the United States.In response to Salesforce\u2019s complaints, Microsoft has said it will bring more price competition to the market. But neither company is totally estranged from its rival, and they say they must work together. In a statement, Peggy Johnson, an executive vice president at Microsoft, said that \u201cwhile we\u2019ll continue to compete, we look forward to continuing to partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cooking Up Conversation as Martha\u2019s Vineyard Quiets Down", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWEST TISBURY, Mass. \u2014 The November meeting of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Cookbook Club offered saffron-infused gin cocktails, a table of food, a tray of something called \u201cstrong ginger cookies\u201d \u2014 and a few strong opinions.\u201cThis book just didn\u2019t speak to me,\u201d said one member, Zoe Thompson. \u201cI\u2019m more of a utilitarian cookbook user.\u201d Then she added, as if it were a bad thing, \u201cI\u2019m a recipe follower!\u201dThough dutifully warned, nearly all the dozen women in attendance sampled them and agreed that while definitely very gingery, they were by no means unpalatable.If the judgments seemed as carefully chewed over as the cookies, chalk it up to a location and time of year that place a premium on good food and conversation.Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the 100-square-mile island off the southern coast of Massachusetts, is known for its summery charms and presidential vacations. Things slow down considerably after Columbus Day, when many bars and restaurants close until spring and the population plummets to about 15,000 from its summer peak of 115,000.While the remaining residents savor the calm, it can take some resourcefulness to stay active, connected and well fed. Potlucks and book clubs are popular.On an island a 45-minute ferry ride from the mainland, finding certain ingredients can be difficult, especially during winter. When one member pointed out that \u201cNear & Far\u201d suggested building an international food pantry at home, the group laughed.The Times asked 15 American families to talk about the dishes on their Thanksgiving tables that speak best to their heritage and traditions, and to who we are. These are their stories.Ms. Waldman recalled one time when none of the local grocery stores had any dill, and no new supplies were in sight. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Wow, O.K., Martha\u2019s Vineyard is just out of dill right now,\u2019\u201d she said.They meet every six weeks. At the end of the meetings, the group picks a cookbook to explore next. Each member chooses a recipe to make and claims it on a shared Google document. They gather at a member\u2019s house, eat the food, compare notes, then discuss the book. Everyone brings a drink to share (alcoholic or not); a plate, fork and glass; and a cloth napkin to ease the cleanup.Ms. Waldman likes the cohesiveness of a dinner made up of dishes from the same book. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a potluck, where you sometimes feel weird afterward from too much mixing things, like curried chicken and watermelon,\u201d she said. \u201cThis way every dish makes sense.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very much a visual draw,\u201d said Ms. Cecil, who shot the cover photo for the Thanksgiving issue of Bon App\u00e9tit. And for that reason, she enjoyed \u201cNear & Far.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s atmospheric, almost voyeuristic and not at all technical. It\u2019s feminine and emotional.\u201dAfter moving to the Vineyard in 2007, she tried a number of off-season activities, including jewelry making and knitting. But nothing resonated as much as flipping through a beautifully designed book, preparing a dish and sharing it with people who appreciate it.Though a few of Ms. Waldman\u2019s close friends are in the club, she made an effort to include people she didn\u2019t know or who didn\u2019t know one another particularly well. And while a range of ages is represented, from 21 to 60-something, she limited the group to women.\u201cIt\u2019s our version of a girls\u2019 night out,\u201d Ms. Waldman said.Makenzie Brookes graduated from the island\u2019s regional high school, and after nearly 16 years away, she returned to raise a family in 2012. She travels all over the country for the State Department, making sure resettled refugee families get the help they need.At home on the island, she appreciates the conversation that comes with the club. \u201cIn the winter, sometimes I get desperate for talking,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thinking.\u201dSeveral members reached out to Ms. Waldman after seeing posts about the club on Instagram, but Ruby Hoy heard about it from a friend. Ms. Hoy, who grew up on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, works here seasonally as a gardener and spends a few months each winter trekking the globe.Our reporters and editors review new releases from Alton Brown, Diana Henry and more.Ms. Hoy, 27, used local radishes and pea shoots in her soba noodle dish, and said that seasonality is a driving factor in her cooking. \u201cI always start with whatever ingredients I have at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I find a recipe that works.\u201dShe was drawn to the club for the food but was also looking for some interaction.\u201cI\u2019m interested in talking to other women because I\u2019m at the time of my life where I\u2019m questioning everything.\u201d she said. \u201cDo I want to go back to school? Or start my own business? This is an interesting group, with a broad range of ages.\u201dThe club has become so popular that Ms. Waldman decided this fall not to accept new members for the time being. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t run as smoothly when there are too many people,\u201d she said.Angie Francis was witness to a hectic meeting in September that nearly 20 people attended. Meaningful conversation was difficult, she said; she never learned what any of the dishes were, and there wasn\u2019t time for a discussion of the book.Ms. Francis, an architect, felt the proceedings needed a bit more structure. \u201cI want there to be an agenda to the meetings,\u201d she said. \u201cI just really enjoy food, and I want this to be an opportunity to talk about it.\u201dIn response to that kind of feedback, Ms. Waldman now plays moderator, helping to get the conversation started.At the meeting on Nov. 2, at Ms. Cecil\u2019s house near the center of the island, each member described her dish and offered some commentary on the process. \u201cSalted yogurt is my new jam,\u201d said Lindsay Russo, who had her 2-month-old daughter, Fyfe, in tow.Ms. Francis appealed for the sort of book that would challenge cooks. \u201cI have my tried-and-true books at home, the ones I use every day,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think for Cookbook Club, I want the dishes to be a stretch \u2014 things I wouldn\u2019t cook at home.\u201dThere had been some interest in a restaurant cookbook, and several requests for more meat dishes. This book would satisfy both, and Ms. Thompson, baker of the strong ginger cookies, was cautiously optimistic.\u201cI can be a creature of habit,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will be good for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess. Will the losing side believe the results? Will the bulk of Americans recognize the legitimacy of the new president? And will we all be able to clean up the piles of lies, hoaxes and other dung that have been hurled so freely in this hyper-charged, fact-free election?For years, technologists and other utopians have argued that online news would be a boon to democracy. That has not been the case.Why? Because if you study the dynamics of how information moves online today, pretty much everything conspires against truth.The root of the problem with online news is something that initially sounds great: We have a lot more media to choose from.In the last 20 years, the internet has overrun your morning paper and evening newscast with a smorgasbord of information sources, from well-funded online magazines to muckraking fact-checkers to the three guys in your country club whose Facebook group claims proof that Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are really the same person.This dynamic becomes especially problematic in a news landscape of near-infinite choice. Whether navigating Facebook, Google or The New York Times\u2019s smartphone app, you are given ultimate control \u2014 if you see something you don\u2019t like, you can easily tap away to something more pleasing. Then we all share what we found with our like-minded social networks, creating closed-off, shoulder-patting circles online.\u201cThis creates an ecosystem in which the truth value of the information doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Walter Quattrociocchi, one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cAll that matters is whether the information fits in your narrative.\u201dDigital technology has blessed us with better ways to capture and disseminate news. There are cameras and audio recorders everywhere, and as soon as something happens, you can find primary proof of it online.You would think that greater primary documentation would lead to a better cultural agreement about the \u201ctruth.\u201d In fact, the opposite has happened.One of the apparent advantages of online news is persistent fact-checking. Now when someone says something false, journalists can show they\u2019re lying. And if the fact-checking sites do their jobs well, they\u2019re likely to show up in online searches and social networks, providing a ready reference for people who want to correct the record.But that hasn\u2019t quite happened. Today dozens of news outlets routinely fact-check the candidates and much else online, but the endeavor has proved largely ineffective against a tide of fakery.\u201cWhere hoaxes before were shared by your great-aunt who didn\u2019t understand the internet, the misinformation that circulates online is now being reinforced by political campaigns, by political candidates or by amorphous groups of tweeters working around the campaigns,\u201d said Caitlin Dewey, a reporter at The Washington Post who once wrote a column called \u201cWhat Was Fake on the Internet This Week.\u201d\u201cIn many ways the debunking just reinforced the sense of alienation or outrage that people feel about the topic, and ultimately you\u2019ve done more harm than good,\u201d she said.Other fact-checkers are more sanguine, recognizing the limits of exposing online hoaxes, but also standing by the utility of the effort.Yeah. Though soon, I suspect, that boulder is going to squash us all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple\u2019s App Store in recent weeks \u2014 just in time to deceive holiday shoppers.The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard\u2019s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a barrage of fake apps,\u201d said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time.Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless \u2014 essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said.But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information.The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple\u2019s process for reviewing every app before it is published.That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google\u2019s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company\u2019s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers.In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them.With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pok\u00e9mon Company, among others.\u201cIt\u2019s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,\u201d he said.\u201cWe strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. \u201cWe\u2019ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We\u2019ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.\u201dIn September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove \u201capps that no longer function as intended, don\u2019t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.\u201d The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing.Despite Apple\u2019s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple\u2019s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered.\u201cIt\u2019s a game of Whac-a-Mole,\u201d Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said.Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients.\u201cWe hope that our clients are all official sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services.\u201dMr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi \u2014 about $3,000 \u2014 for an app written in English.But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook\u2019s campus in Menlo Park, Calif.In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have \u201ctens of employees\u201d at the Facebook address.China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts.Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, \u201cOur angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday.\u201dData from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. \u201cWould give zero stars if possible,\u201d wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. \u201cConstantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.\u201dMr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands.\u201cThe retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,\u201d he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard\u2019s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps.But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real.The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store \u2014 including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear.Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume.Some of the fake apps have even used Apple\u2019s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store.Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple\u2019s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google\u2019s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said.But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pok\u00e9mon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available.\u201cThe criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,\u201d Mr. Clay said.Emily Feng contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fantastic Beasts\u2019 Is a Hit for Warner Bros.", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling pulled off an exceptionally difficult magic trick over the weekend. Not only did they bring the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film franchise back to life, they also did it without Harry Potter.At the weekend\u2019s start, it was unclear how Harry Potter fans would react to \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d which Ms. Rowling (writing her first screenplay) based on her 2001 creature compendium of the same name \u2014 one of Harry Potter\u2019s textbooks, as the mythology goes. But \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d does not feature any of the same central characters, and it takes place in 1926 New York instead of present-day Britain.\u201cThat speaks volumes about the future of this franchise \u2014 about reaching a new generation of fans,\u201d Sue Kroll, Warner\u2019s president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said by phone on Sunday morning.\u201cWe knew we had a lot to live up to with this movie,\u201d continued Ms. Kroll, fresh off a plane from China, where \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d will roll out in the days ahead. \u201cPeople have enormously warm memories of those earlier Harry Potter movies. So we are very, very happy with the way that audiences responded to this completely fresh and original story. We are now set up beautifully for a very long run.\u201d\u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d couldn\u2019t match the heights of a B-list comic book character?Ms. Rowling\u2019s new wizards and witches also faced inevitable comparisons with the eight Harry Potter movies that Warner released between 2001 and 2011. The lowest opening among those films \u2014 each adapted from a smash-hit novel \u2014 was for \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d which collected about $90 million (after adjusting for inflation) over its first three days in North American theaters.Part of Warner\u2019s goal with \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d was to reposition Ms. Rowling\u2019s wizarding world as a limitless movie universe. Ms. Kroll\u2019s team introduced the first trailer for the new film last December. Five more trailers and featurettes followed. Marketing also included extensive partnerships with Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Google, Amazon and China\u2019s Weibo.It was a delicate line to walk: Warner used snippets of music from the original Harry Potter movies and invoked the boy wizard\u2019s name in certain marketing materials, but was careful not to create overt connections that did not exist in the movie \u2014 something that studios often do with franchise spinoffs, much to the displeasure of fans.Ms. Rowling\u2019s publisher, Scholastic, also expects a \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d bump. The screenplay, for instance, was published in book form on Friday. \u201cAny new story from J. K. Rowling is an event, lifting sales and interest in the backlist books,\u201d Ellie Berger, president of Scholastic Trade, said in a phone interview last week. More than 450 million copies of Ms. Rowling\u2019s books have been sold worldwide.The \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d screenplay, Ms. Berger said, should deliver \u201cstrong, sustained\u201d sales. \u201cWe know there is just tremendous interest,\u201d she added.Three other movies arrived in wide release at domestic theaters over the weekend, and each was trampled.Also bombing was \u201cBleed for This\u201d (Open Road), a boxing drama starring Miles Teller that collected just $2.4 million. Open Road paid a reported $4 million for distribution rights. Faring slightly better was \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen\u201d (STX), a teenage comedic drama starring Hailee Steinfeld and produced by James L. Brooks on a slim budget of $9 million. It arrived to $4.8 million in ticket sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Italian-Asian to Locavore Canadian: Food Adventures in Vancouver", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byChoice TablesIt\u2019s no secret that food is one of the best ways to get the gist of a place, and that especially holds true for Vancouver. Among the most ethnically diverse cities in Canada, if not North America, the city is home to sizable populations whose background is Chinese, Southeast Asian, First Nations, Korean, Indian, Portuguese, English, Irish, German \u2014 again, the list goes on.Vancouver\u2019s cultural tapestry can be as beguiling to the visitor as its location amid mountains, sea and forest, scenery that is not only stunning, but rich, yielding everything from foraged mushrooms and berries to wild salmon and seaweed. Combine those resources with the freewheeling imaginations of chefs drawing on a multicultural palette of cuisines and you have a food adventure on your hands.Early this fall, I visited mainly newer restaurants in the downtown area, where some interesting experimentation is going on. But don\u2019t let that deter you from popping into tiny spots like Damso on Denman Street where you might find, as I did, some of the best rice cakes in chile sauce you\u2019ve ever tasted.Instead, on the second floor of a small building with Chinese flourishes, Vancouver was about to welcome what would become one of the most talked about spots in town: a Japanese-Italian restaurant where ingredients like kombu, miso and katsuo flakes turn up in lasagna, frittelli di melanzane and other Italian dishes.The location, said Kissa Tanto\u2019s chef and co-owner, Joel Watanabe, \u201chit all the right notes. Dark. Upstairs. We wanted it to be an adventure.\u201dAnd it can be an adventure just getting there, but more on that later. First the name. Kissa means cafe (with specific reference here to the traditional jazz cafes of Tokyo), and tanto means \u201ca lot\u201d in Italian; together they denote a \u201chouse of plenty,\u201d Mr. Watanabe said. With its curvy banquettes, blue-green walls, stacks of vinyl records, and midcentury-style lighting, the d\u00e9cor conjures up the voluptuous allure of those jazz cafes in their 1960s heyday.The cuisine, however, is decidedly of this century. As my dining companion and I were seated, a server swept past with what looked like lasagna afloat in a neon green pool. And it was lasagna, but not any I had tasted before. Delicate sheaths of handmade pasta, pork, miso besciamella, mustard greens, chantal mushrooms and a parsley-brightened basil cream sauce melded into something that, like all great creations, felt like a thing of destiny. The autumnal salad, in a yuzu-and-grape dressing, included concord and green grapes, robust greens, shaved melon, radishes and stracciatella cheese. For dessert, yuzu cream was essentially a bowl of thick, sweet, citrusy cream strewn with raspberries, pistachios and olive oil crumble.Note: There\u2019s a wrong way and a right way to get to Kissa Tanto. We went the wrong way, walking down a dicey stretch of East Hastings Street, site of rampant drug activity. The right way, at least at night, is by taxi, car or bus.Kissa Tanto, 263 East Pender Street, kissatanto.com. Dinner for two, about 100 Canadian dollars, or $75 U.S.\u201cIt\u2019s like writer\u2019s block,\u201d the bartender said as she blasted a cinnamon marshmallow with a blowtorch. \u201cYou just want to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before.\u201d She positioned the toasted marshmallow atop a concoction of hickory-smoked rye, Amaro Montenegro and Spirit Fire cherry cedar bitters, and a waiter whisked the drink away.Royal Dinette opened last year to a wave of enthusiastic reviews. Like the offerings at Kissa Tanto, the food exhibits Asian and Italian influences \u2014 a recent menu item, for example, was eggplant tortolloni with miso, mushrooms, brown rice dashi and mustard greens. But the real focus, said Jack Chen, the executive chef, was bringing the \u201clocal, sustainable, no-waste\u201d ethos of his former base, the well-regarded Farmer\u2019s Apprentice restaurant in Kitsilano, \u201cright to the middle of the Financial District.\u201dAnd, apparently, the Financial District is impressed; the place was packed on a Wednesday evening. Our table, near a wall lined with jars of pickled cherry blossoms, green apricots, ramps, radishes and other produce, was within earshot of the open kitchen\u2019s sizzling and chopping. We went from the orange and herbal flavors of smoked Castelvetrano olives to red wine rigatoni (made with reduced red wine, instead of water) with venison, celeriac, blistered grapes, juniper and a touch of coffee. Tender slices of aged duck, strewn with dandelion greens, arrived in a vivid red sauce of beetroots and strawberries, enhanced with Nootka rose honey. Vegetables here are not a dieter\u2019s refuge: Heirloom carrots, hidden beneath a mound of sprouted wheat, were prepared with duck fat and ramp vinegar and sat atop a voluptuous daub of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.Miku\u2019s surroundings aren\u2019t, however, why I came here. I was drawn by the restaurant\u2019s elaborate Japanese menu, with the occasional French or Latin twist. The flame-seared aburi oshi sushi was especially intriguing.When we arrived, the waiting area was filled. We killed time by peering into the busy kitchen where I watched a baker pouring green batter into a shallow pan. What is that? I asked one of the many employees gathered around the reception desk, all trying to project good humor among the throngs of impatient diners. \u201cThat? Oh, that is the opera cake!\u201d A green opera cake?Finally, a half-hour past our reservation, we were seated. The servers and the bartender at the ovoid bar yelled out a Japanese welcome. Beyond the glass doors, the lights of North Vancouver twinkled.And so our meal began: sweet, crunchy pickled squash, zucchini and cauliflower, followed by calamari in a feathery batter. Soba peperoncino, with shrimp, squid and ribbons of sweet pepper and jalape\u00f1o in a chile-garlic sauce, had a real bite to it. Salmon oshi sushi lived up to expectations. A thin layer of pressed local wild salmon atop rectangles of rice had been torched just enough to coax a caramelized flavor from a sweet sauce (I asked a waitress what was in it; \u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she said, sotto voce) that augmented but didn\u2019t overwhelm the pure flavor of the salmon. Wasabi and soy sauce were nowhere in sight.And finally, the green tea opera cake \u2014 an elaborate Japanese take on the French version \u2014 appeared. \u201cIt takes three days to make,\u201d our server said effusively.We beheld the wonder of geometry and color. As the server pointed out the ingredients, her voice grew more animated: green-tea g\u00e9noise, chocolate ganache, matcha cream, azuki cream, hazelnut wafer, gooseberry\u2026\u201cI get so sad when people refuse dessert,\u201d she said, after her presentation. \u201cI just think, oh, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.\u201d And she was right: They don\u2019t.Miku, 70-200 Granville Street, mikurestaurant.com. Our meal for two, with appetizers, dessert and drinks, was 144 dollars. But inside, a party was raging: A garrulous, fashion-forward crowd filled the soaring, two-level space. Some were lounging near a fireplace flickering with candles; others were gathered around tables laden with glasses and small plates. The 7,400-square-foot restaurant, with its arched windows and tiled columns, felt liberating \u2014 attributable not only to the mildly inebriated people, but also to the origami-esque nightingales ascending toward the ceiling.At Nightingale the inspiration is homegrown Canadian with an added emphasis on Italian. Attended to by a young woman who served as a sort of grand dispenser of knowledge (\u201cNo need to Google Yelp on your phone,\u201d she said, as my dining companion, in search of recommendations, was in the midst of doing. \u201cI\u2019ll be your Google.\u201d) We followed her suggestion and ordered a very good Okanagan white wine.Dishes were served as they were prepared, resulting in a traffic jam on our small table. Sockeye salmon ceviche with avocado, watermelon radish and flash-fried quinoa was a pretty, pastel dish, citrusy clean and light. The small pizza, its thin crust appetizingly blistered and charred in the beautiful tile oven we had walked by, offered flashes of decadent saltiness from the slivers of guanciale and green olives. There are some ambitious mains, but we stuck with small dishes: fried chicken served without fanfare alongside a preserved lemon yogurt sauce, and exotically spiced roasted cauliflower beneath sunflower seeds and a bold harissa sauce.For the real Hawksworth artistry, go to the chef\u2019s namesake restaurant, but if you want a glamorous night on the town, with fine cocktails, satisfying \u201csocial\u201d food and a cavernous space filled with carefree people, come here.Nightingale, 1017 West Hastings Street, hawknightingale.com. Our meal for two was about 110 dollars, with wine.Suzanne MacNeille is an editor at the Travel section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Will Stop Some Ads From Targeting Users by Race", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byAs Facebook has grown, so too has its ability to slice and dice the habits of its hundreds of millions of users, and offer them up to advertisers that want to reach specific groups for specific reasons.But while the social network has evolved to the point that it can target audiences as narrow as 18-to-24-year-old men in Connecticut who are in long-distance relationships, it has also created tools that allowed advertisers to discriminate against Americans in ways that were outlawed in the 1960s.Facebook responded on Friday to concern that it was violating anti-discrimination laws, announcing that marketers placing housing, employment or credit ads on the social network would no longer be able to use tools that target people by ethnicity.The decision casts a perhaps unwelcome spotlight on what Facebook calls its \u201cethnic affinity marketing solution,\u201d which is still available for use outside the areas of housing, employment and credit advertising.One of Facebook\u2019s main draws for marketers is how narrowly it lets them target messages to its users. Ads can be sent to people based not only on standard demographics like age, gender and location, but also on a bevy of other factors, like whether they have an anniversary coming, their interest in horseback riding, whether they use Gmail or Hotmail, and the languages they speak. Users can also be excluded from seeing ads based on this data.While much of this information is provided voluntarily by users, ethnic affinity is one demographic offered to marketers that users cannot choose, but it is instead assigned based on their interests and activities on Facebook. That includes page likes, group memberships and friendships, the company said. You can list your religious views and languages on your Facebook profile, but you cannot self-identify as, say, Asian-American.On Facebook\u2019s ad-buying website, however, advertisers can choose to include or exclude certain demographic \u201caffinities\u201d from ads in the United States. For instance, they can exclude African-American, Asian-American and four \u201ctypes\u201d of Hispanic \u2014 bilingual, English-dominant, Spanish-dominant or all of the above. Facebook lists the number of people who match those affinities within its ads tool.For example, if an advertiser wants to reach Americans ages 18 and up on Facebook, the company indicates that there are 26 million people with the \u201cethnic affinity\u201d of African-American. The company confirmed that because the assignment is based on activity, a white person could be targeted as African-American and vice versa.ProPublica, for its article last month, bought an ad targeting Facebook users who were house hunting, and excluded people with an \u201caffinity\u201d for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people. The publication showed the ad to a civil rights lawyer, who called it a \u201cblatant\u201d violation of the Fair Housing Act.On Friday, Facebook declined to disclose the number of housing, credit and employment ads placed using ethnic affinity targeting. The company brought in roughly $18 billion in revenue last year, almost all of it from advertising.In her blog post, Ms. Egan wrote that this type of targeting \u201cgives brands a way to reach multicultural audiences with more relevant advertising.\u201d In addition to tools that will disable ethnic affinity marketing for housing, employment or credit ads, Facebook will \u201crequire advertisers to affirm that they will not engage in discriminatory advertising\u201d on the site and offer them information so they \u201cunderstand their obligations with respect to housing, employment and credit.\u201dAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York State attorney general, said its civil rights bureau \u201cinquired about Facebook\u2019s practices and, while we are still reviewing them, we are pleased to see this positive step by the company.\u201dYvette D. Clarke, one of the members of Congress who called on Facebook to change its ad policy, commended the decision and took the opportunity to rap Silicon Valley\u2019s knuckles for its lack of racial and gender diversity.\u201cTo avoid these problems in the future, I urge Facebook and other technology companies to address the lack of diversity in the ranks of their leadership and staff by recruiting and retaining people of color and women,\u201d Ms. Clarke said in a statement.This is hardly the first time Facebook has received intense scrutiny over its ad-targeting practices. In 2013, Facebook paid $20 million to settle a class-action lawsuit against the company for sharing data with advertisers about users\u2019 \u201clikes\u201d without asking permission. The same year, a lawsuit accused the company of scanning users\u2019 private messages on the network and using the information for advertising purposes. In September of this year, a federal judge in California ruled against a bid to certify the case as a class-action lawsuit.The changes to Facebook\u2019s ethnic marketing tool will very likely deal a difficult blow to the company\u2019s longstanding boasts about its superior ad-targeting capabilities, especially in the face of competitors like Google, Twitter and Snapchat. Shares of Facebook closed down 1.5 percent on Friday.Advertisement"}

Such brinkmanship will serve the acquirer well. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are ahead of Oracle in developing cloud-based services and infrastructure for clients.

Again.", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byBitsIt has been said before but it bears repeating: Twitter\u2019s biggest problem is Twitter.When the social media site was created, its founders thought it could be the water cooler or town hall for the world. It was a nice thought. What they probably never anticipated was that Twitter would become a meeting place for all sorts of people you would never want to meet at the water cooler.Even in its early days, tech writers used Twitter to call one another out about their coverage \u2014 who got what story first and why they got it all wrong. Was it juvenile? Of course. But it was usually harmless.What happens on Twitter today, critics would argue, isn\u2019t so harmless. From racist trolls to terrorist recruiting to gaslighting \u2014 today\u2019s popular way to describe lying so often that people can\u2019t quite tell the truth anymore \u2014 Twitter has some serious issues.That both companies are taking a hard look at how their services are being misused shined a harsh light on Facebook, where Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, dismissed the company\u2019s problem with fake news posts, despite the reported misgivings of some of his own employees. But by late Monday night, Facebook did add language to the guidelines of its ad network spelling out that fake news sites were barred from the ad network. To be clear, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll disappear from Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg must run in different Facebook circles than the rest of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Price We Pay for an Ad-Powered Internet", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.We don\u2019t usually think of Timothy Leary as a consumer advocate, but in his zealous promotion of LSD, the iconoclastic 1960s psychologist was searching for what today we would call an ad blocker \u2014 though his tiny tabs relied more on messing with our sensory receptors than dropping code on our mobile phones.In his new book \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d Tim Wu reminds us that Leary pushed acid in the pursuit of \u201ca complete attentional revolution\u201d in which his followers would reject the growing external stimuli of commercial media in favor of an inward, spiritual journey.It\u2019s more than a bit ironic, then, that Leary felt compelled to resort to a classic marketing trick, the jingle, to press his case. His \u201cTurn on, tune in, drop out\u201d was so catchy that, though failing to smash the attention economy, it was ultimately complicit in contributing to it, showing up in a campaign for Squirt, a grapefruit-flavored soda: \u201cTurn on to flavor, tune in to sparkle, and drop out of the cola rut.\u201dThis gets at the heart of the compelling thesis of \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d namely that the age of mass media and mass marketing is characterized by an arms race between those who seek to capture the valuable commodity of our attention and capitalize on it for gain and those who resist this harvesting of time either through drugs; regulation; or most effectively, collective boredom, distraction and indifference. Wu\u2019s argument is that each boom in commercial media in some way went too far and provoked an either minor or major revolt, pushing the advertising industry to adopt more sophisticated or extreme methods to monetize our time.Drawing a line from the snake oil salesmen of the early 20th century, through the birth, rise and decline of broadcast to the \u201cattention plantation\u201d of Facebook, Wu\u2019s history also illustrates the cyclical resistance movements against advertising. First came the unscrupulous false advertising, then the corrective of investigative journalism; first the tidal bore of broadcast television, then the corrective of the remote control; first the era of spam, then the development of filters and blockers.The book is studded with sharp illustrations of those who have tried to stop the encroachment of advertising on our lives, and usually failed. In the 1930s, for example, Rexford Tugwell, an economist and member of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, sought to introduce far stricter legislation on drug advertising, which would have barred pharmaceutical and cigarette industries from making false claims about their products. The pressure brought by manufacturers on broadcasters to resist the proposed legislation saw both Tugwell\u2019s recommendations watered down and Tugwell himself smeared as a Communist. Newspapers and radio barely covered the controversy, in part, Wu writes, as a response to pressure from advertisers.This struggle has only become more relevant today. Many media companies, including The New York Times, are now almost entirely dependent on the ability to build and sustain a business model that captures people\u2019s time and resells it to advertisers, or provides something so valuable to individuals that they will pay for the journalism, programming or experience they receive. If you walk the floor of a modern newsroom, you will most likely see journalists staring at real-time charts flickering with numbers, and dials telling editors where readers are spending every second of their time. If you have got this far in the review, then I and Tim Wu are doing well \u2014 around 55\u202fpercent of readers, on average, will have stopped after 15 seconds.There is little sign of this trend slowing, only accelerating. Facebook and Google represent the largest and most successful advertising-funded businesses in history. They are busy developing technologies that track not only our attention but also every aspect of our online behavior and, in Facebook\u2019s case, synthesizing it with what is known as our \u201csocial graph.\u201d That graph is the circle of colleagues, acquaintances, families and friends we connect with online and determines as a result what type of advertising and even what type of news or other content we see. We are largely unaware of how the hidden tracking technologies operate and are complicit in how much we surrender.From his historical perspective, Wu can see that often a moment such as this one, in which our eyeballs are so thoroughly monopolized, is followed by resistance. But his concern is that we have not individually or collectively paid enough attention to the commercialization of every part of our lives: \u201cOur society has been woefully negligent about what in other contexts we would call the rules of zoning, the regulation of commercial activity where we live, figuratively and literally. It is a question that goes to the heart of how we value what used to be called our private lives.\u201dClearly not a fan of the selfie stick or the culture of \u201cmicrofame,\u201d Wu sees a tendency to self-aggrandize online, turning us all into miniature attention merchants. As the man who coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and a skilled thinker about the importance of an open web, Wu is nevertheless largely disappointed about where the internet has taken us. In a chapter titled \u201cThe Web Hits Bottom\u201d he describes in some detail the business model of the new-media company BuzzFeed and the quest for \u201cvirality.\u201d Wu is steadfastly skeptical, seeing \u201clittle to admire\u201d online. Though he briefly describes \u201cbright spots\u201d like Wikipedia and Reddit and name-checks online legacy media that he grudgingly admits have improved their offerings, he sees them as being \u201cengulfed by the vast areas of darkness, the lands of the cajoling listicles and the celebrity nonstories, engineered for no purpose but to keep a public mindlessly clicking and sharing away.\u201dWhat his thesis doesn\u2019t allow for is the possibility that despite his skepticism, we may have become rather deft in developing our own spam filters and that while the \u201copen web\u201d has in fact delivered a lot of cats falling over, it has also given us access to more knowledge than ever before and more engaging forms of information. It has done this in part because of the possibility of advertising revenue, not despite it. As for his dismissiveness about our \u201cselfie\u201d culture, he never considers the opportunities that the internet has opened up for women, minorities and those outside the mainstream media\u2019s boundaries of acceptability to take control of their own image.For Someone uniquely skilled at advocating a stronger regulatory climate, Wu\u2019s ultimate point is surprisingly low-tech: \u201cIf we desire a future that avoids the enslavement of the propaganda state as well as the narcosis of the consumer and celebrity culture, we must first acknowledge the preciousness of our attention and resolve not to part with it as cheaply or unthinkingly as we so often have.\u201d It might be an idealistic aspiration, but it is a timely one.What Wu achieved with his first book, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d was to demystify the recent history of the ownership and governance of our communications systems, from telecom companies to the web, while identifying how open systems over time became compromised and closed. In \u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d he applies the same thesis of a business cycle to explain the development of the advertising market and the ways in which it has adapted to avoid our natural inclination to ignore it. Despite the book\u2019s occasional finger-wagging, Wu dramatizes this push and pull to great effect.When Vance Packard wrote \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders,\u201d the revelatory 1957 book about advertising\u2019s hidden psychological manipulations, he did so just as the mass media stood at a turning point. He did not stop the march of commercial television, but he provided a powerful critical framework through which to think about it. Wu has written a \u201cHidden Persuaders\u201d for the 21st century, just as we stand squarely on the threshold of a post-broadcast world where the algorithmic nano-targeting of electronic media knows our desires and impulses before we know them ourselves.Emily Bell is the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Gmail Rival Sent to Siberia by a Mysterious Google Glitch", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerCertain institutions in the world are so powerful and popular that we are just lucky that they are a force for good. Like Oprah. If she decided one day that she would like to try out villainy, we would all be in a lot of trouble.Then there\u2019s Google. It\u2019s a company that many consumers rely on and love. It is also a company that has an immense impact on online commerce, in the United States as well as in many other countries where its search engine dominates. Show up high in a Google search and business is good. Vanish and business dries up.Given that Google offers products that sometimes compete with those of other companies \u2014 internet browsers and online shopping services, to name just two \u2014 there is the risk that the mysterious algorithm that determines search results will favor the company that created and controls that algorithm. That\u2019s why European regulators have charged Google with antitrust violations.But these charges tend to focus on a kind of general harm to the market, often expressed as an anxiety that competition could be stifled. Examples of specific companies that have been harmed by Google, in a material way, are rare. But in this episode, we meet a company that thinks it might fit that description.Q. The email service that I use, ProtonMail, recently wrote a blog post on its company site about how Google nearly put it out of business. You\u2019ve written about Google before, and I thought you might be interested.Is this an example of the search giant exploiting its market power?In October 2015, though, the company was turning up many pages deep into a search, which is tantamount to disappearing. ProtonMail consulted search engine optimization experts and none could explain why. If a company tries to snooker Google with what are known as \u201cblack hat\u201d search tricks, Google will sometimes retaliate. ProtonMail says it was staying on the right side of Google\u2019s many rules.The company was still doing well on other search engines, like Bing and Yahoo.The company tried twice to contact Google, without success. It wrote to a regional Google president in charge of strategic relationships. Nothing. In August, the company privately contacted Matt Cutts, then the head of Google\u2019s web spam team, on Twitter.\u201cWe know Google is intentionally hiding ProtonMail from search results,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cInterested in talking before our data goes public?\u201dMr. Cutts wrote back the same day, sounding responsive. A few days passed. ProtonMail nudged on Aug. 9, and by Aug. 11 ProtonMail tweeted to Mr. Cutts that \u201cthe problem seems to be mostly fixed now.\u201dCurrently, ProtonMail is ranked No. 1 in searches for both \u201cencrypted email\u201d and \u201csecure email.\u201dBut the damage incurred during ProtonMail\u2019s months in the internet\u2019s version of timeout was huge. \u201cGoogle directly caused ProtonMail\u2019s growth rate worldwide to be reduced by 25 percent for over 10 months,\u201d the company wrote in its blog post. The company went from covering its monthly expenses to drawing on its emergency reserve fund.So what caused this near-death experience? The closest that Google ever came to an explanation was to write that it \u201cfixed something,\u201d according to Andy Yen, a ProtonMail co-founder. That\u2019s pretty vague.The Haggler wrote to Google seeking illumination. A few days later, a company spokeswoman, Kara Berman, responded:\u201cWhile we understand that situations like this may raise questions, we typically don\u2019t comment on how specific algorithms impact specific websites. We\u2019re continually refining these algorithms and appreciate hearing from users and webmasters. While in many cases search ranking changes reflect algorithmic criteria working as intended, in some cases we\u2019re able to identify unique features that lead to varied results. We\u2019re sorry that it took so look to connect in this case and are glad the issue is resolved.\u201dWhen asked why he had not tried that route, Mr. Yen responded that friends in the S.E.O. world said the chances of getting a response via that channel were not good.It seems highly unlikely to the Haggler that Google set out to sabotage ProtonMail. But this episode is a reminder of a conflict of interest at Google\u2019s core. It is like a football team that gets to write the rules, own all the equipment and control the referees.No opposing franchise in its right mind would compete on those terms, but Google\u2019s popularity and its singular role in online commerce mean that rivals don\u2019t have a choice. They just have to hope that Google can resist the never-ending temptation to place profits over fairness. And that whenever the company needs to \u201cfix something,\u201d it does so lickety-split.Advertisement"}

Necessary business-model experimentation, however, works best away from the public markets.The primary reason for the merger\u2019s collapse is instructive. Banks pulled their financing commitments after Gannett turned in weaker results than expected. Investors, too, see little promise in these embattled newspaper empires. Media companies like Gannett, Tronc, The New York Times Company, News Corporation and Lee Enterprises all trade at less than seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.There\u2019s little in the way of good news. Magna, a research firm, forecasts that newspaper advertising revenue in the United States will fall 11 percent from a year ago, to about $13 billion. That\u2019s 20 percent of the sum generated back before internet companies like Craigslist and Alphabet\u2019s Google started devouring market share.Getting readers to buy online subscriptions is helping, but not enough. The Wall Street Journal, one of the strongest in digital publishing, is offering a fresh round of newsroom buyouts and considering closing sections of the paper after falling behind budget by 30 percent, according to a report in Politico.Success will require even more radical ideas. That could mean embracing some combination of what Buzzfeed and Business Insider have made work so far: combining populist headlines, slide shows, video clips, aggregated news stories and serious-minded original journalism.Since acquiring The Washington Post three years ago for $250 million and pulling its finances out of the public eye, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has done something similar in a bid to expand paying readership across the world. Many American newspapers would benefit from a steward willing to sacrifice short-term profit for a longer-term vision.That would herald a return to a bygone era where families like the Chandlers and Bancrofts owned America\u2019s periodicals. It might invite the sort of unseemly situation occurring with the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who bought The Las Vegas Review-Journal.At this point, however, it\u2019s a chance that many ailing publications probably need to take.Advertisement"}

Under this vision, everything from home security systems to refrigerators will be connected to the internet, gathering data and controllable at the touch of a smartphone icon.With cars likely to get more screens and more computers, the purchase gives Samsung a stake in what could be an industrywide boom. It also could provide insight for the company\u2019s varied components businesses. Samsung can learn firsthand from Harman what it needs to do to sell its screens, chips and memory to carmakers.Samsung\u2019s $112-a-share offer for Harman represents a 28 percent premium from where its shares traded on Friday, but that is still well below the roughly $145 that each Harman share was fetching early last year. Harman\u2019s results from its professional solutions business \u2014 which makes sound and lighting for concerts and other events \u2014 have weakened. The company has said it will work to bring the operations back to their previous strength.Samsung has largely benefited from the new mobile world, as growing demand for smartphones bolstered sales of its displays and microchips. But the company has faced difficulties selling its own branded phones, including a drop in market share, as Apple captured more of the high end and a new generation of low-cost Chinese manufacturers increased pressure on the bottom.The deal for Harman is a rare one for Samsung, which keeps tight control of its supply chain \u2014 often owning its suppliers outright \u2014 and has mostly eschewed big deals to fill in holes in its portfolio.Samsung said that it would also have access to Harman\u2019s designers and engineers, which would allow for more collaboration. It did not give details on what sorts of services they would aim to build together.It said that Dinesh Paliwal, Harman\u2019s chairman and chief executive, would continue to run the operation, and that it would keep the company\u2019s facilities.The deal is expected to close in mid-2017.

Of another whom they perceived as \u201cmanly,\u201d they wrote: \u201cNot much needs to be said on this one, folks.\u201dThis was not a presidential candidate caught in an unguarded moment. This was the men\u2019s soccer team at Harvard, one of the most prestigious and privileged universities in the world, writing about counterparts on the women\u2019s soccer team.The swift penalty came just as Harvard was preparing to welcome hundreds of visitors to campus on Friday for the start of parents\u2019 weekend \u2014 and ascampuses have been consumed by questions involving sexual assault and attitudes toward women. The \u201cscouting report\u201d seems like just more evidence that sexism remains pervasive on college campuses, despite efforts by Harvard and others to combat it. It was also reminiscent of Donald J. Trump\u2019s remarks that he was engaging in \u201clocker room\u201d chatter when he boasted of sexual contact with women against their will.\u201cI think Donald Trump is so extreme that we like to believe that these extreme incidents of sexism and discrimination are, like, isolated to him,\u201d Marty Berger, a sophomore, said as he left an exam on a spectacular fall afternoon, yellow leaves crunching underfoot.\u201cBut it\u2019s important to recognize that they\u2019re just as rampant in our generation, on our campus,\u201d he said.Joyce Fung, also a sophomore, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s less that he\u2019s an exception,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump, \u201cbut more just an extension of everybody.\u201dDanielle Foltz, an undergraduate walking through Harvard Yard, said the conduct didn\u2019t bother her as much as the culture that permitted it.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where I feel like it should bother me, but because it\u2019s so common, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know if I was one of the girls they talked about, it would 100 percent bother me.\u201dAriel Shpigel, 24, a student at Harvard Law School, said that at this point, she almost expected this sort of behavior. \u201cI feel like it happens everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s like, oh if people are smart they\u2019re not going to do things that are sexist and stupid.\u201d\u201cTo Harvard\u2019s credit,\u201d Mr. Berger said, \u201cit is taking positive and affirmative steps to try to combat that discrimination and to combat that kind of locker room talk.\u201dMary C. Waters, the chairwoman of Harvard\u2019s sociology department, who has taught a course on sports and society for many years, said that many college campuses have what might be called a \u201crape culture,\u201d which she has discussed with her students. She said her male students have often said that they would never let their sisters go to some of the parties they attend, but that they did not extend that protective feeling to all women.\u201cEven at a college with very smart and generally very politically progressive students, you can still have this kind of really unexamined male entitlement,\u201d Dr. Waters said.\u201cThey are not bad people, they\u2019re young men and they\u2019re hyping themselves up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t show their vulnerabilities to each other. And when they\u2019re together, they\u2019re trying to be tough and show how strong they are, and part of that is still tied to ideas \u2014 that are troubling to me at least \u2014 about men and sexual dominance over women.\u201dShe said Harvard was taking multiple steps \u201cto show that this kind of behavior is not O.K., but the reality is it\u2019s very pervasive.\u201dSome younger students seemed a bit more disturbed than some of the older ones.\u201cI guess coming in as a freshman, it does surprise me,\u201d said Katie Wang, 18. \u201cI\u2019m not really completely adjusted to the whole culture. Maybe if I was older, I\u2019d know that, oh, you know, that is how it is. But I did think that coming from a university like Harvard, I guess, I\u2019d think that there would be a different standard.\u201dBilal Hussain, 19, said this was a rude awakening for his freshman year. \u201cThey got admitted into Harvard,\u201d he said, adding that he was surprised they had been so vulgar and that he approved of the punishment.Sandra Ojeaburu, also a freshman, was grappling with many facets of what she called the \u201cscandal.\u201d\u201cI think locker room talk is seen as O.K., just because it\u2019s a form of camaraderie and bonding between men,\u201d she said.

And it means that\u2019s harder to change and to break, because it will continue.\u201d\u201cThe sad reality is that we have come to expect this kind of behavior from so many men,\u201d they wrote. The women said they were embarrassed, disgusted and hurt \u2014 pained chiefly because so many of these men they thought were their friends had so degraded them.But, they concluded, they hoped the episode would \u201clead to productive conversation and action on Harvard\u2019s campus, within collegiate athletic teams across the country, and into the locker room that is our world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snapchat\u2019s Parent Files for a Stock Offering", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017: that of Snapchat, the popular messaging service.The social network\u2019s parent, Snap Inc., has filed confidentially to go public, with an eye toward being valued at more than $30 billion, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday. That would make Snap the third-most-valuable technology company at the time of its market debut, after Alibaba and Facebook.The company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as March, though the final timing for an offering has not been determined.The confidential filing, made with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the presidential election last week, comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings. There have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than $50 million in the United States so far this year, down 41 percent from 2015, according to data from Renaissance Capital.A Snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like Google\u2019s in 2004. Still, like Google, Facebook and other tech companies, Snap\u2019s recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives, including its co-founder Evan Spiegel, to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded.Yet Snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors, as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging service\u2019s signature features. In August, Facebook\u2019s Instagram rolled out its version of the Snapchat Stories photo and video service.Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011, Snapchat has become a darling of the tech world, as it has grown from a simple disappearing-messages service into a digital video phenomenon. Its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generation\u2019s equivalent to television.It has built up its popular Stories service, in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers. And it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses, which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs, silly faces \u2014 or Taco Bell tacos, paid for by sponsors.Such has been the popularity of Snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service. Even the White House has set up a Snapchat account, and President Obama has given an interview on the company\u2019s in-house political show.Analysts have estimated that Snap, which began its advertising business less than two years ago, could reach $1 billion in sales next year, up from more than $350 million this year.Snap\u2019s financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed \u2014 if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares.Unlike some private companies, Snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets, so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware.This sets Snap apart from offerings from Square and Box. Both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders.

{"Headline": "Russia Prepares to Block LinkedIn After Court Ruling", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byLinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft, is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that it had breached the country\u2019s data protection rules, a sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating in the country.The case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government\u2019s hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election.Russia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes. The case began in August, before Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal.The country\u2019s push to gain greater control over its internet users is one of a number of attempts by governments worldwide to dictate how people use digital services.From China\u2019s blocking of whole swaths of the internet to Europe\u2019s efforts to regulate what can and cannot be viewed online, different regions and countries are in a battle with companies and other governments to decide how the internet will expand.Officials said the rules were aimed at protecting people\u2019s online privacy from hackers, but critics have claimed the legislation could allow Russian authorities to force companies \u2014 both local and international \u2014 to hand over sensitive information about their users.Many of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech companies, like Facebook and Twitter, also do not store data locally within Russia, but Roskomnadzor, the country\u2019s telecommunications watchdog, targeted LinkedIn for its failure to comply with the new data rules.It was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted in particular, rather than any other major social networking site. Analysts have suggested that the Russian authorities focused on the company, an also-ran in the country\u2019s social networking market, as a warning to larger tech companies.The Moscow court decision, upholding a previous ruling against LinkedIn, means the company will now be blocked from operating across the country.The ban could take effect as early as Monday, with internet service providers in Russia blocking access to LinkedIn\u2019s web address. The company, which has fewer than five million Russian users among its 467 million global users, could still appeal the court\u2019s decision.\u201cThe Russian court\u2019s decision has the potential to deny access to LinkedIn for the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,\u201d Anoek Eckhardt, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request.\u201dA number of other American tech companies like Facebook and Twitter have made efforts to expand their footprints within the country, though they have had to balance people\u2019s use of these social networks with the government\u2019s often heavy-handed efforts to gain control of digital information.Despite criticism of Russia\u2019s data protection rules, other countries, including Germany, have passed similar legislation that forces tech companies to store people\u2019s digital information on local servers.The efforts have been aimed at safeguarding individuals\u2019 personal data, though companies have been quick to voice their skepticism over such practices.In Russia, companies like Google have also faced other challenges from local incumbents like Yandex, the country\u2019s largest search engine, which have often outmuscled international rivals in their home market.Andrew E.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Files Lawsuit Against Sinking Millennium Tower", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Five years ago, when Frank Jernigan, a retired Google software engineer, and his husband bought a 50th-floor apartment in downtown San Francisco for $4 million, they felt on top of the world. And judging by the commanding view of San Francisco Bay from the plate glass windows of their living room, they were.\u201cWe were feeling pretty good about our investment here,\u201d Mr. Jernigan said, looking out at the view from his home on Thursday afternoon.But their 58-story luxury condominium building, the Millennium Tower, which has sunk 16 inches into the soft soils of reclaimed land and is tilting, is now derided as the leaning tower of San Francisco. A dispute over the building\u2019s construction is fast shaping into a huge legal battle involving the developer, the city and owners, and one with stakes befitting Silicon Valley.San Francisco\u2019s city attorney, Dennis Herrera, announced on Thursday that he was filing a lawsuit against the developer of the building for failing to inform buyers that it was sinking \u201cmuch faster than expected.\u201d The developer, Mission Street Development, reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in sales from the more than 400 units in the building, which was completed in 2008.\u201cThey went ahead and sold condominiums for a handsome profit without telling the buyers about the situation,\u201d Mr. Herrera said. \u201cThis is every homeowner\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201dEngineers have questioned the wisdom of building skyscrapers with foundations in mud and clay. A skyscraper being constructed next door has made it clear that its foundation, unlike the Millennium Tower, reaches down to bedrock.P. J. Johnston, a spokesman for the developer, said the allegations by the city attorney had \u201cno merit.\u201dThe building had sunk within \u201cpredicted, safe ranges\u201d during the entire sales process, Mr. Johnston said.He blamed the city\u2019s construction of a neighboring railway station for the building\u2019s sinking. By removing water from the ground, the city agency, the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, had caused the building to \u201csettle beyond the 12 inches it was predicted to settle,\u201d he said.\u201cThe city attorney\u2019s action today has nothing to do with protecting public safety, the building, or its residents,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s an effort by the City of San Francisco to duck its responsibilities and avoid paying for the harm caused by T.J.P.A.,\u201d he said referring to the government agency.A member of the city\u2019s board of supervisors, Aaron Peskin, has quizzed city officials over why the building was approved for occupancy; engineers have bored into the sidewalk in front of the building to measure how much the Millennium Tower is sinking.Patrick Shires, an engineer hired by the building\u2019s homeowners association and the developer, held a news conference in September that seemed intended to reassure the public. Instead, he faced questions about his estimates that the building could sink up to 31 inches, which engineers say could put extreme strain on the building.Mr. Peskin has also questioned whether the developer is playing down the severity of the problem. At a meeting in City Hall last week, Mr. Peskin read from a draft report prepared by Ronald Hamburger, a structural engineer hired by the developer to assess the building. The report concluded that parts of the tower, including the foundation, \u201chad experienced significant stresses as a result of the settlement.\u201d That observation was deleted in the final draft of the report.\u201cAll of that language has been removed,\u201d Mr. Peskin said.Mr. Jernigan and his husband, Andrew Faulk, a physician, said they first found out the building was sinking and tilting when the homeowners\u2019 association summoned owners to meeting in May \u2014 five years after they bought their apartment.In a demonstration of what he said was the building\u2019s tilt, Mr. Jernigan, rolled a marble across his kitchen floor and it rolled back to him.\u201cWe feel cheated \u2014 and shocked,\u201d Mr. Jernigan said.Mr. Herrera said it was too early to say whether apartment owners might receive compensation. \u201cWe are going to see where this goes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at the early stages of the litigation.\u201dMr. Jernigan, 71, and Dr. Faulk, 62, had hoped the apartment would be an ideal location for an active retirement. Dr. Faulk spent his career tending to H.I.V. patients before drugs were available to mitigate the symptoms.Most of their wealth comes from the windfall Mr. Jernigan received by joining Google in 2001, when the company had only around 200 employees.Residents in the building can order room service from a trendy French restaurant on the ground floor. \u201cIt\u2019s like living in a really nice hotel,\u201d Dr. Faulk said.Despite their material comforts and their wealth, Dr. Faulk says he wonders how they can prevail in the dispute with the developer.\u201cOften in America it seems like the individual with the most money wins,\u201d Dr. Faulk said. \u201cAnd we are up against a huge corporation with massive holdings.\u201d\u201cWe are the little guy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Udacity, an Online Learning Start-Up, Offers Tech Job Trials", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byUdacity, an online learning start-up founded by a pioneer of self-driving cars, is finally taking the wraps off a job trial program it has worked on for the last year with 80 small companies.The program, called Blitz, provides what is essentially a brief contract assignment, much like an internship. Employers tell Udacity the skills they need, and Udacity suggests a single candidate or a few. For the contract assignment, which usually lasts about three months, Udacity takes a fee worth 10 to 20 percent of the worker\u2019s salary. If the person is then hired, Udacity does not collect any other fees, such as a finder\u2019s fee.For small start-ups, a hiring decision that goes bad can be a time-consuming, costly distraction. \u201cThis lets companies ease their way into hiring without the hurdle of making a commitment upfront,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, co-founder and chairman of Udacity.Half a million tech jobs went unfilled last year. By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs in America, and only 400,000 computer science graduates to fill them, according to government statistics and think-tank projections.The Blitz initiative and Udacity\u2019s evolution point to the role that nontraditional education organizations might play in addressing the needs of workers and employers in the fast-changing labor market for technology skills.Mr. Thrun, a former Stanford professor and Google engineer who led the company\u2019s effort in self-driving cars, said he was also trying to nudge the tech industry\u2019s hiring beyond its elite-college bias.\u201cFor every Stanford graduate, there are hundreds of people without that kind of pedigree who can do just as well,\u201d he said.Udacity now has 13 job-targeted courses for what it calls nanodegrees, including some to train web developers, data analysts, machine-learning engineers and Android programmers. Three courses have just been added to cater to hot fields: artificial intelligence, virtual reality and self-driving cars.The nanodegree courses typically cost $200 a month and take three to six months to complete. They are rigorous and come with an unusual payment plan: If you complete a nanodegree course, you get half your money back. Completion rates range from 12 percent to 25 percent.Acquiring skills is one thing, but landing a job is another. Since Udacity\u2019s nanodegree courses began two years ago, more than 900 graduates have obtained jobs, including more than 20 workers at Google.Miraj Hassanpur, a computer science major at California State University, Sacramento, wanted to be a developer who worked with the Android operating system after he graduated in 2014. \u201cBut it was hard to break in,\u201d he said.Mr. Hassanpur, 25, got a job at Accenture, the professional services company, where he worked for a year doing programming in the Java computer language for a government client. But he wanted to focus on Android, so he went to Udacity for the Android nanodegree. The degree was created by engineers at Google, where Android was largely developed.Mr. Hassanpur began his Blitz trial at a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., in early 2016 and was hired in April. His compensation \u2014 salary and stock \u2014 is \u201cdefinitely better\u201d than what he made at Accenture, he said.The 22-person start-up is still under wraps and will not even reveal its name. It is working on artificial intelligence technology meant for consumers.Hendrik Dahlkamp, a founder and the chief technology officer of this mystery company, called the Udacity program \u201ca very low-risk way of hiring someone. You\u2019re not stuck with the person\u201d if it doesn\u2019t work out.If someone has made it through a Udacity course, he said, it is a sign that person is a self-starter.James Peterson, 22, has a high school diploma and completed one year of community college. He has had minimum-wage jobs at McDonald\u2019s and Vince\u2019s Spaghetti Express, a fast-food pasta restaurant in Temecula, Calif.Mr. Peterson started with a couple of the free courses at Udacity, and then paid for a nanodegree course in web development that he began in August 2015. It took him five months to complete, and $500 of his $1,000 investment was refunded.He trimmed his hours at the restaurant and spent up to 70 hours a week on the Udacity course. \u201cIt was pretty difficult because I had no prior experience,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cAll of my free time was on the course.\u201dWithin weeks of finishing, Mr. Peterson landed a job at Einstein Industries, where he works on websites for physicians. He makes three times what he did before, and this week moved out of his father\u2019s house and into an apartment in San Diego, near his new job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Former Home to Borders Books, a Tech Hub Now Sprouts", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 A patch of sidewalk on the south side of East Liberty Street, four blocks from the main University of Michigan campus, has returned from the dead with remarkable speed.At almost any hour of day, and especially at mealtimes, a mix of bargain-seeking undergraduates, white-collar tech workers and middle-class townies weave in and out of the restaurants, coffee shop and bank that now line the corridor.The foot traffic is almost enough to make many in this city feel lucky that the single previous occupant of this red brick low-rise building on the 600 block went bankrupt five years ago. Almost, that is, because that previous tenant was the flagship Borders store.\u201cIn some ways, the neighborhood is stronger and more interesting and more vibrant than it was when Borders was here,\u201d said Susan Pollay, executive director of the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority. \u201cAs much as I loved Borders \u2014 and I mean, I loved it \u2014 in the evolution of this building, it\u2019s better than it was.\u201dSuch talk is probably still sacrilege for some local nostalgics, who remember that the store was started by a pair of brothers and Michigan graduates before it turned into an international book chain, but it is difficult to argue on a dollars-and-cents basis with the transformation.For more than 70 years, the site in this pivotal city block was occupied by a single-business anchor, first a regional department store, Jacobson\u2019s, and then, for decades, Borders.There were many ideas about how to use all that space, but one option was immediately taken off the table: installing another anchor tenant.\u201cWe wanted, on purpose, to have a multipurpose building,\u201d said Ron Hughes of Hughes Properties. \u201cI think it\u2019s better for the city as well.\u201dIn early 2012, Hughes Properties acquired the long-term lease rights to the bookstore building that fronts Liberty Street and engaged the commercial broker Jim Chaconas of Colliers International to populate it.Today, commercial office space inventory in Ann Arbor is at a low. Google\u2019s decision to leave a high-rise three blocks from the former Borders and move its 400-person, four-floor customer service operations to a suburban office park by next year is seen as an opportunity, rather than worrisome.Ms. Pollay, in fact, does not mind that shift because Google employees do not fan out in the neighborhood for meals, as they have on-site food service. \u201cThey hermetically seal themselves off,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully the next tenants there won\u2019t.\u201dEven before Mr. Hughes and Mr. Chaconas began deciding the fate of the main Borders building, the three-story former corporate office building was fully leased by Barracuda Networks.Barracuda, a computer storage and security company based in Campbell, Calif., had been expanding its presence in Ann Arbor since 2007 to tap fresh engineering recruits. The company moved in with 230 employees, making it the largest private employer in downtown behind Google.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of places in the downtown area where you could put a sizable tech company,\u201d said Rod Mathews, a Barracuda general manager. \u201cWe did care a lot about what happened in the rest of the space. We didn\u2019t want to be an anchor tenant in a building that wasn\u2019t occupied.\u201dMr. Hughes and Mr. Chaconas figured they would populate the second floor of the old bookstore with multiple office tenants after leasing the ground floor to a retail mix. Yet before Mr. Chaconas got far, the business and media analytics firm Prime Research made an aggressive play to secure 16,000 square feet at $24 a square foot with a call from a vice president, Julie Myers-Beach.\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on touching the second floor until I was done with the first floor, but the day the sign went up for leasing the building, Julie from Prime called me up and said, \u2018I want it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chaconas said. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019m not ready.\u2019 She said, \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201dWith Prime and Barracuda side by side, the Borders spaces suddenly became the workplace for more than 300 young computer programmers with disposable incomes, Ms. Pollay said. Combined with the Google employees two blocks away, the area suddenly took on a tech-hub vibe, whereas for decades it had primarily focused on serving the university community.\u201cA larger tech company can be a real asset in the sense that it creates a talent pool that is now spawning a continuous labor pool for the entire market,\u201d said Spark\u2019s chief executive, Paul Krutko. He noted that Barracuda had not set up an internal food service, which encouraged employees to venture into downtown.That is the clientele Mr. Chaconas aimed to cater to while keeping the offerings local. Just as Borders was deeply rooted in the community, so are two current tenants, Knight\u2019s Steakhouse and Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea, both locally owned chains. A third, the HopCat brew pub, is part of a small chain that started in Grand Rapids.There is also Slurping Turtle, a noodle restaurant, and Pieology, a fast-casual pizza place that chose a corner of the building for its first Michigan location.Mr. Hughes and Mr. Chaconas expected they would be able to get $35 to $40 a square foot. In the end, they got $45 a square foot on average and helped push the area\u2019s retail rental prices up, Ms. Pollay said. Within two years of Borders\u2019 closing, the entire place was leased, and everything had opened by mid-2015.\u201cAll downtown now is restaurants because people will go to restaurants, but people will not shop,\u201d Mr. Chaconas said.An early success, Mr. Chaconas said, was persuading the proprietors of Knight\u2019s, Don and Angela Knight, to move in. They already had two popular steakhouses, including one nearby.As a longtime Ann Arbor family \u2014 their children are seventh-generation, they say \u2014 they had an affinity for the location and its previous tenants. They spent more than $2 million to build out some 3,500 square feet at the southwestern corner of the building into a more modern concept than their other locations. Since opening in 2014, the 200-seat restaurant has exceeded their targets.\u201cThey wanted a family-owned, well-established restaurant,\u201d said Mrs. Knight, who noted that comfort-food dishes like meatloaf that are popular at the other locations are no match in the downtown site for filet mignon sliders, pear and arugula salads, and burgers on pretzel buns. \u201cI think it really mattered for a building with a history like this one.\u201dMr. Chaconas and Mr. Hughes assert that their approach is far healthier for both their bottom line and the city\u2019s welfare than reliance on one tenant, as one early notion to lease the whole former bookstore space to something like a Dave & Buster\u2019s would have.The subdivision of the Borders space is likely to become an example for future turnover, Mr. Chaconas said. The Urban Outfitters store across the street is, at about 10,000 square feet, one of the largest nonfood retailers in the area, which is worrisome.\u201cI lose that tenant, I lose 100 percent of that income,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they leave I may put two tenants in there, so I only lose half the income. That is a perfect example, because nobody is that big anymore.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated one of the streets at the intersection where Borders once had its headquarters and flagship store. It is Liberty and Maynard, not Maryland.Advertisement"}

Fake images show a prominent female leader in a hangman\u2019s noose. A politician\u2019s aide decries violent crime with a Facebook photo of a girl\u2019s corpse \u2014 an image that turns out to come from another country.Another day on social media for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump? Think again.Those incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media\u2019s outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States.\u201cThey should have done this way earlier,\u201d said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook\u2019s fastest-growing markets. \u201cWe already saw the warning signs of this years ago.\u201d\u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook\u2019s global reach \u2014 roughly a quarter of the world\u2019s population now has an account \u2014 is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say.Some governments are pushing back, sometimes with undemocratic consequences. Ms. Merkel has said she is considering plans to force social networks to make public how they rank news online. Some African countries have banned the use of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter before elections. Indonesia\u2019s government has closed sites that it says promote fake news, though experts say some portals were also targeted for political reasons.Facebook said on Thursday that the social network was a place for people to stay informed and that what people saw in their news feed was overwhelmingly authentic. The Silicon Valley company previously denied that it failed to deal with misinformation and said it continues to monitor the social network so that it meets existing standards.\u201cI think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way \u2014 I think is a pretty crazy idea,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told a tech conference days after the American presidential election. \u201cVoters make decisions based on their lived experience.\u201dFacebook\u2019s power is often stronger overseas than it is in the United States. In many developing countries with populations new to both democracy and social media, experts said, fake stories can be more widely believed. And in some of these countries, Facebook even offers free smartphone data connections to basic public online services, some news sites and Facebook itself \u2014 but limits access to broader sources that could help debunk fake news.One such place is the Philippines, where a spokesman for its populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared on Facebook an image of a corpse of a young girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer. Fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from Brazil. Despite the debunking, proponents of Mr. Duterte\u2019s bloody crackdown on reported drug dealers and addicts still cite the image in his defense, according to political analysts.\u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t led to empowerment of the average citizen, but empowerment of professional propagandists, fringe elements and conspiracy theorists,\u201d said Mr. Heydarian, the Philippines political analyst. \u201cVoices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of the public discourse.\u201dWhen Joko Widodo, Indonesia\u2019s president, was running for office in 2014, he was accused through social media of being a Chinese Christian and a communist \u2014 severe criticism in the deeply Islamic country. The Indonesian politician released his marriage certificate to prove he wasn\u2019t Chinese and made a pilgrimage to Mecca just before voting.\u201cThe fake news had a very big impact in our campaign,\u201d said Tubagus Ramadhan, who helped Mr. Widodo run his social media campaign during the election.While Facebook has won plaudits for allowing people in disaster zones to tell friends and families they are safe, it has also been a conduit for dangerous rumors in those situations. At the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, a false message widely distributed in Sierra Leone on Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the social network, said bathing in hot water with salt would cure and prevent the spread of the virus.Even in long-established democracies like Germany, Spain and Italy, false news reports and hate speech on social media have whipped up grass-roots populist movements, which have often targeted the recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees, to garner wider electoral support.Now, many European politicians are questioning what role social media has had in deciding what voters can and cannot see. They also have forced social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google to sign up for voluntary \u2014 so far \u2014 standards to police hate speech online.In Germany, Ms. Merkel\u2019s push to require American social network companies to publish how they rank news is intended to give voters greater control over what they read online.\u201cAlgorithms must be more transparent,\u201d Ms. Merkel has said, \u201cso that interested citizens are also aware of what actually happens with their own media behavior and that of others.\u201dOther politicians, often in more recently established democracies, are going a step further.In some African countries, including Chad and Uganda, officials cite uncorroborated security threats and fears that false results could be shared online as reasons for shutting down social media ahead of elections.Christian Echle, director of the Sub-Sahara Africa media program at Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, a German political foundation, said such actions were heavy-handed and that social media had played a role in helping voters \u2014 many located far from urban centers \u2014 to gain access to much-needed information and interact with political candidates.But, he added, a growing amount of news shared through social media was either false or biased, making it difficult for people in these often fledgling democracies to know which news outlets to trust.\u201cThere\u2019s a big, big threat \u2014 that social media will deepen existing gaps in these societies,\u201d said Mr. Echle, who is based in Johannesburg. \u201cPeople are still learning how to use social media, so many can easily fall for hoaxes.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mark Scott from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Janet Reno Was Unafraid of Science That Could Exonerate the Innocent", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkA phone call to the office of Jeremy Travis, new in Washington: \u201cThe attorney general wants to talk with you.\u201dThe attorney general of the United States at that moment, in 1994, would have been Janet Reno, and not long before, Mr. Travis had gone to work for her as director of the National Institute of Justice, an agency that conducts research for the Justice Department.Ms. Reno told him that she was sitting with one of her deputies, Mr. Travis recalled on Thursday, and they had just read a news article about the DNA exoneration of a man who had been on death row.\u201cShe said, \u2018I have two questions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Travis said. \u201c\u2018How many more are there like this? What can we learn from it?\u2019\u201dIt may not be immediately apparent how daring that inquiry was 22 years ago. DNA testing was then in its early days as a tool in criminal justice, and few people anticipated that prisoners would clamor to have old biological evidence retested in hopes of clearing their names.Moreover, hardly anyone was willing to say aloud that innocent people really were locked up. Politicians could not spend money fast enough on prisons. After a long climb in crime rates, the country was ratcheting up sentences. Bill Clinton had suspended his presidential campaign in 1992 so that he could be in Arkansas, where he was then the Democratic governor, for the execution of a murderer who had shot himself in the head and was so brain-damaged that he asked prison guards to save the pecan pie from his last meal for him as he was being led to his lethal injection.DNA testing is practical only in a small fraction of cases, but the flaws it discloses in conventional investigative techniques \u2014 first documented in that report \u2014 are profound. The most important question is not how those innocent people got out of jail, but how they got into it. Eyewitness errors were a leading source of wrongful convictions, as were false confessions and junk forensic science.The report included commentaries by prosecutors, a police superintendent, and Peter J. Neufeld and Barry C. Scheck, the co-founders of the Innocence Project, who wrote, \u201cThere is a strong scientific basis for believing these matters represent just the tip of a very deep and disturbing iceberg of cases.\u201d (Mr. Neufeld, Mr. Scheck and I later wrote a book on the subject.)At Ms. Reno\u2019s request, the justice institute brought in panels of psychologists who had studied the working of human memory. \u201cShe stayed the whole day,\u201d Mr. Travis said.The work led to new ways of asking witnesses to look at suspects and of recording complete interrogations, as well as greater rigor in laboratory practices and the preservation of evidence.Ms. Reno met many detectives in her home as a child \u2014 her father had been a police reporter in Florida \u2014 and for her, it was important that the public realized they were hardworking, low-paid, great people, said James Doyle, a lawyer and author who interviewed her for \u201cTrue Witness,\u201d a book about eyewitness procedures.That first report she commissioned on DNA exonerations looked fearlessly at the errors not just of police officers, but of a whole constellation of players in justice.Advertisement"}

I want to know what other parents are actually doing that works.For the last six weeks, I\u2019ve circulated (on social media!) 20 questions covering topics like homework, passwords, bedtime and punishments. I received responses from more than 60 families, and though the survey was unscientific, the answers have already changed how we manage tech at my house.Other popular restrictions include: \u201cWriting an expected behavior contract.\u201d \u201cNo use of the internet on school days (except schoolwork).\u201d \u201cScreen time limited to 30 to 60 minutes per day during the week, unlimited on Saturday mornings.\u201dAnother is a partial ban on group texting. \u201cI was able to help my son feel better about not having this by allowing him to view group texts on the family iPad,\u201d one parent said. \u201cIt helped him see how little value the group chatter has.\u201dPhones during friend visits are another issue: \u201cNothing more disappointing than seeing my children\u2019s friends bring their devices to my home and have them focus on the devices to the exclusion of hanging out with my children.\u201dMy own favorite way to limit tech use: \u201cPoor reception \u2014 the phones don\u2019t always work.\u201dAsked to give other parents advice on when to give their children a phone, the consensus answer was: Wait as long as possible.

Some parents are quite strict, limiting all technology \u201coutside of a computer for spelling or Google docs.\u201d \u201cOnly homework-related sites and no social media.\u201d \u201cOnly certain educational sites are allowed.

(I cook a lot and I can keep an eye on them, especially when the children are punished and still try to sneak off with them.)\u201d \u201cAt bedtime, devices go in the bathroom for charging.\u201dOne mother has no specific place, only not in the child\u2019s room: \u201cMy husband and I simply ask where the phones are charging during our \u2018audits of responsibility.\u2019 If the children try to work around the rule, they know the device will be placed in \u2018jail.\u2019\u201dRegardless of the sites, most parents insist on knowing passwords and logins. \u201cMy rules, until he was 18, were that I get all the passwords to all accounts.

{"Headline": "The Story So Far: Fiction Podcasts Take Their Next Steps", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byOn one long August day, Eli Horowitz camped out in a cramped studio in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with Oscar Isaac, Catherine Keener, a microphone and a solitary Betta fish named Young Hollywood swimming laps around its little bowl. Mr. Horowitz was there to direct Ms. Keener and Mr. Isaac as they acted out the story of a strange and intimate relationship between a therapist and an army veteran who come together as part of a secretive \u2014 maybe even sinister \u2014 government program. Mr. Isaac played the vet, Ms. Keener the therapist. Young Hollywood served as scenery.The catch: They had to convey all of this exclusively through sound \u2014 including the fish. Also, Mr. Horowitz had never directed an actor in his life.\u201cI literally Googled \u2018how to direct,\u2019\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. \u201cI swear I read a WikiHow page about it.\u201dMr. Horowitz has built a career as an experimental storyteller. He was managing editor and then publisher of the innovative fiction outfit McSweeney\u2019s, then the creator of a pair of \u201cdigital novels,\u201d which play with geolocation and serialization to make stories for mobile devices. Now he\u2019s working in a new form: the fictional podcast.Mr. Horowitz is the head of the new, one-man fiction division (official title: executive producer of scripted content) at Gimlet Media, a Brooklyn podcasting company begun by the longtime NPR journalist Alex Blumberg in 2014. \u201cHomecoming,\u201d the tale Mr. Horowitz was directing in Gowanus, is Gimlet\u2019s first scripted series, with its premiere on Wednesday, Nov. 16. It\u2019s part of a new wave of ambitious audio fiction, one that moves beyond the early experiments that favored sci-fi and horror plots and cheap and simple storytelling devices and now boasts sophisticated sound design, top acting talent, tightly wound plots and form-bending structures.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to get away from the idea of the old-school radio drama with a capital R and a capital D,\u201d said Julie Shapiro, the executive producer of the podcast network Radiotopia. In its place, she said, \u201ca more contemporary sense is developing of what audio fiction can be.\u201dThe innovation of the podcast \u2014 a digital, downloadable, listen-whenever-you-like format \u2014 has opened up audio storytelling to upstart creators, who can offer their products to a global audience without any backing from a radio station. Yet, about 10 years in, fictional podcasts are still finding their footing as a form.Just as stage plays once opened with explanatory prologues and early novels were told through letters, these conceits provide listeners with a familiar format that helps warm them up to the somewhat alien idea of fiction through their headphones. \u201cNobody watches \u2018CSI Miami\u2019 and says, \u2018Wait, why is there a camera in that police office?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Blumberg. \u201cWe suspend our disbelief.\u201d\u201cHomecoming\u201d drops the act. While the series, which Mr. Horowitz wrote with the screenwriter Micah Bloomberg, plays with native audio elements (like phone calls and interview tapes) \u2014 most of the time we\u2019re just listening in, no explanation necessary.So while \u201cHomecoming\u201d\u2014 in addition to Ms. Keener and Mr. Isaac, it also stars David Schwimmer, David Cross and Amy Sedaris \u2014 is billed as a psychological thriller, it feels more experimental than the thrillers we\u2019re used to watching on film. A distaste for clich\u00e9 stopped Mr. Horowitz short of inserting a metanarrative structure to hold the listener\u2019s hand, and the audio format prevented him from structuring his story around physical action.\u201cIn a way, the whole plot came out of that challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted a whole plot where the actual meat of the story was the conversation.\u201dIn \u201cHomecoming,\u201d therapy sessions between Ms. Keener and Mr. Isaac, and phone calls between Ms. Keener and her boss, played by Mr. Schwimmer, swirl just around the edges of the central mystery of the story line, twisting closer and closer until its secrets are revealed. The audio-only form frees the story to play with disorienting notions of time, place and identity that might not be possible on film.The podcast also features sound design by Mark Phillips \u2014 who worked on \u201cSerial\u201d and a suite of indie films \u2014 that makes it sound more like a movie than the piped-in sound signature of the typical radio drama. Instead of having actors speak into a microphone \u2014 a technique used by a lot of early podcasts \u2014 Mr. Phillips directed the sound as he would for a narrative film. After an early pilot of the podcast seemed full of dead air, Mr. Horowitz worked in new soundscapes throughout the series. For one scene, Mr. Phillips created a rolling, creaking Ferris wheel that sounds as if it were carrying Ms. Keener and Mr. Schwimmer in and out of the bustle of a street fair. And creating the sound of characters moving as conversations whiz by required him to record noises on location (residents chatting at a retirement home, plates clanging at a diner) and take actors outdoors for external scenes.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to really fake that,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.But the key to creating a realistic sound lies with the acting. \u201cAt the heart of great audio is real emotional truth. I think you can hear it even when you can\u2019t see it,\u201d said Mr. Blumberg. And unlike in a film or television show, there are no visual tricks to support a fine performance in a fictional podcast, or to help hide a poor one.While these newly ambitious podcasts may constitute big projects for people working in audio, they can feel delightfully indie to film actors. \u201cIt felt like making a play for our parents in the garage,\u201d Ms. Keener said.Plus, the commitment is slight. Ms. Keener recorded for a week; Mr. Schwimmer for just a day. When Ms. Keener convinced Mr. Isaac to come on board, \u201cI said \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019 and he said \u2018Great. Of course. I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201dPanoply, the podcasting company that produced \u201cThe Message\u201d in partnership with General Electric this year and is releasing the techno-sci-fi parable \u201cLifeAfter\u201d on Sunday, Nov. 13, is building a fiction division. Midroll, a podcast network that originally concentrated on improv comedy pieces and interview shows hosted by comics, expanded its scripted offerings this year with \u201cFruit,\u201d Issa Rae\u2019s tale of a closeted N.F.L. player; and \u201cThe Mysterious Secrets of Uncle Bertie\u2019s Botanarium,\u201d starring Jemaine Clement (of \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d) as a kookily fictionalized version of the 18th-century botanist Lord Joseph Banks. It recently debuted \u201cA Night Called Tomorrow,\u201d a noirish comedy by James Urbaniak set in 1950s Hollywood.\u201cI think there\u2019s still some surprise in the industry that there\u2019s an audience for fiction at all,\u201d said Chris Bannon, Midroll\u2019s chief content officer. Middling efforts have burned listeners in the past \u2014 \u201cThe fakeness of bad audio fiction is really a turnoff,\u201d he said. Creating a hit means a sizable stake in a genre without a clear audience.That audience needs to be willing to invest in the podcast, too. Most nonfiction podcasts are convenient for workouts or commutes, where tuning out for 15 seconds to direct attention elsewhere is no big deal. But in a densely plotted fiction series, 15 seconds can mean missing a central plot point.In piloting the series, Gimlet found that its scripts were initially too long to expect listeners to sustain that level of attention. Episodes of \u201cHomecoming\u201d now clock in under 30 minutes.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to explore what the form can be,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said, \u201cwhile also trying to be conscious of what it is now.\u201dHe\u2019s betting the audience is ready to listen. He\u2019s already at work on Season 2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Is About to Find Out What Donald Trump Really Believes", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In Donald J. Trump\u2019s private conversations and public commentary, one guiding principle shines through: The world is a zero-sum place, and nations, like real estate developers, are either on the winning side of a deal or the losing side.Yet he also is the ultimate pragmatist, perfectly willing to dispense with seemingly core beliefs in return for negotiating advantage. That is why many of his closest supporters have long cautioned that the most headline-grabbing proposals of his run for the presidency should not be taken literally \u2014 they are guideposts, the supporters suggest, not plans. Even Mr. Trump once described his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants as a mere \u201csuggestion.\u201dAs he enters the Oval Office that Ronald Reagan \u2014 another populist pragmatist, but one who had served in public office before the White House \u2014 left nearly 28 years ago, the world is about to find out what Donald Trump really believes. Or at least what he is going to try to do, in partnership with Republicans who on Tuesday retained control of both houses of Congress.It was in Mr. Reagan\u2019s last months in office that Mr. Trump took out a full-page ad in several newspapers complaining that \u201cfor decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States.\u201d Flirting with a presidential run himself \u2014 he was 41 \u2014 and seeking the publicity that would become addictive, he called for the United States to pull out of the Middle East, which he called \u201cof only marginal significance to the United States for its oil supplies,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhy are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing protect their interests?\u201dIt is a line he often repeated in his unlikely candidacy. America\u2019s Asian allies, South Korea included, are about to learn whether that is an opening negotiating position, or the condition for America\u2019s continued military presence in the Pacific. Japan\u2019s best hope arises from the fact that he is now focusing his attentions on the United States\u2019 five-times-as-large trade deficit with China, which he described in May as engaged in \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world.\u201dAt home, his instincts often mix elements of what he has heard or read from the left and the right. His economic policy might best be described as \u201cBig Government Conservatism,\u201d a mix of major tax cuts, mostly for businesses, and a massive infrastructure program to rebuild the dank airports and collapsing bridges that he used in the campaign as a symbol of America\u2019s declining status. It is a subject he comes to easily as a developer who wanted to get customers to his properties.So far, those proposals do not add up to a coherent strategy. The tax cuts come right out of the Republican playbook; the spending right out of the Democrats\u2019 agenda of spurring the economy with government-led job creation. His commitment to preserve social programs is far more Obama than Reagan. His vow to rip apart the Affordable Care Act, the symbolic domestic achievement of the Obama presidency, adopts the favorite cause of the Republican leadership with whom he has often clashed.Experts who have looked at his proposals \u2014 many so vague they cannot be \u201cpriced\u201d \u2014 have concluded that federal deficits will soar. And that gets to Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to entertain two completely contradictory thoughts at once, because rarely did he finish an interview or a debate without reminding listeners that a federal debt heading toward $20 trillion was a \u201cdisaster\u201d that only he could fix. In his first year, he will have to square those two promises \u2014 or not.Indeed, his campaign talk has often contradicted his past proposals. In the early 1990s, for example, Mr. Trump lobbied Congress to raise income taxes on the wealthy to encourage investment in real estate, while advocating the restoration of tax breaks for real estate investments.In 1999, Mr. Trump proposed a \u201cnet worth tax\u201d on the wealthy to pay off the national debt. \u201cPersonally this plan would cost me hundreds of millions of dollars, but in all honesty, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. His motivation: He was considering a bid for the presidential nomination of Ross Perot\u2019s Reform Party, which had made federal debt reduction one of its signature issues.But it is in national security that he faces some of the biggest quandaries.His zero-sum instincts kick in when the subject turns to immigration, which is essentially the importation of people. He has long argued that immigrants take jobs from Americans, diminishing prosperity by dividing the American pie into a larger number of smaller pieces. The idea that they can bolster the economy, too \u2014 as some of the founders of Intel, Google and other Silicon Valley powerhouses did \u2014 never creeps into his speeches.Mr. Trump\u2019s views of the economy are also deeply rooted in his identity as a real estate developer. He regularly emphasizes the economic importance of making things, while rarely mentioning the service work that employs most Americans. He has repeatedly promised to revive the steel production, a line of work that now employs about as many people as a large medical center.In fact, the steel-making era is the one that Mr. Trump harks back to when talking about the time when America was at the peak of its power. He noted in a March interview that in the late 1940s and early 1950s, \u201cwe were not pushed around, we were respected by everybody, we had just won a war.\u201dIt is a view of American power that spills over into his approach to national security. He sees little long-term benefit from funding efforts to eliminate the root causes of terrorism. His mind goes to military solutions first. Few statements were more often repeated, or more heartfelt, than his vow to bomb the Islamic State, and \u201ctake the oil.\u201dThose lines always brought his crowds to their feet. Now comes the far more complex part: He is about to inherit the problem of how to hold and redevelop Mosul once the Islamic State forces are ousted \u2014 under a military plan that he has dismissed as ineffective \u2014 and how to \u201ctake the oil\u201d of a sovereign state, Iraq. And he must do so without returning to an era of constant American combat presence that had made members of his own war-weary party, and Hillary Clinton, blanch.And no relationship will be under more scrutiny than how Mr. Trump handles President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom he has repeatedly praised in terms that shocked his own party, and his running mate.The Cold War was the ultimate geopolitical zero-sum game. For most Republicans, it still is: Twenty-five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the foreign policy and intelligence leadership that Russia must be both constrained and contained, its harassment of the new members of NATO halted, its cyberattacks deterred.Mr. Trump is an outlier to that view, and never once backed the idea of \u201ccontainment.\u201d He repeatedly made the case that he, and he alone, could negotiate with authoritarians like Mr. Putin.Would he lift the sanctions over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea \u2014 a move that Mr. Trump has seemed to suggest was justified \u2014 and its harassment of Ukraine? Would he back off from the Obama administration\u2019s decision to bolster the American military presence off Russia\u2019s borders?\u201cMy administration,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwill work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS, and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And that includes Russia.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Putin seemed to return that sentiment, sensing his opportunity and saying he looked forward to restoring \u201cfully fledged\u201d relations with the United States.\u201cIf they want to join us by knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Trump said recently, in a statement that oozed Kissingerian realpolitik. \u201cIt is a very imperfect world, and you can\u2019t always choose your friends. But you can never fail to recognize your enemies.\u201dSuch issues will stretch Mr. Trump in new directions. His experience in the business world did little to hone his thinking how to prioritize American national interests: When asked about it in March, he said that \u201cprotection of our country\u201d was No. 1, but he struggled to explain others, including when he thought American troops should be put at risk in defense of a humanitarian cause. With nearly 500,000 people dead in Syria, that issue will be on his desk on the afternoon of Jan. 20, along with many others.David E.
