{"Headline": "How You Can Fight Donald Trump Right Now", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byOne day, Americans who were too young to have followed the 2016 campaign will look back and try to make sense of it. They will want to know how such a dangerous person could have gotten so close to the presidency \u2014 a man who spoke of abandoning our allies, admiring foreign despots, weakening constitutional rights, and serially molesting women.Those future adults may also pose a more personal question to their elders:Mommy and Daddy, what did you do in response to Donald Trump?The right response to anti-democracy is more democracy. It\u2019s also the way to defeat Trump. His paths to the presidency depend on large third-party vote shares and low turnout.Fortunately, we know a lot more about how to encourage democratic participation than even a decade ago, thanks to a flowering of research in psychology and political science. Here, then, is a how-to guide for fighting Trumpism:First, obviously, you should vote. You knew that, but many people who intend to vote become waylaid \u2014 by a traffic jam, a sick kid or a work meeting. Make a detailed plan now, about when and where you will vote.You don\u2019t need an intricate effort to influence people, though. Post your own voting plan to Facebook, and ask your friends to reply with theirs. Text or call relatives in swing states and ask about their voting plans. Do the same when you see friends.And when people tell you their plan, don\u2019t just nod and smile. Say that you expect to hear from them after they\u2019ve executed their plan. \u201cSocial pressure is mighty persuasive,\u201d says Carolyn DeWitt, president of Rock the Vote.Third, with the people you feel most comfortable, consider taking the risk of talking politics. I\u2019m well aware of how awkward the subject can be. I come from a close and politically diverse family, and we avoid politics at most gatherings.It\u2019s worth reminding undecided voters in your life about who he is: what he has said about prisoners of war and the disabled, how he has humiliated women, how he has promoted online racism and anti-Semitism. Almost everybody loves somebody who is part of a group that Donald Trump has demeaned.One week from Tuesday night, the often-depressing campaign of 2016 will be over. Before it is, take a moment to imagine how it would feel to live in a country that had voted for and was run by Donald Trump.Then go out and do your part to keep America great.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cities and States Lead on Climate Change", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIOWA CITY \u2014 THE wind turbines that rise out of the cornfields here reminded me on a recent drive of one postelection truth, even in the red state of Iowa.As President-elect Donald J. Trump considers whether to break the United States commitment to the Paris climate accord, the rise of clean energy across the heartland is already too well entrenched to be reversed.Many of the planet\u2019s cities lie along the coasts and are threatened by slowly rising seas. Seventy percent of those cities are already dealing with extreme weather like drought and flooding. Add in aging infrastructure and waves of migrants and it is obvious that city planners, mayors and governors have had to re-envision how their cities generate energy and provide food and transportation.\u201cThe concept of a regenerative city could indeed become a new vision for cities,\u201d the Germany-based World Future Council reported recently. \u201cIt stands for cities that not only minimize negative impact but can actually have a positive, beneficial role to play within the natural ecosystem from which they depend. Cities have to constantly regenerate the resources they absorb.\u201dThis idea won broad support at a recent gathering of city leaders from around the world in Quito, Ecuador, hosted by the United Nations. The Habitat III conference approved a \u201cnew urban agenda\u201d that urges cities to adapt to climate change but minimize their harm to the environment and move to sustainable economies.In a changing climate, these approaches make sense. As Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, told the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce recently, \u201cCities, businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions, because they have concluded \u2014 just as China has \u2014 that doing so is in their own self-interest.\u201dWith or without significant federal support, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require major private investment, as it has here in Iowa, and ambitious private-public initiatives from mayors and governors. We need to activate a new era of \u201cregenerative\u201d cities and states.California\u2019s recent move to reduce its carbon emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 is a hopeful shift that other cities and states should emulate. This would involve setting high benchmarks for developing green enterprise zones, renewable energy, cultivating food locally, restoring biodiversity, planting more trees and emphasizing walkability, low-carbon transportation and zero waste.Following this regenerative approach, the Australian city of Adelaide reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent from 2007 to 2013, even as the population grew by 27 percent and the economy increased by 28 percent. The city experienced a boom in green jobs, the development of walkable neighborhoods powered by solar energy, the conversion of urban waste to compost and a revamped local food industry. The city also planted three million trees to absorb carbon dioxide.Initiatives like those have become a \u201cfill the potholes\u201d reality for many mayors, regardless of political games in Washington. In San Diego, the Republican mayor, Kevin Faulconer, helped to push through a climate action plan that commits the city to 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Other cities are following his lead.\u201cDull, inert cities, it is true, do contain the seeds of their own destruction and little else,\u201d the urban visionary Jane Jacobs wrote. \u201cBut lively, diverse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.\u201dIn an age of climate change, and a possible shift in the federal government\u2019s priority on climate action, never have those words been truer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Art of the New Deal?", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionThe demolition job is finished, and now a new Republican Party is arising from the rubble, its ultimate shape unclear. President-elect Donald J. Trump, the most conspicuous builder on the scene, is the undisputed leader of his party. But he also remains an outsider, as Republicans who opposed him said all the way to election night. The mounting tensions of the transition have done little to change this.In fact, they have highlighted the curiously dual identity Mr. Trump has created for himself. There is the candidate who vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, deport all undocumented immigrants, rollback financial regulations, undo the Iran nuclear deal and repudiate the Paris agreement on climate change. But there is also the Trump who seldom espouses conservative ideology, especially its call to shrink the scope and scale of government. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Daily Signal, a pledge he has since backed away from, but only haltingly. Since his victory he has spoken of bringing jobs to the heartland by spending $1 trillion on infrastructure.This raises a question that has tantalized some observers during Mr. Trump\u2019s improbable campaign. As swiftly as he might try to dismantle President Obama\u2019s legacy, might he also emerge as a defender of F.D.R.\u2019s?It may sound far-fetched, but not necessarily to voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan, who, after voting Democratic in 2012, chose Mr. Trump this time. The conflict is brewing with another enclave of the party: its entrenched governing elite. Their leader is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump during the campaign and has since emerged as a rival architect of the new Republican Party. Mr. Ryan\u2019s free-market, anti-New Deal principles are spelled out in \u201cA Better Way,\u201d a sheaf of ambitious proposals on issues ranging from jobs and education to health care and taxes. It has become the conservative blueprint, and a postelection survey showed that as many as two-thirds of Republicans think Mr. Ryan \u201cshould have more influence over policy\u201d than Mr. Trump, Politico reported.Who, then, will decide the party\u2019s direction, Mr. Trump or Mr. Ryan? A useful precedent is the Republicans\u2019 intraparty conflicts after the 1952 election, when another novice politician Republican, Dwight D. Eisenhower, was opposed by conservatives. The differences between the two men are manifold: Eisenhower was the nation\u2019s greatest war hero, a dignified man of preternatural calm, who was also the president of Columbia University. Mr. Trump avoided the Vietnam-era draft and is better known for his inflammatory tweets and stream-of-consciousness stump speeches. Yet like Mr. Trump, Eisenhower, the first Republican president elected in 20 years, was not especially ideological. And like Mr. Trump, he was suspected of being a closet Democrat.Harry Truman, the accidental and unpopular incumbent who feared he could not be elected on his own, had offered to step aside if Eisenhower agreed to run in his place in 1948 (with Truman on the ticket as vice president). This was partly an acknowledgment of Eisenhower\u2019s stature as the revered \u201csoldier of democracy\u201d who had led the Allies to victory in World War II.Eisenhower declined, and Truman won. Four years later, Eisenhower got the Republican nomination, turning back the party\u2019s ideological leader, Robert A. Taft, in a bitter nomination fight, not unlike the one waged in Cleveland between Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz. In defeat, Taft promised to support Eisenhower as long as he didn\u2019t stray from Republican orthodoxy. \u201cThe greatest threat to liberty today is internal, from the constant growth of big government,\u201d Taft said, after presenting Eisenhower with a small-government manifesto.\u201cBig government\u201d meant the programs enacted by Roosevelt and expanded by Truman during the 20-year period that began in the depths of the Great Depression and continued through World War II and into the Cold War. A new welfare state was in place, and America had become a global superpower. In addition to providing benefits for its citizens at home, the enlarged federal government administered the Marshall Plan and led the NATO alliance. Taft and other conservatives disliked all that as well as the expansion of free trade. They wanted to return the country to free-market purity and isolationism.But converting principled rhetoric into policy wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cOnce in office the Republicans will automatically endorse much of the New Deal, through the simple device of leaving things untouched,\u201d the political journalist Samuel Lubell predicted in 1952.Eisenhower\u2019s two terms bore this out. Instead of unstringing the safety net, he worked, often with congressional Democrats, to strengthen it, and added a new layer with the bipartisan Civil Rights Act of 1957. His biggest infrastructure project, the Interstate System of highways, meshed with the booming auto economy and also with a Cold War defense strategy that called for state-of-the art evacuation routes in the event of thermonuclear attack.President-elect Trump seems caught between those visions. His views on trade, business regulations and foreign policy resemble Taft\u2019s. But he sounds more like Eisenhower on many domestic policies. After President Obama, in a meeting with Mr. Trump, pointed out some key protections of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 for people with pre-existing medical conditions and young adults covered by their parents \u2014 Mr. Trump indicated he might moderate his position. Mr. Ryan, too, said, \u201cWe can fix what is broken in health care without breaking what is working.\u201dThe same dynamic could play out on other issues. Mr. Trump has already begun talking about building a fence instead of a wall along sections of the Mexican border. And while he has been adamant about deporting undocumented immigrants, he has narrowed the emphasis to those with criminal records \u2014 the policy Mr. Obama has pursued. Clear differences with small-government conservatives could also emerge if House Republicans tried to privatize Medicare or health care services for veterans. On infrastructure, Mr. Trump seems inclined for now to side with Democrats who want a big plan over the objections of Republican deficit hawks.One clue to how Mr. Trump might govern from the center is contained in exit polls. According to those surveys, groups about whom Mr. Trump said disparaging things \u2014 including women, Hispanics and blacks \u2014 voted against him, but less emphatically than expected. Mr. Trump\u2019s share of the African-American and Hispanic vote was actually larger than Mitt Romney\u2019s in 2012. Most striking was the gender gap. Hillary Clinton\u2019s edge there, 54 to 42, was large, but not atypical.One major reason: Democrats simply didn\u2019t turn out for Mrs. Clinton in the same numbers they did for Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump talked about cultural issues like abortion, but not with the same intensity of Republicans past. Rather, his ability to tap into anger and frustration about jobs, trade and illegal immigration seemed to stir Republican and independent voters. It was easy to snicker when he asked African- American audiences what they had to lose by supporting him. (One answer may come in his court appointments.) But he recognized that those voters had doubts about him, and he urged them to take a chance. It was a rough-hewed pitch, and perhaps a cynical one. But many of those voters may have viewed it as a common-sense one, too.To dismiss the \u201cgreat\u201d America evoked by Mr. Trump as nothing but code for prejudice and exclusion overlooks the legacy of opportunity and connectedness made possible by New Deal and Great Society programs. Created by Democrats, those programs have long been opposed by conservatives. But pragmatic Republicans like Eisenhower helped preserve them. Mr. Trump drew on this memory in his victory remarks. \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\u201d he said, promising that he would \u201cfix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals\u201d and \u201crebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201dThis is why the most important contest in the days ahead could be one within the Republican Party, as Mr. Trump\u2019s potential \u201cnew\u201d New Deal comes up against the free-market vision of Mr. Ryan. Little more than a year ago, Mr. Ryan supported an infrastructure plan floated by Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who argued that hundreds of billions of dollars could come through a one-time \u201crepatriation\u201d of profits from giant companies\u2019 overseas earnings in exchange for lower tax rates. It might seem surprising that Mr. Ryan \u2014 who has also been saying that he wants to privatize Medicare \u2014 was agreeable. But he represents a flyover state, Wisconsin, that has a troubled economy. The same was true of a second Republican, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who also backed the bill. The bill went nowhere, in part because of election tensions.Now all three legislators will be returning to Washington, bigger players than before. Each would gain stature from a put-America-back-to work bill. The top House Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, instantly picked up on Mr. Trump\u2019s words, saying, \u201cWe can work together to quickly pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill.\u201d She has been joined by other congressional Democrats, who are looking for areas of agreement with Mr. Trump on this and other measures that could ease the struggles of middle- and working-class America.Populists of the past, most strikingly George Wallace, embraced the New Deal while also practicing a politics of racial division. Mr. Trump may follow a similar path, as his selection of Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, as his chief strategist suggests. Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general raises similar concerns.But it is a long way to January 20. A Rust Belt Republicanism that returns to an older idea of pragmatic consensus politics could be a revolution for the better.Sam Tanenhaus is a former editor of The New York Times Book Review and the author of \u201cThe Death of Conservatism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Braces for the Fallout of a Trump Presidency", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byPerhaps no country aside from the United States itself had as much at stake in the American presidential election as Mexico did.\u201cIt\u2019s an unmitigated disaster,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign minister of Mexico and a professor of politics and Latin American studies at New York University. \u201cThere are very few tools to fix the relationship.\u201d\u201cThis election reminded us of the bad image Mexico has in the U.S.,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Silva-Herzog, a columnist and professor at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Mexico. \u201cIt has also served as a mirror in which we have painfully seen our reflection.\u201d\u201cWe will not have to wait for the presidential baton to be passed to feel the devastating effects, not only in economic terms, but also the existential crisis it will cause,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement could greatly affect Canada, too. As a result of the pact, much of Canada\u2019s industry produces for export.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get sideswiped by some of this stuff,\u201d said Mark Warner, a trade lawyer in Toronto. In particular, he said, he expects Mr. Trump to promote \u201cBuy America\u201d clauses in government infrastructure projects that would shut out Canadian companies \u2014 a violation of Nafta.But for Canada and Mexico, the election was a study in contrasts. Canadians reacted to Mr. Trump\u2019s election with concern, even anxiety, but also a whiff of pride.Move-to-Canada memes started spreading as Mr. Trump looked increasingly likely to win Florida: \u201cElection Night Starter Kit,\u201d read a post on Instagram, above photos of United States passports and an Air Canada plane. Another post depicted a machine-gun-toting man riding a moose, with the words \u201cCanadian Border Patrol Watching for Illegal Americans.\u201dIn Mexico City, the vote felt like something else entirely: a validation of Mr. Trump\u2019s hostile remarks about Mexican immigrants, and a broad statement of disrespect.\u201cImagine what the U.S. will look like from now,\u201d said Angelina Gonz\u00e1lez, who sells cosmetics in Mexico City. \u201cA big wave of discrimination is coming.\u201d\u201cThis moment forces the world, including Mexico, to rethink its relationship with the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThis moment, which really is the end of an era, the end of the U.S. hegemony, is also the beginning of a new chapter for us in Mexico.\u201dNow, it turns out Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was right: Mr. Trump was not simply a candidate who could be ignored.In a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday morning, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto congratulated \u201cthe people of the United States for their electoral process\u201d and reiterated his willingness to work with Mr. Trump \u201cin favor of the bilateral relationship.\u201d\u201cMexico and the U.S.A. are friends, partners and allies, who must continue collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI trust that Mexico and the United States will continue to strengthen their bonds of cooperation and mutual respect.\u201dMr. Trump has promised to build a wall between the two countries and make Mexico pay for it. But Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu rejected that notion in a television interview on Wednesday morning.\u201cPaying for a wall is out of our vision,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vision that we have is a vision of integration, of how Mexico and the United States working together are more competitive.\u201dIn practical terms, most experts suspect, the election will reverberate most profoundly through the economy.The United States and Mexico are deeply integrated in matters of economics, demographics, culture and security, stitched together by the movement of people, goods and money across a 2,000-mile border.As one goes, so goes the other. Mexico is America\u2019s third-largest trading partner, after Canada and China, with about $531 billion in two-way trade in 2015.The countries are interdependent, with American goods and parts shipped to Mexican factories whose products are shipped back into the United States, and vice versa. Millions of American jobs are directly tied to trade with Mexico.Mr. Trump argued that Mexico was the outsize beneficiary of Nafta, while American workers suffered job losses and stagnant wages, an argument that played well with segments of the American electorate.While Mexico is the second-largest destination for American goods, giving it some leverage in responding to actions taken by Mr. Trump, the countries have \u201ca very asymmetrical relationship,\u201d Mr. Casta\u00f1eda said, meaning that in the end, there is little Mexico can do to apply pressure.Many Mexicans may lose their jobs. All will suffer from a rapid depreciation of the peso. But an economic crisis could also turn into a migration crisis \u2014 exactly what Mr. Trump has campaigned for months to halt.About 35 million Mexican citizens and Mexican-Americans live in the United States, and the vast majority are either American citizens or legal residents.Illegal immigration from Mexico has fallen, and the Pew Research Center estimates that more Mexicans are returning to Mexico than are migrating to the United States. But a sudden economic shock could send Mexicans once more to the United States to seek work.\u201cYou generate an economic crisis in Mexico, and all of those gains we have seen in terms of zero migration go down the tubes,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Barrios G\u00f3mez, a former congressman in Mexico.Not everyone felt entirely dour about the election results. If there was a silver lining, some said it was that the threat from the outside would force Mexicans to come together.\u201cI believe having a strong, negative factor right across the border will bring the Mexicans together to work harder, which will be a positive effect,\u201d said Arturo Delgado, the retired director of a technical school.Some were confident that Mr. Trump\u2019s hostile talk as a candidate would ebb when he took office.\u201cI don\u2019t see a problem with trade or immigration,\u201d said Raymundo Riva Palacio, a political analyst and columnist.On trade, Mr. Riva Palacio argued that business groups and governors who supported Mr. Trump, including Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, would impress upon him the importance of remaining in Nafta.As for the wall Mr. Trump has vowed to build, \u201cit will be very difficult for Donald Trump to obtain the budget,\u201d he said.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t for Mexico,\u201d Mr. Riva Palacio said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the United States.\u201dReporting was contributed by Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City, Ian Austen from Ottawa, Dan Levin from New York, and Craig S.

{"Headline": "U.S. Should Get Tougher on China\u2019s Deal Making, Panel Says", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byIn its long list of recommendations, the commission advised Congress to authorize a government panel that reviews foreign takeover deals to bar Chinese state-owned companies from acquiring or gaining \u201ceffective control\u201d of American companies. It also said Congress should ask a government watchdog agency to write a report on whether large-scale outsourcing of manufacturing to China \u201cis leading to the hollowing out of the defense industrial base.\u201dIn addition, the commission suggested ways in which Congress could better bring antidumping cases against China.Each year, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission releases a report to Congress with recommendations based on months of research. The commission aims to make suggestions after examining trade, investment and national security issues between the two nations. Its recommendations are not binding.The report this year took a critical look at the free-trade relationship between the United States and China \u2014 for example, implying that the countries are not competing on a level playing field. It follows a populist airing of grievances over the downsides of free trade and a globalized economy in Western nations this year. That helped lead to the election last week of Donald J. Trump as the next United States president and to the vote by Britons in June to leave the European Union.China, in its recent public statements, has emphasized the tight economic ties between the two major trading partners and said the countries would benefit more from working together.The review process is done by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, which approves most of the foreign purchases that it examines. The report released on Wednesday said it is that panel that Congress should authorize to reject purchases by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Such companies are the main drivers of China\u2019s economy.The new report said Congress should also create an office in the International Trade Administration to identify and bring antidumping and countervailing duty cases. Countervailing duties are imposed on goods to offset the fact that the goods may have been made with the help of subsidies.Besides trade and investment, the report covers topics like security relations, China\u2019s global footprint and the United States\u2019 rebalancing to Asia.In one section, the authors criticize what they see as meager American government efforts to block intelligence collection by China. The Obama administration has expressed concern over what it sees as state-sponsored hacking from China in recent years.\u201cThe U.S. government response to the threat from Chinese intelligence collection has suffered from the lack of an integrated, coordinated effort within the U.S. intelligence community,\u201d the report said.\u201cThe U.S. government\u2019s efforts to counter Chinese intelligence collection operations have manifested largely as a series of espionage prosecutions rather than a strategic, whole-of-government response,\u201d it added. \u201cThe Obama administration has taken steps to improve cybersecurity among U.S. government agencies and defense contractors, but these measures could mitigate, not eliminate, the significant cyberespionage threats to these organizations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Ax Fall on Nigeria\u2019s National Parks?", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAmong the unfortunate headlines about Boko Haram and email scams, it is easy to overlook that Nigeria boasts seven national parks and some of the richest biodiversity in West Africa. Nearly all of that flora and fauna is concentrated in Cross River State in the country\u2019s southeast corner, abutting Cameroon. There, the Nigerian government hopes to have the magnificent Cross River National Park listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site.To spend time in this landscape is to understand why it deserves such a distinguished designation. Jagged mountains, made soft by knee-high grass, rise out of jungle thick with fog and bird songs. From one of the bare, craggy peaks, you can see clear across the green hills of Cross River State. Not only is this region one of Nigeria\u2019s most spectacular natural assets, but it\u2019s also home to the world\u2019s rarest great ape: the Cross River gorilla. Only 300 of these primates are believed to exist in this small region of rain forest shared with Cameroon.While a glimpse of these gorillas is exceedingly rare now, some officials and conservationists hope that Cross River State can one day host a gorilla tourism program as successful and lucrative as the famous one in Rwanda. Thanks in large part to its popular gorilla treks, Volcanoes National Park brought in roughly $15 million in 2014, money that helped to subsidize the rest of Rwanda\u2019s parks and boosted the national economy.Gorilla tourism in Nigeria is years away. But that hope could be dashed by an imminent threat from development.Nigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous nation, with 185 million people \u2014 a total that, by 2050, could swell to more than 440 million, according to United Nations projections. But the country is also free-falling into recession with recent crashes in oil, currency and employment.The governor of Cross River, Benedict Ayade, thinks he has an answer to this crisis: build a new deep seaport near the state capital, Calabar, to rival the one in the country\u2019s largest city, Lagos; then connect it to all points north via a six-lane, 160-mile highway. The idea is to open up a new corridor for trade, create jobs and attract investors.But last year, it became clear that the proposed route of the so-called superhighway was drawn right through Cross River National Park. In addition to creating a standard 330-foot clearing alongside the pavement, the design of Governor Ayade\u2019s plan would denude a staggering six miles of rain forest on either side of the highway.What\u2019s more, contrary to federal regulations, planners had filed no environmental impact assessment by the time of the project\u2019s scheduled groundbreaking ceremony in September 2015. Not even the barest cost-benefit analysis to justify the probable long-term damage to rain forests, watersheds, communities and endangered species was available.As a result, a coalition of national and international conservation groups fired off a letter to Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, calling for an immediate halt to the project. The coalition offered to help develop alternatives, including securing funding to rehabilitate the state\u2019s two existing highways.When, soon after, the governor submitted plans that showed a slight rerouting, the president flew down from the capital, Abuja, to attend a rescheduled groundbreaking. Even so, an official environmental impact assessment emerged only months later, in March this year, after Nigeria\u2019s environment minister issued a stop-work order. Because of gaping oversights and errors, the assessment received a \u201cD\u201d rating and was sent back for revision. (Even now, the latest version fails to account for the 12-mile-wide corridor, avoids mention of the national park, and refers to species not even found on the African continent.)The state government provoked further outrage when it published a notice revoking all occupancy rights within the highway corridor. That move would effectively uproot at least 180 indigenous communities from their ancestral homes and livelihoods.Opponents argue that these rural minorities and their international supporters are selfishly standing in the way of Nigeria\u2019s growth. Governments everywhere do, of course, use eminent domain to push ahead with major developments, but such projects usually require thorough public consultation and justification, as well as compensation for affected individuals. Neither has been forthcoming in the Cross River case.Governor Ayade claims the highway and seaport will open up the region for iron ore exports and create thousands of jobs. But the acclaimed long-term benefits of the scheme seem even more dubious when you see, as I have, the way the state\u2019s existing highways are allowed to crumble once built. And despite a recent report that a Chinese manufacturer of heavy-duty machinery has joined the project as an investor, it is unclear how the full $3.5 billion project would be funded or maintained. Nigerian taxpayers have been kept largely in the dark.What is certain is that the Cross River superhighway would cause irreparable harm to Nigeria\u2019s last remaining rain forests, some of Africa\u2019s oldest.Even if it were rerouted around the national park, the road would open up a number of protected areas to increased logging, farming and hunting. This would threaten already endangered populations of chimpanzees, red colobus monkeys, forest elephants, slender-snouted crocodiles and pangolins, as well as the Cross River gorillas. And the development would inevitably cause damage to important watersheds and carbon sinks.If the promised trade and investment do not materialize, however, there will be little for Cross River to fall back on. It is hard to imagine that the prospect for eco-tourism will be enhanced if a quarter of the state has been clear-cut for the construction of one road.Instead of building up a wildlife tourism industry that can provide sustainable economic growth, the state may end up with barren lands and nothing to show for it.

{"Headline": "Republicans Expand Control in a Deeply Divided Nation", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported bySOMERS, Wis. \u2014 It is the stunning paradox of American politics. In a bitterly divided nation, where Tuesday\u2019s vote once again showed a country almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, one party now dominates almost everything in American governance.Experts said that no one thing handed the Republicans so much power, even in places like this that were once reliably blue. The current power balance reflects, among other things, the extraordinary dynamics of a race featuring a television-savvy outsider against the first female major party nominee, the vagaries of turnout in a nation where roughly half of registered voters cast ballots, the systematic redrawing of political maps in ways that favored Republicans, and frustration among voters over lost jobs, low wages and the nation\u2019s changing racial and ethnic mix.Republicans will control the governor\u2019s office and both chambers of the state legislature in four more states \u2014 Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri and New Hampshire.At the state level, the outcome means 24 states will be under full Republican control in legislatures and governor\u2019s offices, clearing the way for new policy. Only six states will now have legislatures and governor\u2019s offices exclusively dominated by Democrats, Mr. Storey said.\u201cThe personalities this time were so big and the drama was so big and so rapidly changing and consumed so many people\u2019s attention that it in some respects blinded them to this trend line that this has been bubbling up for many years,\u201d Mr. Walter said. \u201cIt really is the manifestation of this change that we\u2019ve been seeing bubbling up from the bottom for many cycles now.\u201dIn theory, one-party control in a divided nation might spur lawmakers to find bipartisan answers to bipartisan problems. But few people expect that. In Wisconsin, where Republicans took hold of state government years ago though the populace remained somewhat split politically, the political leaders have done the opposite \u2014 pressing forward with a conservative agenda that has included hard-fought measures to reduce labor power, limit abortions and add restrictions on voting that disproportionately affect Democratic constituencies.On Tuesday, Wisconsinites chose a Republican for president, something they had not done since 1984, propelled by worries over the economy and a desire to shake up Washington. Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by about 1 percentage point, or about 27,000 votes. Some voters here said that they were encouraged by a flip to Republican control of Wisconsin\u2019s Legislature and governor\u2019s office six years ago, and favored Mr. Trump in the hopes that he would deliver more of the same to the nation.\u201cThe Republicans didn\u2019t work with the Democrats at all,\u201d said Chris Larson, a state senator, who was among a group of Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois for weeks in 2011 in an unsuccessful attempt to block passage of the collective-bargaining cuts. \u201cThey came in and just did everything as fast as they could. They jammed through everything. And pretty quickly, they had everything they wanted.\u201dIn more than a dozen interviews in Somers, a bedroom community on Lake Michigan dominated by farms, small businesses and a public university, many residents said they were pleasantly surprised to wake up to the news Wednesday morning that their state had flipped from blue to red.They said the deepening conservatism had been years in the making. They had grown discontented with Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, and were turned off by Mrs. Clinton, whom they saw as untrustworthy. At Tina\u2019s Somers Inn on the village\u2019s main commercial strip, one group of retirees sat at a table playing their regular game of euchre while Fox News was on a nearby television.\u201cWe\u2019re still a mix of Democrats and Republicans here \u2014 I don\u2019t think you could call us a red state,\u201d said Dianne Hegewald, 71. \u201cI have very close friends who are Democrats. But the Republican regime is just doing a better job right now.\u201dKaren Ashton, the owner of a gift shop in Somers, said she was a registered independent but was eager for Republicans to have full control of all branches of government. \u201cNow they\u2019ll really be able to get things done,\u201d she said.Some of her friends and neighbors in town are farmers who have been hurt by Environmental Protection Agency regulations and high taxes, she said, sipping a kombucha tea. \u201cThey\u2019re sick of the government,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think that with Trump in there, he can fix all of that.\u201dOne-party rule can produce results, experts say, and it can also produce changes that will benefit the party in power. Control tends to breed more: Legislators have the ability to redraw political maps in the coming years and establish voting rules that benefit their party. Cooperation between state and federal leaders of a single party can speed along results, from infrastructure projects to federal grants.But there are risks, too. Charging too far too fast can cause blowback as quickly as in elections just two years from now.\u201cThere\u2019s always a danger of overreach,\u201d said KC Johnson, a professor of history at Brooklyn College. He noted the Republican dominance in the 1920s, when, he said, a debate over cultural issues tended to overshadow mounting economic questions that eventually culminated in the Great Depression.\u201cThe contrast between attention paid to issues that ultimately proved unimportant and attention not paid to issues that became important later on is interesting. We know how the 1920s end,\u201d he said. It is hard to measure control of so many offices with numeric precision, but he said that Democrats had probably last held a level of power similar to what the Republicans have now between 1937 and 1945.Linda Truesdell, whose family has lived in the Somers area since the 1820s, said on Wednesday that she was disheartened by the Republican takeover. She had twice voted for Mr. Obama, who in 2012 beat Mitt Romney by 12 points in this county; on Tuesday, Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton here by less than one percentage point \u2014 225 votes.\u201cTrump was a television personality and that had a big influence on people,\u201d she said, as she left the town post office and walked toward her pickup truck. \u201cPeople here are thinking that he\u2019s going to solve their problems.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a photo caption accompanying this article misidentified one of the women shown. She is Nicole Ashton, not her mother, Karen Ashton. It also misidentified Nicole\u2019s occupation; she is a co-owner of Tina\u2019s Somers Inn, not a gift shop.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After These Days of Rage", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThis anger is implacable and spectacular. It is causing long-established party systems to dissolve; trust in elites, experts and even basic science to collapse; and overt racism to rear its ugly head again. Democratic norms and institutions are openly disdained; illiberal and authoritarian ideas from the alt-right and far left are moving from the fringe; and everywhere, truth and civility are squeezed out amid rancor and conspiracism.Many people \u2014 enough to transform politics as we have known it \u2014 feel this system to be simply intolerable. Despairing that the sunlit promises made to them will ever come true, they now seek to turn the whole thing upside down, however they may.The angry feel the old parties no longer represent them. In truth, they don\u2019t.The striving middle class is pushed into the ranks of the poor as well-paying jobs, and the social mobility they bring, disappear, sometimes overseas, sometimes as a result of trade deals the establishment parties insisted were in the popular interest. Communities have been devastated, as the civic ecology on which a politics of the common good depends for most folk has been shattered: stable work on which to build a home and a family, pride in identity and place, and a network of supportive institutions and relationships cultivated across generations.So it has proved. The mood of de-subordination has fueled left-wing insurgencies: Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, Corbynism in Britain and, of course, Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d in America. But it has also fueled the right-wing nationalist movements of Donald J. Trump, Nigel Farage and Marine Le Pen (in the United States, Britain and France, respectively). Once loosed, the negative energies of de-subordination can be diverted into the ugliest channels: racism, anti-Semitism, conspiracism and misogyny.And they are not going away after the election on Tuesday. These swamps cannot be drained by economics alone, any more than they were created by economics alone. But without a return to an economics of the common good \u2014 not some impossible utopia, but what the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes called \u201ccommodious living\u201d \u2014 anger will continue to express itself as hate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Identity", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byRace/RelatedAfter last week\u2019s presidential election, many African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics are fearful that the answer to that question is an unequivocal, \u201cNo.\u201dExit polls conducted by Edison Research showed that nearly nine out of 10 black voters said they would be concerned or scared if Mr. Trump moved into the Oval Office, as did about two-thirds of Asians and Hispanics.How do white Trump supporters respond to those concerns?I spoke to an engineer who described the camaraderie of his multiracial workplace, a retired forklift driver who would like to see illegal immigrants deported, and others.All of them reflected on what they would like to say to anxious black and brown Americans.These conversations, which have been condensed and edited for clarity, reflect only a sampling of the opinions held by the millions of voters who support our president-elect. But they offer some insight at a time when many readers are hungry for dialogue and understanding across racial and political lines.\u2014No, it doesn\u2019t surprise me (that people of color are worried). It\u2019s been that way for so long with minorities over the years, with how people have treated other races. Some people still do look at (minorities) like that. I know some of them personally.But that\u2019s not me. I actually voted for Obama, just the first time. I saw something in him that I liked. I didn\u2019t see anything in the Republican side then.We don\u2019t live in the 1960s or the 1800s anymore. There\u2019s people out there that do things wrong and should be looked at differently. There are people who start fires and burn buildings, people who go out to start a riot. That\u2019s not called for.I believe some of it needs to be investigated. It may be that some people are infiltrating the Black Lives Matter group. Not all of them are bad people. There are people who calmly and peacefully have their protests, people who do good for people and do good for America. As long as you\u2019re not the kind doing the wrong thing, I think everything will be ok.I\u2019ve heard about stop and frisk and if it helps lower crime and stops people shooting in the streets, what\u2019s a few hurt feelings? That\u2019s my opinion. It\u2019s better than seeing people die.I personally think they\u2019re overthinking the things he was saying. I think, you know, things will work out for the best. Everybody will eventually come together and make things work.It\u2019s America. We\u2019re all here for each other.At least we\u2019re supposed to be, right?\u2014Michael Tepedino, a 47-year-old structural engineer and a registered Republican, said he works with a diverse group of colleagues in Charlotte, N.C.I work with people of all races and all colors. I would just say that there\u2019s no need to fear the presidency of Donald Trump.He\u2019s not out to get you. He\u2019s out, not only to unite the country, but to make it a better place for everybody.Black people who say they\u2019re afraid of a Trump presidency, I think their fears are unfounded. I don\u2019t have any reason to think Donald Trump is going to treat anyone differently because they\u2019re black.Now, if you came into the country illegally, you\u2019ve broken the law, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Hispanic or German or Canadian, they have something to worry about. They\u2019re probably going to get deported. But I know plenty of Hispanics who are totally legal. They have nothing to fear.Muslims, if they have ties to any radical temples, that\u2019s something they need to worry about. I know there are Muslims in the United States who are totally fine. They are great people.But people who are Muslim who believe in Sharia law and support ISIS, those are the people that everyone would have a problem with.It\u2019s the campaign people, the fearmongers who are trying to instill fear in those people, saying if you vote for the Republicans, he\u2019s going to give tax breaks to the white rich man.But I think Trump is smarter than that. If he\u2019s alienating half of the country, that is going to make life hard for him. He doesn\u2019t want that. It will be advantageous to him to have a United States of America, not a divided states of America.\u2014Julia McGath, a 66-year-old retired forklift driver, lives in Zanesville, Ohio and works part-time at a retail store. One plant she worked for relocated its operations overseas. She believes Mr. Trump will bring jobs back to the United States, cut the national debt and reduce spending on entitlements.I drove a forklift for 24.5 years at a warehouse. I\u2019ve worked union all my life and I always voted Democrat. Obama, he talked about change, change, change. I did vote for him, both times. But nothing changed. I didn\u2019t vote for Hillary because it would be four more years of nothing getting done.I\u2019m concerned about all the entitlements. That\u2019s the big deal for me. I\u2019ve worked all my life, and with God\u2019s help I\u2019ve not taken any handouts. But there are so many people who live off that their whole life.I would say (people of color are fearful now) because they\u2019re not going to get their entitlements. They\u2019re probably afraid they\u2019re going to lose their green card, or whatever they have going to get a free load with.I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t feel bad for people who are poor, but I\u2019m voicing fear for my kids, too. My daughter was working for nine years at the post office, working six days a week for nine years, and it was temporary, no benefits or anything. My kids work their tails off. They see people living off our paychecks.If people are living right and not breaking the law and doing what they should be doing, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason to worry. Honestly, if they just prayed more, they wouldn\u2019t have to be worried.I never heard about stop and frisk. I can\u2019t imagine them stopping and frisking people for no reason at all. The cops have plenty to do without doing that. That sounds like harassment to me.But if they\u2019re illegal here, they need to be worried. He\u2019s going to find some way to fix the system and move them out.I\u2019m not sure about a registry for Muslims living here. But I was really concerned that we were going to let a whole mess of refugees in. I certainly don\u2019t want them to bring in Syrians or ISIS. We need to take care of us for a change.\u2014He wants to be the president for everybody. We\u2019re all Americans. We need to stop isolating ourselves and voting in blocks based on ethnicity. We need to become Americans and live the American dream. We all have the opportunity; we just need to take it.But if they\u2019re Muslim and they\u2019re coming from Syria, we don\u2019t want them here. If they\u2019re Muslim and coming from Paris and they don\u2019t have a clean record, we don\u2019t want them here.We don\u2019t want to bring in any hostile Muslims. Our C.I.A. and F.B.I. said we can\u2019t vet these people.I think it\u2019s completely appropriate to have a registry for people who are here on visas. I don\u2019t think he was talking about a registry for Muslim citizens. That would be against the Constitution.He\u2019s talking about protecting us and building a wall and getting rid of people who are hurting us. That will be beneficial for all us of us, Latinos, blacks, whites, Muslims, all of us.He says outrageous things sometimes. But if you take out the bombast and look at the substance of what he\u2019s saying, he\u2019s never wrong. He\u2019s always right.It would be totally appropriate for the attorney general to look into Black Lives Matter. It\u2019s against the law to incite riot and if you listen to their rhetoric, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. And if it is deemed constitutional, I would support stop and frisk. The police need that tool.If opportunities are made, if the economy is made better, if he\u2019s successful in making America great again, once all the people are working and there are opportunities for everyone, a lot of the distrust and the animus will fade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Europe Needs to Hear from Trump", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMunich \u2014 America owes Donald J. Trump an open mind and a chance to lead, Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday. So does Europe.But understandably, Europeans are deeply worried about some of the views expressed by Mr. Trump during the campaign. This moment of trans-Atlantic uncertainty must end quickly. It is essential for the president-elect to explain his plans without delay. How will he square the circle between strengthening America\u2019s global role while at the same time reducing America\u2019s foreign commitments \u2014 both goals he has announced? If he really means what he says about the value of NATO (or lack thereof), what exactly does he intend to do?Both Europe and Mr. Trump need to switch now from campaign mode to policy mode. Instead of waiting for the Trump inaugural speech, Europe should enumerate its own policy expectations and demonstrate how much the United States can continue to benefit from a close partnership with it.On this basis, Mr. Trump might then also be able to engage directly with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and try to bring about a new d\u00e9tente. Europe would certainly not be opposed to a renewed push for summit diplomacy. But these efforts must not compromise the security of our Eastern European allies.Not reassuring the Europeans would be tantamount to pulling the rug out from under the NATO alliance. Historically, it has always been cheaper for the United States to actively underwrite European security instead of leaving Europe largely on its own. President-elect Trump can and should push for more equitable burden-sharing. The Europeans may not be easy partners; even Barack Obama often got frustrated with Europe\u2019s indecisiveness and free-riding tendencies. But wherever Mr. Trump looks, he will not find better partners to work with to secure America\u2019s strategic interests and to serve as force multipliers for its military power.But Europe shouldn\u2019t wait for Mr. Trump. Europeans need to come up with a strategy of their own to engage him, but also to hedge against a possible shift in American grand strategy. The challenges are tremendous \u2014 and it is in Europe\u2019s self-interest to speak with one voice, and to be a more credible and capable actor in regional and global crisis management. For that, Europe needs to invest more in civilian and military capabilities, and to start pooling and sharing defense assets more comprehensively.Second, Europe expects the Trump administration to support and propose initiatives to build an even stronger trans-Atlantic economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors, Democrats and Republicans alike, have built a liberal economic world order, based on the idea of open and free trade. Mr. Trump should reassure the world that he will not question this fundamental strategy. Or would he be willing to risk a new trade war, letting loose a cascade of protectionist measures at the end of which we will all be worse off?European companies would not steal blue-collar jobs from the United States. Nor would Europeans engage in dumping. They are partners, not opponents, in securing a fair global trade system. Without a vibrant trans-Atlantic economic exchange, \u201cmaking America great again\u201d will remain an unreachable goal.Finally, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign comments have been unacceptable for those of us who believe in the open and truthful exchange of ideas for the greater good. In Europe, we have long looked to the United States as a model democracy, the shining city upon a hill. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany found the right words when congratulating Mr. Trump on his victory: Enumerating the list of shared values that bind the United States and Europe, she offered her cooperation \u2014 \u201cbased on these values.\u201d Leading the free world, even for Mr. Trump, will not work in the absence of a clear commitment to these values.Without a strong trans-Atlantic alliance under responsible American leadership, the free world as we know it may soon no longer exist. We all live in difficult and dangerous times. Our adversaries are waiting for us to become disunited, disoriented and thus more vulnerable. Clearly, there is no job in the world that comes with more global responsibility than that of president of the United States.During his campaign, Donald Trump used the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But securing American greatness will not succeed without the United States\u2019 best allies, many of whom are now concerned about America\u2019s future foreign policy. Mr. President-elect, I am happy to invite you to present your vision at the Munich Security Conference, where key trans-Atlantic leaders will meet in mid-February. For decades, the United States has served as the main stabilizing force in the world and has greatly benefited from a stable order. As you set out to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d we trust you will not make the world afraid again.Wolfgang Ischinger is the chairman of the Munich Security Conference and teaches at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.

{"Headline": "Video Review: Buick Envision, a Crossover With a Chinese Heritage", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byDrivenTHE new Buick Envision might seem like any other two-row crossover sport utility vehicle available in the United States, but for a crucial distinction. It is the first mainstream vehicle to come to this country from China.Although designed and engineered in America, Envision is assembled in China. Yep, just like your iPhone. (Purists might argue that Volvo was first in the United States with a Chinese-built S60, but that has been only a long-wheelbase version of the car.)Buick is exceedingly popular in China. Elite leaders of the past, including Pu Yi, Sun Yat-sen and Zhou Enlai, were driven in American-made Buicks. That pedigree (and the shabby quality of domestic Chinese cars in the past) catapulted the mark to great success in China.The Envision slots between the tiny Buick Encore, which is assembled in South Korea, and the large Michigan-made three-row Buick Enclave. Although a limited number of 2016-model Envisions from China were quietly introduced a few months ago, it is with the 2017 models that Buick is playing up the vehicle\u2019s American market entry.Buick has held focus groups in the United States and says that \u2014 unlike politicians, unions and auto journalists \u2014 buyers care little about where a vehicle is built, as long as it is welded and screwed together well. The Envision seems well constructed. The design presents itself as nondescript at first, but it grew more handsome to my eye as the week progressed.During that time, not a single squeak or rattle developed. The pleasant cabin has stitching on the dash. Opinions will vary over the faux-wood trim and the few hard-plastic panels, strategically out of sight and touch, in the interior. But remember: Buick is only a near-luxury brand. For G.M., it is Cadillac that does the luxe heavy lifting against Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.Envision embodies Buick\u2019s mission of coddling passengers in a quiet, comfortable cocoon after a hard day\u2019s work. That is something both Americans and Chinese can appreciate. The stout chassis is constructed to a large extent from high-strength steel. And because Buick banished its pillowy ride reputation long ago, the Envision soaks up bumps and impacts impressively, yet cornering doesn\u2019t suffer much.In contrast to some vehicles in its class, there are no changeable drive modes, paddle shifters or active suspension here. Engineers simply locked in a good balance of comfort and control. Frankly, it is the setup most adjustable cars default to upon start-up. You would have to drive the Envision\u2019s most direct competitors \u2014 Acura RDX and Lincoln MKC \u2014 back-to-back to discern the differences in handling.That could be because I\u2019m driving a Premier model running with a 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. In addition to 252 horsepower and 260 pound feet of torque, the Envision\u2019s turbo models receive G.M.\u2019s HiPer Strut front suspension and an upgraded all-wheel-drive system that employs torque vectoring in the rear for better traction. The standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder provides 197 horsepower and 192 pound feet of torque. Both engines get 6-speed automatic gearboxes.In a hurry? Go with the turbo. With 0-60 runs in the 8-second range, pep is respectable. Envision\u2019s fuel-saving engine start-stop system is the best I have experienced, its operation going unnoticed at first. (That is crucial because it cannot be disabled.)The Environmental Protection Agency rates the fuel economy of my turbo A.W.D. tester at 20 city, 26 highway on specified premium. That\u2019s similar to the Acura and Lincoln.For passengers in the rear, seating slides fore and aft for extra leg room. Those seat backs recline, the floor is flat and the rear has its own climate zone and heated cushions. There is also a power port and two USB jacks for device charging.Envision\u2019s back quarters are roomy enough. But assess rear headroom closely if the giant glass roof is on your option list.For cargo, seats split 60/40, with no ski pass-through. Handy storage compartments are under the load floor. There is a spare tire, too, which not all cars have these days.This year, Consumer Reports rates Buick third in reliability after Lexus and Toyota.The Envision starts at $35,000 for a base front-drive model. My Premium example stickers for about $44,000, on par with the competition. In China, G.M. is on pace to sell 200,000 Envisions this year. United States sales results remain to be tallied.But wherever it is made, the Envision is an S.U.V. that Buick needs to attract buyers, no matter where they live.An earlier version of this article referrred incorrectly to the model being reviewed in two instances. It is the Buick Envision, not the Enclave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving Today\u2019s Car a Well-Tuned Interior", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byWheelsIT can make engines sound like purring pussycats \u2014 or growling tigers.Through the wizardry of digital technology some of today\u2019s most sophisticated vehicles, like the GMC Sierra Denali, are designed to keep annoying engine noise from seeping into the cabin.Others, like the Lexus NX F Sport, include digital tuners to accentuate the engine\u2019s throaty growl to satisfy the primal urges of driver and passengers.And sometimes \u2014 in a seeming contradiction \u2014 the same car does a bit of both.In the Nissan Maxima, for example, noise-cancellation technology helps suppress undesirable droning frequencies from the engine. But the throb of horsepower is acoustically amplified when the driver steps on the gas.\u201cIt\u2019s about the driver\u2019s comfort,\u201d explained Aaron Gauger, a product planning manager at Nissan. \u201cBut we also want the driver to have a good experience during acceleration.\u201dAll of this, like so much else in modern automobiles, happens through the magic of digital software and hardware.\u201cThere are many companies that are using noise cancellation to make your ride quieter,\u201d said Grant Courville, a senior director at the software company QNX, a BlackBerry subsidiary whose technology is used in Chrysler, Ford and Honda vehicles. Suppressing noise digitally can reduce the need for insulation, helping to make vehicles lighter and thus improving fuel economy.Noise cancellation can also improve the accuracy of voice recognition for navigation systems and other controls in cars. In addition, it can make it easier to appreciate the music from sophisticated onboard audio systems, or even make it easier to have conversations in the capacious cabin of a seven-seater S.U.V.Noise-cancellation systems use multiple microphones (usually positioned near the driver\u2019s and passengers\u2019 ears in the liner of the vehicle\u2019s ceilings) to detect sounds in the interior, isolating particular unwanted wavelengths and frequencies. Software and digital signal processors then use the car\u2019s audio system to create countervailing waveforms that are broadcast over the speakers to block the original noise.Not all unwanted sounds can be eliminated. The noises in and around a car \u2014 like the whine of tires on different surfaces, the rush of wind through an open window or a road crew\u2019s jackhammers \u2014 are too varied and changing to cancel out completely.\u201cWe can\u2019t create a cone of silence \u2014 yet,\u201d said Alan Norton, senior technical leader for audio quality at Ford.Bose, which has been working on active noise cancellation with automakers including Nissan and General Motors since 2010, says the technology is necessarily more complex than that employed in the company\u2019s familiar noise-canceling headphones, which some travelers wear on jetliners to block the steady droning of engines.\u201cHeadphones cancel broadband noise,\u201d explained John Pelliccio, a product manager in the automotive division at Bose. \u201cThe noise canceling that we do in cars is designed to go after specific engine harmonics.\u201dThat can mean eliminating lower-frequency engine sounds, some of which result from newer fuel-saving designs. Cylinder deactivation, for example, which can turn off four cylinders in a V8 at cruising speed to save gas, may also generate booms, throbs and other noises that may make drivers think something is wrong with the car.Mr. Pelliccio said Bose\u2019s active noise canceling can reduce such annoyances by tapping into the car\u2019s computers to determine the status of the cylinders and the engine load in real time, and making the necessary acoustical adjustments.The technology relies on complex algorithms that are tuned to specific vehicle interiors, accounting for reflective glass surfaces, the position of passengers, and even such details as whether there are cloth or leather seats.\u201cThere\u2019s also a signature to every engine,\u201d Mr. Pelliccio said, \u201cand automakers are particular about which harmonics they want to enter the cabin and which ones they don\u2019t.\u201dThat is where the ability to enhance engine sounds can come into play. Because the current generation of smaller, more fuel-efficient engines and turbochargers often does not generate the sort of throaty resonance drivers expect, automakers design systems to augment the sonic experience.In some ways it is a tradition that stretches back at least as far as the 1960s with Thrush\u2019s hot-rod mufflers. But unlike those chrome-plated exhaust pipes, which were meant to spur the admiration \u2014 or annoyance \u2014 of people on the street, today\u2019s digital engine enhancements are usually aimed at the driver and passengers inside the car.\u201cWhat we do is essentially the same,\u201d Mr. Pelliccio said, \u201cexcept we\u2019re doing it electronically and playing it through the speakers.\u201dHe noted that consumers in different parts of the world have different opinions on what constitutes a \u201cgood\u201d engine sound. In the past, for example, car companies might have had to design different exhaust systems for a European car and an American model of the same car.\u201cToday,\u201d Mr. Pelliccio said, \u201cwe can just change the software.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to Announce Carrier Plant Will Keep Jobs in U.S.", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byFrom the earliest days of his campaign, Donald J. Trump made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big air-conditioner company, to move over 2,000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a tailor-made talking point for him on the stump.On Thursday, Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, Indiana\u2019s governor and the vice president-elect, plan to appear at Carrier\u2019s Indianapolis factory to announce a deal with the company to keep roughly 1,000 jobs in the state, according to officials with the transition team as well as Carrier.Mr. Trump will be hard-pressed to alter the economic forces that have hammered the Rust Belt for decades, but forcing Carrier and its parent company, United Technologies, to reverse course is a powerful tactical strike that will hearten his followers even before he takes office.\u201cI\u2019m ready for him to come,\u201d said Robin Maynard, a 24-year veteran of Carrier who builds high-efficiency furnaces and earns almost $24 an hour. \u201cNow I can put my daughter through college without having to look for another job.\u201dIt also signals that Mr. Trump is a different kind of Republican, willing to take on big business, at least in individual cases.And just as only a confirmed anti-Communist like Richard Nixon could go to China, so only a businessman like Mr. Trump could take on corporate America without being called a Bernie Sanders-style socialist. If Barack Obama had tried the same maneuver, he\u2019d probably have drawn criticism for intervening in the free market.In exchange for keeping the factory running in Indianapolis, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence are expected to reiterate their campaign pledges to be friendlier to businesses by easing regulations and overhauling the corporate tax code, according to a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump.The state of Indiana also plans to give economic incentives to Carrier as part of the deal to stay, according to local officials.The message from Mr. Trump that captivated the Carrier workers \u2014 keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States after decades of losses to overseas factories and automation \u2014 resonated throughout the Rust Belt. That promise, plus his opposition to pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, were key reasons he was able to edge out Hillary Clinton in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Political symbolism aside, saving 1,000 Carrier jobs doesn\u2019t loom so large in an economy that\u2019s created an average of 181,000 jobs a month this year, noted Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served as adviser in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011.Still, he confessed a grudging admiration for Mr. Trump\u2019s political jujitsu. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t so scared of the damage a Trump administration might do, I\u2019d find it refreshing to see an administration fighting for factory jobs like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, no one should confuse what Trump is doing here with sustainable economic policy.\u201dHow the president-elect\u2019s deal measures up to U.S. manufacturing job losses.Over the long term, and for less prominent firms, the temptation to move to cheaper locales for manufacturing will stay great, said Robert Reich, a prominent liberal Democrat who served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration.\u201cMemories are short but the economic fundamentals remain the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWall Street is breathing down companies\u2019 necks to cut costs, and the labor savings in Mexico is too great.\u201dMr. Trump first announced he was talking to Carrier on Thanksgiving Day via Twitter, which the company quickly confirmed. The discussions have continued this week, and with a tentative deal in hand on Tuesday, transition officials scheduled Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Pence\u2019s visit to Indianapolis.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this quick,\u201d Mr. Maynard said.While the standoff loomed large in the lives of its employees in Indiana, for United Technologies the forgone savings is tiny \u2014 equivalent to about 2 cents per share in earnings.\u201cEvery penny counts, but if we step back and I\u2019m looking at earnings of $6.60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-elect listens to some of the company\u2019s bigger concerns,\u201d said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York.When Carrier announced in February that the two Indiana factories would be closing, it did offer benefits to employees facing layoffs, including paying for them to go back to school and retrain for other careers. Even with that, however, once the layoffs were to begin in mid-2017, most of the workers would have had a hard time finding jobs that paid anywhere near the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran line workers earn.Carrier is best known for its air-conditioners, but it also sells a variety of other heating and cooling equipment for homes and businesses, like the gas furnaces and fan coils for electric furnaces made at the Indianapolis factory. The jobs in Indiana Mr. Trump has referred to are in two separate sites \u2014 the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, with 1,400 employees, and a United Technologies factory in Huntington, Ind., with 700.While Carrier will forfeit some $65 million a year in savings the move was supposed to generate, that\u2019s a small price to pay to avoid the public relations damage from moving the jobs as well as a possible threat to United Technologies\u2019 far-larger military contracting business.Roughly 10 percent of United Technologies\u2019 $56 billion in revenue comes from the federal government; the Pentagon is its single largest customer. With $4 billion in profit last year, the company has the flexibility to find the savings elsewhere.Members of Congress have been pressing to punish big military contractors if they move jobs outside the United States.Many industrial companies face intense pressure from Wall Street to increase profits, even when the economy grows slowly \u2014 a major reason United Technologies decided to move.That won\u2019t change after Mr. Trump takes office \u2014 especially when hourly pay in the Indianapolis plant is equivalent to what workers in Mexico make in a day.\u201cThis is a spot solution,\u201d said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. \u201cIf it goes through it helps some Carrier employees for a period of time, but it doesn\u2019t address the loss of manufacturing jobs to technological change, which will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Anthropocene Journey", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "In the essay, I explore the host of meanings and debates that have emerged around the word, saying, \u201cAfter 16 years of percolation and debate, anthropocene has become the closest thing there is to common shorthand for this turbulent, momentous, unpredictable, hopeless, hopeful time\u00e2\u0080\u0094duration and scope still unknown.\u201dIn 2000, after a century of earlier efforts by scholars, scientists, and at least one journalist (me) to give a name to humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emerging role as a planet-scale force, one word emerged in a heated moment at a global change conference in Cuernavaca, Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0094anthropocene.It appears to be here for the long haul. After 16 years of percolation and debate, anthropocene has become the closest thing there is to common shorthand for this turbulent, momentous, unpredictable, hopeless, hopeful time\u00e2\u0080\u0094duration and scope still unknown.The word is still so novel that no one has even settled on how to pronounce it; the British stress the second syllable and Americans the first. That seems appropriate, given that reactions to the emergence of the term\u00e2\u0080\u0094let alone the actual environmental changes it aims to describe\u00e2\u0080\u0094have come in all colors and flavors. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even been a spirited push for alternatives, some rather biting.The anthropocene (both the word and the unfolding age) has so much Rorschach-like plasticity that all I can offer as guidance are my informed but subjective reflections based on what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned and unlearned in my long, quirky journey. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that what matters most is not resolving some common meaning so much as engaging in deeply felt discussions, fresh lines of inquiry, and new proposals for sustaining the human journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which have been sparked by the emergence of this concept.To navigate this terrain,\u00c2\u00a0it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to start with the foundational anthropocene idea, as blurted out in February 2000 during a scientific meeting on human-caused global change. A prominent participant was Paul J. Crutzen, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d won a Nobel Prize for helping identify the threat certain synthetic chemicals posed to the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protective ozone layer. At the meeting, his frustration grew as peers described momentous shifts in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating systems, but always anchored them in time by mentioning the Holocene. Holocene is the formal name for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwholly recent\u00e2\u0080\u009d epoch of planetary history that began at the end of the last ice age 11,700 years ago.At one point, Crutzen couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold back. He interrupted a colleague, as the scientist Will Steffen later described: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop using the word Holocene. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in the Holocene any more. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 (searching for the right word) \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the Anthropocene!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cConsidering these \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 major and still growing impacts of human activities on Earth and atmosphere, and at all, including global, scales, it seems to us more than appropriate to emphasize the central role of mankind in geology and ecology by proposing to use the term \u00e2\u0080\u0098anthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for the current geological epoch.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCrutzen and several collaborators refined the concept in subsequent papers. The term quickly spread, propelled in a dizzying array of directions as if filling a linguistic vacuum. It began popping up in peer-reviewed literature in a variety of disciplines and eventually spawned at least three scientific journals (and one magazine) using \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d in their titles.But a long road lay ahead. The following year, Zalasiewicz and some colleagues began assembling a working group on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the invitation of one of the 16 subcommissions of the International Commission on Stratigraphy. Those quotation marks around \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappear until some final judgment on the validity of a new epoch is reached.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps earth scientists of the future will name this new post-Holocene era for its causative element\u00e2\u0080\u0094for us. We are entering an age that might someday be referred to as, say, the Anthrocene. After all, it is a geological age of our own making. The challenge now is to find a way to act that will make geologists of the future look upon this age as a remarkable time, a time in which a species began to take into account the long-term impact of its actions. The alternative will be to leave a legacy of irresponsibility and neglect that will manifest itself in the fossil record as just one more mass extinction\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the record of bones and empty footprints left behind by the dinosaurs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dReflecting on this now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite certain that when I wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cearth scientists of the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was thinking generations, if not centuries, into the future. But it took just eight years for scientific rigor to be applied to the idea of an anthropogenic geological age. We do live in fast-forward times.~~According to the dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition, the Anthropocene is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe era of geological time during which human activity is considered to be the dominant influence on the environment, climate, and ecology of the earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore including it, the OED editors had wisely let the word percolate for 14 years after it first entered widespread discourse. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that they jumped the gun in one important technical way and missed the main, grander meaning of the word. That second point is not a criticism; it just reflects the plasticity and richness of this still-emerging neologism.The technical problem with the definition? The word, despite having roots springing so directly from stratigraphic nomenclature, could still end up rejected as a formal \u00e2\u0080\u009cera of geological time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2026Many influential stratigraphers have expressed deep skepticism that the Anthropocene deserves formal standing. For one thing, any new addition to the time scale must be useful to science. Calling an abrupt end to the Holocene could achieve the opposite, creating confusion in the literature. There are significant debates over when to mark the starting point or lower boundary of the Anthropocene in the time scale.Now in its seventh year, the working group has been under pressure to complete its formal recommendation to the stratigraphic commission. Almost daily, emails fly back and forth among its 35 members, refining drafts of papers (including a response to Finney and Edwards) and planning next steps. There have been three face-to-face meetings of the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s members, most recently in Oslo in April 2016.Coincidentally, that meeting kicked off on the 46th Earth Day. We gathered around a long table in an ornate room at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in a mansion built a century ago by the famed Arctic explorer for whom the institute was named. For two long days, discussions led by Zalasiewicz and Colin Waters of the British Geological Survey centered on a review of the \u00e2\u0080\u009carguments against formalization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The 17 bullet points ranged from the technical and straightforward\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cstratigraphic record is minimal \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 based on predictions \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the testy and provocative\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c[T]he Anthropocene is political, not scientific.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As if to remind participants of the gravity of the task, there was a plastic-laminated copy of the scale itself at each seat, along with the usual array of writing pads and pens.And now the revolutionary genetic editing tool CRISPR is poised to imprint humans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambitions on that tree at least as profoundly as fossil fuels have changed the physical world. I also noted that the sparring in the stratigraphy community strongly echoed fights that had first erupted in meteorology and climate science 25 years ago, as new lines of evidence and new tools, such as global climate models, pointed to a growing and disruptive human warming influence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. But I stressed, using climate change as an example, that it is possible to separate the \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\u00e2\u0080\u009d of science from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cought\u00e2\u0080\u009d of society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices. With some bumps and bruises, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had found a way forward. Now it was geology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn.There was some irony in the stroll each day between our hotel and the Nansen Institute. It took us along the shore in front of a giant Jenga-block scramble of horizontal white towers that belong to Statoil. Norway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly state-owned oil company has contributed substantially not only to Norway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy but also to global climate change. Even as Norway was adding incentives for drivers to buy electric vehicles to take advantage of ample domestic hydro-electric power, the company announced plans to expand drilling in the Barents Sea to boost fossil-fuel exports. One got the impression that decisions made in that building would have a bigger impact on world affairs than any conclusions we produced.But there was a second layer of irony there on the windswept shores of the fjord. The grassy stretch along the sinuous path was also a sculpture park. A vertical slab rose from the grass directly in front of the Statoil building, imprinted with an image of one of Easter Island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moai\u00e2\u0080\u0094the haunting stone figures carved at the potent pinnacle of the great, but vanished, Rapa Nui civilization.While many geologists worry that a human-etched epoch grants us too much power on the basis of too little evidence, a few think the proponents of the geological Anthropocene are thinking way too small. One such expert is Jay Quade of the University of Arizona. After decades of fieldwork and lab analysis on six continents, Quade\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose father and grandfather were geologists\u00e2\u0080\u0094seems to live, breathe, and eat insights from ancient rock. I met him in June at a Santa Fe, New Mexico, gathering of scientists focused on the Quaternary Period. He credited the efforts of Crutzen and scientists such as those in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d working group for all that they were doing but said his reading of the evidence pointed to an even more massive unfolding geological transition. It could, he believed, be akin to\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not bigger than\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Permian-Triassic mass extinction 250 million years ago and the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction that cleared out the dinosaurs and led to the Age of Mammals\u00e2\u0080\u0094and us.Time will tell.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Two Putin Problem", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionWASHINGTON \u2014 With a single phone conversation this month, Donald J. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin have started talk of another \u201creset\u201d in ties between Russia and the United States. A new president, of course, has every reason to seek improved relations. But what could make this \u201creset\u201d work? Mr. Trump rightly believes there may be opportunities in the relationship. They\u2019re just not the ones he thinks.To succeed, the president-elect must see that there are really two Putins \u2014 one confident, cagey and effective; the other defensive, isolated and unsure of himself.The confident Putin has used Russian power more boldly than any leader, Russian or Soviet, in many decades. In the last 10 years, he has doubled military spending, renovated his armed forces and deployed them abroad. His international exploits \u2014 especially the seizure of Crimea in 2014 \u2014 have brought him near-absolute political dominance at home. He has fashioned new tools (from cyberhacking to a lavishly funded propaganda machine) for meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs. He mocks Western governments as weak and hypocritical, and seems to enjoy his role as bad-boy statesman.Mr. Trump obviously relates to this strutting Putin. But there\u2019s another Putin, too: the one who knows his country is entering the third year of a recession, one of the worst recent performances among major economies. With foreign direct investment in Russia down 90 percent in three years, future growth will be slow. Mr. Putin himself has said major reforms are needed. But he has not proposed any. How can he? Real reform would threaten the systemic corruption on which Putinism rests.This second Putin knows his country\u2019s living standards have dropped sharply. In 2013, 41 percent of middle-class Russians said they were in good shape economically; today, just 22 percent do. Russia\u2019s government feels the pinch, too. Budgets for health, education, pensions, even the military are all on the chopping block.Both Putins aim to restore respect for Russia as a great power. Yet neither has been able to do so. With other leaders, Russia\u2019s president suffers from a reputation for dishonesty and double-dealing. And all over the world, polls show greater popular confidence in President Obama than in Mr. Putin. In Europe, the margin is a staggering five to one.Mr. Trump will need to slow the aggressive momentum of the first Putin and play on the anxiety of the second. There may be room in such a relationship for strongman-to-strongman shows of \u201crespect,\u201d but Mr. Trump must not kid himself. The key to winning Mr. Putin\u2019s respect \u2014 and to assuring his restraint \u2014 is to leave no doubt about America\u2019s military, economic and diplomatic power.It will surely surprise Mr. Trump to hear it, but the policies he inherits from the Obama administration provide the essential ingredients for such a relationship. Europe is the critical case. Russian aggression and confrontation there have not cracked trans-Atlantic unity. Western support has held Ukraine together and confined separatists to two small enclaves. Sanctions have deepened Russia\u2019s economic downturn. All NATO members have pledged to increase military spending. And the alliance plans to deploy small military units to new members, creating a needed tripwire against Russian pressure.Only by understanding this record, rather than disparaging it, can Mr. Trump achieve \u2014 and profit from \u2014 chummy personal relations with his Russian counterpart. Let\u2019s imagine, for example, that the second, anxious Putin decided to accept an outstretched hand from Washington as cover for extricating himself from the stalemate he has created in eastern Ukraine. If so, President Trump would have a shot at reviving the long-blocked \u201cMinsk 2\u201d agreement, which obliges Russia to withdraw while Ukraine allows some form of autonomy for the eastern separatists.Mr. Trump should know the risks of this respect-for-retreat strategy. Once Mr. Putin decides he wants out of eastern Ukraine, he\u2019ll find a way to go ahead with the Minsk 2 deal. But he won\u2019t even consider backtracking if he thinks he can get what he wants for nothing. That\u2019s why the new president must insist on a real solution in Ukraine, not a cosmetic one.Giving Russia relief from sanctions without a complete withdrawal would only make Mr. Trump look like a chump. He would have failed to check the first Putin, and let the second one off the hook. Russian-American relations would face new challenges. They would become less stable, not more.If Mr. Trump plays the two Putins right, he has a chance to move forward on other issues. Russian officials have expressed little interest in new arms control talks. But that was before Russian military spending came under pressure. Having promised his own buildup, Mr. Trump is in a position to re-engage Mr. Putin on the broad issue of strategic nuclear stability. (Doing so will have will have the further benefit of making it easier for European governments to maintain Ukraine-related sanctions.)Finally, Mr. Trump says he wants to work with Russia in defeating terrorists. It\u2019s a worthy goal, but at least as difficult to achieve as real peace in Ukraine. The new president won\u2019t get the Russians to cooperate against the Islamic State in Syria just by saying, as he did during his campaign, that he wants to bomb its forces just as ferociously as Mr. Putin does. Unless the United States has its own workable strategy and can begin to show results from it, Mr. Trump\u2019s outreach to Mr. Putin is almost certain to fail.For all the failures of his Middle East policy, President Obama leaves behind a better approach than his successor appreciates. The administration\u2019s continuing effort to retake Mosul, the biggest Islamic State stronghold in Iraq, offers a more promising model for lasting regional influence than Mr. Putin\u2019s bludgeoning use of air power in Syria. Its elements \u2014 the patient corralling of groups that have been unable to work together, the small-footprint use of advisers and assistance, the sensitivity to civilian casualties, the support of friends and allies in the region \u2014 all point up how America\u2019s antiterrorism strategy differs from Russia\u2019s, and is more likely to succeed.Before the election, Russian commentators had begun to explain Mr. Putin\u2019s milder tone in talking about the United States as a way of preparing for the next American president \u2014 that is, for Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump should ponder this story. It seems the prospect of dealing with a new leader whom Mr. Putin knew to be tough made him more cautious. Perhaps he had heard what Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, said about how to deal with Russia: \u201cI\u2019m not giving up anything for nothing.\u201dMr. Trump doesn\u2019t have to say who gave him this idea. He just has to act on it.Advertisement"}

Trump on Sunday chose Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and a loyal campaign adviser, to be his White House chief of staff, turning to a Washington insider whose friendship with the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, could help secure early legislative victories.In selecting Mr. Priebus, Mr. Trump passed over Stephen K. Bannon, a right-wing media provocateur. But the president-elect named Mr. Bannon his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, signaling an embrace of the fringe ideology long advanced by Mr. Bannon and of a continuing disdain for the Republican establishment.The dual appointments \u2014 with Mr. Bannon given top billing in the official announcement \u2014 instantly created rival centers of power in the Trump White House.Mr. Bannon\u2019s selection demonstrated the power of grass-roots activists who backed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Some of them have long traded in the conspiracy theories and sometimes racist messages of Breitbart News, the website that Mr. Bannon ran for much of the past decade.The site has accused President Obama of \u201cimporting more hating Muslims\u201d; compared Planned Parenthood\u2019s work to the Holocaust; called the conservative commentator Bill Kristol a \u201crenegade Jew\u201d; and advised female victims of online harassment to \u201cjust log off\u201d and stop \u201cscrewing up the internet for men,\u201d illustrating that point with a picture of a crying child.The grass-roots activists may be angered by the selection of Mr. Priebus as chief of staff, viewing him as a deal maker who will be too eager to push the new president toward compromise on issues like taxes, immigration, trade, health care and the environment.In a statement Sunday afternoon, the transition team emphasized that the two men would work \u201cas equal partners to transform the federal government.\u201dThe arrangement appeared aimed at ensuring that both men would be required to sign off on many decisions jointly. And Mr. Bannon was assured that he reports directly to Mr. Trump, not to Mr. Priebus.The simultaneous announcement and competing lines of authority are consistent with Mr. Trump\u2019s management style in his businesses and in his campaign: creating rival power structures beneath him and encouraging them to battle it out.It is also a reflection of who has the ear of the president-elect: his children, and especially his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both had argued that the chief of staff job should not be held by someone too controversial, according to several people familiar with the decision-making inside the transition effort.Mr. Kushner is likely to wield great influence over the new president regardless of whether he holds a formal title. Mr. Kushner, who has no experience in politics or government, often has the final word in advising Mr. Trump.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.But while Mr. Trump apparently feels comfortable with Mr. Priebus, the people with knowledge of his weekend decision said Mr. Bannon was still the adviser who was better able to talk forcefully to the president-elect during difficult moments.The transition team appeared eager to appease concerns among Mr. Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters that choosing Mr. Priebus meant the president-elect had already caved to the Washington \u201cswamp\u201d he had promised to drain. The team also wanted to mollify Mr. Bannon, and to that end, the official statement mentioned Mr. Bannon first.\u201cWe had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in the statement. \u201cWe will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201dMr. Priebus said he looked forward to working with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump \u201cto create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\u201dMr. Priebus is expected to have multiple deputies, including Katie Walsh, the chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, who is close to Mr. Priebus and helped ensure a tight working relationship between the party\u2019s operational infrastructure and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.A onetime Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Bannon has transformed himself into a media figure who favors a scorched-earth style of politics and is deeply suspicious of the government establishment and the corporate elite. During the campaign, he pushed Mr. Trump to embrace a fierce populism that helped fuel his victory.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last summer to put Mr. Bannon in charge of his campaign was part of an effort to reset a candidacy that had been troubled by controversies surrounding high-level campaign officials.Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment on Sunday set off a fierce response on Twitter and in Washington. The Anti-Defamation League issued a scathing statement calling him \u201chostile to core American values.\u201d\u201cIt is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the \u2018alt-right\u2019 \u2014 a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists \u2014 is slated to be a senior staff member in the \u2018people\u2019s house,\u2019\u201d the statement said.Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said, \u201cIt is easy to see why the K.K.K. views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of white supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide.\u201dMr. Bannon brings to the post a background that includes misdemeanor charges of domestic violence and allegations that he threatened his wife with retribution if she testified in the criminal case, according to a police report and court records obtained by The New York Times.The charges date back two decades to the end of a troubled marriage to Mary Louise Piccard, who said he had attacked her at their home in Santa Monica, Calif.He was charged in February 1996 with domestic violence, battery and trying to dissuade a victim from reporting a crime, but the case was dropped when Ms. Piccard did not show up to court. In court records, Ms. Piccard later claimed that Mr. Bannon had instructed her to leave town to avoid testifying.Despite his image as a bomb-thrower, Mr. Bannon is also savvy at cutting deals to achieve his goals.But as chief of staff, Mr. Priebus will be the one who has several hundred White House staff members reporting to him. He will be the primary gatekeeper for Mr. Trump and the person most responsible for steering the president\u2019s agenda through Congress. That role will be especially critical for Mr. Trump, who has never served in government and has few connections to important political figures.The selection of Mr. Priebus comes at the end of a roller-coaster year for the Republican Party, which saw Mr. Trump rewrite many of its policy orthodoxies, clash with its leaders in Congress and denigrate the Bush political dynasty.As Mr. Trump denounced the Republican primary process as rigged and, on occasion, threatened to quit the party and run on his own, Mr. Priebus remained neutral. And when Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Mr. Priebus stood by his side.Mr. Priebus worked with Mr. Trump on the nuts and bolts of presidential politics, trying to smooth his rough edges and staying in close contact as a bare-bones campaign prepared to go up against the Clinton machine.On the surface, the two men could hardly be more different. While Mr. Trump, 70, is known for his brashness and at times his viciousness, Mr. Priebus, 44, is regarded for his low profile and humility.Born in New Jersey and a lawyer by training, Mr. Priebus has never held elected office. But he served as state treasurer and worked his way up through the Wisconsin Republican Party to become chairman, putting him on the Republican National Committee, where he eventually became general counsel to the chairman at the time, Michael Steele.Now the longest-serving Republican National Committee chairman, Mr. Priebus was elected to the job in 2011, unseating Mr. Steele on the promise of modernizing the party and refilling its coffers. With his focus on fund-raising and fiscal issues, Mr. Priebus let Republican leaders in Congress be the voices of the party during the early part of his tenure. His profile rose as the 2016 election got into gear.At times, Mr. Priebus, whose first name rhymes with \u201cpints,\u201d struggled to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s antics, but he showed his loyalty by supplementing the campaign\u2019s resources and by urging Republicans to fall in line behind the candidate in spite of their reservations.When Mr. Trump emerged onstage to give his victory speech early Wednesday, Mr. Trump made his appreciation clear, dismissing rumors of tension with Mr. Priebus and singing his praises.\u201cI never had a bad second with him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable star.\u201dAn article on Monday about President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s appointment of Reince Priebus to be his White House chief of staff misidentified the state where Mr. Priebus was born. He is a native of New Jersey, not of Wisconsin.Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Choke Point of a Nation: The High Cost of an Aging River Lock", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "A symbol of America\u2019s ailing infrastructure, Lock No. 52 on the Ohio River is responsible for a shipping bottleneck that hobbles commerce far and wide.Supported byLuther Helland stood on a platform in the middle of the river and surveyed his dam. It was in bad shape. Several of the panels that kept the water back were missing, while others were out of true. Weeks of work stretched before him, compounded by the vagaries of the river.Built in 1929, Lock No. 52 sits in a quiet corner of southern Illinois that happens to be the busiest spot on America\u2019s inland waterways, where traffic from the eastern United States meets and passes traffic from the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River. More than 80 million tons of grain, coal, fuel and other goods \u2014 worth over $22 billion \u2014 move through here each year.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t seem like it, but this is more stressful than when I was in the military,\u201d said Mr. Helland, a farm boy from Wisconsin who worked as an Army welder and machinist in South Korea before he took this job.The average delay at No. 52 in October and November was 15 to 20 hours. At the moment, No. 52\u2019s sister dam downriver, No. 53, is adding 48 more hours to the wait.Dealing with both dams, it can take five days to travel just 100 miles on this stretch of the Ohio River. And if something goes wrong at either one \u2014 which does happen \u2014 the delay can build to a week or more. On Sept. 14, for instance, all river traffic stopped for an additional 15 hours while emergency repairs were made to No. 52\u2019s dam.Capt. David Stansbury was in the pilot house of the towboat William Hank, which was tied to a fleet of barges near Metropolis, Ill., waiting for its turn to pass through 52\u2019s lock. \u201cWhat would happen if both lanes of Interstate 95 were completely shut down for three or four days?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re talking total gridlock in a major metropolitan area \u2014 this is the equivalent of that.\u201dRight now, the inland waterways are out of most Americans\u2019 sights and minds. \u201cIf 52 does fail, or one of the other locks fails, and you cut off half the United States from their barge traffic, then you\u2019ll see a public outcry,\u201d Mr. Stansbury said. He explained: If corn cannot get to the factories, the price of any grain-based product will go up, and people will say, \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019ve got to pay $10 for a box of cornflakes? Are you out of your mind?\u201dA towboat and its barges need at least nine feet of water to stay afloat. To guarantee this depth from, say, Pittsburgh to Cairo, Ill., a distance of 980 miles, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built dams. The dams make pools. Each pool is like a step, climbing from sea level to the Appalachians, say, or St. Paul. To get from one step to another, boats use water elevators, called locks, that raise anything that floats from one pool to another. Before the locks and dams, many rivers in the United States were low enough to walk across during dry months.On an overcast September morning, the William Hank was pushing 13 barges \u2014 two tankers of soybean oil, one barge of dry cement, one barge of aluminum ingots, three barges of scrap steel, four barges of iron ingots, one barge of wheat and one of grain \u2014 a total of 19,200 tons of cargo, worth around $6.5 million. Most towboats push a 15-barge tow, which holds the equivalent of 225 train cars or 1,050 truckloads. There is a lot at stake when this much stuff is late.In a low orange-trimmed building on the outskirts of Paducah, Ky., are the offices of Tennessee Valley Towing, which owns the William Hank. Gordon Southern, the company\u2019s senior vice president, calculated that the 15-hour river closure on Sept. 14 cost him around $80,000. His company is just one of dozens.\u201cWe call that bleeding,\u201d said Harley Hall, Tennessee Valley Towing\u2019s vice president for operations. \u201cIf 52 failed, all that tonnage that passes through here each way, it would have to move on rail and road, and the rail cars aren\u2019t there and there\u2019s no room on the highways. There\u2019s no way to bypass this.\u201dDomestically, trucks moved five times as many goods, by weight, as ships or barges did in 2013. Trains moved twice as much as was moved via water, and planes moved far less. But 72 percent of all international trade moved via water in 2014, compared with 10 percent by truck, 5 percent by rail, and less than 1 percent by air. Many supply chains rely on multiple modes of transportation, and no single mode has enough redundancy to accommodate the goods of another.\u201cThe corps does so much with so little,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cThis is the hub, holding all the spokes together,\u201d he said of No. 52, but \u201cuntil Olmsted is completed we have a ticking time bomb,\u201d referring to the dam under construction in Illinois.The corps, an agency within the federal government, decided to build Olmsted with an experimental \u201cin the wet\u201d construction method: Hollow sections of the dam are built on the bank, skidded down to the river, towed into position and lowered into the water, where they are filled with concrete. Traditionally, a project like this would have used a coffer dam \u2014 a small temporary dam that keeps water out of the site while construction goes on in the dry.The \u201cin the wet\u201d method was supposed to save time and money and minimize delays, but it did the opposite. By the time the corps realized its folly, it was too late to alter course. The novel construction process and inadequate congressional funding, among other things, have dragged the project past the quarter-century mark.Olmsted has been under construction for so long that the company contracted to build it has been bought and renamed three times, the new locks at the Panama Canal \u2014 Olmsted\u2019s global equivalent \u2014 have been begun and finished, and grandchildren of the early workers have been hired. Meanwhile, the old locks and dams are costing the country $640 million a year in delays and closures, according to the Army corps.Little has changed at No. 52 and No. 53 since 1929. Each dam is made of over 400 steel or oak panels, called wickets, that sit in the river and hold back water. When the river is high \u2014 about 40 percent of the year for No. 52, more for No. 53 \u2014 the wickets can be lowered to the river bottom to let boats pass above them.When the water goes down, a steam-powered crane from 1937, with a boiler the size of a car, is towed out into the river. A worker reaches into the seething current with a 20-foot steel hook and feels around for an 18-inch bar. When he has hooked it, the crane grabs the end of the hook, pulls the wicket up, and the force of the current sets it in place. This is repeated until all the wickets are up, which might take 24 hours.\u201cThis is all farmer work,\u201d said Mr. Helland, the lockmaster. \u201cIf you grew up on a farm, what\u2019s in your back pockets? Either a pair of pliers or a hammer \u2014 that one tool you always use to fix everything with.\u201d He sat on the steps of the old white frame house, on a hill above the lock, that serves as his office. \u201cThe lock is kept going with all the bubble gum and duct tape we\u2019ve got left,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe\u2019re running out. She\u2019s deteriorating so fast it makes it hard to keep up.\u201dThe corps has identified 25 failure points at No. 52 and No. 53 \u2014 things that are on the verge of breaking, and shutting the locks down. Both are built on wood pilings driven into the river bottom sand. The lock walls are cracking and sagging, the hydraulic pipes are paper thin, concrete is crumbling, metal is rusted through, railings are gone, and seals are leaking.Mr. Helland worries about his dam every day. Last year, a family of six drove their pleasure boat down the spillway and four people died. Recently a contractor hit the dam and broke another wicket (cost: $20,000), adding a two-wicket hole to many one-wicket holes and a four-wicket hole. Each hole makes it harder for the dam to hold back water. After the contractor crash, the smaller lock chamber was shut for a few days because pipes carrying hydraulic fluid to the gate were leaking and about to burst.\u201cThese are old backbreaking places,\u201d said Randy Robertson, the 51-year-old master of Lock and Dam No. 53. \u201cTrying to keep these things going, it\u2019s a struggle every day. We work a lot of overtime just to try and maintain junk \u2014 and that\u2019s what it is. There are things we can\u2019t get parts for anymore. You can\u2019t just go to a boat store or a hardware store and get a drum for a 1937 steam engine. You have to go to a machine shop and have it machined.\u201dOn a recent Friday, Mr. Robertson\u2019s lock resembled ancient ruins, mud-colored, emerging from the river. It is still in working order, but it looked abandoned. Paint peeled, concrete cracked, and there was no reason to fix it. Each piece of Olmsted that is placed in the river is \u201cone step closer to 53 being obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting phased out and I\u2019m O.K. with that,\u201d Mr. Robertson said.Earlier, Mr. Robertson was driving past Mound City, Ill., just downstream from Olmsted. The grain harvest was coming in, filling the huge elevators and making two-story piles on the ground. Trucks carrying grain drove by every few minutes. All the farmers in the surrounding countryside depend on him, he said. If the locks fail, their corn doesn\u2019t get to market.\u201cYou know that everybody pinpoints down to you. You see it firsthand, they\u2019ve got a wife, kids, a paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you mess up, you cost everybody.\u201dMr. Robertson was lockmaster of No. 52 for five years. Because of the stress, he said, his doctor told him he needed to do something else if he wanted to live. When the job opened up, he was relieved to be transferred to No. 53, where the dam is down more and stress is lower.Even drinking water is at the mercy of the locks. When the corps lowered No. 52\u2019s pool to work on the dam on Sept. 14, Paducah\u2019s intake pipes \u2014 which suck water directly out of the river \u2014 could have risen above water. If the closing had persisted for 96 hours, as was predicted, the town of 25,000 people would have had to find another source of water.A few days later, Mr. Helland stood above the dam on a steel box that would protect his divers from the fierce current when they dived into the river to fix the wickets. The steam-powered maneuver boat lay against the dam, boiler hissing. The crane operator jiggled his foot on the pedals. Warm vapor rose from the roiling rapids below. On top of the dam, a milk crate, a dead fish, a bowling ball and hundreds of logs had come to rest. \u201cDid you know bowling balls float?\u201d asked Scott Davis, a lock operator.Earlier that week, it was starting to rain, and Mr. Davis and Sadie, his black dog, were leaving for the night. They walked past three retired wickets on the ground above the lock. The wood was gray, pockmarked and scoured from the river. \u201cThis is the best-made thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d said Mr. Davis, 52. \u201cThe wood is spectacular \u2014 it\u2019s the heartwood of white oak trees.\u201d He has been taking old wickets home, milling the wood, and making picture frames and coffee tables. \u201cWhen somebody retires from here, I\u2019m going to give them a picture of a sunset over the lock and a coffee table to put their feet on,\u201d he said.By the time the William Hank was cleared to enter No. 52\u2019s lock, the captain had gone to bed, and the pilot, Jackson Walker (universally called Bubba), was in the pilot house. \u201cI have actually sat on both sides of this lock for a week to a week and a half before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s money these companies are having to pay these guys just to sit.\u201d Slowly, the boat chugged toward the lock wall.One thousand feet in front of him, on the head of the tow, a deckhand called over the radio telling him how close he was: \u201cAll right, Bubba, four more feet you be looking at daylight on that long wall \u2026 about a foot or two to the good.\u201dMr. Walker maneuvered the William Hank into the 1,200-foot chamber, a temporary addition from 1969 that has long outlived its design life. Instead of a smooth wall, the chamber is made of poured concrete cylinders that almost seem designed to catch the front of a barge. \u201cYou can easily get quartered just enough that you can jam up in here and do a bunch of damage,\u201d Mr. Walker said. His tow, like most, was 105 feet wide. The lock chamber is 110 feet wide. To park his 1,130-foot, 19,200-ton craft, he had as much space as a car does in a crowded parking lot.Gently tapping the stainless steel levers that control the rudders and pulling back and forth on the two throttles, Mr. Walker steered, came ahead, and stopped in the center of the chamber. To his right, the bedraggled condition of the wickets was apparent. \u201cIt\u2019s just like holding your fingers up against the water and letting it flow through,\u201d he said. The William Hank had waited eight hours to get here. \u201cThis is one of the fastest I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Mr. Walker said.A man in a neon green vest rode a little yellow scooter to the end of the lock wall. He got out and leaned back on a long metal lever. The lock gate began to creak and groan. A big red gear turned, a black steel arm stretched out, and the gate slowly closed. No. 52 is operated entirely by hydraulics, and Mr. Helland said he could tell by the sound if something was wrong. The lock operator can move a tow through the chamber in an hour by himself, using the levers and a set of buttons inside two sheet metal shacks a little bigger than portable toilets.At Olmsted, this will all be done with clicks of a mouse, but no matter how much money is invested in infrastructure by the Trump administration, Mr. Helland\u2019s shoulders will feel the weight of 80 million tons for at least two more years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Isn\u2019t Actually That Happy About Trump\u2019s Victory", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMOSCOW \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s shocking triumph in the American presidential election will have some unusual foreign-policy repercussions. During the campaign, Democrats frequently tried to damage Mr. Trump\u2019s standing by claiming that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was working for and supporting the Republican nominee. Now many may believe that America\u2019s huge political upset could even be described as a victory for the Kremlin.In fact, the idea peddled by American news media that Mr. Putin supports Mr. Trump is far removed from reality. Proponents of this idea have blithely ignored the assessments in mainstream Russian news media and by Russian analysts, which have never been particularly enthusiastic about Mr. Trump.There is a lot of concern in Russia about what will happen to American foreign policy once Mr. Trump is inaugurated.The main problem with Mr. Trump is that no one \u2014 including the president-elect himself \u2014 seems to know what he will do as president, especially in the area of foreign policy. His statements on foreign relations so far have been confusing and, at times, contradictory. His aides and advisers also appear to have a broad range of conflicting views on America\u2019s foreign and defense policy.What is more, Mr. Trump will have to find an accommodation with the Republican Party establishment. His administration\u2019s foreign-policy and defense appointments may well become a bargaining chip in that difficult process. As a result, some very unexpected figures, including outspoken hawks, may be put at the helm of the State Department and the Pentagon. Mr. Trump\u2019s own apparent preference is to focus on domestic matters, especially the economy, so he may yet delegate foreign policy and defense to the established Republican elite, which is clearly hostile to Russia.Considering all of this, no one in the Kremlin, where people closely follow American politics and intelligence reports, would seriously consider betting on Mr. Trump.Unlike much of the American and international news media, Russian analysts and commentators have never underestimated Mr. Trump. Even though he was sometimes compared to Vladimir Zhironovsky, a flamboyant and outspoken Russian populist, Mr. Trump was more often viewed as a strong and charismatic right-of-center leader. Some Russian commentators even reckon he may more resemble Ronald Reagan \u2014 a successful president pursuing a tough unilateral line on foreign and domestic policy.In the longer term, however, Moscow can take comfort from some trends in American politics that have been put into stark relief throughout 2016. On foreign policy, both Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Bernie Sanders\u2019s Democratic primary bid highlighted a renewed American proclivity toward isolationism. Large segments of the American public are tired of endless military campaigns in the Middle East, and weary of the burden of America\u2019s foreign commitments.Even more important, it has become clear over the past two decades that globalization has not been such an unalloyed boon for the United States as some wish to portray it. In fact, it is the industrial heartland of America that has borne the brunt of the displacement caused by the breakneck globalization advocated by the Washington elite.The key question now is whether America\u2019s nascent isolationism will translate into policy. Even if it does, it won\u2019t happen soon. The American political elite remains almost universally interventionist and supportive of globalization.In the meantime, as Russia tries to figure out what to expect from the Trump presidency, it has very little reason to hope that the new president will offer any major concessions or strike any major deals with Moscow, regardless of what he said during the campaign. And Moscow has very little to offer to Washington at the moment. There are few areas for possible cooperation. Even if Mr. Trump does want to improve relations with Russia, he will find out when he moves into the Oval Office that the United States has little to gain from such an improvement.This is why there is no reason to expect \u2014 either now, or in the foreseeable future \u2014 that America and Russia will strike some grand deal to divide the world into spheres of influence. Even more modest compromises seem unlikely. The Trump administration will have no incentive to make overtures to Moscow, such as taking a softer stance on Ukraine or easing the sanctions on Russia. Besides, for Mr. Trump any softening toward Russia would face opposition from within the Republican Party and in the American foreign policy and defense communities. The new president is unlikely to be willing to pay the steep domestic political price, especially since improving relations offers no tangible benefits to America.The basic problems in Russian-American relations stem from Moscow\u2019s fundamental aspiration to return to the global arena as a great power, and even to contemplate integration into the American-led, pro-Western world order only on the condition of being recognized as a great power that dominates most of its former Soviet neighbors. These Russian aspirations will remain unacceptable to any American administration for years, if not decades, to come.There\u2019s only one way this could change, though it is a scenario that many Americans may find uncomfortable to contemplate.In the event of further major deterioration of America\u2019s positions in the global arena \u2014 for example, if the United States is dragged into a confrontation with China while remaining mired in the Middle East \u2014 Russia may look like a more appealing ally, or at least a less appealing adversary. A confrontation with China, and other foreign-policy complications, might force Washington to seek a rapprochement with Russia, in the same way that rivalry with Germany had once forced the British Empire to put aside its longstanding differences with Russia and sign a pact in 1907. But for this scenario to come to pass, Moscow will have to remain firm and unyielding for as long as it takes.Ruslan Pukhov is a defense analyst and the director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a think tank based in Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kerry\u2019s Antarctica Visit Highlights a Continent, and Climate Policies, Under Threat", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported bySCOTT BASE, Antarctica \u2014 A group of hikers in red parkas approached a half-dozen seals resting on floating sea ice. The leader of the entourage \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 raised his arms and ordered everyone to halt.As an ethereal silence descended, Mr. Kerry cocked his head in the stillness of one of the world\u2019s last truly wild places.The presence of Mr. Kerry, the highest-ranking United States government official ever to visit Antarctica, lifted the morale of scientists working to understand the icebound continent. Yet the visit, at the end of last week, was shadowed by anxiety.In his nearly four years as secretary of state, Mr. Kerry has hurled himself into conservation issues, making them a central focus of American diplomacy and winning a string of ambitious deals to limit global warming and protect the oceans.But with last week\u2019s election results, the prospect looms that Donald J. Trump will rip up the Obama administration\u2019s work \u2014 and throw global efforts against climate change into confusion.Mr. Kerry and the aides traveling with him to Antarctica, many of them young liberal Democrats, were not expecting Mr. Trump to win. The trip began a day before the election, and Mr. Kerry had confidently predicted a Hillary Clinton victory.He was flying over the South Pacific toward New Zealand the next day when the results began to come in. His aides rushed around the plane, shocked at some of the states Mrs. Clinton was losing.The results were not definitive until he was in his hotel room that night in Christchurch. In an interview the next evening, and in a series of chats on the trip, Mr. Kerry trod carefully, declining to offer any direct criticism of Mr. Trump.He and his aides plan to welcome the Trump appointees who will soon run the State Department, hoping to build relationships with them and, possibly, persuade them to keep some of Mr. Kerry\u2019s diplomatic deals.But Mr. Kerry also made clear that when he leaves office Jan. 20, he will rejoin the political struggle over climate change, speaking publicly on the issue and perhaps campaigning against members of Congress who dispute the validity of climate science.\u201cI\u2019m ready to continue to fight,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made too much progress.\u201dOn Wednesday, in Marrakesh, Morocco, Mr. Kerry is expected to urge delegates at a United Nations climate conference to redouble their efforts to limit emissions.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.But the world\u2019s climate diplomats are intensely worried that under Mr. Trump, the United States will renege on its commitments, potentially leading to a collapse of the global political will to tackle the problem. Mr. Kerry can make no promises that will bind the Trump administration.In decades as a senator from Massachusetts, he urged the United States government to tackle global warming, but won only a handful of legislative goals, including tougher efficiency standards for cars.\u201cIf global climate change keeps moving at the pace it is, there are going to be climate refugees, there are going to be climate conflicts, there are going to be food conflicts,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.In his years as secretary of state, Mr. Kerry turned up at obscure negotiating sessions where he was by far the most senior diplomat in the room. He cajoled the leaders of Russia, China, India and other countries.As he approached Antarctica on Friday, Mr. Kerry, an experienced pilot, rode in the cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster cargo plane transporting his entourage, one of the regular flights from New Zealand to Antarctica run by the United States Air Force.As the plane steered toward the American logistics base at McMurdo Station, Mr. Kerry looked down at the stretch of ocean he had helped to preserve.Over two days, he hiked for hours, listening to scientists explain evidence that the Antarctic landscape is undergoing profound change.He lingered to discuss a project led by John Stone of the University of Washington, who was at McMurdo Station preparing for a journey to haul drilling apparatus into the frozen wilderness.\u201cWhat\u2019s been observed in the West Antarctic ice sheet that\u2019s so alarming now?\u201d Mr. Kerry asked.Dr. Stone showed him maps of glaciers that are being weakened by warmer ocean water, possibly indicating an incipient destabilization of the ice sheet, which scientists believe is vulnerable to collapse in a slightly warmer climate.Dr. Stone plans to drill through the ice into rock to establish the last time much of West Antarctica melted, a potential clue to the amount of global warming it will take to cause another collapse, which could raise the global sea level by 10 or 15 feet.\u201cWe know that sea level has been higher in the past,\u201d Dr. Stone said as they gazed at the maps. \u201cBut sea level doesn\u2019t tell you where the ice sheets were melting and what melted, and it doesn\u2019t so easily tell you how fast it all happened.\u201dMr. Kerry was also fascinated by Antarctic wildlife. On his first day, flying by helicopter to see the spectacular geology of an ice-free region called the McMurdo Dry Valleys, his group was accosted by a lone Ad\u00e9lie penguin. The secretary of state whipped out his phone and filmed the creature.\u201cCome on, walk up here, buddy!\u201d Mr. Kerry said. The penguin hesitated, then did exactly that.Lumbering Weddell seals \u2014 lolling about on the sea ice near Scott Base, the New Zealand government\u2019s research facility \u2014 showed less interest. They barely lifted their heads to sniff the air as Mr. Kerry\u2019s group approached.Flying back to New Zealand, Mr. Kerry seemed invigorated. The task now for people worried about climate change is to create a widespread movement that politicians cannot ignore, he said. While the first Earth Day is remembered for those millions of marchers, he noted that many legislative victories did not come until the newly energized environmental movement targeted recalcitrant senators for defeat in the 1972 election.\u201cIt was the losing of seats that moved people,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cYou have to translate it into political fear.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One of the most striking elements of the campaign is how alienated the Clinton and Trump electorates are from each other.Bonica said in an email that many of the responses suggested that Trump loyalists could be described as \u201cauthoritarian/nationalists.\u201d Nearly nine out of ten Trump supporters agreed that \u201cpeople living in the U.S. should follow American customs and learn English,\u201d the single strongest predictor of Trump support. One out of four Clinton supporters shared this view.An even larger 97 percent of Trump voters agreed that \u201cpatriotism and protecting our national identity is important,\u201d compared with 55 percent of Clinton backers. 15 percent of Trump voters said the country should offer a path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants, compared with 81 percent of Clinton supporters.She had it all \u2014 the pliant media, the tech oligarchs, Wall Street, the property moguls, the academics, and the all-around \u2018smart people.\u2019 What Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t have was flyover country, the economic \u2018leftovers,\u2019 the small towns, the unhipstered suburbs, and other unfashionable places. As Thomas Frank has noted, Democrats have gone \u201cfrom being the party of Decatur to the party of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\u201d No surprise, then, that working- and middle-class voters went for Donald Trump and helped him breakthrough in states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa \u2014 that have usually gone blue in recent presidential elections.According to Mason Williams, a history professor at Albright College, the failure of Democratic leaders to address the erosion of local institutions in the wake of capital mobility, disinvestment and austerity resulted in the party\u2019s setbacks in the Midwest. In that region, Williams wrote:Late Wednesday afternoon, Senator Sanders issued a statement that followed up on this theme:Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids \u2014 all while the very rich become much richer.Tuesday\u2019s ballot-box rebellion was a profound act of small-d democracy. I know that will offend many who are genuinely fearful of the violent talk and bigoted slurs that Trump has employed and encouraged. But so far, the Trump campaign has operated within the nonviolent democratic tradition.Greider catches some of the crusading tenor of the Trump campaign, but does not take into account the fact that Clinton won the popular vote.\u201cIn many ways, the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,\u201d Goodall told Fallows:In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays \u2014 stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.Fallows notes that Goodall, in her book \u201cMy Life With the Chimpanzees,\u201d tells \u201cthe story of \u2018Mike,\u2019 a chimp who maintained his dominance by kicking a series of kerosene cans ahead of him as he moved down a road, creating confusion and noise that made his rivals flee and cower.\u201dClinton\u2019s failure to gain a sufficiently strong foothold among her essential constituencies in the face of Trump\u2019s incendiary tactics speaks to the complexity of the decision making a woman faces when she attempts to corral her own supporters. For Clinton, picking up those few needed votes in the face of multiple obstacles proved impossible. But it is also true that this is the second time in the past five presidential elections that the popular vote winner has been the Electoral College loser, which had last occurred in 1888. Should this continue to happen, it would begin to call into question the legitimacy of our current system.The author, most recently, of \u201cThe Age of Austerity\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Is in an Economic Slump, but Some Investors Are Hopeful", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionOTTAWA \u2014 An array of factors makes Canada seem like a less-than-attractive place to invest these days.The global collapse of prices for oil and commodities that come from mines and forests have hurt an economy that depends heavily on natural resources. A surge in factory production that was expected \u2014 or at least hoped for \u2014 after the Canadian dollar shrank in value has not really materialized.Economic growth has lagged behind that of the United States, and Canadian financial markets have posted only about half the growth of their American counterparts since the dark days of 2008.But Kiki Delaney, the founder and president of Delaney Capital Management, is undeterred.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I talk about some of the reasons to be hopeful about Canada because it seems popular not to be,\u201d she said by phone from Toronto, where her company is based. \u201cI actually am relatively optimistic about Canada.\u201dLike all Canadian investors, Ms. Delaney, whose firm manages about $2 billion in investments, has to deal with the fact that \u201cthe Canadian market is not necessarily reflective of the Canadian economy.\u201d By her estimate, about two-thirds of Canada\u2019s equity market is made up of shares in banks and other financial institutions, oil and gas producers and mining companies.So some of Ms. Delaney\u2019s optimism rests on a less grim situation for Canada\u2019s oil industry.\u201cThe price of oil is not going to go back to $26,\u201d she said about the price around which oil bottomed out. \u201cI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going back to a 100-and-something either.\u201dAny price increase, she said, will amplify the effects of spending cuts throughout the oil industry.Canada\u2019s oil sands industry was not able to shut down production to wait for better prices, unlike many conventional oil projects elsewhere. But the expansion of current oil sands projects and the development of new ones may now largely be history, which might not entirely be a bad thing, Ms. Delaney said.\u201cThere were too many projects being built at the same time, and that was really having a diabolical impact on costs,\u201d she said.Instead, she is focused on Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan to jump-start economic growth by running a budget deficit to fund sweeping spending on roads, schools, bridges, hospitals and other infrastructure.\u201cThat is one thing which is really differentiating us from other countries,\u201d Ms. Delaney said. \u201cIf you want to encourage growth, fiscal spending is what\u2019s got to happen. The central banks, they\u2019ve done what they can do.\u201dNearly three decades after Canada signed a free-trade agreement with the United States that was eventually transformed into the North American Free Trade Agreement, relatively few publicly traded manufacturing companies remain based in Canada, and Ms. Delaney is skeptical about the ability of Canadian plants to compete against operations in Mexico on a cost basis.And while BlackBerry and, before it, Nortel Networks were Canadian technology giants that became global forces before flopping, Ms. Delaney said that the Canadian tech sector still had major success stories like CGI, an information technology services provider based in Montreal. It\u2019s \u201ca huge company, an unbelievably successful company,\u201d she said.But perhaps the greatest source of her optimism is, in a way, Canada\u2019s reputation for quiet, dutiful dullness.\u201cWe do have a stable government in this country, and we do have a government with a majority that, therefore, is able to institute programs,\u201d Ms. Delaney said. \u201cIn a number of other countries, you either don\u2019t have a stable government or you don\u2019t have the ability of the president or prime minister or the premier to be able to institute the policies that they want to. That\u2019s a major plus here \u2014 presuming that you\u2019ve elected a good government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Triumph of Tracy Flick?", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byDispatchYou go, Tracy Flick.An openly ambitious, doggedly prepared, and hyper-accomplished female former student government president is on the verge of claiming the presidency. Or is she?Then, she was seen as the obnoxious teacher\u2019s pet madly waving her hand with the right answer, the scheming careerist and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-stuffer who would stop at nothing to win. Now, the question is whether Americans\u2019 perceptions of ambitious women have evolved enough to elect one as president.On the surface, at least, much has changed. Political scientists and pollsters have tracked the increasing acceptance of women as suited to politics, including their ability to manage the economy and national security.On the campaign trail and in debates, Mrs. Clinton has not needed to tiptoe around being the smartest girl in class. She did her homework, reeling off her facts and policy positions. She didn\u2019t tame her aggression, taunting her opponent as unprepared and unfit, and bolstered her standing in the polls after the debates.To be likable, Ms. Kimmell said, female candidates have to be prepared but not overscripted; confident but not arrogant. Women are allowed to be ambitious in the sense that they are running for office, but they need to stress that they are doing so on behalf of their constituents. \u201cIt\u2019s socially acceptable for men to display ambition, but it\u2019s not socially the norm for women,\u201d Ms. Kimmell said.Mrs. Clinton has heeded these messages in framing her campaign. Ms. Kimmell noted her frequent references to the Methodist creed as an expression of service to others: \u201cDo all the good you can, by all the means you can.\u201d Similarly, her emphasis on work she\u2019s done for children and families softens the edges of her ambition and places it in a context acceptable for women.Women are also judged more harshly than men for seeming like typical politicians, the research shows. Voters expect women to be more honest than men, and they penalize women more than men when they perceive them to be lying.\u201cWe put women on a pedestal,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as the most honest, the most pure. When that may not be the case, the fall for them is hard and far.\u201dThat explains why Donald J. Trump\u2019s open, repeated disregard for the truth \u2014 indeed, his embrace of it as savvy business practice \u2014 does not seem to damage his candidacy as much as charges of deception have alienated voters from Mrs. Clinton.\u201cThis idea that I\u2019m not going to support Clinton because she\u2019s a liar, but he lies in a different way than she lies\u201d reflects these gendered ideas of how women and men act, said Mirya R. Holman, an assistant professor of political science at Tulane University.So is the specter of Tracy Flick vanquished, or stubbornly persistent?But she thinks that confident and assertive women are still labeled bossy. \u201cYou have these negative connotations to being ambitious,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you lose some of that authority that you\u2019d otherwise have. You approach it in a softer way; you tend to think more about, \u2018How are my actions going to be perceived?\u2019\u201d Wellesley was a haven from such condemnation.In the wider world, however, the verdict is still open.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is Donald Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy?", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump will enter the White House having promised to radically alter United States foreign policy, with ramifications for Americans and the world.But it\u2019s not yet clear how. Mr. Trump offered vague and sometimes contradictory proposals during his campaign, with few of the typical details or white papers. Voters, foreign policy professionals and the country\u2019s allies are all, to a real extent, left guessing.Here, then, is a rundown of what we know about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy ideas and what some experts say about their feasibility and likely ramifications.Mr. Trump has repeatedly emphasized a set of ideas that would reduce America\u2019s role in the world. He said he would take unilateral action, move away from traditional allies and move closer to adversaries.He said during the campaign that he would diminish or possibly abandon American commitments to security alliances. That includes NATO and defense treaties with Japan and South Korea.He has threatened to pull out of the World Trade Organization and called the North American Free Trade Agreement \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever signed in this country.\u201d And he said he would \u201ccancel\u201d the international agreement on combating climate change, reached last year in Paris.Mr. Trump has suggested that more countries should acquire nuclear weapons, to protect themselves without Washington\u2019s help. He has said allies like Saudi Arabia must pay for American support.But Mr. Trump, not a dove, has indicated a willingness to use force and promised to reinstate waterboarding, a form of torture.When the Iranian Navy intercepted American sailors who had drifted into their waters, Mr. Trump said that, had he been president, the Iranians would have been \u201cshot out of the water.\u201d He has threatened to dismantle the international agreement that limits Iran\u2019s nuclear program.Perhaps most famously, he has promised to build a wall on the country\u2019s southern border and force Mexico to pay for it.It is difficult to extrapolate concrete plans from his pronouncements, particularly since they are not always consistent.Some days, for example, he called NATO \u201cobsolete\u201d and implied that he would reduce American commitments to European security. On others, he did not go as far, saying only that European states should contribute more to NATO and focus more on terrorism.The agenda seemed to change with his mood, and he has released relatively few policy papers, making many foreign policy analysts wonder whether he may be entering office without a plan.American presidents enjoy unusual autonomy on foreign issues, and Mr. Trump would be able to make some of his proposals happen quickly.But other policies would be more difficult to enact. Mexico, for instance, seems unlikely to comply with his demand to pay for a border wall. Other ideas, such as seizing Iraq\u2019s oil, may not even be physically possible (the oil rests beneath the ground of a sovereign state).His own administration could be his biggest roadblock.Foreign policy is conducted by vast institutions \u2014 the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence agencies \u2014 staffed with thousands of career officers.Mr. Trump has only a handful of like-minded advisers. So he will need to staff these agencies with his party\u2019s foreign policy veterans \u2014 a group with which he has broken so acrimoniously that many denounced him and his policies in open letters. Now, they will have a sort of veto power over moves like withdrawing from NATO or striking Iran.Beneath his specific proposals \u2014 or pronouncements \u2014 there does appear to be a guiding worldview.Mr. Trump seems to see the world as chaotic and threatening and inhospitable to traditional American objectives like democracy promotion or international institutions. In this world, the United States must pursue its interests narrowly, unilaterally and with unapologetic force.Perhaps owing to his years in the competitive world of New York real estate development, Mr. Trump seems to approach foreign policy as a series of deals, each divided between a winner and a loser.This may explain his skepticism of alliances: If every interaction must conclude with one party\u2019s humiliating loss, then mutually beneficial agreements are neither appealing nor possible.In most cases, it is nearly impossible to say.Because Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are so unusual and his election victory so unexpected, foreign nations have not indicated how they might respond. So it is difficult to judge even the first-order effect of, say, a NATO withdrawal or a partnership with Mr. Assad in Syria, much less any ripple effects.In practice, much of foreign policy is responding to crises. Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of experience or clear proposals make it difficult to predict how he would handle, for example, a major breakthrough in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program or a major Russian cyberattack.Some proposals, though, are easier to study.Beyond that, Mr. Trump\u2019s likely impact on the world is difficult to predict. As Mr. Shapiro wrote in his policy brief, \u201cThe essence of Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be its unpredictability.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The customer told him he could not pay; he had to go back to his home country before he could be deported.At the furniture store Casa Dominicana on St. Nicholas Avenue in Upper Manhattan, the white leather sofas and bedroom sets have not been selling, the manager, Wendy Calderon, said. \u201cMost people are afraid to go out and shop,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are saving their money if anything crazy happens.\u201dThose most worried are undocumented immigrants, whom Mr. Trump during the campaign vowed to deport. Some 574,000 city residents are undocumented, and they pay $793 million a year in state and local taxes, according to a study commissioned by the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat.About 10 percent of the city\u2019s workers are unauthorized, according to United States census figures, although an accurate count is hard to determine.It is likewise impossible to separate the underground economy from New York\u2019s larger economy, because the city is home to immigrants of every kind of legal status, like day laborers, taxi drivers, kitchen workers in restaurants owned by undocumented immigrants who pay taxes, and college-educated entrepreneurs who have temporary protection from deportation.If they were to leave the city, either by returning on their own to their home countries or by government order, \u201cit could be a massive ripple effect,\u201d Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, said.\u201cYou take away upwards of a half-million undocumented immigrants,\u201d Mr. Bowles added, \u201cand these are folks that pay taxes, that spend money in their communities, that may be employing other New Yorkers. And we could see others take flight.\u201dDr. Bastida had a dire prediction: \u201cIt will be an economic tsunami.\u201dElizabeth Vilchis, a technology entrepreneur who came to New York as a child from Mexico, said, \u201cBecause we\u2019re always in the backdrop, people don\u2019t realize the impact we have.\u201dHis constituents, he said, were saying: \u201cWhy not just slow down the expenditures? Because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to need this money to defend myself.\u2019\u201dThat mentality is not prevalent only among low-wage workers. Cris Mercado, the founder of two start-up ventures, is doing the same. Mr. Mercado came to the United States as a child from the Philippines.But his financial clock is ticking, he said. \u201cI have about two months to really ramp up the next iteration of my app and also to secure the many independent contracting opportunities,\u201d Mr. Mercado said. \u201cI\u2019m really trying to hoard resources and cash, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next.\u201dErnesto Cury, a Dominican-born accountant in Jackson Heights, said that since the election, several clients had inquired about the tax implications of taking out their profits from restaurants, cleaning services and construction companies. Even if they are not legal permanent residents, Mr. Cury explained, immigrants can be self-employed, form a corporation and then pay taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, because they do not qualify for Social Security.In Queens, the self-employment rate of foreign-born people is 12 percent, according to the Center for an Urban Future, compared with 6.4 percent of those who are native-born.Juan Ospina, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, runs two businesses: Mama Empanada y Algo Mas on 82nd Street in Jackson Heights, and a contracting company that recently finished building a nearby hair salon. He says he relies on day laborers who are undocumented, and cannot imagine what would happen if they were not available.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Trump will kick out the engine,\u201d Mr. Ospina said.But many undocumented immigrants are now wondering whether he will. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, curve-enhancing Colombian jeans are staying on the rack at a neighborhood store. Customers from Ecuador have told the Mexican-born owner, Maria de los Santos, that they might need any extra money in the coming year to move their families.At Patricia Salazar\u2019s clothing and catchall store on Roosevelt Avenue off 82nd Street in Jackson Heights, two customers told her last week that they were leaving the country. And her longtime hairdresser, who worked at a salon up the block, said she was going back to Colombia the next day.Ms. Salazar, who immigrated from Bolivia 30 years ago, said she had been a supporter of Mr. Trump because she thought he would be good for business. But now, even though her children and grandchildren are United States citizens, she is thinking of returning home.\u201cI don\u2019t want to live with this thing in my heart, because I am scared,\u201d she said.Around the corner from her store, Dr. Bastida and his daughter, Araceli Thornton, who manages his practice, were wondering whether they might have to combine practices with one of the other dental offices that line 82nd Street, all of them catering to the neighborhood\u2019s immigrant population.They see how the businesses in the area are interwoven. \u201cIt is a circle,\u201d Dr. Bastida said. \u201cOne that buys here later eats food from there.\u201dPerhaps the most ubiquitous symbol of New York\u2019s immigrant-driven economy is the bicycle-riding food deliverer.Soon after Ms. Vilchis, the entrepreneur, graduated from City College of New York with a degree in mechanical engineering, she helped create a start-up technology company to optimize food delivery in the Manhattan neighborhoods of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Chelsea.She employed undocumented immigrants to deliver food at $15 an hour \u2014 a job that usually pays $7.50, she said. The most frequent orders came from finance professionals who had no time to leave their desks, which led Ms. Vilchis to another conclusion: Time is another currency propelling the city\u2019s economy, with lower-paid, often-undocumented workers performing tasks that higher-paid professionals are willing to outsource, including the delivery of pad Thai to their desks.\u201cA lot of people who are successful in the city, it is because there are immigrants to fill the roles that let them use their time to advance their careers,\u201d Ms. Vilchis said. \u201cIf we take that away, the whole thing crashes.\u201dTeodelina Basavilbaso contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Presidents Who Tilt Toward Russia", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe presidencies in these countries are largely ceremonial. Bulgaria, unlike Moldova, is a member of both the European Union and NATO and is not likely to quit either. The elections in both countries were heavily influenced by public frustration with corruption and with living standards that continue to lag behind Western neighbors more than two decades after the collapse of Communist rule.But the swing away from pro-Western candidates toward those urging better relations with Moscow offers more evidence of growing disenchantment in Eastern Europe with Western liberal attitudes, exacerbated by the tide of immigrants. Bulgaria and Moldova were the latest to be affected by nationalist and anti-globalization sentiments that have spread across Europe and that helped elect Mr. Trump in the United States.President Vladimir Putin of Russia is bound to take comfort in these developments, which give him hope that Western sanctions over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea will soon be lifted. The votes in Bulgaria and Moldova, however, were less an endorsement of Mr. Putin\u2019s rule than a reflection of economic and geographic ties.Bulgarians have traditionally had close personal and economic ties with the Russians, and the sanctions against Russia have hurt Bulgaria\u2019s economy, the poorest in the E.U. The Socialist-backed president-elect, Rumen Radev \u2014 a political novice and former NATO fighter pilot who spent a year training in America \u2014 pledged to seek improved relations with Russia, arguing that being pro-European did not mean being anti-Russian. Probably a stronger factor in Mr. Radev\u2019s election was popular anger at the pace of reform under the center-right government of Prime Minister Boiko Borisov, who promptly resigned.In Moldova, a former Soviet republic, the winning candidate, Igor Dodon, called for a repeal of an association agreement signed with the European Union in 2014, which provoked a painful Russian embargo on Moldovan wine and fruit exports. In Moldova, too, the election was colored by anger over corruption, and especially a bank fraud in 2014 in which $1 billion disappeared.Whether the presidents can do much to assuage the frustrations of their people is uncertain, especially given the limits on their powers. And there is no evidence that voters in Bulgaria or Moldova want to return to Russian domination. But the Brexit vote and the Trump victory show how popular discontent with disparate issues can lead to unexpected and fateful consequences.Whatever the individual voters in Bulgaria and Moldova had in mind, their receptivity to warmer relations with Mr. Putin is another blow to Western cohesion at a critical juncture. That makes it all the more important for Western leaders who understand the importance of unity to resist all attempts to turn back the clock.Advertisement"}

He jabbed a fist in the air as Fox News recorded victory after victory for Mr. Trump.\u201cThis isn\u2019t all white people!\u201d yelled Mr. English, who is black. \u201cMinorities are voting for Trump, I\u2019m telling you!\u201d (Exit polls showed 87 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s vote came from whites; 2 percent came from blacks.)Mr. English is the director of a state office that helps businesses owned by minorities compete for government contracts. In his work, he said, he had toured some of the most depressed counties in eastern North Carolina. Before Mr. Trump, he said, it seemed that few politicians were addressing the grievances of people who were economically wounded by free-trade deals that hastened the downfall of the textile industry.\u201cWe need to get those jobs back,\u201d Mr. English said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be on the ground. I\u2019m talking thousands of people who are walking around those counties unemployed.\u201dIn Wisconsin, Beth Schmidt, chairwoman of the Rock County Republican Party, said she woke up Wednesday morning feeling happy but a little stupefied.\u201cAs a Republican, I should be bouncing off the walls,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201dMs. Schmidt, a 58-year-old mother of three adult children, is fervently against abortion. She feels that welfare is necessary, but that it has become overused. She was not one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, instead favoring Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina in the primary season. But she \u201cmoved forward\u201d in the general election, deciding to vote for Mr. Trump in the end.She is convinced that Mr. Trump will surround himself with smart and experienced people. \u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see that he will, surprisingly, bring people together,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to pray for this. As time goes on, people are going to see a different Trump.\u201dTo Mark Harris, a businessman from Georgia, Mr. Trump\u2019s indecorous outbursts and often crude behavior were a price worth paying for the shake-up he believed Mr. Trump would bring to government.\u201cA lot of the American people can put aside him being rough around the edges to take the chance on the change that he talked about,\u201d he said.Mr. Harris, 49, a retailer in one of Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs, could hardly contain his glee over Tuesday\u2019s outcome. It was, he said, an unrestrained rejection of politicians, lobbyists and the news media. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of the government in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said.But he also had a warning for Mr. Trump: Break your promises at your peril.\u201cIn four years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll see if he\u2019s smart enough to be able to go through with what he\u2019s promised the American people,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIf he\u2019s able to put into motion what he has proposed over this election, he will win in four years, hands down.\u201dJoseph Connor, of Bergen County, N.J., said it was the general principles in Mr. Trump\u2019s message that were more important, particularly the idea of getting government out of the way of commerce.\u201cI think it\u2019s time to shed regulation and let Americans do great things in the world,\u201d said Mr. Connor, who works in finance and belies the stereotype of Trump voters as working class and rural. \u201cAnd I see that in Trump.\u201dAt Republicans\u2019 election night party in Phoenix, a pair of friends, Linda M. Wright and Susan Cheatham, pumped their fists and thanked Jesus for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to raise our taxes,\u201d said Ms. Wright, 58, of Phoenix.\u201cHe\u2019s going to protect our borders,\u201d said Ms. Cheatham, 53, of Scottsdale.\u201cHe won\u2019t take our weapons away,\u201d Ms. Wright said.\u201cHe will appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect our Constitution,\u201d Ms. Cheatham said.\u201cYeah, protect the Constitution \u2014 that\u2019s key,\u201d Ms. Wright concluded.They agreed that Mr. Trump represents their version of America: a place that loves God and cares for its military.\u201cNobody has the right to come into our country and steal it from me,\u201d Ms. Wright said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like our country, don\u2019t move here. Don\u2019t come here and try to impose your religion on us.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Ms. Cheatham said, \u201cShariah law.\u201d\u201cThe great mass of his supporters, the overwhelming white vote, they also have a right to respect their heritage, their values,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe he\u2019s really an advocate of Western Christian civilization.\u201dBut Mr. Duke rejected the idea that racism was part of Mr. Trump\u2019s message. So did Bridg Webb, 21, who was walking into a celebratory Republican rally at the Rice-Eccles football stadium of the University of Utah on Tuesday.On the way, Mr. Webb said, someone drove by him and shouted, \u201cNazis!\u201d That, he said, was exactly what Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents \u2014 in the news media, on the left, in urban centers \u2014 failed to grasp about voters like him.\u201cI\u2019ve been called a bigot; I\u2019ve been called a white supremacist,\u201d he said. \u201cI pride myself on being a good guy. I go out of my way to help people. All these things are so unfair, and it\u2019s all because I said I like Donald Trump.\u201dHe worried the American economy would not have a stable job for him. He hopes to become a police officer, and he worried that Mrs. Clinton would pass gun restrictions that could disarm law enforcement. Mr. Trump, he said, was a balm for those fears.Supporters like Jeanne Koval, 57, and her husband, Alan, 59, see themselves as part of a global movement against corrupt governments run by insiders. The couple, who hail from Fenton, Mich., were playing the slots on the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday night.Ms. Koval, a nurse, compared her support for Mr. Trump to the support that the Filipino nurses she works with have shown for the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cThey were tired of the corruption, and they want someone who can get something done,\u201d she said.Neither could specifically say what change they wanted Mr. Trump to make, but they voiced concern about rising health care costs and jobs going overseas. Ms. Koval said her parents\u2019 health care premiums recently increased $600 a month.In Utah, Olivia Blackham, who was adopted from Guatemala as a baby, voted for Mr. Trump in her first presidential election.She did so in large part because, she said, she believed America\u2019s immigration system was broken.Ms. Blackham said she had been frustrated after working with refugees who received free health care while her middle-class friends and family had to pay high premiums and hundreds of dollars for prescriptions. She said she believed Mr. Trump could fix that.\u201cI\u2019m really passionate about getting it straight,\u201d she said.But as the reality set in that Mr. Trump would become the 45th president of the United States, Ms. Blackham, 34, expressed a lingering uneasiness.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be scary,\u201d Ms. Blackham said. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a change.\u201dReporting was contributed by Katharine Q.

{"Headline": "Daily Report: The Valley Awakens to Trump", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byBitsSilicon Valley loves disruption \u2014 just not, it turns out, disruptions of a certain kind.The tech elite had criticized him for his statements about immigration and globalization, along with much in his personal behavior. Mr. Trump in turn took the Valley companies to task for building their iconic products in China, and implicitly condemned the local culture of global elites, driving their subsidized Teslas past much of working-class America.With a relationship like that, there are expectations that much of the tech business as usual is over. At first pass, even before Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and programs are known, the tech world seems to feel as if it won\u2019t be at the center of attention, the way it seemed to be in the now-passing Obama years.President Obama, a self-proclaimed geek, liked publicizing his school science fairs at the White House and embraced the idea that the sweeping changes to the economy and society wrought by modern technology were ultimately beneficial.Not being cool with the powers that be would indeed be disruptive, and could very likely affect local profits. But there are a few things the Valley should bear in mind before falling into utter despair.For starters, no matter who is in charge, the future is still coming at us, one day at a time, and they have a big role in that. The next administration won\u2019t recall all iPhones or forbid the production of apps.And while Mr. Trump may profess anger at the digital industry, he is clearly fond of Twitter, and ran a lightweight, fast-moving and iterative campaign that owed much to his fans using new media like YouTube.Besides, Mr. Trump famously likes to do deals; with all the billions lying around the Valley, the two sides might eventually find a way to do business together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Jobs Numbers Show an Economy That Is Basically Healthy", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byJobs ReportThe United States economy is basically healthy.That is the simplest, most important thing to take away from new jobs numbers released Friday morning, four days before the presidential election. These numbers affirm that Americans were probably right to focus on other things during this election. The United States still has plenty of problems and economic challenges. But they are more of the long-building variety than the get-us-out-of-this-slump variety.The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in October, continuing a remarkably stable run (it has been either 4.9 percent or 5 percent for 12 of the last 13 months). Employers added 161,000 jobs, broadly consistent with the pattern over the last year; job creation estimates for September were revised upward.The biggest and most pleasant surprise in these numbers is evidence that workers\u2019 wages are rising faster than they have through seven years of expansion. Average hourly earnings for private sector workers rose 0.4 percent, and are up 2.8 percent over the last year. It suggests that the many anecdotal reports that employers were needing to increase pay to attract workers are more than just anecdotes.It is also true that inflation is starting to edge up, which means that in terms of buying power wages aren\u2019t really rising any faster than they were a few months ago. But if you think of inflation trends lately as being driven mostly by swings in energy prices, you\u2019re left with the good news that American workers seem to have the leverage to demand higher pay from their employers. That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from more than a year at a 5 percent unemployment rate, but wage gains have been slow in coming.There is less good news in the report as well. The October numbers partly reversed progress that was evident in the September report on the number of Americans who were part of the labor force. A whopping 444,000 more people said they were either working or looking for work in September than August, but that number fell by 195,000 in October. For the truth of the matter, it\u2019s probably best to average the two months and assume that higher wages are indeed coaxing people into the labor force, but at a more gradual pace than the September report suggested.Where does that leave a proper understanding of the state of the United States economy on the eve of an election?The current economic expansion may be the most maligned in history. Among the complaints: It has been too weak, too slow, too uneven; it has been accompanied by people dropping out of the labor force; it hasn\u2019t brought meaningful income gains; it is driven entirely by the sugar high of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve.And these statements aren\u2019t wrong. It really has been painfully slow, particularly given the depth of the 2008-9 recession from which the United States has been recovering these last seven years.But it\u2019s worth pausing to look at what has been achieved. Some 95.1 percent of Americans who tell survey-takers that they want a job are working. And they are finally starting to get the bigger paychecks they have long hungered for. It took a long time getting here, but the problems in the economy don\u2019t have much to do with recessions and recoveries anymore. They\u2019re about deeper questions of how best to improve the nation\u2019s long-term economic potential.In particular, the biggest lingering weakness in the employment picture is in the millions of people who have left the labor force \u2014 not just in October, but over the last seven years. Only 59.7 percent of American adults were employed in October, down from 62.9 percent at the start of 2008. A big part of that decline is demographic: baby boomers hitting retirement age. But millions of people dropped out of the labor force entirely during and after the recession and have not returned to the work force.One possibility is that rising wages will serve to pull those people into the labor force; somebody who is unwilling to look for a job when the best thing available pays $10 an hour might feel differently about $12. Another possibility is that the problem of labor force dropouts is more deep-seated and complex than mere higher wages can fix.Either way, trying to get more Americans into the labor market will be a priority if the next president wants to build on the sound economy he or she will inherit. The decision voters face is which candidate\u2019s long-term vision they find most compelling for doing that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With One Castro Gone, Questions About What the Other Castro Will Do", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 For half a century, as Fidel Castro transformed Cuba into a Communist state and sparred with the United States, his brother Ra\u00fal worked in his shadow, the authoritarian leader\u2019s disciplined, junior partner.It is now solidly Ra\u00fal\u2019s Cuba, an island where millennials talk to their cousins on Skype, where restaurant owners hustle for zucchini at privately run farms and where Americans clog the streets of Old Havana.Over all this, he has a firm hold on power, secured by trusted military leaders in vital positions and a new economic course of his making in which private enterprise plays an essential \u2014 but unthreatening \u2014 role.Cuban officials say they have weathered financial and political swings before, whether they were the American embargo, the collapse of the Soviet Union or the economic troubles in Venezuela.With Fidel gone, a lingering question may now be answered: Did the weight of his legacy hold Ra\u00fal back, preventing him from substantially dismantling the cherished system his brother had constructed, or were the slow, halting steps toward change a reflection of Ra\u00fal\u2019s own desire to insert new life into the ailing Cuban economy \u2014 without weakening the structures of state power?Roberto Veiga, the director of Cuba Posible, an organization in Havana that promotes political dialogue, said that Fidel\u2019s passing would \u201cdeeply affect people\u201d on the island, but that it would not change the course of the country.\u201cIt will have an emotional impact,\u201d Mr. Veiga said. \u201cIt will have a political impact. But it won\u2019t have any impact on how the country is governed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long time since Fidel was in the presidency,\u201d he added. \u201cRaul Castro has been leading the country for years. He has a team. There\u2019s stability.\u201dEnrique L\u00f3pez Oliva, a retired church historian in Cuba, expects change. While he did not rejoice in Mr. Castro\u2019s death, he said, he found himself excited about the possibilities that it could bring for Cuba\u2019s future.\u201cIt\u2019s the end of one era and the beginning of another,\u201d he said. \u201cThe death itself, we were waiting for that to happen at any moment. But now it feels like a new phase is about to begin.\u201dPhotographs from a land of endless waiting and palpable erosion \u2014 but also, an uncanny openness among everyday people.Some experts contend that Ra\u00fal held back true economic reforms because his brother opposed them. Fidel, some believe, prevented the Communist Party from announcing major new endeavors at the party congress this year, Mr. L\u00f3pez said.\u201cNow Ra\u00fal will feel more free,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process of change will undoubtedly accelerate.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez added that Cubans were eager for more economic changes because the increase in tourism seemed to have had the adverse effect of diverting food and other necessities to the tourism sector. Shortages are common, and frustrations are running high.Mr. L\u00f3pez, who lives on a $12 monthly pension, said he recently had to sell two luxury antique lamps in order to buy food.\u201cWhen I was in Miami, people asked me why I didn\u2019t stay in Miami, and I said I wanted to see the end of the movie,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez, 80, said. \u201cNow I am watching it. We are living a historic moment. I was happy to have lived through the revolution and happy to live through this.\u201dRa\u00fal has shown a willingness to change course. Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. analyst who has followed the Cuban leadership closely for decades, said the Castro brothers\u2019 relationship was once like a show. Fidel played the mercurial, genius director spewing bold visions, while Ra\u00fal was the producer backstage, making sure that the microphone worked, that the actors were paid and that everyone followed the script.But as Fidel withdrew, he said, Ra\u00fal was increasingly free to steer the production in a different direction, while retaining its spirit.Ra\u00fal has long framed his vision as a continuation of the revolution, vowing to build \u201ca prosperous and sustainable socialism.\u201d\u201cWe have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working,\u201d he told the National Assembly in 2010.He replaced many of Fidel\u2019s senior leaders with his own trusted allies in the military. He opened limited space for small private enterprise, introduced performance-based salary increases and reduced state subsidies, publicly rejecting \u201cthree principles of Fidelismo: paternalism, idealism and egalitarianism,\u201d Mr. Latell said.Fidel began his protracted retreat from public life in August 2006, when a grave intestinal illness forced him to step aside. He ceded power to Ra\u00fal, first provisionally, then permanently in 2008.Fidel\u2019s silence after the United States and Cuba announced they would restore diplomatic relations in 2014 was interpreted by Cubans and by foreign experts as a sign that the former leader was extremely sick.Some Cuba watchers wonder if the breakthrough with the United States could have been achieved if Fidel had still been in power or in better health. But others believe that the changes must have carried Fidel\u2019s endorsement, or at least that Ra\u00fal acted in a belief that he was following his brother\u2019s grand design.In the televised speech to announce the rapprochement with the United States, Ra\u00fal said his openness to talks was \u201ca position that was expressed to the United States government, both in public and in private, by our Comrade Fidel at different moments of our long struggle.\u201dWhile Ra\u00fal is firmly in control, and seemingly in good health, many people inside and outside Cuban wonder what kind of Cuba comes after him.Ra\u00fal, 85, has pledged to step down in 2018. His vice president and former minister for higher education, Miguel Mario D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, 56, is expected to fill the presidency. But in the opaque, tightly guarded circles of Cuban politics, it is impossible to know for sure.Victoria Burnett and Randal C. Archibold reported from Mexico City, and Frances Robles from Miami.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "6 Books to Help Understand Trump\u2019s Win", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byFor those trying to understand the political, economic, regional and social shifts that drove one of the most stunning political upsets in the nation\u2019s history on Tuesday, we have some suggested reading from our critics and reviewers.It\u2019s possible that the book that best explains the American that elected Donald J. Trump appeared more than three years ago. In \u201cThe Unwinding,\u201d George Packer took a wide-angled look at this country\u2019s institutions and mores and was appalled by what he found. The book begins like a horror novel, which to some extent it is. \u201cNo one can say when the unwinding began,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhen the coil that held Americans together in its secure and sometimes stifling grip first gave way.\u201d What follows are profiles and meditations on personalities as diverse as Sam Walton, Oprah Winfrey, Elizabeth Warren and Newt Gingrich. He describes how Mr. Gingrich\u2019s rhetoric, when he came to power in the late 1980s, changed the way elected leaders spoke to one another: \u201cHe gave them mustard gas, and they used it on every conceivable enemy, including him.\u201d His book hums with sorrow, outrage and compassion. (Dwight Garner)\u201cBut the resentments she finds are as toxic as the pollutants in the marsh and metastasizing throughout politics. What unites her subjects is the powerful feeling that others are \u2018cutting in line\u2019 and that the federal government is supporting people on the dole \u2014 \u2018taking money from the workers and giving it to the idle.\u2019 Income is flowing up, but the anger points down.\u201dIn The New York Times Book Review back in April, Beverly Gage wrote: \u201cLiberals may be experiencing mixed emotions these days. The prospect of a Trump presidency has raised urgent fears: of the nation\u2019s fascist tendencies, of the potential for riots in the streets. At the same time, many liberals have expressed a grim satisfaction in watching the Republican Party tear itself apart. Whatever terrible fate might soon befall the nation, the thinking goes, it\u2019s their fault, not ours. They are the ones stirring up the base prejudices and epic resentments of America\u2019s disaffected white working class, and they must now reap the whirlwind.\u201cIn his new book, the social critic Thomas Frank poses another possibility: that liberals in general \u2014 and the Democratic Party in particular \u2014 should look inward to understand the sorry state of American politics. Too busy attending TED talks and vacationing in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Frank argues, the Democratic elite has abandoned the party\u2019s traditional commitments to the working class. In the process, they have helped to create the political despair and anger at the heart of today\u2019s right-wing insurgencies.\u201dThis \u201ccogent and exceptionally clarifying guide,\u201d Jonathan Alter wrote in The New York Times Book Review, \u201chelps to understand what \u2018populism\u2019 means, where it comes from and why it is advancing on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d Mr. Judis distinguishes left-wing economic populism from right-wing cultural populism, which accuses \u201celites of coddling an ever-shifting third group \u2014 immigrants, blacks, terrorists, welfare recipients or all of the above,\u201d Mr. Alter wrote.\u201cIn the end, Judis has a surprisingly benign attitude toward even right-wing populism. He thinks Trump and the European right-wing populists are nasty nationalists, but not fascists, insisting that even those with authoritarian streaks believe in working within the democratic system and lack the territorial ambitions that were central to German and Italian fascism. Instead, Judis writes, Trump resembles the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the buffoonish media baron.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battle Lines Over Trump\u2019s Lands Policy Stretch Across 640 Million Acres", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byDENVER \u2014 Uranium mines around the Grand Canyon. Oil drilling rigs studding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. New coal and timber leases in the national forests. States divvying up millions of acres of federal land to dispose of as they wish.To environmental groups, it would be a nightmare. To miners, loggers, ranchers and conservative politicians in resource-dependent areas, it would be about time. Either way, Donald J. Trump\u2019s election presages huge potential change on America\u2019s 640 million acres of federal public lands, from the deep seas east of Maine to the volcanic coasts of Hawaii.\u201cInto a new world,\u201d said Bruce Babbitt, who ran the Interior Department under President Bill Clinton.But the unknowns and political variables are huge, too. Mr. Trump himself, while promising to push resource extraction, has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations.But the hopes, and the fears, about how that system might now change are boundless.\u201cMy big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in San Juan County and these rural areas,\u201d said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner in southern Utah, where antigovernment feelings run as deep as the slot canyons. \u201cYou just feel like everything has been stifled with regulations.\u201dAt the Western Watersheds Project, a conservation group focusing on the Rocky Mountain region, legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready for an onslaught of anti-environmental policy, and we\u2019re arming up to litigate,\u201d said Erik Molvar, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe Trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past 40 years.\u201dIn the decades-long struggle for control of America\u2019s public lands, the Obama years were a flush time for conservation groups. The administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the Grand Canyon and blocked new coal leases. Public lands were also adapted for new uses on Mr. Obama\u2019s watch, notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical significance, and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in Nevada.Conservatives who loathed those regulations \u2014 or new uses \u2014 are now hoping Mr. Trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor. Republicans in Congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect wilderness, water quality, endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments. Some conservatives hope Mr. Trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to states, which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals.To see where change may come the quickest, look to the edges of Glacier National Park in Montana, at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. In March, the Obama administration capped a three-decade fight over oil and gas drilling in the area, called the Badger-Two Medicine, by canceling a Louisiana energy company\u2019s lease on 6,000 acres.The company, Solenex, sued. A lawyer for the company, William Perry Pendley of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, said the incoming Trump administration could simply decide that canceling the lease had been wrong.\u201cAll it would take,\u201d he said, \u201cis for the Justice Department to enter the case and say, \u2018We\u2019ve re-evaluated. We will lift the suspension and we\u2019ll permit the drilling to go forward.\u2019\u201dThis week, the Interior Department announced that a separate energy company with oil and gas leases on 32,000 acres in the same area had voluntarily canceled them. Blackfeet tribal leaders called it a victory for cooperation among industry, conservation activists and the government.To see where things get more tangled, head into the damp woods of the Cascade Range in central Oregon, and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, where a long economic decline began in the late 1980s as international trade shifted timber markets to places like Canada, and automated mills eliminated tens of thousands of jobs. Those computer-run mills are not going away even if more logs start arriving.\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a clear and easy path to go back to the good old days when natural resource extraction was driving our economy,\u201d said Sean Stevens, the executive director of Oregon Wild, a conservation group. \u201cIt is not as easy as just logging more,\u201d he said.Logging industry officials said that employment could grow, but that changes at the federal level would have to be profound to make a difference.The first step, they said, would be to increase the budgets of federal land agencies like the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, something that conservative congressional representatives \u2014 many of them bent on budget cuts \u2014 might not want to hear.\u201cYes it\u2019s going to cost us money, but in the long term it will save us money because we face a federal forest crisis, with millions of acres that are diseased, fire-prone, and overstocked,\u201d said Travis Joseph, the president of the American Forest Resource Council, which represents wood product companies from the Northern Rockies to California. \u201cWe have got to educate Congress and inform them that this is about an investment.\u201dDavis Filfred, a Navajo Nation council delegate, said he felt that time was running out for the stretches of pi\u00f1on pine and red sandstone known as the Bears Ears area in southern Utah. It is rich with Native American artifacts, and tribal groups and conservationists have been urging Mr. Obama to name it as a new, perhaps final, national monument before he leaves office.Mr. Filfred drove up to Bears Ears from his home in Aneth, Utah, over Veterans Day weekend with his two sons and other members of Western tribes, and reflected on how much had already been lost there to irresponsible visitors.\u201cThey\u2019re taking bones, they\u2019re taking pottery,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re desecrating and damaging the writing on the walls. They\u2019re tearing up the ground with their ATVs and motorcycles. It\u2019s heartbreaking to me when I see that.

Trump looked increasingly likely to win Florida: \u201cElection Night Starter Kit,\u201d read a post on Instagram, above photos of United States passports and an Air Canada plane. Another post depicted a machine-gun-toting man riding a moose, with the words \u201cCanadian Border Patrol Watching for Illegal Americans.\u201dSuch a desire to flee an election result in the United States is often expressed, but rarely borne out. On the other side of the border, Canadians reacted to Mr. Trump\u2019s election win with concerns of their own, even anxiety, but also a whiff of pride.\u201cIt definitely makes me happy to live under the Trudeau government,\u201d said Cordell Jacks, 36, an international development worker in Vancouver, British Columbia, referring to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Mr. Jacks added that he wanted to see his country become a leader in championing human rights and battling climate change. \u201cCanada\u2019s going to be in a higher position to take on global issues that America\u2019s going to put to the side,\u201d he said.For a country with an economy that depends heavily on exports to the United States, the most worrying uncertainty for Canada involves Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist trade stance and his vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. While Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Nafta have mostly been aimed at Mexico, the pact, and the agreement between Canada and the United States that it incorporated, effectively left much of Canada\u2019s industry largely producing for export.Mark Warner, a trade lawyer in Toronto, said that while it was unclear what Mr. Trump had in mind for Nafta, he feared that a Trump administration would rekindle old trade battles with Canada.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get sideswiped by some of this stuff,\u201d Mr. Warner said. In particular, he said he expected Mr. Trump to promote \u201cBuy America\u201d clauses in government infrastructure projects that would shut out Canadian companies \u2014 a violation of Nafta.Not every Canadian, of course, was displeased by the election result.\u201cAs a gay, liberal, health care-loving Canadian, most of my friends thought I was crazy to be supporting Trump,\u201d Ashley MacIsaac, who is perhaps Canada\u2019s most famous fiddle player, said in an email. \u201cBut I suggested he had to win to offer a chance for world peace by preventing WWIII with Russia and for his stance on radical Islam.\u201d\u201cIt was all very playful before, but now there seems to be a sense of urgency to them,\u201d he said of the emails.Andrew Griffith, a former director general of the citizenship and multiculturalism branch of Canada\u2019s immigration department, said most of those suggesting they would leave because of Mr. Trump would not qualify as refugees and would have to go through a system that rates them based on factors such as education and job skills.Having a firm offer for a skilled job in Canada can make getting a visa a relatively fast process, Mr. Griffith said. But in general the process can be protracted, expensive and without guarantees. And for almost everyone, he added, starting life over in a new country, even one next door, would be disruptive.\u201cIt\u2019s not an automatic process despite the Twitter posts saying \u2018You\u2019re all welcome here,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Griffith said. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not all welcome.\u201dIan Austen reported from Ottawa, and Dan Levin from New York.

Trump, the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Separately, a Chinese government spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said the \u201cremarks actually reflect some Western politicians\u2019 deep-rooted and baffling sense of superiority.\u201dMr. Oettinger defended himself on Thursday as having been \u201cfrank and open\u201d about the possibility that Germany and Europe could \u201close the global battle for competitiveness\u201d unless they made far-reaching overhauls in areas like pensions and the retirement age.He also used his apology to urge China to make changes, suggesting that its economy would benefit from being more open to European investment.\u201cChina is a partner and a tough competitor, therefore we need a level playing field where Chinese companies can buy European ones, and European companies can buy Chinese ones,\u201d he said. \u201cI see room for improvement.\u201dMr. Oettinger, who had reportedly called Wallonia a communist-run \u201cmicro-region\u201d that was \u201cblocking\u201d Europe, responded by saying some of his comments had been \u201cmisquoted,\u201d although he did not specify which.The statement on Thursday made no reference to Mr. Oettinger\u2019s apparent slight at Berlin\u2019s policy agenda, in which he joked that a bill to make same-sex marriage \u201cobligatory\u201d might soon be proposed in Germany.As outrage grew over Mr. Oettinger\u2019s comments in Hamburg as well as over his refusal to apologize, some in Germany sought to play down the idea that the remarks reflected any kind of bias.\u201cEveryone has their own way of using language and style of delivery,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman, told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday in response to a question about the Chinese reaction. \u201cThe passages that we were able to hear were certainly not the speech and style of delivery of the chancellor.

{"Headline": "Trump and the Arts: \u2018Evita,\u2019 Huge Towers and a Snub for Warhol", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byFor the arts world, the question is essentially the same as the one being asked everywhere right now, across the political spectrum: \u201cWhat will a President Donald J. Trump mean for me?\u201d The answer from artists, museums, theaters, actors, writers, musicians and the movie and television industry is, to a rare degree in previous presidential elections: \u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201dThough he has been front-and-center in public life for more than four decades in the country\u2019s cultural capital, Mr. Trump has left a meager trail to suggest what positions he might take on public arts funding and arts education, along with issues like censorship and economic policies that would affect creative industries, not to mention how he and the first lady, Melania Trump, might decorate the White House.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything apocalyptic with him coming in,\u201d said Rocco Landesman, the Broadway impresario and former chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, which disburses grants to cultural organizations and projects. \u201cThe Tea Party has a real grievance with the arts, and when I was at the N.E.A., during the budgeting process, the Tea Party conservatives would X out the budget, and we\u2019d have to fight to restore it. But I would not envision that kind of process with President Trump at all. That doesn\u2019t seem to be his agenda.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s primary connection to the creative world has been through architecture, though with the exception of Philip Johnson \u2014 whom he hired along with Costas Kondylis to reimagine the old Gulf and Western Building at 1 Central Park West as Trump International Hotel and Tower \u2014 he has hired mostly low-profile architects and has drawn criticism for buildings that are either bland or gaudy. The critic Herbert Muschamp, in The New York Times, wrote in 2002 that the over-the-top buildings were at the very least not boring. He called Mr. Trump \u201cthe only beauty freak at large in New York City real estate development\u201d and added: \u201cAggression and desire, violence and sex: Put them together, and they add up to Trump World Tower, undeniably the most primal building New York has seen in quite a while.\u201d That tower, across from the United Nations, also had a fan in Terence Riley, then the chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, who called it his favorite new building.In 1999, after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani threatened to cut off city funding to the Brooklyn Museum because of an exhibition featuring a painting by the British artist Chris Ofili that depicted a Virgin Mary figure and incorporated collaged pornographic elements and clumps of dried elephant dung, Mr. Trump joined in the criticism. Then exploring a run for president as a candidate of the Reform Party, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Giuliani\u2019s attempt to block public funding for the museum. He called Mr. Ofili\u2019s work and that of some other artists \u201cabsolutely gross, degenerate stuff,\u201d and vowed as president to ensure that federal funds would never support such art.Some beneficiaries of government support worry about losing the relatively small amount of help they get. \u201cWe\u2019re all in a place right now of not knowing \u2014 I encounter that everywhere I turn, and that\u2019s always a scary place,\u201d said Eric Ting, artistic director of the California Shakespeare Theater, known as Cal Shakes, in Orinda, Calif. Stephen Kidd, executive director of the National Humanities Alliance, a nonprofit coalition that advocates for humanities education and other programs, said his constituents held out hope that government support for cultural endeavors would continue in a Trump administration. Despite conservatives\u2019 desire to shrink the government, the Republican-controlled Congress agreed last year to President Obama\u2019s request for the first budget increase for the National Endowment for the Humanities since 2010.\u201cIt was fairly modest,\u201d Mr. Kidd said, \u201cbut given the fiscal climate on the Hill it was a big show of support.\u201d(In 2014, when he was Budget Committee chairman, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan proposed ending federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, saying in budget documents that \u201cthe activities and content funded by these agencies go beyond the core mission of the federal government.\u201d)While Mr. Trump\u2019s election has been widely condemned by much of the artistic world, parts of the commercial culture industry are cautiously optimistic that the next four years might not be so bad \u2014 though mostly because fear of economic volatility might cause shifts in wealth that will be good for places like art galleries, which have already benefited immensely from the world\u2019s concentration of wealth.He added: \u201cThe wealthiest sector of the global economy will continue to accumulate more cash than it can consume or productively invest. That money will seek a safe haven.\u201dMichael Cooper, Michael Paulson and Graham Bowley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Bannon.Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Bannon to be his senior counselor on Monday. The move has been widely criticized by Democrats and minority groups who say that Mr. Bannon\u2019s website, Breitbart.com, promotes anti-Semitic and racist views.\u201cWe look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,\u201d Mr. Dermer said.Rudolph W.

Bush, said the president-elect must transfer control of all of his businesses assets and investments to an independent trustee who would sell them and not disclose how the proceeds were invested.If he chooses to put his children in charge of the businesses, as Mr. Trump has said he plans to do, they added, \u201ca clear firewall must by established\u201d barring family members from being involved in policy decisions at the White House and forbidding them from discussing the business with their father or anyone in his administration.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who battled with Mr. Trump during the Republican primary contest, said Thursday that he was \u201ceager and committed\u201d to working with the president-elect.In an interview on Fox News, Mr. Cruz said that he met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday and that they had a \u201cfar-reaching\u201d conversation about the challenges facing the country. There is speculation that Mr. Cruz could be a potential nominee for attorney general or the Supreme Court, but on Thursday he dodged questions about his future.\u201cI\u2019m eager to work with the president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles I was elected to defend,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI am excited for the opportunity we have to come together and get the job done.\u201dIn a renewed sign of turmoil among Democrats after their bruising loss last week, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said Thursday that he would challenge Representative Nancy Pelosi of California as leader of the House Democrats.\u201cI have spent countless hours meeting and talking to members of our caucus, and the consensus is clear,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a letter to his Democratic colleagues. \u201cWhat we are doing right now is not working.

Appropriations bills have been contentious because they are often filled with conservative policy riders that have made those spending bills subject to presidential veto in the Obama administration. With Mr. Trump in the White House, there will be a fresh test of the appropriations process, including a new debate on earmarks.Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, was asked by members of Congress at a hearing Thursday about the economic impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Markets have rallied on optimism that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans will stimulate growth by cutting taxes and increasing spending on defense and infrastructure.

The United States is Israel\u2019s most important ally.The Israeli government, which has often had a tense relationship with the Obama administration, has studiously avoided taking sides, but at the same time, Jerusalem has moved to improve relations with India and Russia, and is in talks to develop economic ties with China.\u2014 ISABEL KERSHNERAcross the Middle East, where the United States has a long history of often divisive involvement, many seemed to have no idea how to react to the election of Mr. Trump.Syrians, too, said they had little inkling what the vote would mean for the civil war in their country, although many in the opposition had expressed hope that a victory for Hillary Clinton would mean more robust support for the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad.Many have expressed worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about Islam and Muslims would translate into aggressive policies in the region, as well as making it harder for displaced Syrians to seek refuge.\u2014 BEN HUBBARD, ANNE BARNARD and HWAIDA SAADPrime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had been planning to meet Mrs. Clinton in Washington in February, tried to calm his country, as the yen surged and stocks stumbled. \u201cHand in hand with Trump, we will try to work together,\u201d he said.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump singled out Japan. He claimed that Tokyo was not paying its fair share to support United States military bases, calling into question the American commitment to defend Japan in case of attack.A rising China could put a check on Mr. Trump\u2019s stated ambitions in Asia. \u201cMaybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,\u201d said Shin Kawashima, professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. \u201cBut if he carries out such a policy, China will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against Trump\u2019s policies. It is a little difficult for Trump to just change all the old policies.\u201dPresident Park Geun-hye of South Korea instructed her government to coordinate closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team to ensure that her country and the United States would maintain sanctions and pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program.\u201cNorth Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond\u201d to provocations, said Jeong Joon-hee, a government spokesman.Mr. Trump unsettled South Koreans when he said that he might withdraw American troops from their country unless Seoul paid more for their presence. He also indicated that he might let Japan and South Korea protect themselves with nuclear weapons and that he might negotiate directly with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Trump\u2019s surprisingly strong performance caught analysts off guard, but it was welcome news for those in South Korea who believe that their country must build its own nuclear weapons to defend against North Korea.\u2014 CHOE SANG-HUNPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia was one of the first leaders to offer effusive praise for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe world has watched this year\u2019s presidential election with fascination,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt almost every turn, media commentators have been proved wrong and the results anticipated by experts have been overturned. Donald Trump was considered a distant outsider when his candidacy was first announced. He beat the establishment consensus by winning the Republican nomination, and did so again with his remarkable victory today. Mr. Trump\u2019s success shows that politicians should never take voters for granted.\u201d\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are alike.

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Loving,\u2019 They Loved. A Segregated Virginia Did Not Love Them Back.", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byThere are few movies that speak to the American moment as movingly \u2014 and with as much idealism \u2014 as Jeff Nichols\u2019s \u201cLoving,\u201d which revisits the era when blacks and whites were so profoundly segregated in this country that they couldn\u2019t always wed. It\u2019s a fictionalization of the story of Mildred and Richard Loving, a married couple who were arrested in 1958 because he was white, she was not, and they lived in Virginia, a state that banned interracial unions. Virginia passed its first anti-miscegenation law in 1691, partly to prevent what it called \u201cspurious issue,\u201d or what most people just call children.The America that the Lovings lived in was as distant as another galaxy, even as it was familiar. The movie opens in the late 1950s, when Mildred (Ruth Negga, a revelation) and Richard (Joel Edgerton, very fine) are young, in love and unmarried. They already have the natural intimacy of long-term couples, the kind that\u2019s expressed less in words and more in how two bodies fit, as if joined by an invisible thread. It\u2019s a closeness that seems to hold their bodies still during a hushed nighttime talk on a porch and that pulls them together at a drag race, under the gaze of silent white men.Those hard, reverberant stares are about the only hint that the world in \u201cLoving\u201d is going to be falling off its axis. Mr. Nichols (\u201cTake Shelter,\u201d \u201cMud\u201d) has a way of easing into movies, of letting stories and characters surface obliquely. If their story didn\u2019t open when and where it does, there would be nothing remarkable about Mildred and Richard. But this is a Virginia still in the grip of Jim Crow, so when they decide to marry, they exchange vows in Washington. Not long after, the local sheriff (Marton Csokas) and his deputies \u2014 prowling like thieves \u2014 enter the couple\u2019s home in the middle of the night and arrest them for breaking the state\u2019s law against interracial marriage.The Lovings have been the subject of both books and movies, including \u201cThe Loving Story,\u201d the 2011 documentary directed by Nancy Buirski that is partly the basis for Mr. Nichols\u2019s movie. Ms. Buirski\u2019s documentary primarily consists of archival film footage, including of both Lovings at home with their three young children, and with the lawyers who helped the couple in their legal fight. The footage is charming, in the way that some images from the past tend to be, with their old-fashioned clothes and recognizable yet faraway worlds. Part of the allure, though, is just the Lovings themselves and how they look at each other and how they look at the camera \u2014 her shy openness, his wary reserve.With exacting economy, Mr. Nichols borrows from the documentary \u2014 its people with lined faces, its rooms with weathered walls \u2014 drawing on signifying minutiae, textures and cadences to fill in his portrait. He captures the era persuasively, embroidering the realism with details like Mildred\u2019s knee-skimming skirts and Richard\u2019s brush-cut hair. One sequence restages a 1965 visit to the Lovings from a photographer, Grey Villet (Michael Shannon, a bolt of lightning), who was on assignment from Life magazine and whose exquisite, artfully casual photographs remain the most recognizable images of the Lovings, partly because they suggest the unforced intimacy of family snapshots.Mr. Nichols\u2019s most distinct aesthetic choice is the movie\u2019s quietness and the hush that envelops its first scene and that eventually defines the Lovings as much as their accents, gestures, manners and battles. He wraps them in a deep-country quiet, the kind that can unnerve city people and sound \u2014 feel \u2014 utterly foreign, especially to ears habituated to the noise of American movies with their therapeutic chatter. There\u2019s beauty in this silence, as when Mildred closes her eyes as the wind stirs the trees. There\u2019s also diffidence and thudding fear, because while Richard\u2019s taciturn affect may be a matter of temperament, his darting, haunted eyes also suggest those of a whipped dog.The movie lightly traces the arc of the Lovings\u2019 story, including their decade-long legal fight to live in their home state as husband and wife, even as Mr. Nichols plays with time, omits certain facts and glosses over others. He\u2019s more interested in showing Mildred and Richard laughing with their friends than in hanging around courtrooms, watching their defense. Here, in scene after scene, the story of the Lovings is nothing if not wrenchingly personal. (The lawyers \u2014 played by a broadly funny Nick Kroll and a rather more subdued Jon Bass, with a sardonic twist \u2014 humorously sweep in like the cavalry, courtesy of Robert F. Kennedy and the American Civil Liberties Union.)Movies get a lot of mileage from the fantasy that we are the heroes of our own stories. Life\u2019s regular hum \u2014 the effort and joy of making homes, having children and nourishing love \u2014 tends to be drowned out by speeches and dramas in which characters rob banks to get out of debt instead of struggling or despairing. It\u2019s why the insistent, quotidian quiet of \u201cLoving\u201d can feel so startling. It plucks two figures from history and imagines them as they once were, when they were people instead of monuments to American exceptionalism. It was, the movie insists, the absolute ordinariness of their love that defined them, and that made the fight for it into an indelible story of this country.\u201cLoving\u201d is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for racist language.

{"Headline": "The Women Who Helped Donald Trump to Victory", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byNAZARETH, Pa. \u2014 Debbie Biro became a Republican to vote for Donald J. Trump.A lifelong Democrat, Ms. Biro, 57, is a churchgoing single mother who practices yoga and does not eat meat. She works in the office at the Crayola Crayons factory near here, and she can pinpoint her \u201cturning point\u201d \u2014 the moment she became convinced that Mr. Trump was \u201ca strong leader, and he\u2019ll get things done.\u201dIn well-to-do Naples, Fla., Sue Gauta, 47, a small-business owner married to a doctor, also embraced Mr. Trump. So did Wanda Lincoln, 67, a retired college administrator still working to make ends meet in a threadbare mill city in Maine. And Kyleigh Ostendorf, 26, who lives in Los Angeles and produces graphics for ESPN.In interviews here in the Lehigh Valley \u2014 a bellwether region in a swing state that helped elect Mr. Trump \u2014 and around the country, female supporters said theirs was a vote for Mr. Trump and not against Hillary Clinton. America was on the wrong track, the women said, and Mr. Trump alone could fix it.They are women who want their daughters to grow up and run businesses \u2014 and who run businesses themselves. Many said they were eager for a woman as president. Were they offended by Mr. Trump\u2019s vile comments about women, captured on tape? Absolutely. Did they believe the women who came forward and said Mr. Trump had groped them? Not necessarily. Did any of it stop them from voting for him? No.Where female opponents took to Twitter with #NotOkay, branding Mr. Trump a misogynist and worse, his female supporters saw \u201ca good man and a good father,\u201d said Mary Barket, the head of the Pennsylvania Federation of Republican Women, who knows Ms. Biro from church and helped her get involved in the Trump campaign.Ms. Biro, who said she was \u201ca quiet, reserved person,\u201d had never knocked on doors or worked in politics before. But she spent one day each weekend since August canvassing for Mr. Trump.Where those who voted against Mr. Trump saw someone who bankrupted businesses and ducked paying taxes, these women said they saw a man who built a real estate empire and simply followed the law. They saw a man who had raised and promoted a beautiful and successful daughter, Ivanka, and who let a smart and accomplished Washington strategist, Kellyanne Conway, manage his presidential campaign.In short, they embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s sales pitch for himself.\u201cI think that women see the big picture \u2014 women are smart,\u201d Mrs. Gauta said. \u201cThe fact that he said something crude,\u201d she said \u201cis not going to change my mind about the good he can do for our country.\u201cDid I like that, no,\u201d she went on. \u201cBut do I think he can do a better job than Hillary? Absolutely. I think he has got the best interests of this country at heart. He\u2019s got a beautiful family; he wants to leave a nice country \u2014 the great country he was raised in \u2014 for his kids. And I think he said the only way I\u2019m going to get that done is by being president myself.\u201dShe took her sons, 14 and 16, to a Trump rally, and said she \u201cwas even more impressed by him in person than on TV.\u201d But as to his sometimes foul mouth, \u201cIf my boys ever said anything like that, I\u2019d put them over my knee and spank them.\u2019\u2019In Chicago, Nicole Been, 22, a Roman Catholic who attends DePaul University, is deeply opposed to abortion and the \u201chookup culture.\u201d She complained that other students branded her a racist and a bigot for supporting Mr. Trump.In Philadelphia, Daphne Goggins, 53, an African-American community activist and ardent Republican, always knew she would vote for Mr. Trump. She said she believed decades of Democratic efforts had done little for black people. When Mr. Trump invited her to a minority outreach meeting, she told him tearfully that \u201cfor the first time in my life, I feel like my vote is going to count.\u201d (Only 4 percent of black women, exit polls show, supported Mr. Trump, while 26 percent of Latinas did.)For the women interviewed, as for male Trump backers, the economy was of utmost concern. Mrs. Gauta and her husband are tired of paying $1,800 a month in health care premiums, with a $12,000 annual deductible. Ms. Lincoln, the retired college administrator, now works at her husband\u2019s auto body shop in Old Town, Me., to help pay the bills.Ms. Ostendorf, the graphics producer in Los Angeles, watched her father\u2019s million-dollar business implode in the economic crash of 2008. He picked up work doing maintenance for the Y.M.C.A.\u201cI\u2019ve seen America fall down,\u201d she said, \u201cand a big part of Trump that appealed to me was his business plan.\u201dAnd they said they are troubled, as well, by an America that seems to have embraced multiculturalism and political correctness without question. They said they did not understand the Black Lives Matter movement, wondered why Democrats seemed so fixated on transgender access to bathrooms and tended to be enraged at the way veterans are treated and violence directed at the police.They are concerned about immigration and the threat of terrorism.Bobbye Horton, 67, of Grand Junction, Colo., who is Hispanic, approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall with Mexico. On Wednesday she wore a \u201cViva Trump\u201d T-shirt. Immigrants, she said, needed to use legal channels or stay out. \u201cHe got at the heart of America.\u201dResearch suggests Americans in both parties long ago became open to a female president. By 1999, the Gallup poll found that 92 percent of Americans said they would vote for a woman. When Gallup first asked that question, in 1937, the figure was 33 percent.This held true in many conversations with Mr. Trump\u2019s female supporters. Many said they simply avoided talking about voting for him with Democratic female friends, for fear it would damage their sisterly bonds. (Ms. Biro never speaks of politics at yoga or at work.)\u201cWhen I told them that I was supporting Trump, they were, like, shocked, oh my gosh, \u2018there is no way I could support him,\u2019\u201d Ms. Biro said of her friends. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018Everybody has their thing.\u2019\u201dCelinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said the party had expected \u201ca surge of women\u201d to support Mrs. Clinton, but that did not happen. While Mrs. Clinton did better with women in almost every demographic group, Ms. Lake said, \u201cTrump won very solidly the white women\u2019s vote, and we know that was fed by white, blue-collar women.\u201dMs. Biro comes close to fitting that mold; although she considers herself middle class, she did not go to college. And Nazareth, a middle-class community in Northampton County, is the kind of community where Mr. Trump did well.\u201cHopefully he\u2019s going to try to unite people,\u201d she said of the president-elect. \u201cWe have to try to help people heal, so people can learn to trust, and have faith that things are going to be O.K.\u201dJess Bidgood contributed reporting from Old Town, Me., and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blockbuster Deals in a Race to Stay Ahead of the Competition", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWorld-changing corporate transactions just seem to keep coming. It won\u2019t last, however.The number of multibillion-dollar deals announced in recent weeks is staggering by any measure, particularly in an election year, when the uncertainty tends to drive away deals.Time Warner\u2019s & AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion proposed tie-up has dominated the headlines as consumers latch on to tales of media dominance, but in October alone, $329 billion worth of deal activity in the United States has been announced, according to Thomson Reuters, a record. The worldwide number, $483.1 billion, is also no slouch and the fifth highest on record.Other gigantic deals include General Electric\u2019s combination of its oil business with that of Baker Hughes, British American Tobacco\u2019s $47 billion takeover offer for Reynolds American and Qualcomm\u2019s $38.5 billion deal for NXP Semiconductors. One of the biggest deals this year is Bayer\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto.Looming in the future are potential other big deals like a recombination of Viacom and CBS.Conventional wisdom is that this activity is all about cheap money. Interest rates are at 400-year lows and the world is awash with liquidity as investors try to find anything that yields a decent rate. Capital markets are so well developed that AT&T can seek to borrow $40 billion to buy Time Warner without missing a step. The days of the financial crisis are well and truly over as lenders are again jumping to lend \u2014 albeit at lower leverage rates. (We did learn something from the crisis, thankfully.)The other broad force driving this merger boomlet is confidence. The worldwide economy is choppy, but we are actually in a period of stability. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has come, and though it may prove to be a disaster for the British economy, it has not brought the trade bloc down with it.Indeed, since the British referendum on June 23, the British stock market is up about 15 percent. The decline in the value of the pound has spurred deal-making, like Softbank\u2019s $32 billion acquisition of the British chip maker ARM Holdings.Forget about shareholder value; the top priority of any chief executive is to remain employed. And in a sluggish economy with few obvious opportunities, a big merger has become the only way to acquire growth or a new product or new technology and ensure that the chief executive holds on to power.The challenge facing chief executives is compounded by the changes wrought by technology. Companies, particularly in technology, media and telecommunications, are racing to keep up and avoid being outmaneuvered. Microsoft\u2019s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn can be viewed solely as a defensive play \u2014 keeping its global reach on the internet.This trend has also been apparent in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology deal making of the past years as companies bought drugs instead of developing them.And tech itself continues to produce new challengers and spur further deal activity. The potential initial public stock offering of Snap at very likely an extraordinary valuation will push other tech companies to go public, generating more money in the pockets of the tech elite to make acquisitions.But the result of all this merger activity is a broad push toward oligopoly, meaning industries are dominated by just a few big players.Take media and telecommunications. We are heading into a world that is focused on video as people spend their lives on their smartphones, at least for now. The AT&T-Time Warner combination is built on this premise as AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, bets that the money in telecom is in content.In this new media world, there will probably be four or five big providers of content, two of which will certainly be Facebook and Google. AT&T is making its play to stay in that elite league through its proposed acquisition.A cynic might see the AT&T deal and others getting ahead of any changes to our inadequate antitrust laws. In a low-growth economy, getting bigger and squeezing out competitors is a clear way to success.Yet the monopolistic power play has changed. In the case of AT&T, its businesses do not overlap with those of Time Warner. This is a so-called vertical merger, which is harder to stop, and there is little history of the government doing so.It is how Facebook has been allowed to preserve its dominance by acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 two emerging potential rivals that were swallowed before they could challenge the Google/Facebook dominance.You may have noticed that the \u201cbigger is better\u201d mantra is not politically popular at the moment. Republicans and Democrats alike have called for regulators to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal.In Washington, you can expect not just greater enforcement but possibly a change in the laws to focus on corporate giants that dominate a market through their immense size.So there is a rush to get deals through before the laws change. Either way, things are not getting better. And the risk of being left behind because of technological disruption and change is driving companies to make acquisitions faster. It is also a trend that, not surprisingly, affects larger companies. Thomson Reuters reports there have been 615 deals year to date, down from 967 in 2014, so the deals are concentrated at the higher end.This trend is spurring the return of the oft-derided conglomerates that came about in the 1960s. As was the case then, instead of growth and survival, we may just end up with bloat.At the moment, it is hard to find anything that can slow the merger train. Everything is going right. But it is in these times that perhaps caution is necessary. The merger market has always been cyclical. The current is moving forward, but sentiment can change. In addition, the risk of disruption still exists, whether it be the United States election, renewed uncertainty in Europe or global turmoil from Russia. And there is the prospect of higher interest rates, and how that will affect cheap deal financing is anybody\u2019s guess.If we have learned anything from more than 100 years of corporate mergers, it is that the lurking influences eventually emerge and the current trends driving all of this merger activity are unlikely to last. Let\u2019s hope it ends slowly and not with a sudden burst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Market Is Betting Trump Will Bring Higher Inflation and Interest Rates", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsAnd on Wednesday, bond markets sent one signal loud and clear: The Trump years are likely to feature higher inflation and higher interest rates than have prevailed in recent years.The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries soared to the highest level since January, rising 0.22 percentage points to 2.07 percent. And much of the rise was attributable to investors\u2019 belief that inflation will be higher than had seemed to be the case before the election surprise.Bond market data tells us that consumer prices are on pace to rise 1.7 percent a year over the next half-decade, up from 1.61 percent Tuesday. The jump was even larger for longer-term expectations, with expectations of annual inflation over the next 10 years rising 0.13 percentage points and over the next 30 years rising 0.15 percentage points.Those numbers are based on the gap between interest rates on regular bonds and inflation-protected bonds. In effect, inflation-protected bonds have become more appealing in the eyes of investors relative to the conventional variety, implying that investors expect prices to rise more quickly than they have been.The changes so far are nothing alarming. The Federal Reserve has been trying to get inflation up toward its 2 percent target for years, and the swings suggest global investors think they are more likely to achieve that goal in the coming years.But it does suggest that investors see the economic ground shifting in the wake of Donald J. Trump\u2019s surprise victory on Tuesday. One big factor seems to be driving the changing sentiment. Mr. Trump is proposing large tax cuts and a huge amount of new infrastructure spending. If that creates stronger economic growth, that could drive prices higher \u2014 especially because, as many economists believe, the United States is already near its economic potential. The fiscal stimulus would translate into higher prices instead of more people working.Think of it this way: When the government pours hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure when there is mass unemployment, it can help put those people back to work and turn it into higher economic output without creating inflation. But when nearly all the people who want a job already have one, that spending just bids up the pay of people already working, eventually resulting in higher prices more broadly.That\u2019s the most obvious driver of the shift in bond markets. But there are a few other possibilities that could be in play, though there isn\u2019t much direct evidence of them.First, Mr. Trump has ignored the established practice of government officials not directly commenting on or attacking the Federal Reserve with his vocal criticism of chairwoman Janet Yellen. As president, he will be able to appoint two governors to the seven-member board of the central bank immediately.Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chair ends in early 2018, so he\u2019ll get to replace her if he chooses. (The president can\u2019t fire a chairperson because of disagreement over policy choices, only over misconduct.) If as president Mr. Trump pressures the Fed \u2014 or even just appoints members who are not worried about maintaining the central bank\u2019s inflation-fighting credibility \u2014 inflation and longer-term interest rates would tend to rise.Second, higher budget deficits would force the federal government to issue more debt than it would on its current trajectory. A bigger supply of bonds with unchanged demand would, barring anything else, mean lower bond prices, which in the math of bond markets means higher interest rates.And finally, if Mr. Trump follows through on plans to start mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, it could leave some industries with labor shortages, particularly for low-skilled workers. The remaining workers in those industries could demand higher pay, which is good news for them, but it would also contribute to inflationary pressure.Again, those explanations are more in the category of speculation than something supported by the data. But whatever the exact mix of causes, it\u2019s a reminder that elections can matter for more than just the usual debates over foreign and domestic policy. They also can reshape the financial system.Advertisement"}

A document about the agreement, whose text was largely blacked out, was provided as part of a Freedom of Information Act request.\u201cOften, nonboard settlements are confidential and thus the specific terms cannot be released by the agency,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs such, I cannot comment to the terms of the agreement.\u201dBridewater said in a statement: \u201cWe have policies to protect ourselves that are both legal and reached in agreement with the people who are affected by them and we are pleased to let the legal-regulatory system judge their merits. That has been done and we are pleased and respectful of the process.\u201dIn the past, Mr. Dalio has said that his firm is often misunderstood by the outside world and the media, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve sort of kind of kept it behind the scenes in a sense.\u201dBridgewater is one of the most influential hedge fund firms in the world. It manages more than $150 billion for institutional investors, including public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.Over the years, the firm has lured some top government officials to its ranks. Its former general counsel, James B. Comey, is the current director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.In the meeting, the three men discussed global financial markets, currency and the American economy, according to a statement released by Mr. Trump\u2019s press team. \u201cSpecial emphasis was placed on restoring long-term economic growth rates on an annual basis of 4 to 5 percent,\u201d the statement said.The complaint against Bridgewater was filed this summer after a sexual harassment complaint by a former Bridgewater employee. The board had accused Bridgewater of \u201cinterfering with, restraining and coercing\u201d employees from exercising their rights.The former employee, who withdrew his harassment claim after Bridgewater did not object to his taking a job with another firm, had claimed that he was the victim of sexual harassment by a male supervisor. He also said in his complaint that the firm had retaliated against him.Lawyers for the former employee did not return requests for comment.In a letter explaining the redactions, a labor board official said that much of the agreement was being kept confidential \u201cto protect the privacy interests\u201d of Bridgewater and \u201cconfidential commercial or financial interests.\u201d It added that the determination to keep the agreement confidential was made after considering \u201cobjections and arguments\u201d raised by the hedge fund firm.Advertisement"}

Dressed in ragtag uniforms and brimming with Islamist fervor, they pointed out holes from airstrikes and the rubble that had once been the Police Academy.\u201cThere was too much corruption and looting before,\u201d said Masoud Saad, 19, who had dropped out of middle school to become a fighter. \u201cWe wanted to present the true religion of God in a correct way.\u201dNow they are struggling to govern in the middle of a war that has ground to a destructive stalemate.In an interview in his car, because the Defense Ministry headquarters had been bombed, Brig.

And the group\u2019s anti-American stance rankles Washington, which used to count on the Yemeni government as an ally against Al Qaeda and has aided Saudi Arabia in its military campaign against the rebels.The rebels\u2019 slogan is spray-painted on walls and checkpoints throughout their territory: \u201cGod is great. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse on the Jews. Victory for Islam.\u201dThe Houthi movement began as a religious revival in the 1990s among Zaydi Muslims, an Arab religious minority in northern Yemen who sought to push back against efforts by Saudi Arabia to spread its fundamentalist version of Sunni Islam.The group takes its name from its founder, Hussein Badr Eddin al-Houthi, who was killed by Yemeni forces in 2004. His followers launched an insurgency against the government, and developed as a guerrilla force in a series of civil wars.That background of insurgency rooted in backwater parts of the Arab world\u2019s poorest state forged the group into a strong fighting force but gave it few skilled politicians, intellectuals or technocrats \u2014 a weakness glaringly apparent during a recent visit by New York Times journalists in Sana.In interviews during a recent trip to Yemen, Houthi leaders and fighters described themselves as \u201crevolutionaries\u201d in the mold of Hezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza, saying their aim was to cleanse the country of corrupt leaders they considered beholden to foreign powers. In describing their goals, they spouted beliefs that often clashed with their behavior.\u201cI saw that they stood with justice and the oppressed,\u201d said Majid Ali, who dropped out of a Sana university to join the Houthis when they seized the capital. \u201cThe goal was not to take control, but to help the oppressed and the weak.\u201dBut their enemies in Yemen and Saudi Arabia insist that the Houthis are a dangerous proxy force being used by Iran to expand its influence and challenge Saudi influence.Analysts and diplomats who follow Yemen say the reality is somewhere in between. While commonly considered Shiite, the Houthis\u2019 Zaydi sect differs significantly from Iran\u2019s official Shiite creed, and historically ties between the Houthis and Iran were not strong.But their shared hatred for Saudi Arabia has brought them together in the current conflict, and Iran has given the Houthis weapons and technical help to attack Saudi forces along the border.April Longley Alley, a Yemen analyst with the International Crisis Group, said the Houthis\u2019 surge out of the north to seize the capital had been opportunistic. Their objectives included gaining a decisive stake in national decision-making and in Yemen\u2019s military and security apparatus.What remains unclear, she said, is how the war has changed those goals.\u201cNow that they are in the capital, the question is how much of a stake do they think they can hold on to after this experience with governance,\u201d she said.During our 10-day trip to Sana and nearby provinces, it was clear that the Houthis were in charge. Their authorities issued our visas, determined what sites we could visit and assigned us a minder to make sure we stuck to the program.Houthi checkpoints dotted the roads, sometimes less than a mile apart, and some of the scrappy young fighters who manned them struggled to read our Houthi-issued permits before allowing us to pass. While this slowed traffic, Houthi security measures have put a stop to the suicide bombings and assassinations that used to be frequent in the capital, perhaps their greatest achievement in governing.Many ministry buildings have been bombed by the Saudi-led coalition, and those still intact are nearly empty, their employees staying home for fear of airstrikes and because they are not being paid.In many cases, the Houthis have installed their loyalists as overseers, giving militants with few qualifications authority over civil servants with significant experience.One Sana-based businessman recalled going to a police station to file a complaint and finding a dozen officers unable to take action without orders from their new Houthi boss.To visit Sana\u2019s main pediatric and maternity hospital, we had to get permission from its new \u201cdirector,\u201d a Houthi in a robe and plastic sandals who allowed that his sole qualification was a diploma in nursing.A nurse who had worked there for 16 years said he had not been paid in two months and complained that the Houthis had no way to fund their administration.\u201cAnd if you go out and protest to ask for your rights, they could take you to prison,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s all armed militias.\u201dOfficially overseeing the Houthis\u2019 attempt to govern is the High Political Council, formed this year.In an interview in the Republican Palace, Yemen\u2019s equivalent of the White House, the council\u2019s head, Saleh al-Sammad, called the body \u201cthe highest authority in the country,\u201d but acknowledged that the state\u2019s main sources of income were out of its hands.The council took another hit in September when President Hadi moved Yemen\u2019s Central Bank, which paid the salaries of 1.2 million civil servants, to the southern port city of Aden, where his rival administration has a presence.Mr. Sammad blamed Saudi Arabia, the United States and the United Nations for Yemen\u2019s growing humanitarian crisis, but said it would only intensify people\u2019s will to fight.\u201cMost of the Yemeni people are armed, and they consider Saudi Arabia responsible for their humiliation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worse the economic situation gets, the more people will be pushed toward confrontation and the fronts.\u201dThe Houthis\u2019 fighting mettle and alliance with some Yemeni military units has enabled them to stage painful attacks on Saudi Arabia and fire ballistic missiles over the border, killing Saudi soldiers and civilians.The group\u2019s endgame remains unclear, however. It has participated in peace talks and agreed to a recent cease-fire, but the truce expired on Monday, amid accusations by both sides of violations and with no sign of when talks might resume.Many Yemenis in the country\u2019s south and east oppose what they see as a Houthi coup, and measuring the depth of their support in areas controlled by the Houthis is difficult.Human rights organizations have accused the Houthis of indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, arbitrary arrests of political opponents and torture. But some Yemenis who have been living under Houthi rule said the Saudi intervention had unified diverse forces against a common enemy.\u201cWhat brought the army together with Ansar Allah?\u201d asked Tariq Mohammed, a policeman in the town of Hajjah, using another name for the Houthis. \u201cThe aggression against the country. That is what caused us to come together as one hand.\u201dA map on Nov. 27 with an article about the struggles of the Houthis, a rebel group that has seized the Yemeni capital, Sana, and many other parts of the country, misidentified the country east of Iran in some editions.

{"Headline": "Review: Election Night With the Gabriels, a Play in Real Time", "Date": "2016-12-04", "News": "Supported byThey didn\u2019t exactly improve my state of mind about the state of the nation. But they put me in touch with feelings that I had been trying to avoid all day. There are times when sitting down with like-minded friends for a good cry \u2014 even if the crying is on the inside \u2014 temporarily drains the poison from what has felt like an abscess of a day.The Gabriels are the tenderly wrought creations of the playwright Richard Nelson. Their time onstage here and in two previous dramas \u2014 along with Mr. Nelson\u2019s earlier tetralogy, \u201cThe Apple Family Plays\u201d (seen between 2010 and 2013), also set in Rhinebeck \u2014 may collectively represent the most profound achievement in topical theater in this country since the Depression-era triumphs of Clifford Odets\u2019s \u201cWaiting for Lefty\u201d and Marc Blitzstein\u2019s \u201cThe Cradle Will Rock.\u201dNot that Mr. Nelson\u2019s cycle of works is anything like those ardently partisan predecessors. Neither the Apple nor the Gabriel plays are exhortative in any polemical way. Nor do they belong to that class of domestic melodramas (see: \u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d) in which a warring, divided family festers with the sins of their nation.When \u201cWomen of a Certain Age\u201d begins, most of its characters have already cast their votes for president. They have all been for Hillary Clinton, though this play could never serve as part of any campaign endorsement. A troubled ambivalence shades the political allegiances of the Gabriels, though there is something about the prospect of a woman as president that makes them glow a bit brighter in the twilight.As its title suggests, \u201cWomen of a Certain Age\u201d is indeed dominated by women \u2014 all in late middle age, except for one, who\u2019s in her 80s, and all as at ease in their roles as if they were their favorite bathrobes. The house where they have come together to eat belonged to Thomas Gabriel, a playwright who died a year earlier, and is now presided over by his widow, Mary (Maryann Plunkett), a retired doctor.Also assembled for the purposes of making a cheering meal from an old Betty Crocker cookbook are Thomas\u2019s mother, Patricia (Roberta Maxwell), a resident at an assisted-living center nearby; Thomas\u2019s sister, Joyce (Amy Warren), a costume designer who lives in Brooklyn; and his first wife, Karin (Meg Gibson), an actress, who is temporarily staying in the house. Then there\u2019s Hannah (Lynn Hawley), who is married to Thomas\u2019s brother, George (Jay O. Sanders), a carpenter.Notice that I have saved mentioning the one male cast member for last. Though all of Mr. Nelson\u2019s Rhinebeck plays have featured strong female characters, in this one, he more or less turns the stage over to them entirely (though Mr. Sanders, wonderful as always, is a gallant kibitzer).And, yes, these women do talk occasionally of Mrs. Clinton, whom they wish were a little closer to perfection than she, being mortal, has turned out to be. Karin has even put together a one-woman show that traces the chapters of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s life, to be performed (and not without irony) later that evening.But in cleaning out a lot of dusty boxes and trunks, the Gabriel women have come across vintage magazines, cookbooks, photographs and sheet music that summon earlier eras. Women have changed so much since then, haven\u2019t they? Well, haven\u2019t they?The reason for all this rummaging, by the way, is that their house is on the market, to help pay for college for George and Hannah\u2019s son (who cast his first vote for president that afternoon) and for the care of the aging Patricia. \u201cThe buzzards are circling,\u201d George says, but it\u2019s not really a joke. No one is entirely sure of where she or he will be in a year\u2019s time.The talk in \u201cWomen\u201d never strays far from the safe foot path of casual conversation. But Mr. Nelson knows that in certain contexts, no conversation is casual. And somehow, before you know it, this modest play has indirectly addressed matters both of the utmost immediate relevance \u2014 the election, the economy, the medical industry \u2014 and of cosmic implications.Far more than in any of his other plays, Mr. Nelson comes close here to capturing the elusive, expansive comic sadness we associate with his beloved Chekhov. That Chekhovian sense of time fading even as we inhabit it thrums through both the talk and the silences.This is all the truer because the team of designers here \u2014 Susan Hilferty and Jason Ardizzone-West (set), Jennifer Tipton (lighting) and Scott Lehrer and Will Pickens (sound) \u2014 have made the Gabriels\u2019 kitchen into what feels like a warm corner of never-ending security. And yet we\u2019re abidingly aware that this house may well be demolished within the year.When we say that \u201cthis too shall pass,\u201d it is sometimes as a source of comfort. But when you think about the phrase in a larger way, it\u2019s frightening, too, in that it says that our very lives shall pass soon enough. Mr. Nelson understands both the solace and the sorrow of that multipurpose adage.By the way, if you plan to see \u201cWomen\u201d \u2014 and you should, no matter your political persuasion \u2014 brace yourself for the moment when Ms. Plunkett\u2019s Mary, toward the end, is asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s pregnant with possibilities, but Mary chooses to answer it in the most direct and literal-minded way on offer. This is not the kind of statement that usually elicits tears, but the house was in floods on the night I saw \u201cWomen.\u201d Perhaps everyone was thinking, as I was, that the only thing to do when the world goes dark is to try to avoid thinking about anything beyond that next, small step you have to take.Advertisement"}

Trump probably could not have found a better candidate for the job than Mr. Ebell.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Mr. Ebell, who revels in taking on the scientific consensus on global warming, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s lead agent in choosing personnel and setting the direction of the federal agencies that address climate change and environmental policy more broadly.Mr. Ebell has said that the plan, which has been tied up in the courts since it was finalized in 2015, is illegal. In the interview in Paris last year, he said he hoped whoever was elected president would \u201cundo the E.P.A. power plant regs and some of the other regs that are very harmful to our economy.\u201dAs the person Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the transition at the E.P.A., Mr. Ebell, 63, will be in a position to begin to do just that.Mr. Ebell, who did not respond to a request for an interview, grew up on a ranch in Oregon.

{"Headline": "Asserting a Muslim Fashion Identity", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byLast week, quietly and without much fanfare, the 22nd global Vogue went live.Framed in striking black and gold, the glossy digital pages look, in many ways, much like any other international issue of the world\u2019s most powerful fashion magazine. There is a video interview with the star model Gigi Hadid, a colorful carousel of spring 2017 runway trends, a lavish editorial featuring the latest Chanel, and bright, chatty pieces about hot local brands and social media stars.But then there is this: \u201cHow to Style Your Hair Under a Hijab.\u201d And this: Malikah, a fiery Beirut-raised hip-hop star, describing how she began her career spitting lyrics into a face mask to hide her identity from disapproving conservatives.And, just after a cinematic short film featuring the Lebanese designer Elie Saab and the model Elisa Sednaoui amid ornate dining rooms and lush walled gardens, there is this: the definitive edit of this season\u2019s most stylish abayas (robelike dresses).\u201cThis Vogue is very overdue,\u201d said Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz, 41, the Riyadh-based Saudi princess, former retailer and newly crowned editor in chief of Vogue Arabia, while she was in Paris during fashion week last month. \u201cThe Arabs deserve their Vogue, and they\u2019ve deserved it for a long, long time.\u201d\u201cThe Vogue Arabia woman is one who celebrates her tradition but also considers herself a highly educated global citizen,\u201d Ms. Aljuhani Abdulaziz said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that we understand luxury almost better than anyone else on earth. Middle Eastern women have been serious couture clients since the late 1960s. We\u2019ve been around long before the Russians and the Chinese ever came into the picture.\u201dA key part of her Vogue editorial mission, she said, is to eradicate misconceptions around the Arab and Muslim diaspora. The new magazine\u2019s headquarters will be in Dubai, and alongside the online platform starting next March, the 25-member editorial team will produce 11 print issues a year, two of which will be solely in Arabic.\u201cVogue Arabia is not just about appealing to our own region, but about providing a cross-cultural bridge, a beautiful source of inspiration you would want to pick up even if you were from another area,\u201d she said.\u201cMany people don\u2019t really know exactly what Arabia is, and there are major misunderstandings around modest dressing, too,\u201d Ms. Aljuhani Abdulaziz added. \u201cI have a responsibility to tackle those issues, through a fashion lens, of course. I am not interested in being a political magazine. There are plenty of others who do that. But what I can lay out to readers, both near and far, is that what brings us together is far greater than what sets us apart.\u201dA hijab is not just a symbol or a statement, \u201cbut a part of a Muslim woman\u2019s identity, an identity they are asserting more confidently,\u201d Ms. Hasibuan said. (Her show received a standing ovation.) \u201cI believe fashion is one of the outlets in which we can start that cultural shift in today\u2019s society to normalize the hijab in America and other parts of the West, so as to break down stereotypes and demystify misconceptions.\u201dIndeed, modest fashion is fast becoming a commercial phenomenon; the global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $327 billion by 2020, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report \u2014 larger than the current clothing markets of Britain ($107 billion), Germany ($99 billion) and India ($96 billion) combined. And a rising Muslim middle class, having greater affluence and sophisticated tastes as well as pride in its religion, is likely to triple from an estimated 300 million in 2015 to 900 million by 2030, according to Ogilvy Noor, the Islamic branding consultancy.Shelina Janmohamed, vice president of Ogilvy Noor, said: \u201cThe rise in modest fashion over the last decade has come hand in hand with the emergence of \u2018Generation M\u2019: Muslims who believe that faith and modernity go hand in hand. They want to wear their religion with pride but also feel part of the societies around them.\u201dShe said that more than one-third of today\u2019s Muslims are younger than 15, and nearly two-thirds are younger than 30. And when it comes to young women, more are digitally connected, marrying later and in possession of a disposable income than ever before.\u201cConsumption is part of their identity,\u201d Ms. Janmohamed said. \u201cWhen they buy products that help them better their practice and that reinforce their beliefs, then they believe it will also make them better Muslims.\u201dThe modest fashion catwalk, which hosts three to four runway shows per day, largely from foreign brands, is the centerpiece of the weekend, said the Expo\u2019s chief executive, Tahir Mirza, though it also includes live cooking demonstrations and workshops on Islamic art put on by local galleries.\u201cThe shows are packed,\u201d Mr. Mirza said. \u201cMany young British Muslim women love these modest fashion houses from abroad, because they have westernized branding but traditional values. And they don\u2019t want to compromise.\u201dFor Jacob Abrian, the chief executive of the Arab Fashion Council, the industry body responsible for organizing Arab Fashion Week, his primary focus beyond show seasons is on reinforcing local infrastructure and the framework necessary to create a viable, interconnected fashion industry across the region. By strengthening the existing manufacturing roots and luxury heritage \u2014 from the small traditional factories and village damask weavers to glossy fashion houses being started from the glittering skyscrapers of the Gulf \u2014 and encouraging Western designers to come and showcase their work to a valuable client base, the Middle East could become a center for fashion in its own right.Ms. Aljuhani Abdulaziz appeared acutely aware that her role as Vogue Arabia editor in chief would require relentless careful navigation of religious and regional codes.But as the first Vogue editor to have formerly been a retailer (she was a founder of a fashion concept store in Riyadh called D\u2019NA), she pointed out that she was in the best possible position to understand the demands of her 21st-century readership, \u201cbe it the sophisticated Qatari woman able to shop in Europe, or to help a young woman in a remote village in Algeria or Yemen have dreams and feel like she can belong to something.\u201d\u201cThis job is not without its challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cIt only really dawned on me after the appointment that this won\u2019t just be me doing something I love, but is also a massive responsibility. But I know what offends in this world and what doesn\u2019t, because I am one of them. I have my own sensitivities as to what is appropriate and what is not. I certainly don\u2019t believe that you have to have blatant sexuality or absolute nudity to do a beautiful editorial.\u201d\u201cAny regional title outside the so-called Western world has to make decisions on models and their ethnicity, skin color and body type rather than the usual default Caucasian, and consider considering cultural distinctions,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut Vogue Arabia will have to constantly cross overtly into religious as well as national and regional identities, practices and a variety of income brackets in order to find her reader. And that won\u2019t always be easy.\u201cThen again,\u201d she continued, \u201cthis is something Western brands are being forced to think about more and more when it comes to appealing to observant women from numerous religious backgrounds. Fashion designers in particular need to think more laterally about how they design and the nonnegotiable elements of some lifestyles they design for.\u201cModest fashion and Muslim fashion are no longer on the periphery of the industry, and an industry that stopped being able to afford to be elitist and exclusive long ago. This movement is really driven by an empowered new demographic who are expressing their presence in the modern world, and attempting to assert their place in it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under the Din of the Presidential Race Lies a Once and Future Threat: Cyberwarfare", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 The 2016 presidential race will be remembered for many ugly moments, but the most lasting historical marker may be one that neither voters nor American intelligence agencies saw coming: It is the first time that a foreign power has unleashed cyberweapons to disrupt, or perhaps influence, a United States election.And there is a foreboding sense that, in elections to come, there is no turning back.The steady drumbeat of allegations of Russian troublemaking \u2014 leaks from stolen emails and probes of election-system defenses \u2014 has continued through the campaign\u2019s last days. These intrusions, current and former administration officials agree, will embolden other American adversaries, which have been given a vivid demonstration that, when used with some subtlety, their growing digital arsenals can be particularly damaging in the frenzy of a democratic election.\u201cMost of the biggest stories of this election cycle have had a cybercomponent to them \u2014 or the use of information warfare techniques that the Russians, in particular, honed over decades,\u201d said David Rothkopf, the chief executive and editor of Foreign Policy, who has written two histories of the National Security Council. \u201cFrom stolen emails, to WikiLeaks, to the hacking of the N.S.A.\u2019s tools, and even the debate about how much of this the Russians are responsible for, it\u2019s dominated in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in any prior election.\u201dThe magnitude of this shift has gone largely unrecognized in the cacophony of a campaign dominated by charges of groping and pay-for-play access. Yet the lessons have ranged from the intensely personal to the geostrategic.Email, a main conduit of communication for two decades, now appears so vulnerable that the nation seems to be wondering whether its bursting inboxes can ever be safe. Election systems, the underpinning of democracy, seem to be at such risk that it is unimaginable that the United States will go into another national election without treating them as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201dBut President Obama has been oddly quiet on these issues. He delivered a private warning to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during their final face-to-face encounter two months ago, aides say. Still, Mr. Obama has barely spoken publicly about the implications of foreign meddling in the election. His instincts, those who have worked with him on cyberissues say, are to deal with the problem by developing new norms of international behavior or authorizing covert action rather than direct confrontation.After a series of debates in the Situation Room, Mr. Obama and his aides concluded that any public retaliation should be postponed until after the election \u2014 to avoid the appearance that politics influenced his decision and to avoid provoking Russian counterstrikes while voting is underway. It remains unclear whether Mr. Obama will act after Tuesday, as his aides hint, or leave the decision about a \u201cproportional response\u201d to his successor.Cybersleuths, historians and strategists will debate for years whether Russia\u2019s actions reflected a grand campaign of interference or mere opportunism on the part of Mr. Putin. While the administration has warned for years about the possibility of catastrophic attacks, what has happened in the past six months has been far more subtle.Russia has used the techniques \u2014 what they call \u201chybrid war,\u201d mixing new technologies with old-fashioned propaganda, misinformation and disruption \u2014 for years in former Soviet states and elsewhere in Europe. The only surprise was that Mr. Putin, as he intensified confrontations with Washington as part of a nationalist campaign to solidify his own power amid a deteriorating economy, was willing to take them to American shores.The most common theory is that while the Russian leader would prefer the election of Donald J. Trump \u2014 in part because Mr. Trump has suggested that NATO is irrelevant and that the United States should pull its troops back to American shores \u2014 his primary motive is to undercut what he views as a smug American sense of superiority about its democratic processes.If so, this is a very different use of power than what the Obama administration has long prepared the nation for.Four years ago, Leon E. Panetta, the defense secretary at the time, warned of an impending \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d in which enemies could \u201ccontaminate the water supply in major cities or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country,\u201d perhaps in conjunction with a conventional attack.That is still a risk, of course \u2014 one that the Pentagon and its United States Cyber Command spend billions of dollars trying to deter. Yet America\u2019s main adversaries know those steps would constitute an act of war, most likely prompting an overwhelming military response.What has come instead \u2014 doling out stolen emails, testing the defenses of the voting system \u2014 clearly caught the administration off guard.\u201cThe unprecedented use of cyberintrusions to influence this election should galvanize our country to act,\u201d said John P. Carlin, who left the Justice Department two weeks ago as assistant attorney general for national security, a post in which he helped oversee legal responses to major Chinese and Iranian attacks on American banks and other institutions. \u201cWhoever is elected, how to regulate, defend and deter in cyberspace must be at the top of the national security agenda.\u201dYet he noted that \u201cin a campaign where cyberintrusions and threats dominated the news more than any other in American history, there has been surprisingly little discussion on how our country should confront the problem going forward.\u201dThe severity of the challenge has been particularly evident even in the final days of the campaign.The Department of Homeland Security invited reporters on Friday to tour its war room, a vast monitoring center that is buried deep in a nondescript building in Virginia and is connected to the National Security Agency and sensors running through government networks. The center is supposed to be the internet equivalent of the giant North American Aerospace Defense Command in Cheyenne Mountain, just outside Colorado Springs, which opened almost exactly 50 years ago to scan the skies and warn of incoming Soviet nuclear missiles.The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is expected to do the same thing, but its vision is limited to federal computer systems. Officials conceded that if a foreign power began tinkering with the registration rolls or vote-tallying systems on Tuesday \u2014 a process run by the states \u2014 it was unlikely that direct evidence would show up on the center\u2019s screens.\u201cOur partners would have to call us,\u201d one senior official conceded.Here on Sunday night in the battleground state of New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton held one of the final rallies of her campaign just miles from the headquarters of a company that was taken out two weeks ago in a \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack that paralyzed websites along the East Coast.Officials at the company, Dyn DNS, and others like it are frantically looking for ways to ward off another attack on Election Day out of fear that it could freeze up websites used for getting out the vote, showing people how to get to polling places or reporting results.And just a few hours before she arrived here, Mrs. Clinton got news that the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had informed Congress that his agency\u2019s review of the latest batch of her emails, found on the computer of former Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York, the estranged husband of one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aides, did nothing to change his view of the case.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s decision to use a private email server, of course, was the original digital act of this election season \u2014 the decision by Mrs. Clinton that, to keep her personal emails private, she would conduct her government business from a private server.Mr. Comey has never conclusively determined whether the Russians, or any other foreign power, broke into that server, which was kept in the Clintons\u2019 home in Chappaqua, N.Y. But the Russians had been behind many other break-ins, his investigators noted, including of the unclassified systems of the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If they skipped Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server, one investigator noted, it must have been an oversight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips Take Different Paths to \u2018Sold!\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIt was difficult to escape a sense of unreality in Manhattan last week.High in his eponymous 664-foot-high tower in Midtown, a real estate tycoon and erstwhile reality show host, having just been elected as the 45th president, was appointing members of his administration while protesters down below chanted their disapproval.At the same time, the three big international auction houses were trying to persuade the superrich to buy some of the world\u2019s most expensive art. By and large, they succeeded.\u201cEveryone has been in the dark about how the market would react to the craziness that has been going on in the outside world,\u201d said David Nisinson, a private art dealer based in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re not back to 2007, but this must have a positive effect,\u201d he said about the success of the five evening auctions, which all registered selling rates of more than 80 percent.But all three auction houses, using contrasting strategies, did manage to coax onto the market significant paintings in the $20 million to $50 million range, and ensure they found buyers.Phillips posted the most improved results. Its Wednesday evening auction of 20th-century and contemporary works raised $111.2 million, more than double the $46.6 million from the equivalent sale in May.The auction house, privately owned by Mercury, a luxury retail group based in Russia, has recently made a number of high-profile hires, including Robert Manley, a former deputy chairman at Christie\u2019s, and Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby\u2019s former worldwide head of contemporary art, who starts in March.Edward Dolman, the chairman and chief executive of Phillips, described the result of his sale as \u201ca significant step up in a market that has contracted.\u201dBut the auction houses\u2019 reliance on third-party guarantees to source and sell big-ticket artworks, particularly at Phillips and Sotheby\u2019s, does raise the question of how much that $25.6 million for the Richter represented a \u201ctrue\u201d market price.Values can be inflated when auction houses offer competitive guarantees to secure major consignments. These guarantee can then be transferred to a third party, who will either buy a work at a sale, or be rewarded for their unsuccessful bidding. More recently, some third-party guarantors \u2014 called \u201cirrevocable bidders\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 have also been paid fees if they are the purchaser. These confidential arrangements, denoted by symbols in the catalog, can have the effect of deterring bidding in the salesroom.\u201cIt\u2019s a sold picture, with uplift if possible,\u201d said Alan Hobart, director of the Pyms Gallery in London. \u201cThe price is arranged by the vendor and is normally high. It\u2019s become very opaque,\u201d added Mr. Hobart, who paid $8.45 million for Picasso\u2019s unguaranteed 1951 bronze sculpture, \u201cTete de Femme,\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s Nov. 14 auction of Impressionist and modern art.Bidders at Sotheby\u2019s were similarly lukewarm when Edvard Munch\u2019s 1902 Symbolist masterwork, \u201cGirls on the Bridge,\u201d was offered \u2014 with a third-party irrevocable bid \u2014 as the star of an otherwise relatively thin 42-lot Impressionist and modern auction. Estimated at a heady $50 million, this was bought for $54.5 million by the guarantor.In the case of both the Richter and the Munch, the third-party buyer was also paid a fee by the auction house. Following an approach from Sotheby\u2019s, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs recommended in September that \u201cnet\u201d prices reflecting buyer discounts should be published after such sales, and all three houses have complied. The buyer of the Richter received about $1.6 million from Phillips; the buyer of the Munch $2 million from Sotheby\u2019s, according to post-auction calculations.\u201cThe air has got quite thin at the top,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. \u201cThere used to be at least two bidders on most of the lots, but now there is usually only one. Guarantees do provide cover for the lots and give a sense of security. But what do the totals mean in terms of profit? We\u2019re blind.\u201dWith 16 of the Ameses\u2019 works covered by third-party \u201cirrevocable\u201d bids, competition was conspicuously measured. But a sumptuous red-hued 1986 Richter abstract, \u201cA.B. Still,\u201d which the Ameses bought at Sotheby\u2019s in 1991 for $264,000, was doggedly pursued by two telephone bidders to a top price of $34 million, against an estimate of $20 million.Over all, the 79 lots of the Ames Collection raised $131.3 million, a total which would suggest that Sotheby\u2019s did make a profit on the guarantee.Similarly, the following evening at Christie\u2019s Impressionist and modern sale of 48 lots, Claude Monet\u2019s 1891 \u201cGrainstack\u201d \u2014 a spectacular sunset from the artist\u2019s first set of series paintings, also offered without a guarantee \u2014 set off a 14-minute bidding duel that ended in a telephone buyer paying $81.4 million with fees, also an auction high for the artist and the highest auction price this year.Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, the historic rivals of the auction world, are taking different approaches to winning consignments. The privately owned Christie\u2019s has drawn back from the high-rolling guarantees that bought it market dominance in 2015 and is now luring sellers with the promise of higher prices in competitive bidding at its auctions.With Phillips now in the mix, three-way bidding for consignments of blue-chip works is becoming the new reality at the top end of the auction market. This is good news for owners of valuable art, if not bidders in salesrooms.\u201cI\u2019m very happy, said a smiling Fran\u00e7ois Odermatt, a collector based in Montreal, just before Phillips\u2019s auction last Wednesday. \u201cThe more competition the better.\u201dAn earlier version of the article mischaracterized the status of Cheyenne Westphal at Phillips. She will take up a position there in March; she has not already joined the company.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Victory Could Prompt Fed to Raise Rates More Quickly", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve remains on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December as investors generally reacted with equanimity to the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president of the United States.And some analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans could prompt the Fed to keep increasing the rate.The president-elect has promised to stimulate faster economic growth with measures that include a large tax cut and as much as $1 trillion in spending on infrastructure. He has also promised new barriers to imports, which could drive up inflation. Economists appear deeply divided on the impact of such policies.\u201cHis market-positive agenda will begin to emerge and, with a Republican Congress behind him, the potential for many of these policies to become law is high,\u201d said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer for equities at Federated Investors.Others, however, took a bleaker view of the likely consequences of Mr. Trump\u2019s election, arguing that he could push a fragile economy into recession.\u201cA blanket of uncertainty now hovers over the private sector of the economy,\u201d wrote Bernard Baumohl, chief economist at The Economic Outlook Group. \u201cThe cost of that uncertainty should be palpable. Growth will reverse course fairly significantly.\u201dThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note topped 2 percent for the first time since the first quarter of the year, suggesting that investors are anticipating higher rates.The quick rebound appeared to reflect a first impression among investors that Mr. Trump\u2019s partnership with congressional Republicans was likely to lift the economy. But analysts cautioned that the market\u2019s mood could change.\u201cThe rates market is pricing in more of a fiscal stimulus rather than a growth shock,\u201d economists at TD Securities wrote in a note Wednesday. \u201cBut we should be sure not to extrapolate immediate reactions to long-term implications.\u201dFederal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.Looming over all such deliberations are the president-elect\u2019s trade policies. He has promised to impose more tariffs and to tax sharply goods imported from American companies that move operations overseas. That could increase inflation and depress productivity gains.Mr. Trump\u2019s election was viewed as one of the few developments that might throw a wrench into the works. The Fed, which started the year predicting that it would raise rates four times, has instead left rates untouched in a range between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent. The low rates are intended to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. If financial conditions tighten in the coming weeks, or volatility rises, the Fed might decide to delay a rate increase again.\u201cFaced with such a tightening in market-driven financial conditions, the Fed would be less likely to add a higher federal funds rate to the mix,\u201d wrote Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management, a division of BNY Mellon.But a growing number of Fed officials are publicly advocating a rate increase, and the Fed has carefully prepared markets for the likelihood that it would raise rates. Moreover, the Fed has several weeks to watch and wait before its next meeting on Dec. 13 and 14.\u201cWhile fiscal and economic policy uncertainty has increased, it would be a challenge for Fed rhetoric to maintain an aura of being above the political fray if that were the only rationale for not moving next month,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. He said he still expected a rate increase in December.Mr. Trump will also have the opportunity to quickly overhaul the Fed\u2019s leadership. Once in office, he can fill two vacancies on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board. And in 2018, when their terms end, he can replace the Fed\u2019s top officials, Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman.Mr. Trump sharply criticized Ms. Yellen during the campaign, claiming without evidence that the Fed was delaying increasing rates until after the election to improve the fortunes of Democrats. Raising rates, he said, would pop \u201ca big, fat, ugly bubble.\u201dUnder Ms. Yellen, the Fed has embraced a responsibility to reduce unemployment by holding down interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Some conservative economists have sharply criticized this campaign, arguing that the Fed is trying to do too much, and that it is sowing the seeds of financial instability and higher inflation.Officials appointed by Mr. Trump are likely to urge the Fed to focus on fighting inflation, meaning they probably would favor raising rates more quickly.\u201cA reasonable assumption is that these nominees will all be more hawkish than would have been the case under Clinton,\u201d Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said, referring to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Mr. Guha noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s selections would be constrained by the need to win the support of congressional Republicans.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}

So it\u2019s not surprising that it took him a little time to figure out where he wanted to retire about a decade ago.He and his wife, Cecelia, 69, decided to settle in Virginia; Ms. Riffer grew up in Roanoke, and Mr. Riffer\u2019s mother was then living in Yorktown. Their first choice, Fredericksburg, was only about an hour from Washington, but they didn\u2019t find a home to their liking and the traffic was too busy.College-bound students aren\u2019t the only ones comparing university communities, which have a lot of advantages for older Americans who are seeking intellectual stimulation, cultural amenities and sports offerings without high urban price tags, not to mention a generally healthy economic base.Some who migrate to college towns later in life return to the town of their alma mater. Others research to find a place they see in their mind\u2019s eye.For Sherry Burford, a former market researcher turned career coach, and her husband, Peter, an independent book publisher, the decision to relocate began with a road trip in 2007. They had become recreational sailors and wanted easier access to water than was available in Short Hills, N.J. They toured areas in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware before realizing that Ithaca, N.Y., where Ms. Burford graduated from Ithaca College in 1973, fit their criteria.\u201cI wanted to return to my college roots and have the lifestyle I didn\u2019t have as a student,\u201d she said.When their son graduated from college in 2010, the couple sold their house on a quarter-acre in New Jersey and moved into one last yearly rental to see whether they wanted to downsize. They didn\u2019t. The next year, they bought a home that was about the same size, 2,500 square feet, as their New Jersey home. The new residence sits on nearly two acres and was one-third the price.In other seasons, Ms. Burford credits the area with encouraging a healthier lifestyle that incorporates biking and hiking in addition to sailing. The couple visits the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art on the Cornell University campus and Cornell Botanic Gardens. They anticipate enrolling in a bird behavior course offered in the spring by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.Bill O\u2019Connell, 69, a former trade association executive who lived in suburban Washington, took a course to decide where to live before settling in Asheville, N.C., home of the University of North Carolina Asheville. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute on that campus offers two courses to help individuals with retirement planning. Mr. O\u2019Connell said they helped focus his priorities. \u201cMost people confuse where it was fun to vacation with where it is good to retire,\u201d he said.He was renting in Alexandria, Va., paying $2,400 a month for 1,000 square feet of living space. The Asheville condominium he now owns is twice the size. And he said he did not skimp on entertainment. While the symphony in Chicago, where he also once lived, was more than $100 a ticket, in Asheville his cost is less than $40. \u201cI feel more like a participant because of the cost of things I like to consume,\u201d he said.He already had two advanced degrees, an M.B.A. and a Master of Public Administration, but he decided to enroll as a graduate student to study how communities approach public health for older adults.For all the advantages, relocating to a college community also has some drawbacks. \u201cColleges and universities can be a bit insular,\u201d Catherine Frank, executive director at the Osher Institute at U.N.C. Asheville, wrote in an email. Moreover, \u201cbecoming part of the intellectual life of a campus focused on serving undergraduates can take some persistence.\u201dShe points out that as colleges and universities worry more about their bottom lines, many are becoming less flexible about nontraditional students or about rules for auditing courses.Ms. Frank urged caution for those considering returning to the place where they went to college. \u201cYou need to think about how you have changed and how the place itself has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to think about what you really need every day, not just about the outstanding experiences you might have occasionally.\u201dStephen A. Sass, a research economist at the Center for Retirement Research in Boston, says he believes such moves are made more easily at younger ages, before the loss of a spouse or an unexpected illness become part of the equation.Joe and Brenda Talley, 70 and 65, who were already living in the college town of Iowa City, considered moving to areas in five other states. They sought a community no larger than 75,000 people where they could escape harsh winters and avoid a high cost of living, Ms. Talley said. They eventually gravitated to Oxford, Miss.The move held some surprises. The metro area of their new town, about 20,000, is smaller than Iowa City\u2019s, which has a population of 67,000. For a wider selection of electronics and clothing, they travel 110 miles round-trip to the larger city of Tupelo as frequently as three times a month, where they can shop at big-box stores like Best Buy and Barnes & Noble.They were accustomed to receiving health care at a large medical complex, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Finding specialists in Oxford who take Medicare has been more challenging than they expected. They travel to Tupelo for that, too.For all the unexpected twists, they are glad they made the move. People are friendly, and the welcome from the Oxford Newcomers Club, a 17-year-old organization for retirees and other new residents, was warm and helpful.You can do a lot of useful research, Ms. Talley said, but in the end, \u201cchoosing any community comes down to a leap of faith.\u201dAn article on Saturday about retirees who move to college towns erroneously included one big-box store among those a couple, Joe and Brenda Talley, travel to Tupelo, Miss., to shop at. There is no Costco there, though they sometimes go to one in Memphis.Advertisement"}

It is worth remembering that these figures come from a survey of the most powerful members of society, not the poor, who might experience the shortcomings of our infrastructure more intimately.

All sides, though, agree that the outcome depends in large part on the particular timing and location of the spending.

The fixed rate of the tax, along with the increasing fuel efficiency of American cars, has meant that gas tax revenues have not kept up with inflation and the costs of maintaining our roads. The federal government has had to chip in money from its general fund to make up for the shortfalls, but Congress has been reluctant to continue doing this.

{"Headline": "Battle Over an Oil Pipeline: Teaching About the Standing Rock Sioux Protests", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byCivicsThis lesson plan asks students to weigh the potential drawbacks and advantages of the pipeline project for all involved, then challenges students to develop a reasonable and just solution to the current standoff. Ideas in the Going Further section can encourage students to look more closely at environmental issues, Native American history and more._________If you have one or two class periods...Warm UpEvaluate Costs and BenefitsGenerate SolutionsIs completing the pipeline \u2014 or stopping the pipeline \u2014 necessarily a win-lose situation? Is there a compromise solution that might please both protesters and pipeline supporters? And if not, is there a resolution that at least might be deemed fair and equitable considering all of the circumstances?Break students into teams representing each of the main groups identified in the chart above. Give students access to the following resources and time to develop a solution (or solutions) that would be acceptable to their group.Next, have each group list its solutions for the rest of the class to see. Are there any ideas that have support from multiple groups? Ask students to explain their reasoning, then clarify, and extending their thinking as necessary. Can the class come to a consensus?Make PredictionsAsk students: What do you think will happen next? How do you think this standoff will be resolved? Why?Voice Your OpinionHow might the United States government navigate a just and equitable solution to the conflict over the pipeline?_________Going Further IdeasExplore Environmental Issues\u25a0 This is not the first time in recent history that the Sioux Indians have dealt with the consequences of efforts to improve infrastructure in the Dakotas. The Oahe dam, built in 1958, was constructed to control the Missouri River\u2019s flooding and provide hydroelectric power. It did those things, but it was also severely destructive to the Standing Rock community, flooding homes and forcing the surrender of land through eminent domain laws. Re-engineering the Missouri River changed the entire way of life of the Standing Rock Sioux by eliminating the natural resources on which the tribe had depended.The Standing Rock poverty rate is 43.2 percent, nearly triple the national average of 14.5 percent. There is little economic activity to speak of and childhood mortality, suicide and dropout rates are among the highest in the nation. Food insecurity is vast. Access to quality health care and education is lacking. Far too many go without electricity or running water.\u25a0 Environmental issues often carry both local and global implications. In this case, there is the immediate concern over whose drinking water might be at risk. But activists also claim that their role as \u201cwater protectors\u201d has national scope \u2014 by blocking the pipeline, they are preserving the water for all those that use the Missouri River downstream now and in the future. This is a matter both of environmental awareness (identifying the potential pitfalls of this kind of development) and environmental justice.Environmental justice is defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.Research a History of ResistanceFor research:The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources.There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. By September, more than 300 tribes \u2014 including my tribe, the Ojibwe \u2014 were physically represented at the protest camp, at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers.What also makes this Indian protest different from others is its manner and its reach. The protesters refer to themselves as \u201cwater protectors.\u201d Theirs is a nonviolent protest that is speaking broadly, in such a way that non-Indians can see that these environmental and policy concerns affect them, too.Have students read the piece, annotating it and marking areas that represent continuity and change both from prior protests by American Indians and from the African-American civil rights movement. What does Mr. Treuer mean when he states: \u201cto say that the story of the Dakota Access pipeline is another iteration of that old western story is to repeat the mistakes of past protests and movements. We situate ourselves in a position of powerlessness\u201d? According to Mr. Treuer, how can Americans, indigenous and otherwise, assume power over the situation that has developed in Standing Rock?Investigate the Loss of Land and Wealth\u25a0 In the context of United States history, Native Americans have experienced great losses \u2014 broken treaties, massacres and deprivations. Should that past affect how one views this particular issue today?Students can also learn more about the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), which is connected to the pipeline debate. In \u201cBury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\u201d Dee Brown describes the treaty, signed at the end of Red Cloud\u2019s War:For a few more weeks [Red Cloud] kept the treaty makers waiting, and then on November 6, surrounded by a coterie of triumphant warriors, he came riding into Fort Laramie. Now a conquering hero, he would sign the treaty: \u201cFrom this day forward all war between the parties to this agreement shall forever cease. The government of the United States desires peace, and its honors is hereby pledged to keep it. The Indians desire peace, and they now pledge their honor to maintain it.\u201dFor the next twenty years, however, the contents of the other sixteen articles of that treaty of 1868 would remain a matter of dispute between the Indians and the government of the United States. What many of the chiefs understood was in the treaty and what was actually written therein after Congress ratified it were like two horses whose colorations did not match.Does this description of the treaty suggest that both parties had a clear understanding of the agreement that was made? How might this background color the ongoing relationship between the Sioux Indians and the United States government?Students can also look at how different maps tell alternate stories about the pipeline:Consider what the creators of each map have chosen to include or omit. Each map is of a similar area, but tells a different story: Ask students to translate each one into a brief written statement about the land and the people living there. What complications do the various maps help surface or hide?For the Standing Rock Sioux, the battle against the pipeline is not just about safe water \u2014 it\u2019s also about respecting sacred ancestral lands and burial grounds, and what they consider \u201cunceded territory.\u201d Should these claims be respected, even if the pipeline never crosses current reservation boundaries?As some residents find themselves cashing oil royalty checks worth tens of thousands of dollars a month or more, many of their neighbors are resigned to receiving almost nothing from the wells that pepper the landscape and even their own land \u2014 aside from the headaches that go with living in a boomtown.Tribes have been forced to fight a series of losing battles to control and capitalize on the natural resources found on their land. In North Dakota, where an oil boom has bolstered the state economy and driven the unemployment rate down to just 3.1 percent, the unemployment rate in Standing Rock is 79 percent.This vast inequity raises questions about how the wealth from natural resources should be shared. Is there a better way to divide the windfalls that come from natural resources? Is there a better way to protect people and the environment from the hazards of natural resource extraction? Or, is that the way our economy is supposed to work \u2014 there will always be a clear division between winners and losers, even in a sparsely populated state like North Dakota?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel to Seek 4th Term as Germany\u2019s Leader", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported bySlightly hoarse but clearly determined after consulting leaders of her conservative Christian Democratic party, Ms. Merkel said the decision to seek a fourth term was \u201canything but trivial,\u201d for her country, for her party and for herself.A scientist with a low-key manner, Ms. Merkel rejected the idea that, after the election of Donald J. Trump as president in the United States, she had a lone role in keeping Western liberalism alive. \u201cThat is grotesque, even almost absurd,\u201d she told reporters.But she also said that the campaign ahead of the German elections in fall 2017 would be unlike any other she has fought in an increasingly polarized country. She faces stronger challenges on the right and left, while the war in Syria, the arrival of large numbers of migrants and the continuing euro crisis tear at Germany and place new demands on its people.Since the election in the United States, speculation had mounted that Ms. Merkel would bow to pressure to run again and uphold liberal values in a world transformed by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and Britain\u2019s vote last summer to leave the European Union.Ms. Merkel, 62, has served 11 years as chancellor. She is the first woman and the first person raised in Communist East Germany to hold the post.Since coming to power in 2005, Ms. Merkel has gradually acquired a political stature commensurate with the power of her country, Western Europe\u2019s largest economy and its most populous nation, with about 81 million inhabitants.But her image as the cautious caretaker of her country\u2019s interests has suffered over the past year, after she opened Germany to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many of them Muslim refugees fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa.The prospect of integrating almost 1 million newcomers into Germany has weakened Ms. Merkel\u2019s standing at home, despite garnering some praise, particularly from President Obama.Visiting Berlin last week, Mr. Obama lavished compliments on his longest-standing ally in his eight years in office, saying that if he were German, he would vote for her.Ms. Merkel responded to the election of Mr. Trump with a robust appeal for him to follow Western values and respect human dignity. This, she said, was the basis of any close cooperation.Even as commentators and leaders outside Germany invoked her stature, Ms. Merkel has been eager not to hog the limelight.\u201cOne person alone can never solve everything,\u201d she said on Friday at a news conference with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain. \u201cWe are strong only together. In that, I want to do what my duty is as chancellor.\u201dRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.In the days before her party leadership met on Sunday, several Christian Democrats said that the next parliamentary elections would be difficult to win with Ms. Merkel, but impossible to win without her.As she entered the atrium of her party headquarters on Sunday, she was applauded by about two dozen people on a second-floor balcony.While Ms. Merkel mentioned several times that her ability to continue would be contingent on good health, she showed little weariness and gradually became almost feisty as she outlined the challenges to German industry and citizens in the 21st century.Germans should stick to their tried and tested concept of \u201csocial market economy,\u201d a blend of welfare state and capitalism, as they navigate this new world, Ms. Merkel said.But she acknowledged that even in this conservative and comparatively wealthy country, politics has been thrown into turmoil by the rise of the populist, right-wing Alternative for Germany party.It is now in 10 of the country\u2019s 16 state Parliaments and seems certain to win seats in the federal Parliament next year. That would scramble conventional coalition building, since no mainstream party has been willing to govern with the populists.Ms. Merkel\u2019s role as a beacon of liberal values may also be dented by the power of populism elsewhere in Europe, whose union has been thrown into ever greater doubt since Britain, the Continent\u2019s leading military power, voted in June to leave the European Union.Next month, Italy votes on constitutional reforms that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi considers crucial to his country\u2019s modernity. Austria will choose a president in an election plagued by delays, and may see the first far-right politician elected as head of state in modern Europe.The Netherlands, France and Germany all hold pivotal elections next year, with the ballot in France being closely watched as a bellwether for the strength of populism as embodied by the National Front of Marine Le Pen.Speaking in Berlin last week, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France predicted that \u201cEurope can die\u201d as a result of the populist wave and the economic and political dissonance in the 28-nation European Union.Ms. Merkel has guided Germany and, increasingly, Europe though myriad crises.She was chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis, and was much criticized for German insistence on austerity during the Greek debt crisis and the subsequent pressure on the euro. Since Russia flexed its military muscle by seizing Crimea and meddling in Ukraine in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the main Western interlocutor to President Vladimir V. Putin.Ms. Merkel has also led her country in abandoning nuclear power, and has moved her conservative party firmly to the center on social policy.An article on Nov. 21 about a decision by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to seek a fourth term referred incorrectly to the population of Germany. It has the largest population in the European Union, not in all of Europe. (Russia\u2019s population is larger.)Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Animosity in a Burmese Hub Deepens as Chinese Get Richer", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byMandalay JournalMANDALAY, Myanmar \u2014 From damp and drizzly London, the siren of British imperialism, Rudyard Kipling, wrote a poem that captured the palm trees, pagodas and temple bells of Burma during colonial rule.Kipling never visited Mandalay, having imagined it from a brief sojourn in a city called Moulmein, now Mawlamyine, several hundred miles to the south.But perhaps if he arrived in Mandalay today, he would find its charms faded \u2014 buried under the demands of Chinese commerce, and the hustle of Chinese businessmen scooping up jade and timber for the market back home.Residents view them as interlopers who take advantage of Mandalay\u2019s location close to India and Bangladesh, Laos and Thailand, as well as a large swath of southern China. And some of the Chinese view the Burmese as beneath them, slow at business and making money.At the open-air jade market, Chinese businessmen haggle with Burmese traders selling rough green slabs of the gemstone, freshly dug from mines in remote areas to the north. Deals have slowed. Prices are down in China, flattened by the slowing economy and a fierce anticorruption campaign.On a recent morning, the mood was surly along the rows of wooden stalls where the Chinese inspect the jade for quality and color.\u201cIt\u2019s dirty and chaotic, and sometimes dangerous,\u201d said Zhu Xuefei, a jade buyer from Guangdong Province in China. Myanmar, the name now used for Burma, was too poor to install the closed circuit television cameras that are ubiquitous in China to help prevent robberies, he complained.Chinese traders have been coming to Mandalay since before the mid-19th century, when the city was created on the banks of the Irrawaddy River as the royal redoubt. Records show a Chinese temple from 1773. Some sailed down the river; others rode south from Yunnan Province in mule caravans ferrying silver and silk. The Chinese had a light touch.Now the Chinese dominate the economy, their mansions lining the streets of an enclave called New Town, symbols of the wealth accrued in the underground drug, timber and mineral trades in the northern Shan and Wa States of Myanmar.The city has become a sprawl of about one million people on a scorched, dusty plain. George Orwell, who lived here briefly in the 1920s, dismissed it as having just five features: pagodas, pariahs, pigs, priests and prostitutes. The old pagodas, many covered with gilded paint, still exist, though the most notable recent one has a pale jade exterior, a testament to the city\u2019s new money.The timber buildings of Orwell\u2019s era either burned down or were demolished to make way for crude concrete buildings that now dominate the downtown area.In the early hours, the sun lights up the red brick fortress walls of the palace, and the moat glistens with soft light. But soon the sun\u2019s hot glare drums down on everything, and by midday the streets mostly empty out.Much of the activity moves to the teahouses. They are open sided, with ceiling fans moving listlessly in the heat. Waiters carry large metal teapots, their flip-flops making a swishing sound on the concrete floors as they fill customers\u2019 cups and plop down platters of curry.To soothe raw feelings between Chinese and Burmese customers, some teahouses display a photograph of the recent meeting in Beijing between the leader of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping.The barely disguised contempt of the Chinese toward the Burmese \u2014 \u201cWe only need to pay $2.50 a day for labor,\u201d said Mr. Zhu, the jade buyer \u2014 is returned with resentment that ebbs and flows according to the political and economic climate.\u201cThe new Chinese try to influence our culture by donating to temples and religious associations,\u201d said U Kyaw Zan Hla, 69, the former editor of a defunct leftist newspaper, The People. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the Burmese tradition of respect to elders, teachers and monks.\u201dWhen remnants of China\u2019s Nationalist Army fled to northern Burma after the Communist victory in 1949, they settled in Mandalay with their large families. By then, the royal palace \u2014 wooden pavilions with gabled roofs and richly painted pillars \u2014 had been burned to the ground by Japanese bombardment in 1942.A replica was built in 1989 by the junta, which handed the vast sward of green that surrounds the palace to the military for use as a headquarters. (The last king and queen of Burma fled to India in 1885, pushed out by the conquering British four years before Kipling composed his poem.)After World War II, Mandalay was a backwater \u2014 a place where the new Chinese settlers made themselves at home, took Burmese names and learned the language.The children of the Nationalist Army veterans are now in their 60s. Some practice tai chi in the soft dawn hours on a walkway near the palace walls. U Shwe, an enthusiastic man dressed in shorts and sneakers, made his tai chi moves with a red Chinese fan fully opened in one hand and a silver sword in the other. Chinese music boomed from a portable tape deck.But even here, a condescending attitude toward the Burmese is prevalent. \u201cWe hire a lot of them,\u201d said Mrs. Xu, 65, who owns a metal factory and gave only her last name. \u201cThe Burmese are very easygoing. They believe everything is predetermined, so they accept everything that happens in life.\u201dIn the 1980s, after the Chinese government stopped its support of the Communist Party of Burma, a new wave of entrepreneurs from China\u2019s then-fledgling market economy flooded over the border.They found lucrative deals trading in drugs and gems in the restive northern provinces, and bought identity cards and citizenship papers from corrupt officials of the military government, said Mr. Kyaw Zan Hla, the former editor, as he sat in his library filled with old newspapers, magazines and first edition books, including a yellowed copy of Orwell\u2019s \u201cBurmese Days.\u201dIn 1984, when a fire swept through downtown Mandalay, burning the mostly wooden structures to the ground, the Chinese acted.\u201cThe Burmese people had no money, and the Chinese bought the land which only they could afford,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, there are tensions between the newcomers and the Burmese \u2014 the Burmese look at the Chinese with hatred because they are very haughty.\u201dThe Chinese know that many Burmese are offended by their flashier lifestyle. They are fearful of reprisals, or of a repetition of anti-Chinese riots here in the 1960s.When violence broke out between Buddhists and Muslims in Mandalay several years ago, Chinese residents took extra measures to protect themselves, said Zhang Xucheng, a businessman.The Chinese are curbing excessive shows of wealth. \u201cIn the Chinese schools, they are telling the children not to be confrontational, not to live extravagantly,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cThere is no Blue Label whiskey, only Red Label and Black Label. We limit the number of cars for a wedding. There used to be 40 or 50. Now they have only 16 cars.\u201dYufan Huang and Wai Moe contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rethinking Globalization | Investigating the Benefits and Drawbacks of Global Trade", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byEconomicsWhat are the economic benefits and drawbacks of global trade?Who are the winners and losers in this story of economic change?These are the questions students will consider as they learn why trade became such an important issue in the 2016 election. As part of the lesson, they will also consider the implications of President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s related campaign promises.BackgroundThe lesson begins by having students investigate where their possessions are manufactured; then they use a Times video and article to help them better understand the complex consequences of increased trade. Further down, we offer opportunities for debate and argument writing, analyzing the effects of global trade abroad, and doing additional research._________Warm Up: What Countries Make the Products We Buy?This activity can be started for homework the night before or completed entirely during class:Students, look at the labels on your clothing, sneakers, electronics or anything else you own. Choose five items and find out where they\u2019re made. List the countries on the board, or share in small groups. What trends do you notice across the class or in your groups? What countries are making the things that Americans buy?After they have gathered this data, students should consider any trends they notice about the countries that produce most of the goods they and their classmates identified. How do wages and economic activity in these countries compare to the same categories for the United States?_________Video: \u201cThe iPhone Economy\u201d_________For generations, libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods, lifting wages and amplifying growth. The powers that emerged victorious from World War II championed globalization as the antidote to future conflicts. In Asia, Europe and North America, governments of every ideological persuasion have focused on trade as their guiding economic force.But trade comes with no assurances that the spoils will be shared equitably. Across much of the industrialized world, an outsize share of the winnings have been harvested by people with advanced degrees, stock options and the need for accountants. Ordinary laborers have borne the costs and suffered from joblessness and deepening economic anxiety.These costs have proved overwhelming in communities that depend on industry for sustenance, vastly exceeding what economists anticipated. Policy makers under the thrall of neoliberal economic philosophy put stock in the notion that markets could be trusted to bolster social welfare.In doing so, they failed to plan for the trauma that has accompanied the benefits of trade. When millions of workers lost paychecks to foreign competition, they lacked government supports to cushion the blow. As a result, seething anger is upending politics in Europe and North America.Below are questions for writing and discussion:1. The article states, \u201cFor generations, libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods, lifting wages and amplifying growth.\u201d What went wrong? Why was global trade such an important issue in the 2016 election for many voters?2. The article states, \u201cSuccessive administrations in the United States, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, have embraced liberalized trade as a central component of the nation\u2019s foreign policy. Yet only 19 percent of American voters said trade with other countries created more jobs in the United States, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in July.\u201d Why is there a disconnect between government trade policy by both Democrats and Republicans and what American voters think?3. The consequences of increasing global trade for American workers and the American economy are complex. Who are the winners? Who are the losers? And, how are some groups both winners and losers?4. The article states, \u201cAmerican factories produced more goods last year than ever, by many indications. Yet they did so while employing about 12.3 million workers \u2014 roughly the same number as in 2009, when production was roughly three-fourths what it is today.\u201d How can this be \u2014 that American factories are producing more than ever before, but while employing fewer workers?5. What is Nafta? What is the W.T.O.? Explain how each has affected American workers and the American economy.6. Douglas A. Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College, stated, \u201cWe have a public policy toward trade. We don\u2019t have a public policy on automation.\u201d What point is he making, and why is it relevant to this discussion?7. What kind of safety net do government programs provide for workers displaced by increased global trade? How does this safety net fall short in the United States?_________Activity: Debate, Discussion or Argument WritingIs increasing global trade a force for positive or negative change? Or both? And, should the United States pursue more free trade agreements or trade protectionism as the best solution to the negative consequences of globalization?After watching the video and reading the article, students have enough information to support both sides in an evidence-based discussion, debate or argument-writing piece. They can also suggest policy proposals for supporting workers or businesses hurt by the changing economy. For example, is there anything government policy can do to raise wages and working conditions for service workers now that many manufacturing jobs have disappeared?If you want students to have more information to bolster their arguments, here are additional resources from The Times and elsewhere:_________Going Further1. The Rise of AutomationChanges to the economy brought on by global trade are happening at the same time as an increase in automated manufacturing. Peter S. Goodman writes:All the while, automation has grown in sophistication and reach. From 2000 to 2010, the United States lost some 5.6 million manufacturing jobs, by the government\u2019s calculation. Only 13 percent of those job losses can be explained by trade, according to an analysis by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Indiana. The rest were casualties of automation or the result of tweaks to factory operations that enabled more production with less labor.Rather than a job-killing catastrophe, tech supporters of U.B.I. consider machine intelligence to be something like a natural bounty for society: The country has struck oil, and now it can hand out checks to each of its citizens.2. Women Trying to Join the Workforce in India3. Raising \u2014 or Lowering \u2014 Labor Standards?But human rights groups say that three years later, those promises are still unfulfilled, and that safety, labor and other issues persist in Bangladesh and other countries where global retailers benefit from an inexpensive work force.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Borders Close", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byThat great shock came in 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, and it ended an extraordinary four-decade period of rising migration and trade. But that era provides clear parallels to the globalization boom that gained momentum in the 1980s and stalled during the financial crisis of 2008. Today globalization is once again in retreat. Populists are on the march, as evidenced by Donald J. Trump\u2019s stunning victory last week. They have already won control of the government in Britain and gained momentum in Italy, France and Germany.It is not clear how Mr. Trump, who has called for protectionist measures and tighter borders, will govern. But it is clear that the open world order is breaking apart. The new age of deglobalization is on, and it is likely to last.National economies move from boom to bust in cycles that last a few years, but globalization is different. At least since Genghis Khan secured travel along the Silk Road, the flow of goods, money and people across borders has advanced and retreated in decades-long waves. The retreat that began in 1914 continued for three decades, weakening the world economy and feeding the resentments that erupted into World War II. The retreat that began in 2008 is still gaining strength, and it is time to recognize the likely fallout, which is slower growth, higher inflation and rising conflict.The parallels between the two booms are striking. The recent advance of globalization was driven by changing technology \u2014 including container ships and the internet \u2014 and new rules that opened the world\u2019s most populous country, China, to commerce. Before 1914, steamships and the \u201cVictorian internet,\u201d the telegraph, as well as novel rules that opened the 19th century\u2019s largest economy, Britain, to imports, drove globalization. By the eve of World War I, the world was in some ways as connected as now. Measured as a share of the population, immigration to the United States was three times greater in 1914 than at any time since.The social tensions generated by rapid globalization in the early 20th century also ring familiar. The share of income going to the richest 1 percent of Americans rose steadily from 1870 to a peak of nearly 20 percent in the late 1920s, as global commerce created a \u201cgilded age\u201d plutocracy. Popular resentment spread, and politicians began working to seal the borders, particularly after 1929, when the economy crashed into the Great Depression.America turned inward. Congress passed the sweeping Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, prompting a global trade war. Measured as a share of the world economy, trade peaked at 30 percent in 1914, and fell to a low of 10 percent in 1933. That year, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which barred big banks from the investment business. The movement of money from country to country slowed to a trickle in the 1930s and 1940s.The United States also virtually shut down immigration in the early 1930s, when the influx of people declined to a few tens of thousands, down from more than a million annually before 1914. As many as one million Mexicans went home in this period, with 80,000 deported by the federal authorities and many more scared off.Closing the borders reduced competition and commerce, prolonging the Depression. In the United States, populists were fringe figures promising to \u201cshare the wealth\u201d and chanting, \u201cAmerica First.\u201d But in Europe and Asia, they took power as the militarist autocracies that started World War II.After the Axis powers were defeated and the victorious democracies began rebuilding an open world order, it took decades for the flow of trade, money and people to regain momentum. Global trade did not recover to its 1914 peak until the 1970s, and capital mobility \u2014 the scale and ease of money flows \u2014 did not recover until the 1990s. Once these flows gained speed, however, they thundered along right up to the financial crisis.Today, 2008 looks to be as clear a turning point as 1914. With global demand weak, and many nations erecting import barriers, trade is slumping. Measured as a share of global gross domestic product, trade doubled from 30 percent in 1973 to a high of 60 percent in 2008. But it faltered during the crisis and has since dropped to 55 percent.The flow of capital \u2014 mainly bank loans \u2014 is retreating even faster. Frozen by the financial crisis and squeezed afterward by new regulations, capital flows have since slumped to just under 2 percent of G.D.P. from a peak of 16 percent in 2007.The flow of people is slowing, too. Despite the flood of refugees into Europe, net migration from poor to rich countries decreased to 12 million between 2011 and 2015, down by four million from the previous five years. Between 2009 and 2014, the number of Mexicans leaving the United States outnumbered new arrivals by 140,000, and that was before Mr. Trump\u2019s first anti-Mexican tirades.In an echo of the 1930s, the slowing of trade, global investment and migration are further weakening the global economy. There are many reasons to expect that this new age of deglobalization will last, as the postwar order is under assault from both popular autocrats in emerging powers like Russia and China, and populist candidates in Western democracies.The recent trade boom was fueled by relatively simple deals that cut import tariffs. But trade deals have become more complex, and now take much longer to complete. At the same time, the world\u2019s major economies have imposed hundreds of protectionist measures since 2008, led by India, Russia, China and the United States. And once such protectionist walls spring up around one industry, they tend to grow and spread to other industries.Changes in China\u2019s economy will further slow trade. When China opened up in the 1980s, its vast population turbocharged global trade almost overnight. Nations all over the world prospered by supplying raw materials and parts to plants in China, and later in countries like Poland and Mexico. Before 2008, much of the global trade boom involved intermediate goods traveling within these supply chains. But this trend has reversed. Supply chains are contracting, particularly as China moves to make its economy less dependent on trade, and its factories learn to make more parts at home.Recently, the International Monetary Fund and other institutional bulwarks of the postwar order have mounted a defense of globalization. They point to research blaming automation and other forces unrelated to globalization for middle-class job losses. But the technocrats are missing the political reality: The tide has turned against immigrants and trade. It is time to recognize the implications of deglobalization.During and between the two world wars, the anti-global agenda reduced competition and worsened weak economic growth with rising inflation. Today, populists are again calling for protecting domestic industry and sharing wealth, which could have the same impact.Redistributing wealth within nations could have the salutary effect of narrowing the income gap between individuals. But more protection could widen the wealth gap between nations. Since World War II, few nations have escaped poverty without a huge lift from exports, and rising trade barriers will make it harder for developing countries to do that. The economic advantage is shifting from export-driven economies, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to those that rely on large domestic markets, such as India and Indonesia.World War I shattered the hope that an increasingly interconnected world would render armed conflict between nations obsolete. Similar hopes surfaced in recent decades. But the connections are fraying, tensions are spreading and my-nation-first populism is gaining, including in the United States. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called for toughening border security, renegotiating or blocking major trade deals, and cutting support for allies the United States has backed since 1945.Mr. Trump may not follow through on all these proposals, but his direction is clear. The global movement of goods, money and people is likely to continue slowing. The lesson of the past is that just as night follows day, deglobalization follows globalization \u2014 and can last just as long.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Exit Polls Reveal a Starkly Divided Nation", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byThe social and political fissures that have left Americans walled off from one another along lines of race, class, education, gender and geography played out in stark ways in this election, a contest that left people pessimistic about the future of their country and uninspired with their choices of who should lead it.Eight years after the election of the first African-American president held the promise of breaking down the country\u2019s deep and longstanding racial divisions, American society seemed as polarized as ever, according to surveys of early voters and exit polls conducted by Edison Research.One thing most voters shared was an overriding sense of disgust, even if they were split bitterly over which candidate repelled them more. Significant numbers of voters said the thought of either candidate in the White House frightened them.Updated as results become available.Donald J. Trump\u2019s coalition was overwhelmingly white, and leaned toward male and older voters. He won whites without college degrees by more than two to one \u2014 a larger margin than any candidate since at least 1980. His support from rural voters was nearly double Hillary Clinton\u2019s.Mrs. Clinton was lifted, by contrast, by women, urban voters and those with more education. She also held onto the people who formed the backbone of President Obama\u2019s coalition in both 2008 and 2012, though in lesser numbers: blacks, Hispanics, unmarried women and young voters.Neither candidate was viewed favorably; more than half of voters saw Mrs. Clinton unfavorably and six in 10 had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Trump.The quality that mattered most to voters was the ability to bring needed change, cited by nearly four in 10 voters. Mr. Trump won these voters by a huge margin. Experience and good judgment were each cited as the most important quality by about one in five voters, and Mrs. Clinton won these voters by large margins.Close to four in 10 said they would be scared if Mr. Trump were elected; three in 10 said the same about Mrs. Clinton.Uneasiness extended well beyond the state of politics. Americans expressed concern about their financial well-being, their children\u2019s futures and the fitness and trustworthiness of their leaders.Times reporters provided real-time analysis of Donald J. Trump\u2019s stunning upset in the presidential election on Tuesday.Three in five voters said the country was seriously on the wrong track and about the same number said the economy was either not good or poor. Two-thirds said their personal financial situation was either worse or the same as it was four years ago. About one in three voters said they expected life to be worse for the next generation.Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual assault on the impartiality of the country\u2019s elections appeared to have an effect, but mostly among his supporters. Nearly seven in 10 of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s voters were very confident that the votes in their state would be counted accurately. But fewer than three in 10 of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters said they were very confident.Some demographic trends seem to be hardening. Twelve years ago, George W. Bush made inroads with Hispanic voters who many Republicans confidently said would form the basis of an enduring conservative majority. But today\u2019s Republican Party is repelling them. Mr. Trump\u2019s performance among Hispanics, at 29 percent of the vote, was similar to Mitt Romney\u2019s in 2012, but far below Mr. Bush\u2019s 44 percent support in 2004.Americans were in a foul mood about the state of their country\u2019s politics. Nearly half of voters were dissatisfied with the way the federal government is working and another quarter were angry. Only a quarter were satisfied, and far fewer were enthusiastic.The results contained warning signs for Republicans, who concluded after the 2012 election that changing demographics would reduce them to a permanent minority party unless they improved how blacks and Hispanics viewed them.Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination seemed only to exacerbate those trends, with his hostility toward many foreigners, his refusal at times to dissociate himself from avowed racists and his plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States.Most voters rejected one policy proposal Mr. Trump vowed to pursue from the beginning and never backed away from: building a wall on the southern border with Mexico. A majority opposed that plan. Seven in 10 said that most undocumented immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.Immigrants who have become citizens favored Mrs. Clinton by a ratio of two to one.Though immigration or terrorism did not rank at the top of most voters\u2019 concerns, the majority of voters who said immigration or terrorism was their top issue favored Mr. Trump.Most voters who cited the economy or foreign policy as top priorities backed Mrs. Clinton, seemingly rejecting Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that his business background gave him a superior set of negotiating skills.A majority of voters said they approved of the job Mr. Obama was doing as president, and those voters backed Mrs. Clinton by huge margins.But neither Mr. Trump nor Mrs. Clinton inspired voters in the way that Mr. Obama did. Four in 10 voters said they strongly favored the candidate they supported, and a quarter of voters said they were motivated by dislike for the other candidate. In 2012, about two-thirds of voters said they strongly favored their candidate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Exposed About the G.O.P.", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe election of Donald J. Trump will bring as sharp a turn to the right as this country has seen since at least the election of Ronald Reagan \u2014 thanks mainly to the rare conservative control of Congress, the presidency and, before long, the Supreme Court.But in a strange and unforeseeable way his campaign and election mark the end of the era in which American politics is defined by ideological conflict.Ever since the election of Reagan 36 years ago, American politics has been marked by profound ideological division, increasing polarization and often paralysis. The ideologically coherent and often unyielding conservative movement represented the dominant theme, while liberals (many of whom wouldn\u2019t even use that word) struggled to find a pitch as clear and appealing as the right\u2019s message of lower taxes, smaller government and strong defense.The election of 2016 is the culmination of this ideological era, but ironically reveals its hollowness. The politics of 2016 breaks entirely along lines of identity: first race or ethnicity, followed by gender, level of education, urbanization and age.The first mystery of the year was how Donald Trump won his party\u2019s nomination, but more important, why 16 others, including popular governors and senators, lost. The answer is simply that all the others thought the key to the Republican base was ideology. Some, such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, styled themselves as the purest and most adamant of conservatives, others as just practical enough to deliver on conservative goals and one (Gov. John Kasich) as sort of a moderate. None of them clicked with the Republican base, simply because ideology wasn\u2019t what motivated the base. It was always about identity, about them and us. Only Mr. Trump had that key.Ideology had formed a kind of a comforting curtain around the more intractable divides of race and identity. Ideological conflict, as deep and irresolvable as it often seems, at least in theory, lends itself to persuasion and compromise, such as President Obama\u2019s long quest for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on spending and taxes. Ideology can help structure people\u2019s engagement with politics, giving them clear preferences organized around a few core values.But ideology can also be hard work \u2014 most people don\u2019t have the time or inclination to decide if they are \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d and what that means, or to fight about it.With his shifting, largely irrelevant policies, his birtherism and his targeting of people (Mexicans, \u201cbad hombres\u201d) rather than problems, Mr. Trump pulled the curtain away. It was identity all along.If so, it was a tactical mistake. Mr. Obama in 2012 had targeted the same voters, but with a more explicitly ideological story about government\u2019s role in rebuilding the auto industry and the economy.The candidacy of Barry Goldwater two years later and Reagan 18 years later, along with the \u201cBest and the Brightest\u201d debacle in Vietnam, proved the fallacy of that technocratic era.Rather than a pragmatic fixer-upper, Mr. Trump now seems likely to be the vehicle through which the ideological right achieves its decades-old dream of undoing the Great Society and the Warren and Burger courts. But the victory that made that possible was based explicitly on identity, not ideology.Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Must Serve Trump", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byFor the next four years, the most important check on what we\u2019ve seen of Trump\u2019s worst impulses \u2014 his hair-trigger temper, his rampant insecurity, his personal cruelty \u2014 won\u2019t come from Congress or the courts or the opposition party. It will come from the people charged with executing the basic responsibilities of government within his administration.This is particularly true in foreign policy, where presidential power has its fewest limits \u2014 where the chief executive can start wars with near-impunity, deal out death from the skies, rattle the global economy with an executive order, and decide with barely anyone else\u2019s input to launch a nuclear weapon. In foreign policy, too, the choices that presidential appointees have to make on their own, in diplomatic and military contexts, can have life-or-death consequences very quickly. So to the extent that Trump\u2019s approach to governance threatens world peace, that threat can be mitigated by appointees with experience and knowledge, and magnified if their posts are filled by hacks and sycophants instead.It may be, of course, that Trump wishes to fill the most important posts with sycophants. In which case anyone who goes to work for his State Department or Defense Department risks being subject not only to his whims, but also to the whims of secretaries and under secretaries who mirror his all-too-readily-apparent vices.But here the Republican Senate has a crucially important role to play. Trump cannot appoint cabinet officials without the approval of many senators who opposed or doubted him throughout the campaign \u2014 from Mike Lee and Jeff Flake to John McCain and Lindsey Graham. These senators cannot force him to pick a secretary of state from the ranks of #NeverTrump foreign-policy hands. But they can look at his short lists and suggest names that would win confirmation easily (like Stephen Hadley for the Defense Department), while making it clear that other nominations (Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, say, or Sheriff David Clarke as head of Homeland Security) would be met with prejudice and voted down.If this happens, if a layer of experienced leadership is established at the top, then it will signal to younger personnel that they can serve without fearing that the government they\u2019re entering has already been Trumpified, or that they will be isolated if the man at the top goes haywire.These men and women should not be ready to serve permanently, regardless of what their new boss does in office. If a Trump presidency lurches into naked authoritarianism \u2014 abusing executive authority in unprecedented ways, issuing immoral or illegal orders to the military \u2014 then there will be an obligation not to serve, but to resign. And the gray area between these two obligations will create a lot of territory in which Trump appointees could succumb to moral corruption, justifying their toleration for enormities on the grounds that \u201cthe greater good requires me to stay.\u201dOther evils may await, but sufficient unto this day this one. So if he calls, answer.Gail Collins is off today.Gail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a French Artist Turned a Stay in North Carolina Into Conceptual Art", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byEDEN, N.C. \u2014 The trees were turning yellow, orange and brown the weekend before the election in this town of some 15,000 people just a mile from the Virginia border.Something about the fall palette and the once-bustling streets lined by rows of shuttered businesses strongly suggested the work of the photographer William Eggleston and his knack for forlorn, deadpan details. There were an unusual number of \u201cLost Cat\u201d posters plastered on telephone poles, and Trump signs were thick on the ground, a harbinger of his victory both here in North Carolina and nationally.And ultimately Eden became part of a conceptual art project.It seemed an unlikely place for an art event, but here was Mr. Couzinet-Jacques hosting a couple dozen neighbors at a sundown party to celebrate his rehabilitation of the Little Red Schoolhouse. He bought the 1884 structure a year and a half ago for $1,000 when it was abandoned and falling apart. He has painstakingly renovated it and most recently painted it an alarmingly bright red color \u2014 not the classic schoolhouse maroon, but the color of caution, a toxic Edenic apple.\u201cIt\u2019s a pure object, a sculpture,\u201d Mr. Couzinet-Jacques said of the schoolhouse, which was largely empty inside. Essentially he was presenting the debut of the new paint job.The building has been the subject of his photographs and obsessive documentation for the past year, indeed, something closer to a fetish object, as well as a symbol of economic distress here and everywhere.\u201cThere is a paradise here, but it\u2019s lost,\u201d he said of Eden. \u201cI wanted to bring about a re-enchantment through art.\u201dThe multimedia installation in Aperture\u2019s gallery on West 27th Street in Chelsea includes some 20 photographs of the schoolhouse and its environs, some dramatically tinted in red and blue. Two large prints mounted on the walls are covered in linoleum scraps from the building\u2019s floor.Mr. Couzinet-Jacques also turned a phrase from the property deed (\u201cfoundations are bricks and some boulders\u201d) into a Tracey Emin-like neon work, rendered in his own handwriting. And he has reconstructed parts of its rickety porch in the gallery, after having traveled alongside the pieces in a truck for the 500-mile journey from Eden. (Live kudzu, the invasive vine common in the South that he intended to grow around the wooden pieces, didn\u2019t arrive in time.)Aperture is publishing an \u201cEden\u201d book, too, and it features almost 1,000 of the 12,000 close-up images that Mr. Couzinet-Jacques made with a document scanner to record every inch of the structure.\u201cThe idea is that the entire house is in there,\u201d he said.The elaborate installation \u201chas stretched us,\u201d said Chris Boot, the executive director of Aperture, known for mounting more traditional photography shows. \u201cThis is something the likes of which we have never done before.\u201dBut Mr. Couzinet-Jacques\u2019s approach to photography \u2014 using it as a launching pad for a larger conceptual work \u2014 is part of a trend that Aperture can\u2019t ignore, Mr. Boot said. \u201cEvery photographer now wants to be a sculptor,\u201d he said.Catherine Tsekenis, the director of the Herm\u00e8s foundation, said that \u201cthe process itself\u201d of moving to a foreign land \u201cis a work of art.\u201d She added, \u201cSylvain wanted to be immersed.\u201dBearded and eager, Mr. Couzinet-Jacques, 33, who sometimes sounds like he is still in a graduate seminar, has degrees from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Marseille and the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de Photographie in Arles.He made a specialty of documenting the housing speculation debacle in Europe. For a 2013 Paris exhibition, Mr. Couzinet-Jacques showed photographs of failed real estate projects in Spain and illuminated the gallery with ultraviolet light so that the images would degrade over the length of the show. Viewers had to wear protective glasses. \u201cI got a sunburn working on that one,\u201d he said.When he was nominated for the Herm\u00e8s commission in late 2014, he at first proposed an American road trip. But at the last minute, he overhauled his idea.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay in a hotel for just a week and take some tacky photos,\u201d Mr. Couzinet-Jacques said. \u201cI wanted to be more involved. I wanted to live, as much as possible, an American life.\u201dOnce he first visited Eden, he found that the artistic risk was taking derivative photographs that looked too much like the work of Mr. Eggleston or Stephen Shore, so he decided to amplify his ideas, he said, to \u201cbring a three-dimensional aspect to my practice.\u201dBoth of his parents are teachers, and Mr. Couzinet-Jacques grew up living above a school for part of his childhood in the Burgundian town of Sens. After searching for a building to document and learning that a schoolhouse was available, \u201cI took it as a sign,\u201d he said. He also noted that 1884 was the year that the predecessor to Eastman Kodak first introduced photographic negative paper.Mr. Couzinet-Jacques has mostly stayed in motels and a rented house (the schoolhouse doesn\u2019t have working plumbing), and he blew through his prize money long ago, dipping into personal funds. He lost one long-distance French girlfriend to his international sojourn, though he found another one.He doesn\u2019t drive, so when not hitching a ride with a local studio assistant, he traversed Eden by bike and on foot, which baffled residents. \u201cThey call me \u2018the walker,\u2019\u201d Mr. Couzinet-Jacques said with a laugh.His embrace of the town has been mutual. Over wine and beer at the Eden party, several residents said that any old building\u2019s being saved was a good thing, even though Mr. Couzinet-Jacques wasn\u2019t exactly pouring money into the local economy with his trips to the salad bar at Ruby Tuesday.\u201cWe exhibit the normal Southern atmosphere from time to time,\u201d said James C. Burnette, a town council member who showed up at the party, referring to initial suspicions of the Frenchman in their midst. \u201cBut we want to see progress here. People are excited to see what the next step of this project is.\u201dMr. Couzinet-Jacques was repeatedly stopped and asked about it over the weekend by acquaintances. The town even offered him a tall safety light to illuminate the schoolhouse at night, and set it up across the street for him. The building\u2019s red exterior shone ominously for the partygoers and any passers-by.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible what Sylvain has done, but I\u2019m not sure everyone grasps it yet,\u201d said Randy Hunt, the head of the local chamber of commerce. \u201cI think people have wondered, \u2018Why us?\u2019\u201dAfter nearly two years on \u201cEden,\u201d Mr. Couzinet-Jacques will go back to France, but he also plans to return to North Carolina and photograph more of the people he has encountered here.\u201cI see this as a long-term project,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the first chapter.\u201dThe schoolhouse\u2019s closest neighbor, Ken Yearout, came over in his wheelchair to have a drink. Mr. Yearout lost his legs because of repercussions from Agent Orange poisoning from his service in Vietnam, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve haven\u2019t heard anyone complain about him,\u201d he said of Mr. Couzinet-Jacques. \u201cHe\u2019s a good neighbor.\u201dThe issue of how neighbors and communities cohere \u2014 or fray \u2014 has long been on the mind of French observers. After de Tocqueville returned home from the United States, he issued warnings about fractious individualism run amok but made many positive pronouncements about Americans, including, \u201cThey all consider society as a body in a state of improvement.\u201dThe same tensions are apparent in Mr. Couzinet-Jacques\u2019s work. He isn\u2019t so sure Eden\u2019s trajectory is upward, but he knows that it will be the proudly eccentric citizens, not old buildings, that give it hope. \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are such characters down here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Will Require a Vote in Parliament, U.K. Court Rules", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byIf the court\u2019s ruling is upheld \u2014 the government immediately vowed to appeal \u2014 that plan would be thrown into disarray, analysts said.Few observers say they believe that Parliament will go so far as to prevent a departure from the bloc. Lawmakers themselves voted overwhelmingly to hold the referendum and pledged to abide by the results.But it was not immediately clear how the politics would play out. The Conservative government is already split over what kind of future relationship it wants with the European Union, and in general, members of Parliament were not in favor of leaving the bloc in the first place. The government hoped to get the talks started without a major parliamentary debate and potential interference, especially in the House of Lords, where the Conservatives do not have a clear majority.\u201cI see M.P.s from all parties saying, \u2018Oh well, actually we should stay part of the single market; we should continue with our daily financial contributions,\u2019 \u201d he said in an interview on BBC Radio. \u201cI think we could be at the beginning, with this ruling, of a process where there is a deliberate, willful attempt by our political class to betray 17.4 million voters.\u201dOn Thursday, the government said that an expedited appeal would be heard in December by the Supreme Court, Britain\u2019s highest appellate body, and that it was sticking to its timetable for leaving the bloc for now. Yet in the growing environment of constitutional, legal and political uncertainty, the government\u2019s strategy could easily be disrupted.The ruling was \u201ca severe setback for Theresa May\u2019s government,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. But he added that the government\u2019s timetable could still be met if the Supreme Court ruled in its favor.The British government must consult Parliament before proceeding with formal negotiations over its withdrawal from the European Union, the High Court ruled. The legal action was brought in the name of several individuals.Although Parliament approved holding the referendum, Mrs. May\u2019s critics argued in court that failing to give lawmakers a voice would turn them into bystanders as Britain negotiated its disengagement from the bloc. They also pointed out that, technically, the referendum is not legally binding.The plaintiffs argued successfully that leaving the European Union involved the revocation of certain rights granted to Britons by Parliament, and that lawmakers must have a say and a vote before Article 50 is invoked.In his ruling, the lord chief justice, John Thomas, said, \u201cThe most fundamental rule of the U.K. Constitution is that Parliament is sovereign and can make or unmake any law it chooses.\u201dOddly enough, this was precisely the case made by those who wanted to end membership, who argued that only by leaving the European Union could Parliament\u2019s sovereignty be completely restored. Now that same argument could delay the very exit so desired by those politicians and their supporters.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.The government argued that under residual powers of royal prerogative, which cover international treaty-making, it had the power to invoke Article 50 without a vote in Parliament.Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, welcomed the ruling, adding that it was \u201cdisappointing that this government was so intent on undermining parliamentary sovereignty and democratic process that they forced this decision to be made in the court.\u201dIn a statement, he added, \u201cGiven the strict two-year timetable of exiting the E.U. once Article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lay out their negotiating to Parliament, before such a vote is held.\u201dAlthough Mrs. May has said that lawmakers will eventually be consulted, many fear it will take place too late to influence the shape of Britain\u2019s new relationship with the European Union.For example, if Parliament is given a chance to vote on an exit agreement at the end of the two-year period, lawmakers may be forced to choose between endorsing a deal they oppose or leaving the bloc without any formal relationship with it.The government had dismissed the case as legal \u201ccamouflage,\u201d regarding it as a thinly disguised effort to frustrate the democratic outcome of the June 23 referendum.The Conservative Party, which was badly split over the referendum, has now largely embraced its outcome, in many cases enthusiastically.Many supporters of the opposition Labour Party also voted to leave the European Union, which will make it harder for their lawmakers to oppose a withdrawal.Along with the Supreme Court, the ruling might ultimately be referred to the European Court of Justice, an institution opposed by many who argued for Britain to leave the bloc.Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Will Trump Trade Policy Actually Look Like? Three Possibilities", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byGlobal ShiversDonald J. Trump, through decades in public life, has been consistent on one core policy idea: that the United States has gotten a raw deal from its major trading partners in the agreements that bind their economies. Renegotiating those terms will surely be a top priority for his administration.Since Election Day, trade experts have been gaming potential scenarios of what Trump administration trade policy might look like in detail. Some of those possibilities would risk only modest disruptions to the world economy and could very well result in better long-term arrangements for American companies.Others would blow up the underpinnings of the modern global economy, endanger trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of cross-border commerce, and stand a good chance of prompting a worldwide recession.Here\u2019s what those possibilities look like, from the most benign to the most disruptive.There really are some elements of the United States\u2019 existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the United States. By taking more aggressive stands on some of them, a Trump administration may be able to get better deals.The Trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the United States unfairly and bring cases before the World Trade Organization. Paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair behavior, the approach could win more favorable deals. The Bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in 2002, as did the Obama administration with a 35 percent tax on Chinese tires in 2009.But Mr. Trump\u2019s administration could bring a series of such cases, and if, as he promises, his team members prove to be made up of tougher, smarter negotiators than their predecessors, perhaps they could get better results. Even if they don\u2019t, the $18 trillion United States economy will most likely be O.K.Mr. Trump has said he will instruct his Treasury secretary to declare China a currency manipulator. The George W. Bush and Obama administrations didn\u2019t do this, although they also thought that China artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of Chinese exporters. However, they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than head-on confrontation to get results.But who knows? Maybe that calculation was wrong, and a more confrontational approach would have led China to allow its currency to respond to market forces. The Chinese government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few years, putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue. (But it could still be in the United States\u2019 interest to put in place agreements to make sure this remains the case.)Naming China a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it. Such negotiation would most likely be hard-fought, and it might result in a better long-term arrangement for the United States. Or not. But either way, it wouldn\u2019t need to disrupt day-to-day trade relations.That assumes that Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and authorities, and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries. If so, it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy.\u201cThere would be pushback, but you\u2019d be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by Congress and the W.T.O. and our trading partners,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer at White & Case who has been critical of Mr. Trump. \u201cEverybody will talk about it, but it won\u2019t change the global macroeconomic outlook.\u201dAmbiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy. Mr. Trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest.Moves along those lines would get everyone\u2019s attention, but they would also create enormous ripple effects. There would surely be legal challenges by the targeted country\u2019s industries, as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners. China (or Mexico, or Japan) wouldn\u2019t take these kinds of measures lying down.\u201cWith these blunt instruments, there would be a lot of effects,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt would hit poor Americans the hardest in the sense that it\u2019s a regressive tax that makes things like clothing and consumer electronics more expensive.\u201dAnd the retaliation would most likely be fierce. If China is the target, it might cancel orders for Boeing airliners and buy from Europe\u2019s Airbus instead. (The United States exported $15 billion worth of aircraft to China last year). Or perhaps the Chinese would retaliate against American agriculture, endangering the $10.5 billion in United States soybean exports to China and endangering farms across the Midwest \u2014 prime Trump country, as the decision-makers in China will surely be aware.And with the economic underpinnings of major industries under stress, the financial markets would probably enter a period of remarkable volatility. Expect plummeting stock prices for major United States companies that do business around the world.The Trump administration would be risking significant damage to the United States economy if it took this route, without any guarantee of coming out with a more favorable long-term deal on the other side.Trade wars that would be started by broad-based tariffs on major trading partners would be economically disruptive but would still leave the basic infrastructure of the global trade system in place.The most extreme versions of a Trump trade policy, however, could wreak havoc on the entire system of global economic connections that the United States helped build since the end of World War II.If the Trump administration can\u2019t get the concessions it seeks in renegotiating Nafta, would he follow through on his threat to use the power, written into the trade agreement, to withdraw entirely with six months\u2019 notice?If he seeks to do those things using executive authority, will Congress stand by or seek to stop him?\u201cFor the last 100 years or so, Congress and the executive branch have had a kind of gentleman\u2019s agreement where Congress delegates its authority over international trade to the president as long as Congress gets the ultimate say,\u201d Mr. Lincicome said. In a more extreme case of a Trump trade agenda, he said, \u201cthe risk is you have not just an economic crisis but a constitutional crisis.\u201dThis is pretty far down the road of speculation. The various business interests who have the president-elect\u2019s ear would surely try to persuade him not to risk everything by being so drastic. Financial markets since the election have appeared to reflect an expectation that the benign scenario for Trump trade policy will emerge. The S.&P. 500 index, the Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq Composite index and the Russell 2000 index all hit new highs Monday.The question of whether one of the more extreme, every-country-for-itself-trade-war scenarios emerges instead boils down to this: Does Mr. Trump mean some of the things he has said on the campaign trail about reopening the very basics of United States economic relationships, or was it all just words?The economic consequences of the answer are huge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The History of Southern Africa, by Train", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byJUST A FEW HOURS INTO our train ride, we know the passengers in the cabins on either side of ours: On one side are two young Canadians on a monthslong, round-the-world backpacking trip. On the other are four middle-aged women on a trading expedition from their towns in Zambia to Dar es Salaam, where they\u2019ll buy supplies for their shops, including clothes and spare parts for cars. They\u2019re not waiting to get to Dar to get started: At every whistle-stop town along the way, vendors try to sell things through the window \u2014 often produce at prices far below those in the Tanzanian metropolis. So the women are stocking up on items they can sell for a profit when we arrive in a day or two: tomatoes, oranges, passion fruit, boiled peanuts and, just this morning, roasted caterpillars.Much of this trading takes place in the corridor outside our cabins. Chilesi, one of the Zambian women, tells me what\u2019s good, and what to pay. Yesterday: \u201cThat papaya. Five hundred shillings,\u201d or about 25 cents. Today: \u201cNo, don\u2019t buy the caterpillars. Just try mine.\u201d She has bought a plastic bag containing three or four pounds of the roasted amber morsels. I pop one in my mouth. It\u2019s lightly salted. \u201cMm,\u201d I say, and make a face. She and her travelmates laugh.Later, something will blow through an open window and lodge in Chilesi\u2019s eye. An hour passes and it\u2019s still there, so the call goes out for help: One of the Canadians has contact-lens solution, and we have eye drops. And later yet, when Chilesi\u2019s better, the ladies will gather in the corridor in a happy mood and sing as the train rumbles through the Tanzanian night. As they harmonize, we realize it\u2019s church music.\u201cUp through South Africa, the train labored in the heat ... slicing on hot wheels, ever north. This was where Cecil John Rhodes had intended for we British to go. From Cape to Cairo had been his dream. One long stain of British territory up the spine of Africa.\u201dFuller\u2019s family decided to leave the country after the civil war. Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, and their farm was sold off in 1982. Now the Africans are in charge, conflicted about their inheritance \u2014 imperialism was not about love. Lately, South Africa has been agonizing over images of Rhodes in particular. Last year, after a statue of him at the University of Cape Town was splattered with human feces during a protest, a South African Rhodes scholar who had graduated from Rhodes University wrote in The Times about \u201cthe aesthetic and moral assault on one\u2019s entire being that occurs when a black person walks across a campus covered with statues and monuments that celebrate colonial conquerors as heroes.\u201d The statue was eventually removed. Someone attacked the bust of Rhodes at nearby Table Mountain National Park a few months later, removing its nose with a grinder after failing to cut off its head.It was soon after that my wife, Margot, and I arrived in Cape Town from New York and checked into a dreamy hotel perched on a hillside overlooking the sea where the Indian Ocean meets the Atlantic; we could see pods of whales passing by. Although many people who visit Africa head straight to a safari lodge, our trip would be different: two weeks rolling on trains northeast to Dar es Salaam via Victoria Falls, from South Africa into Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania, over 3,000 miles in all. Other rail lines exist but ours would get us the farthest north in the shortest time. The rides would be wildly various: We would whipsaw between luxury and something closer to freight-hopping. And along the way, we would see the land from a different perspective \u2014 literally, of course. But our conveyance would also be inseparable from the continent\u2019s history and struggle to forge a different kind of present.The experience is both comfortable and discomfiting. Walking with your fellow passengers from a private waiting room in the station onto the train itself is to feel the 21st century collapse into the 19th; we were back in colonial days, pampered members of the ruling race. The Blue Train is the fanciest train I have ever seen. Its exterior is painted lushly in its eponymous color; inside there is a lot of lacquered Italian birch and custom marquetry, and brass fittings galore. Margot and I sat across from each other in our cabin\u2019s club chairs, gazing out of our big, clean window. The rough exurbs of Cape Town yielded to an amber veld with patches of irrigated green; hills rose and fell. We were rolling to Pretoria, the seat of South Africa\u2019s executive branch of government, and the ride was awesomely quiet \u2014 quite a feat for an old train.Our fellow passengers were an older, prosperous crowd, mostly British and Afrikaner, and mainly Caucasian. All the butlers, waiters, bartenders, kitchen and other low-level employees were black, as were the two armed guards who stepped outside the train at every sunny stop. Three of our 52 fellow passengers were black South African \u2014 a mother and her two adult children. The daughter explained to us that their mother had been saving for the trip for years.At dinnertime, the Blue Train aspires to the grandeur of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d: Women are instructed to dress in \u201celegant evening wear\u201d and men must wear coat and tie. The spirit of upper-class occasion was reinforced by the almost baroque servility of the waiters.\u201cMa\u2019am-sir, good evening,\u201d said ours. \u201cThis is Goodhope.\u201d He was referring to himself. \u201cSorry to leave you alone. Will you be having wine?\u201d Margot and I were sharing a table with a retired English couple, the Waterses, and we all said yes. \u201cGoodhope will return,\u201d he said, with a slight bow.After the meal, we found that our cabin had been transformed: Our butler had lowered our beds from the wall and carefully made them, turning back a corner of each duvet. Electric mini-blinds covered the window; the lighting was golden and low. We found a movie on the room\u2019s little TV, turned off the lights and opened the blinds so we could see the stars. The tracks clicked by beneath us, this train an instrument not of empire, but of tourism.We would end up arriving in Pretoria at 6:40 p.m. instead of 12:40 p.m., but the Blue Train was a pleasant place to be stuck. I spent a couple of those hours chatting with a staff member who lived in Soweto and was proud of it. \u201cIt has the only street in the world with the homes of two Nobel Peace Prize winners \u2014 Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu.\u201d I wanted to talk about the fate of the Rhodes statues but he demurred; employees, he said, were under strict instructions not to discuss politics with the guests. But he did allow that his country\u2019s constitution was \u201cstill young \u2014 just 20 years. This will take time.\u201d I commented on how stunningly quiet the train was. He explained that was partly due to its double-glazed windows, which also prevented stones from coming in. I raised an eyebrow.\u201cYes, sometimes children throw them. They may break the outside window, but they won\u2019t break the inside.\u201d\u201cWhy do they throw stones?\u201d\u201cWell, to some the Blue Train is still a symbol of apartheid.\u201dThat made sense. Our lavishly comfortable car with its armed guards and passengers in formal attire had just passed one of those stopped commuter trains crammed with workers. But I also knew better than to draw a deep moral out of this. When I had been catching the rails with the hobos, I had to dodge rocks thrown by kids through the boxcars\u2019 open doors. People throw stones at Amtrak trains as well \u2014 investigators once considered it a possible cause of a wreck in Philadelphia in 2015. So the stone-throwing might be apartheid \u2014 but it might also be the temptation of the train itself.FROM PRETORIA, Rhodes\u2019s rail line continues north, through present-day Botswana to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. From there, the route angles northwest to Victoria Falls, crossing the Zambezi River into Zambia. After two days on the Blue Train, we flew from Johannesburg to Bulawayo, and a very different country.Zimbabwe\u2019s economy suffered a near-collapse between 2007 to 2009, from which it\u2019s yet to recover. Today, the most imposing building in Bulawayo belongs to the National Railways of Zimbabwe. But its profile belies its actual power: Freight carried by the railway declined from 18 million tons in 1998 to roughly 2.5 million tons in 2015. The station itself is semi-decrepit. Tickets are sold only on the day of departure; though we arrived before the ticket office opened we still had to stand in line for most of an hour: many people, one clerk.It was a relief to finally settle in our compartment, but we soon noticed problems. Several of the lights inside the train didn\u2019t work. The window, presently open, was nearly impossible to close. A tiny wash basin, cleverly hidden by a folding table, looked like it hadn\u2019t worked for years. And pretty much everything in the compartment was filthy \u2014 Margot ran a hand wipe along the leatherette seat and it turned black: We had been spoiled by the Blue Train.That night, I drifted into a fitful sleep, but Margot stayed up. The train made many, many stops, during which it became clear that it was a lifeline to villages that had no other connection to the outside world. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy outside on a donkey cart!\u201d she exclaimed around 2 a.m. By morning, this train to one of the world\u2019s great tourist destinations was basically empty except for us; everyone else had gotten off somewhere along the way.The Zambian terminus of this project is the grand railroad station in tiny Kapiri Mposhi. One of its best features, from our point of view, was its first-class waiting room. That lounge, with its upholstered furniture, portraits of the presidents of Zambia and Tanzania, and private bathroom, was where we met Chilesi, Catherine and the others who would share our first-class car to Dar. With about three hours to kill before departure, we exchanged food (our Clif bars, their fruit) and told stories. The Zambian women showed Margot how to wrap the fabric she had bought into a skirt. In short, we became friendly before the train ever left \u2014 the perfect prelude to a rail journey.The train had linen service and offered meals in our compartment, as well \u2014 typically eggs for breakfast and chicken and rice at other times, all of it cheap and homey. The Chinese-made coaches, though showing their age, were cleaner than the train cars in Zimbabwe; even better, the windows worked.Just as the Blue Train had slowed on its approach to Johannesburg and Pretoria, so too did the Tazara creep into Dar es Salaam. The advertised noon arrival somehow slipped to 11:30 p.m. We didn\u2019t mind terribly much, except that I was worried we wouldn\u2019t be met at the station by the driver we\u2019d arranged for in advance. The end of a long train journey is like the end of a dream: You must leave the cocoon, the private compartment and the separate experience of time and space, and rejoin reality \u2014 in this case, a big African city we didn\u2019t know. No more contemplating history; it was time to fend for ourselves in the present. For our Canadian friends, the dream ended before the train even came to a stop: Taxi drivers leaned in through the windows, wanting to know where they were going.We marched with trepidation onto the dimly lit platform. Colorful lights and music greeted us as we approached the station: the station\u2019s restaurant was hosting a wedding party. A short tunnel led to the street; we waded into the throng. Two or three signs with names on them were being waved in the air, and I was stunned to see one with our name. The driver had waited 11 and a half hours for us; I practically hugged him. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d I said.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, reaching for our bags. His car was old and beat up. It was beautiful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Administration Could Test Whether Deficits Help the Economy", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byFiscal PolicyHere\u2019s a surprising conclusion you reach when you start to game out what economic policy will look like in Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration: While many details of his policy agenda are likely to be staunchly opposed by the left, Mr. Trump appears likely to enact a fun-house mirror version of what many liberal economists have advocated for years: Keynesian fiscal stimulus.Mr. Trump did not run a campaign with many detailed proposals, but he promised to cut taxes significantly, rebuild and expand infrastructure and maybe increase military spending. Together those moves would most likely increase the budget deficit substantially. That risks increasing interest rates and inflation, which could dampen the pro-growth effects of any tax cut and government spending.If that turns out to be the policy reality of the next few years, it would be a real-world test of an argument liberal economists have made for years: that higher deficits could help end an era of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d and spur faster growth. Somewhat higher inflation would actually be a feature, not a bug, of the policy approach.The most detailed policy proposal the Trump campaign issued was on tax policy. It broadly tracks the priorities of a Republican Party that will control both houses of Congress.So expect major tax cuts, which will especially benefit wealthy Americans and businesses. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan included cutting the rate on the highest earners from its current 39.6 percent to 33 percent and cutting the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.Of course any actual changes to tax policy will depend on the results of laborious negotiations with Congress \u2014 no campaign policy proposal is ever enacted exactly as written. But Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal is similar to a proposal by House Republicans, and it is quite clear this is the direction Congress will want to go.Some version of this infrastructure policy has a good chance of being enacted. Republicans in Congress are generally on board with the idea of spending on roads, bridges airports and other projects; opposition to such a proposal during the Obama administration has been more tactical than ideological.Even if the details of a Trump infrastructure plan take a different form than the one that left-of-center economists have advocated as a cure for persistently slow growth, the result in terms of the macroeconomic effects should be similarly positive.But then there are the tax cuts. In the simplest math of fiscal policy, lower taxes plus more spending equal higher budget deficits. Mr. Trump resorted to vague hand-waving about any spending cuts to offset those changes, promising instead that faster growth would prevent the deficit from rising.Most hardheaded analysis \u2014 including from those sympathetic ideologically \u2014 suggests this is wrong. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for example, estimates that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would reduce federal revenue by about $12 trillion over the next decade, and faster growth would offset only about $2 trillion of that.Assuming that those forecasts are right and that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans sharply increase the deficit, the open question is what it means for the economy. For the last few years, the world has suffered from a chronic shortage of demand, depressing inflation and interest rates worldwide.If those conditions persist, a Trump administration may have some room to expand deficits without triggering a spike in interest rates that would undo any economic boost those deficits create.It\u2019s unwise to extrapolate from short-term moves in financial markets what will happen to the economy over years ahead. But shifts in the markets on Wednesday suggest that investors are pricing in some significant chance of this happening.The yield on Treasury bonds fell initially Tuesday night as Mr. Trump\u2019s victory looked more probable and investors sought a safe-haven investment. But Wednesday, rates actually rose 0.11 percentage points, which suggests global investors think that higher rates are in the United States\u2019s future. Measures of expected inflation in the bond market rose as well.\u201cWhile things change fast, for now the market seems to think of a Trump presidency largely as inflationary,\u201d said Roberto Perli, an economist with Cornerstone Macro, in a research note Wednesday morning.Even for people who don\u2019t like Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts or the rest of his policy agenda, if he gets his way on taxes and infrastructure spending, it will be a test of whether deficits really matter in a world that has been locked in a slow-growth reality for years.An earlier version of this article misstated the extent of an income tax cut Donald J. Trump had most recently proposed for the highest earners. He suggested lowering the tax rate to 33 percent from its current 39.6 percent, not to 25 percent. Mr. Trump had previously proposed lowering it to 25 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The View From Trump Tower", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byIf your social circles are like mine, you spent Tuesday night swapping miserable texts. Not all, but many of my friends and family members were outraged, stunned, disgusted and devastated. This is victory for white supremacy, people wrote, for misogyny, nativism and authoritarianism. Fascism is descending.I was on PBS trying to make sense of what was happening while trying to text various people off the ledge. At one point I was opining about the results while a disbelieving text flashed across my phone: \u201cChange It! Change It! CHAAAANGE IT!\u201dThose emotional reactions were a fitting first-night response to the greatest political shock of our lifetimes. Still, this is probably not the best mentality for the coming era.In the first place, emotions like disgust don\u2019t do justice to the complexity of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters. The disgusted posture risks turning politics into a Manichaean civil war between the alleged children of light and the alleged children of darkness \u2014 between us enlightened, college-educated tolerant people and the supposed primitive horde driven by dark fears and prejudices. That crude and ignorant condescension is what feeds the Trump phenomenon in the first place.Second, we simply don\u2019t yet know how much racism or misogyny motivated Trump voters. It is true that those voters are willing to tolerate a lot more bigotry in their candidate than I\u2019d be willing to tolerate. But if you were stuck in a jobless town, watching your friends OD on opiates, scrambling every month to pay the electric bill, and then along came a guy who seemed able to fix your problems and hear your voice, maybe you would stomach some ugliness, too.Third, outrage and disgust impede learning. This century is still being formed and none of us understand it yet. The century really began on 9/11, and so far it has been marked by strong reactions against globalism and cosmopolitanism \u2014 by terrorism, tribalism and authoritarianism.Populism of the Trump/Le Pen/Brexit variety has always been a warning sign, a warning sign that there is some deeper dysfunction in our economic, social and cultural systems. If you want to take that warning sign and dismiss it as simple bigotry, you\u2019re never going to pause to understand what\u2019s going on and you will never know how to constructively respond.Finally, it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result. Trump\u2019s main problem in governing is not going to be some fascistic ideology; his main problem is going to be his own attention span, ignorance and incompetence. If he\u2019s left to bloviate while others are left to run the country and push through infrastructure plans, maybe things won\u2019t be disastrous.The job for the rest of us is to rebind the fabric of society, community by community, and to construct a political movement for the post-Trump era. I suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes: open and closed and individual and social.Those who believe in open trade, relatively open immigration, an active foreign policy and racial integration. Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade, closed borders, a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism.Those who favor individual believe in individual initiative, designing programs to incentivize enterprise and removing regulatory barriers. Those who believe in social believe that social mobility happens within rich communities \u2014 that people can undertake daring adventures when they have a secure social and emotional base.Donald Trump is probably going to make the G.O.P. the party of individual/closed. He\u2019s going to start with the traditional Republican agenda of getting government out of the way, and he\u2019s going to add walls, protectionism and xenophobia. That will leave people isolated in the face of the challenges of the information age economy, and it will close off the dynamism and diversity that always marked this crossroads of the nation.The Democrats are probably going to be the party of social/closed. The coming Sanders-Warren party will advocate proposals that help communities with early education programs and the like, but that party will close off trade, withdraw from the world, close off integration with hyper-race-conscious categories and close off debate with political correctness.Which is why I\u2019ve been thinking we need a third party that is social/open. This compassionate globalist party would support the free trade and skilled immigration that fuel growth. But it would also flood the zone for those challenged in the high-skill global economy \u2014 offering programs to rebuild community, foster economic security and boost mobility. It would integrate the white working class and minority groups by emphasizing that we are all part of a single American idea.Trump\u2019s bigotry, dishonesty and promise-breaking will have to be denounced. We can\u2019t go morally numb. But he needs to be replaced with a program that addresses the problems that fueled his ascent.After all, the guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year. The future is closer than you think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OPEC Reaches Deal to Limit Production, Sending Prices Soaring", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byVIENNA \u2014 After years of trying fruitlessly to prop up energy markets, OPEC on Wednesday finally reached a consensus on production cuts, sending oil prices soaring. The problem is, the euphoria in the markets may not last.With prices still at less than half the levels of two years ago, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed this fall to lower collective production. But it could not figure out how to spread the cuts among the countries.The path to consensus has been complicated by Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose longstanding mutual enmity encompasses religious, political and economic competition. When it comes to oil, Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s top producer, has fought to maintain its market share, while Iran has worked to protect its nascent comeback as a power broker in the cartel, a role it lost in recent years under Western sanctions tied to its nuclear program.They overcame their differences on Wednesday, with OPEC deciding to cut production next year by about 4.5 percent, or 1.2 million barrels a day. It will be the first cut in eight years.With the prospect of less pumping, oil prices, which began rising earlier in the day in anticipation of the deal, were up more than 8 percent, to nearly $50 a barrel. Rising prices could lift the troubled economies of oil-dependent nations like Nigeria and Venezuela, and bolster the fortunes of smaller American energy producers that have been shaken by the weakness.The deal shows that \u201cthe weight and resilience of OPEC is still there and will continue to be,\u201d Qatar\u2019s energy minister, Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada, said at a news conference on Wednesday.The market optimism, though, may soon be tempered.The deal, which is to last six months starting in January, is contingent on the cooperation of non-OPEC countries, most notably Russia. While Russia agreed to participate, Moscow is notoriously difficult to predict. And its reported 300,000 barrels-per-day cut is only a trickle in its total output.A recent production frenzy creates another wild card for the deal.While Saudi Arabia and Iran have vocally supported higher prices, their national oil companies have been making deals in Asia and filling tankers as quickly as possible. Saudi production has increased to well over 10 million barrels a day, while reductions in domestic consumption have left more available for export. Iran, relieved of nuclear sanctions, has gone on its own selling spree in India and started production in new oil and gas fields.Other OPEC countries have followed, increasing production in recent months. The race to pump more is taking several of the cartel\u2019s largest members to the brink of their production capacity.The intense competition makes OPEC\u2019s new plan less meaningful \u2014 part of the piece of the industry dynamics that means the price increase could prove temporary.The size of the cut is fairly trivial in a 96-million-barrel-a-day marketplace that remains oversupplied. Should prices rise in the next few weeks, American shale producers are very likely to drill and complete more wells, which would add supply to the global market. And if history is any guide, even a modest agreement can be breached by cheating.\u201cIf higher prices bring higher output, prices will not remain up for long,\u201d said Jim Krane, a Middle East energy analyst at Rice University. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before we\u2019re back where we started.\u201dOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.But the cartel\u2019s words and actions did not initially dovetail. The production and export frenzy in Iran has been accompanied by increased activity across much of OPEC.In the midst of a civil war, Libya has more than doubled oil production since August, to 600,000 barrels a day. It says it hopes to raise output an additional 300,000 barrels by early 2017. Iraq has expanded production by 300,000 barrels a day since the summer. Nigeria has pledged to increase oil production to 2.2 million barrels a day by the end of the year, from 1.9 million.Iran is trying to reclaim the global market share, and the clout in OPEC, that it lost in recent years under nuclear sanctions.Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern and African producers \u2014 particularly Angola, Iraq, Kuwait and Nigeria \u2014 took advantage of Iran\u2019s troubles by raising production to serve its old customers. Iran once threatened a retaliatory naval blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, the critical Persian Gulf choke point, a move that could have paralyzed the economies of Saudi Arabia, its neighboring allies and much of Asia and inflamed geopolitical tensions.Now Iran is coming back fast.Since many sanctions were lifted in January, Iran\u2019s crude oil production has risen nearly a third, to about 3.7 million barrels a day. Having achieved the goal of returning to pre-sanctions levels, Iranian officials want to take production capacity higher still, toward 4.8 million barrels a day by 2021.\u201cIran\u2019s influence in OPEC, and indeed in the region, has been growing since the lifting of nuclear-related international sanctions,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Markit, a research company.Iran is also beginning to negotiate deals with outside companies for the capital and technological expertise needed to reach its production goals.Officials have already reached a preliminary agreement with Total to develop a giant gulf natural gas field that Iran shares with Qatar, and they are discussing energy deals with Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch giant. Nearly 50 oil and gas projects may also be opened to international investors.Iran\u2019s ultimate success at recovering its old glory is uncertain.During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump promised to rip up the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration and other world powers. And even if other countries do not follow Mr. Trump\u2019s lead, persistently low oil prices could deter foreign investment.\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Homayoun Falakshahi, an Iran analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.The Saudi-Iranian rivalry has complicated the negotiations.Some energy analysts say the Saudis pushed the idea of a cut, in part thinking that Iran had reached its production limits and would not be able to fight for supremacy in the Asian markets for long. In the days before the OPEC meeting, Iran tried to negotiate an exemption from any cut.The competition extends beyond markets. Saudi Arabia and Iran are also playing an increasingly deadly political game, battling for power in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East.The specifics of the ultimate OPEC deal give both Saudi Arabia and Iran reasonable room, adding to the doubt about whether the cuts will have much teeth.Saudi Arabia is taking a considerable hit, agreeing to cut 486,000 barrels a day, the largest chunk of the total deal. But the Saudis would normally cut substantially in the winter, when they burn less oil to generate electric power for air-conditioning. Iran faces a ceiling about 100,000 barrels a day higher than what analysts estimate it is now producing.Adherence to the deal is also not a given. Three big and reliable gulf producers \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 account for more than 60 percent of the cuts. But the rest come from other producers who may not adhere as closely to their limits.\u201cThis is a great headline number,\u201d said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy, who was observing the meeting. But considering the \u201cneed to secure cuts from non-OPEC and that there need to occur big contributions from countries that don\u2019t have a great history of compliance, it starts to look smaller,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misspelled the name of the oil minister of Saudi Arabia. He is Khalid al-Falih, not Khaled al-Falih.Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Stock Markets, Initially Shaken, Went Up After Trump\u2019s Victory", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byAfter a sharp sell-off overnight in Asia, markets staged a recovery on Wednesday as investors shook off the shock of a Donald J. Trump presidency and began to focus on whether his mix of policies could spur a still-fragile global economic recovery.Futures for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index initially plunged 5 percent but recouped nearly all their losses when stocks started trading in the United States. The major market indicators ended the day up more than 1 percent.By their nature, markets are wired to look beyond the moment and into the future. In that regard, the bounce-back in stocks reflects the bet being made by many investors that Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to increase government spending, cut taxes and ease financial regulations will outweigh his anti-trade rhetoric.To that end, stocks that would benefit from more robust economic growth, like banks and companies tied to infrastructure and transportation, were in demand on Wednesday. Shares of Bank of America closed up 5.7 percent. The equipment rental company United Rentals ended up 17 percent.More broadly, however, market experts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory should be viewed as a loud signal from Main Street that the time had come for fiscal policy in the form of increased government spending to replace central bank activism as a means to stimulate economic growth.\u201cThis was a political uprising,\u201d said Jurrien Timmer, a market strategist at the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments in Boston. \u201cMonetary policy has been part of the problem, in that the wealth effect has not accrued equally. If the baton is passed toward fiscal policy, that would mean higher inflation and lead to a rotation toward cyclical stocks such as financials.\u201dFor quite some time now, economists have been warning that the reliance of governments in the United States and elsewhere on central banks to energize economies via zero interest-rate policies and buying back securities was creating an uneven recovery by bolstering the housing markets in New York, London and San Francisco while real economies lagged.As Donald J. Trump began to solidify his path to the presidency on Tuesday night, international markets fell sharply. Wall Street was expected to react similarly, but was up on Wednesday.Increased government spending on highways, bridges and roads may well provide a lift to the broader economy, and tax cuts and looser regulations will be cheered by the financial markets.But there are downsides to these approaches, including increased deficits and levels of debt.Moreover, market analysts wonder how Mr. Trump will balance these policies, which are mostly positive for financial markets, with his promises to increase trade barriers on goods from Mexico and China.Mr. Trump\u2019s antitrade position has prompted fears that he would precipitate a trade war at a time when global trade is already suffering because of increased protectionist measures in countries around the world.\u201cThis is not Brexit,\u201d said Jeffrey Kleintop, an investment specialist at Schwab Investments, referring to the rally in stocks and bonds that soon followed Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. \u201cThat will be a long process of negotiated change. The worry is that Mr. Trump would follow through on his promise to raise tariffs on China and Mexico.\u201dIn that vein, emerging market currencies and stock markets bucked the market\u2019s buoyant mood. The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar and the Chinese renminbi continued a recent trend of weakness, suggesting, some traders said, that China might be pushing the currency lower to give exports an extra lift before Mr. Trump takes office.More than most days, investors flocked to exchange traded funds during the market\u2019s opening hours, with E.T.F.s at one point accounting for 45 percent of total stock market trades, according to officials at BlackRock. Among the more popular was iShares biotechnology fund, which soared 9 percent on the hope of fewer regulations for pharmaceutical companies under Mr. Trump.On Wednesday, the benchmark S.&P. 500-stock index closed up 1.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index also ended up 1.1 percent, while the narrower Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4 percent. Trading volume was the heaviest since the market turmoil of late June after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.For now, the market\u2019s willingness to cast a positive eye on a Trump victory seems tied to the prospect of more government spending.In the weeks leading up to the election, a noticeable trend has been the slow but persistent increase in the interest rates of government bonds, many of which have been in negative territory for some time as investors sought safety in these securities.The sell-off in Treasury securities on Wednesday was drastic, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, on the benchmark 10-year note past 2 percent for the first time since January. The yield, which touched a low of 1.37 percent in July, ended Wednesday at 2.07 percent.Analysts have said that these moves reflect a growing willingness of politicians around the world to loosen their fiscal belts to fight long-term stagnation. Any move toward a meaningful pickup in infrastructure investing would require more government borrowing and thus put upward pressure on today\u2019s low interest rates.\u201cThe question of lack of demand should be our preoccupation in thinking about macroeconomic policy going forward,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cAnd it has a natural solution \u2014 issuing debt to support whatever investments the government sees as best.\u201dGovernments around the world that are sitting on large piles of cash, like Germany, are facing similar pressures to take advantage of low rates to borrow and spend to stimulate a more vigorous level of growth.While such policies would also increase debt levels, economists who support Mr. Summers\u2019s policy prescription argue that a trade-off of higher growth is worthwhile, given how low borrowing costs are right now.Global investors initially reacted as if the world had caught fire. They yanked their money from the marketplace in an unrestrained bout of selling reminiscent of the outbreak of war.They even sold the United States dollar, which nearly always functions as a refuge in times of chaos. Yet hours later, the dollar rallied, oil prices recovered and even the Mexican peso came off its lows.Times reporters provided real-time analysis of Donald J. Trump\u2019s stunning upset in the presidential election on Tuesday.Neil Gough, Peter S. Goodman and Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Kia Cadenza Offers Budget-Minded Pampering", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byDrivenWe make deliberate choices when buying things. Shopping for a wallet recently, I briefly considered a devastatingly gorgeous Burberry billfold. However, the outlay would have left me with little money to put into it. Oh, the irony. I opted for something similar but far more affordable.It\u2019s the same with cars. A deluxe sedan can be had without a premium badge affixed. Toyota does it with the Avalon. There are also the Hyundai Azera, Nissan Maxima and Chevy Impala.The near-luxury entry from Kia, the South Korean automaker, is the Cadenza (which spell check desperately wants to change to credenza). The 2017 model is the second generation to be sold in the United States. Simply put, this elevated machine pampers owners with Coach quality at Wilsons Leather prices.Does the Cadenza indulge at the level of a BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class? No. There is more than just social ranking with those loftier prices.The Germans are rear- or all-wheel drive, while the front wheels pull the Korean around. Autoparking and those traffic-jam-coping self-driving modes that briefly take over on Volvo, Mercedes and BMW cars are M.I.A. on the Cadenza.Base models with standard rearview camera and leather seating start at $32,890. My Limited tester at $45,290 is stuffed with details expected from upscale rides. Its trendy quilted Napa leather is supple, and the front seats it is draped over are climate controlled. A suede headliner looks to be swiped from a car twice the price. Panoramic roof glass treats all passengers.There is no shortage of safety tech, either. Auto braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and blind-spot warning are all along for the ride. So is a surround-view camera system that to the driver makes it seem there is a drone hovering above the car.Shoveling content into an upscale car is easy enough. But integrating it well is a black art that Kia engineers pull off. The touch-screen interface is fall-on-your-face easy and incorporates Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. A head-up display helps to keep eyes on the road.How does the Cadenza go? Acceleration is brisk, nailing 0 to 60 runs in just under 7 seconds. But the revised V6, refined as it is, doesn\u2019t match the velvety operation found under high-zoot hoods. At 3.3-liters, the engine produces 290 horsepower and 253 pound-feet of torque.The transmission has eight speeds and shift paddles on the steering wheel. Drive modes alter shift dynamics, steering weight and throttle response, but not suspension firmness. (Remember those extra Franklins in your wallet or purse before grousing.)The new Cadenza\u2019s lighter chassis structure manages to improve torsional rigidity by 35 percent. The suspension employs aluminum steering knuckles, and Amplitude Selective Damping shock absorbers help quell body bob and dive.Kia finally dialed in some road feel through the steering wheel, an attribute historically lacking. The button-down ride quality is comfortable, controlled and quiet without oozing driving character. Go with the Nissan Maxima for a taste of that.Uncle Sam rates Cadenza\u2019s fuel economy at 20 city and 28 highway on standard grade fuel. That is competitive in its class.Kia claims that the Cadenza\u2019s interior is the most spacious among the direct competition, and there is no question the back seat is nearly limolike.Bun warmers back there? Yep. There are sunshades for the side and rear glass, too. Power jacks in the rear can charge phones and computers, but there\u2019s no rear climate zone. Seat backs don\u2019t fold to expand the trunk (though there is a slot for skis). Fortunately, the trunk is spacious.Not only does the Cadenza slug it out with the cars mentioned earlier, it holds its own against near-luxury offerings like Buick\u2019s new LaCrosse, the Lincoln MKZ and Lexus ES.In addition to style, features and value, Kia offers a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty. The Cadenza may not impress brand snobs, but the price leaves buyers a good amount of leftover cash to stuff into their wallets. Feel free to make it a fancy one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Leaders Support Steps to Rescue Climate", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan car alliance, gives a clear reason his company is taking the lead in developing moderately priced electric cars.The rules governing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for climate change are going to get stricter, he said. If so, that is bad news for the future of vehicles powered by emissions-producing gasoline and other fossil fuels.\u201cYou know that the only technology that will allow the industry to continue to prosper is zero emissions or very low emissions, \u201c he said.While there is much skepticism on the eve of the meetings about climate change in Marrakesh, Morocco, known as COP22, about whether the world is taking big enough steps to prevent temperatures from rising to dangerous levels, the changing attitudes of business leaders are one reason for cautious optimism.While governments may make the rules, the responsibility will likely fall on businesses to implement energy- and emissions-reducing changes in how they operate and the products they provide to society.Many business leaders say they recognize climate change as a serious problem and that they are under pressure to demonstrate to their customers and employees, as well as governments and regulators, that they are doing something about it.\u201cI think the demand comes from the people who buy our products,\u201d said Trisa Thompson, vice president for corporate social responsibility at Dell, the computer maker.Dell is taking some energy-saving steps, like moving away from delivering computers on daily Boeing 747 flights from China to the United States. Instead, the company is putting the machines on boats.Dell is also delving extensively into what is known as the circular economy, reusing the plastics in its computers and even exploring the possibility of using plastic debris gathered in polluted estuaries in its packaging.Ms. Thompson and Mr. Ghosn spoke at a two-day New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference in Paris that ended Friday.At the conference, technology companies like Dell and Microsoft said that they saw many business opportunities in the need to save energy and cut emissions.Rob Bernard, chief environmental strategist at Microsoft, said the world was on the cusp of what he called a fourth industrial revolution and that there was a \u201chealthy paranoia\u201d in most executive suites that if companies did not make better use of resources they would find themselves out of business.The tech companies say they can make a big contribution through digital strategies, including those that save energy or manage it better. \u201cWe believe technology is the backbone of the changes that will solve the world\u2019s big hairy problems,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.Even what seem to be very traditional companies apparently are capable of change.Enel, the large Italian utility, is reinventing itself as a much more nimble company focused on renewables and services rather than building large-scale utility projects.Investing directly in renewables is becoming a larger and more stable business, executives said.Torben Moger Pedersen, chief executive of PensionDanmark, a Danish pension fund, said the firm had invested about 3 billion euros, or $3.33 billion, in various renewable projects.\u201cInvestors looking for opportunities to invest in large-ticket projects can relatively easily find them out there,\u201d he said.Clean energy sources, like wind and solar energy, represented more than half of the new electric power capacity installed around the world last year, according to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy security group, which has added climate change to its portfolio.Yet, leaders of major oil companies warned that despite the powerful shift that was unquestionably occurring, oil and gas would be needed for decades to come.Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, Europe\u2019s largest oil company, said that while Shell was investing in biofuels and other renewable energy, there was no alternative to oil and gas that would pay the company\u2019s shareholders the large dividends they expected.\u201cAt this point in time, of the $30 billion that we invest each year, I cannot find a significant percentage to invest in renewable projects simply because they are not there,\u201d he told the conference.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the chief environmental strategist at Microsoft.

{"Headline": "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon Wins Center-Right Nomination for French Presidency", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 French voters chose a socially conservative, budget-cutting former prime minister on Sunday to lead the center-right Republican Party in next year\u2019s presidential election. Once again, the outcome upset pollsters\u2019 initial predictions, and it paved the way for a likely face-off with the country\u2019s far-right party in 2017.Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, 62, a sober, dark-suited government veteran who called for economic sacrifice, major changes in the French workplace and a crackdown on immigration and Islam, won about 67 percent of the vote in the primary contest on Sunday, crushing his more centrist opponent, Alain Jupp\u00e9, who is also a former prime minister.French presidential elections are usually decided in two rounds, with the first round winnowing the field to two candidates. Having won his party\u2019s primary, Mr. Fillon is widely expected to be one of those two finalists in the general election in the spring.It now seems increasingly unlikely that the current governing party, the Socialists, will produce the other. The French left is weak and in disarray after five years in which high unemployment rates and slow economic growth have barely budged. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has not said whether he will run for another term, and many in his party hope he does not.Mr. Fillon, with his themes of restoring France\u2019s identity and national greatness and his tough language on immigrants and Islam, has been making a clear play for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s voters.His promise to slash 500,000 government jobs and cut the budget by more than 100 billion euros (about $106 billion) could leave him vulnerable against Ms. Le Pen, who promises to safeguard France\u2019s substantial safety net of government protections and spending. Mr. Fillon told supporters during the campaign that he was going to \u201cbreak down the house,\u201d but many in France don\u2019t want the house broken.Promises of top-to-bottom economic overhaul have generally brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets. Unions are already sounding warnings about Mr. Fillon\u2019s plans to reduce the state\u2019s role in the economy, and the National Front has heaped scorn on his proposals.In his victory speech on Sunday night, Mr. Fillon emphasized traditional French rightist themes of restoring \u201cauthority\u201d and \u201cFrench values,\u201d as he did throughout the campaign, when commentators largely dismissed his chances.\u201cIn our country, there is an immense need for respect and pride,\u201d Mr. Fillon told cheering supporters in Paris. \u201cThere is also a demand for the authority of the state, and for exemplary behavior from those who govern it. In my conduct, the voters of the right and the center have found the French values to which they are so much attached.\u201dHis opponent, Mr. Jupp\u00e9, campaigned on a \u201cunity\u201d theme that led many on the right to suggest that he was a leftist in disguise. The notes Mr. Fillon sounded were darker.With many of his fellow citizens uneasy over immigration, terrorist attacks and the integration of Muslims, Mr. Fillon vowed to restore a more traditional France by strictly regulating Islam and limiting immigration, and promised an alliance with Russia to crush what he called \u201ctotalitarian\u201d Islamists. Commentators have noted Mr. Fillon\u2019s close relations with Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president.A Catholic from conservative, rural western France, Mr. Fillon entered Parliament in 1981; at 27, he was the house\u2019s youngest member. Catholic voters who appreciated his positions against abortion and same-sex marriage supported him heavily in the presidential race, even though he has promised not to interfere with legal guarantees of either.Mr. Fillon still sits in the National Assembly and lives in a medieval manor house near Le Mans with his family; he has five children. During the campaign, he spoke often of France\u2019s identity and of instilling the country\u2019s \u201cnational epic\u201d in its schools.\u201cFrance can\u2019t tolerate its slippage,\u201d Mr. Fillon told supporters on Sunday night. \u201cFrance wants truth and action. This past presidential term has been pathetic. We\u2019ve got to end it and start afresh, as we haven\u2019t done in over 30 years.\u201dMr. Fillon has promised to rewrite France\u2019s 3,000-page labor code, reduce taxes on companies and the rich, raise the retirement age to 65, and lengthen the 35-hour standard workweek. He called his program \u201cmore radical, maybe more difficult,\u201d in a televised debate with Mr. Jupp\u00e9 last week.\u201cI could have said more agreeable things,\u201d Mr. Fillon said. \u201cBut the only way to keep one\u2019s promises is to have a very precise program.\u201dHis supporters do not appear to be scared by these promises, at least for now. \u201cHe\u2019s an upright man,\u201d said Roselyne Duchaine, 81, a retiree in Paris\u2019s 17th arrondissement who said she had voted for Mr. Fillon on Sunday.Another voter, Thierry Roland, 68, said: \u201cFillon has the rigor.

Its teller is Ralph Ayres, a World War I veteran now domiciled in an old folks\u2019 home, although he isn\u2019t old. The listener is his nephew, Ned Ayres, a boy transfixed by an uncle whose stories help the two escape the confines of their routines.Uncle Ralph recounts a surreal encounter between American infantrymen and \u201cthe Hun\u201d in the French countryside. The Germans \u201ccame from the forest into twilight. Wolves were among them, mangy creatures, undisciplined, furtive in the shadows. And then the wolves vanished and the German infantry was in our midst. .\u2008.\u2008. They were weary. And they carried gifts, candy bars and chocolate bears, bunches of flowers. They looked half starved but they couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been friendlier.\u201d Talking, laughing, the German soldiers stay for an hour or more, and then, slowly, \u201cthey disappeared into the rain, one by one.\u201dAnd here, at once, are the two totems of this book, the wonder of the literary imagination and the authority of fact. It\u2019s possible that all of writing lies between them, and Ned, you might say, splits the difference. He will become a newspaperman, specifically an editor, whose job it is to assess a compilation of facts and manipulate them into something aspiring to truth. It sounds portentous to say so \u2014 and Just, with his predilection for understatement, never would \u2014 but questions of storytelling and truth are at the center of \u201cThe Eastern Shore.\u201d What makes a story true? What means of storytelling best capture reality? Are facts a path to truth or a finely constructed gate? Just, who has been a newspaperman and a memoirist, as well as a novelist, may be as qualified to consider these questions as any American writer.He does so through the person of Ned, whose career begins at his local paper. Impatient, ambitious, claustrophobic in his snug Indiana town, Ned will face a moment of truth when he must weigh in on the publication (or not) of a hot story: A prominent and upstanding local citizen is found to have a secret and violent past. The facts prove it. Should the story run?The newspaper publisher says yes: This is the inspirational story of a man who has triumphed over adversity. Ned wants more time to think it over, but he worries about looking weak. So he forces his conclusion. The story, he decides, \u201cwas the truth and fortified by fact.\u201d It runs \u2014 and the consequences are predictably tragic.Not for Ned, however. Elevated by the episode, he moves to Chicago, then 1960s Washington, to take increasingly important newspaper jobs. Ayres lives for journalism. To him, the front page is a work of art, made anew every evening. Campaign coverage \u201ccould resemble a symphony, violins carrying the melody, a warning from the horns, provocation from the big bass drum.\u201d (Modern readers might be excused for finding this a charming notion.) The other elements of a life \u2014 love, family, a partner, even loss \u2014 leave little impression on either character or reader. Instead, \u201cNed sipped whiskey, lit a cigarette and stepped into the newsroom.\u201dJust tells this story with a dispassionate remove and an economy of dialogue that make one wonder what might have happened if he\u2019d directed his writing to the stage. Consider this exchange between Ned and Elaine, an early lover. As the couple walk along Lake Michigan, Ned commits an act of infidelity \u2014 he inadvertently reveals his preference for the newsroom, and his frustrated companion forces his hand.\u201c\u200a\u2018Will you stop looking at the time. Just stop it.\u2019\u201c\u200a\u2018I\u2019m late.\u2019\u201c\u200a\u2018Catch a cab.\u2019\u201c\u200a\u2018I\u2019ll see you at home,\u2019 he said.\u201c\u200a\u2018Or not,\u2019 she said.\u201c\u200a\u2018Or not,\u2019 he agreed.\u201dIf people don\u2019t quite talk like this in real life, they should. These six terse sentences detail the end of a relationship with wonderful efficiency. They\u2019re filled with facts and emotions unsaid because they\u2019re already known. The truth lies behind the dialogue.There are plenty of such painfully incisive exchanges in \u201cThe Eastern Shore,\u201d along with the genuine pleasure of Just\u2019s sure hand as he guides us through Ned\u2019s career. But the novel is scented with an air of nostalgia that, while truthful, is less than compelling. As editor in chief of a newspaper obviously modeled on The Washington Post, Ned is hounded by the internet, nibbled at by budget cuts, undermined by the flight to the suburbs and the hopscotch attention spans of a new generation. He retires to a house on the Eastern Shore, a pre-Civil War manor in which Edgar Allan Poe had \u201crusticated for a spell.\u201d The house is now crumbling \u2014 falling, you might say.Ned commences to write his memoirs, but he is blocked; the book will never happen. He has come to wonder about the point of it all and debates whether to \u201cwipe the computer clean,\u201d to erase all his memories. \u201cNed Ayres liked to think he had been part of a golden age that was never to repeat itself in any recognizable form.\u201d But in these pages, it does.Richard Bradley is editor in chief and chief content officer of Worth.Advertisement"}

Still, President Obama\u2019s charm and civility clearly made a strong impression, though it\u2019s impossible to say when a nasty tweet will come in the middle of the night.\u201cI want a country that loves each other,\u201d Trump told the paper. \u201cI want to stress that.\u201dHarry Reid wasn\u2019t in a kumbaya frame of mind, calling Trump \u201ca sexual predator who lost the popular vote.\u201dOut of a hailstorm of unfathomable things during the week, one sticks out to me: How can it be that in the end, Barack Obama did not understand the Obama revolution?He came away from that elated whoosh in 2008 not comprehending that many voters viewed him as the escape hatch from Clinton Inc. It never would have occurred to anyone then \u2014 even the Clintons \u2014 that President Obama would be the one to brush away any aversions and objections, take us by the elbow, and firmly steer us back to Clinton Inc.Voters waited in line for hours at those early Obama rallies because they wanted thunderous change. They wanted a newcomer who didn\u2019t look like the old dudes on our money, someone who would bust up the incestuous system and give us, as the poster said, hope.But Obama lost touch with his revolutionary side and settled comfortably into being an Ivy League East Coast cerebral elitist who hung out with celebrities, lectured Congress and scorned the art of political persuasion.He was cozy with Silicon Valley and dismissive of working-class voters anxious about globalization, shrugging that \u201cWe\u2019re part of an interconnected global economy now, and there\u2019s no going back from that.\u201d He was dismissive of Americans anxious about terrorism after the Paris attacks, noting that you\u2019d be more likely to die from a bathtub fall.He was dismissive of Bernie Sanders and his voters, treating Sanders as a fairy tale, just as Bill Clinton treated him in 2008 when he was a senator with little record but with an army of passionate supporters who wanted to upend moldy politics.The man who swept into the White House in a boisterous rebellion was dismissive of the boisterous rebellions in both the Democratic and Republican Parties. He insisted that an incrementalist and fellow Ivy League East Coast cerebral elitist who hangs out with celebrities would be best to save his legacy.The leaked John Podesta emails showed how deluded the campaign was about the insurgent mood of the voters.In January 2015, Hillary\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, advised Podesta: \u201cMake a virtue of her longevity. Embrace all the Clinton-ness \u2014 the forty years in politics, the decades on the national stage.\u201dAs late as February, Hillary\u2019s chief strategist, Joel Benenson, was fretting that the candidate had no vision or message compared to Sanders: \u201cDo we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be?\u201dThey should have listened. Bill ousted the first President Bush by focusing on \u201cyou\u201d rather than \u201cI,\u201d what the voters wanted. Hillary\u2019s campaign message boiled down to \u201cIt\u2019s my turn, dammit.\u201dPresident Obama, trying to hoist Hillary over the finish line, offered a solipsistic message, saying it would be \u201ca personal insult\u201d if African-Americans did not vote for Hillary, and an accusatory message, suggesting that sexism was stopping men from voting for Hillary.In September, Hillary stumbled when she dismissed half of Trump supporters as a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d Tellingly, the snooty remarks were made at a high-dollar fund-raiser hosted by Barbra Streisand and other sparklies at Cipriani Wall Street.Hillary should have spent less time collecting money on Wall Street and more time collecting votes in Wisconsin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Wants You to Take Trump Seriously, but Not Too Seriously", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWashington \u2014 It was the perfect way to celebrate Halloween at the National Press Club.Mr. Thiel likes to talk about bubbles. Having lived through the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, Mr. Thiel says he is well-versed in the subject. In his talk, Mr. Thiel described elites in Washington, D.C., and Silicon Valley as the new bubble inhabitants. Politicians, journalists and business people alike ignore reality, he said, because it throws their own success in question. Unlike those cozy elites, he said, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters understand that everything is not fine.\u201cIt\u2019s not a lack of judgment that leads Americans to vote for Trump. We\u2019re voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of our country to have failed,\u201d Mr. Thiel said.When asked if he thought he\u2019d set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d in the Gawker case, Mr. Thiel said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cI strongly believe in the First Amendment. I believe journalists are a privileged group in our society. They play an important role in getting us information and our system of checks and balances. But these were not journalists,\u201d he said.Left unasked was whether the country\u2019s titans of capital should be responsible for deciding who qualifies as a journalist.\u201cIf you\u2019re a single-digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to our legal system,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt costs too much.\u201dWhen asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States, Mr. Thiel shifted in his seat.\u201cI don\u2019t support a religious test. I certainly don\u2019t support the specific language Trump has used in every instance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media always is taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally. I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously, but not literally.\u201dMr. Thiel said Hillary Clinton was \u201cwildly overoptimistic about the outcome of war,\u201d because she, like other elites, denies the difficult reality of the cost of war.\u201cThat\u2019s how bubbles form. Whenever there is a hard problem, but people want to believe in an easy solution, they will be tempted to deny reality and inflate a bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething about the experience of the baby boomers, whose lives have been so much easier than their parents\u2019 or their children\u2019s, has led them to buy into bubbles again and again.\u201dAnd, like speculators in the throes of the dot-com bubble, many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters are mistakenly conflating enthusiasm with success. When faced with bad poll numbers, Republican leaders have responded by citing crowd sizes, \u201cmomentum\u201d and other highly unscientific metrics.The dot-com bubble burst when manic speculation vastly overshot the actual value of fledgling internet companies. The 2008 real estate bubble burst when irresponsible lending, among other factors, led to millions of foreclosures. Whether or not the Trump bubble will burst could remain a political question for decades to come.\u201cNo matter what happens in this election, what Trump represents isn\u2019t crazy, and it\u2019s not going away,\u201d Mr. Thiel said on Monday. \u201cHe points toward a new Republican Party beyond the dogmas of Reaganism. He points even beyond the remaking of one party to a new American politics that overcomes denial, rejects bubble thinking, and reckons with reality.\u201dAfter his talk was over, the journalists in the room were barred from leaving until Mr. Thiel had safely left the building, so as to ensure no pesky follow-up questions. Apparently for Mr. Thiel, some bubbles are acceptable \u2014 as long as he gets to set their parameters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In India, Black Money Makes for Bad Policy", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 On Nov. 8, the Indian government announced an immediate ban on two major bills that account for the vast majority of all currency in circulation. Indians would have until the end of the year to change those notes for other bills, including newly minted ones.On Wednesday, the government released via a smartphone app called \u201cNarendra Modi,\u201d named after the prime minister, the results of a survey purporting to show 90 percent support for its so-called demonetization policy.The government\u2019s wish to tackle these problems is laudable, but demonetization is a ham-fisted move that will put only a temporary dent in corruption, if even that, and is likely to rock the entire economy.Many Indians have been scrambling to change their old notes, causing snaking queues in front of banks and desperation among the poor, many of whom have no bank account and live from cash earnings.Anyone seeking to convert more than 250,000 rupees (about $3,650) must explain why they hold so much cash, or failing that, must pay a penalty. The requirement has already spawned a new black market to service people wishing to offload: Large amounts of illicit cash are broken into smaller blocks and deposited by teams of illegal couriers.Demonetization is mostly hurting people who aren\u2019t its intended targets. Because sellers of certain durables, such as jewelry and property, often insist on cash payments, many individuals who have no illegal money build up cash reserves over time. Relatively poor women stash away cash beyond their husbands\u2019 reach, as savings for the children or the household.Small hoarders often fear being questioned about the source of their money \u2014 they are accustomed to being harassed by tax collectors, among others \u2014 and may choose instead to forgo some of their savings.People have also been skimping in response to the new policy, causing demand for certain basic goods to fall, which has hurt farmers and small producers and could eventually lead them to scale back on their activities.And even more pain is around the corner. With so much money in circulation suddenly ceasing to be legal tender, India\u2019s economic growth is bound to nose-dive. Another risk is that the Indian rupee could depreciate as a result of people and investors moving to more robust currencies.One reason is that the bulk of black money in India isn\u2019t money at all: It\u2019s held in gold and silver, real estate and overseas bank accounts. Another is that even if demonetization can flush out the black money that is held in cash, with no improvement in catching and punishing tax evaders, people with ill-gotten gains will simply start saving in the new bills currently being issued.Both these justifications are flawed. Catching fake notes already in circulation neither helps trap the terrorists who minted them nor prevents more such money from being injected into the economy. It simply inconveniences the people who use it as legal tender, the vast majority of whom had no hand in its creation.There also is no evidence that black money actually is more inflationary than white money; nor in theory should it be. Black money is just money held by people instead of the government. It\u2019s an excessive money supply that tends to create inflation; whether that money is white or black makes little difference.Demonetization may have been well-intentioned, but it was a major mistake. The government should reverse it. It could at least declare that 500 rupee notes, which many poorer people frequently use, are legal again.Tackling corruption also goes beyond currency, cash or even banking. It requires changing institutions and mind-sets, and carefully crafting policies that acknowledge the complexity of economic and social life. The government could start by increasing penalties for tax evasion and amending India\u2019s outdated anti-graft laws.In a country like India, where the illegal economy is so intimately intertwined with the mainstream economy, one inept government intervention against shadow activities can do a lot of harm to the vast majority, who are just trying to make a legitimate living.Kaushik Basu, the C. Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the Indian government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-6.Advertisement"}

Already skilled at making cranberry liqueur, which she bottled and gave as gifts at Christmas, she came up with a formula for a lavender liqueur, using sprigs from her garden. When she shared it with friends at a holiday party, their response was emphatic: Get this to market.In the roughly 18 months since they introduced their Wild Moon brand in six flavors, including birch and rose, Ms. Dubay, 47, and her husband, Tom Dubay, 52, have managed to get the product into roughly 500 liquor stores, bars and restaurants in Connecticut and about 60 in Rhode Island. They now employ two full-time and 11 part-time workers.\u201cThe mixologists love it,\u201d Ms. Dubay said, \u201cbecause it gives them something they don\u2019t have.\u201d The couple is already planning to expand beyond their 2,200-square-foot space as they eye other markets.Under legislation adopted this year, the state will spend about $30 million over the next five years to help communities identify and invest in places ideally suited to support entrepreneurial activity that creates the kind of walkable urban settings that have proved so attractive to young workers. The program operates through CTNext, a state-backed support network for entrepreneurs.The intent is also to stimulate more entrepreneurial activity around major colleges and universities and corporate research facilities.\u201cConnecticut has the ingredients that make for a good environment for entrepreneurs \u2014 a smart work force, great higher-ed institutions,\u201d said State Senator John Fonfara, a Hartford Democrat and the legislation\u2019s architect. \u201cWe just have never taken the ingredients, put them together and put them in the oven.\u201dHartford received one of those grants in collaboration with the town of East Hartford, thanks to the efforts of a group of entrepreneurs, local officials and representatives from major institutions like Trinity College, the University of Hartford and Hartford Healthcare. Michelle Cote, who oversaw the effort, said the group worked together to identify about a half-dozen areas where innovation might flourish.\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible concentration of institutions that have the capacity to foster start-up activity and second-stage business growth activity,\u201d said Ms. Cote, who is the managing director of the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Connecticut\u2019s School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of getting them better connected and working toward everyone\u2019s shared benefit.\u201dDowntown Hartford was also identified as a potential innovation place, not least because the University of Connecticut is moving its West Hartford campus there next fall with some 2,300 students and 250 faculty members. The university\u2019s Graduate Business Learning Center is already downtown, just a few blocks from the new campus location, which is also close to the Hartford Public Library and the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. Apartment development is on the rise; downtown has gained at least 650 units over the last few years, most of which have been absorbed by younger people, said Jamie Br\u00e4tt, the city\u2019s director of planning and economic development.Ms. Schlossberg is particularly interested in robotics start-ups, and said there was no reason Hartford could not claim it as a specialty.\u201cHartford is primed and ready for this kind of activity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just needs someone from outside to come in and push.\u201dHer brother Benjamin Schlossberg, a managing member at Shelbourne Global Solutions, a real estate investment firm in Brooklyn, agreed that Hartford was at a tipping point. His company bought 20 Church Street in 2013, and another Class A building at 100 Pearl Street a year later. They expect to close on a third shortly.\u201cNot enough has been done to cheerlead for Hartford,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said.That could be about to change. Ms. Schlossberg said a group of downtown building owners were joining to fund a major media campaign to be developed by the advertising firm Cummins&Partners to rebrand Hartford \u201cas a city with a lot to offer entrepreneurs.\u201d Hartford\u2019s main claim to fame, she said, should not be its location halfway between Boston and New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shenzhen Connect Offers Chinese Stocks. Will the World Buy?", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global investors in two weeks will get direct access for the first time to the stock market in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, giving them a chance to bet on a tech-heavy clutch of private companies on an exchange sometimes called China\u2019s Nasdaq.But many investors will be skeptical, and the tale of Baofeng Group explains why.A largely unknown tech firm that designs online video players, Baofeng conducted a modest debut on the Shenzhen exchange in March 2015. Over the next three months, its stock rose 4,200 percent.The company went public at the height of China\u2019s share market frenzy, as speculative investment in stocks became the national hobby. Vast fortunes were minted \u2014 Baofeng\u2019s chief executive became a billionaire almost overnight.Then, just as quickly, investors\u2019 hopes were dashed. Chinese stocks imploded in June of that year. The government\u2019s attempt to stem the losses with trading suspensions, bans on selling and a campaign of state-directed buying only added to the concerns of private investors.Many fled the market and still remain on the sidelines more than a year later. As a result, shares of Baofeng \u2014 while up nearly 10 times from the day they began trading \u2014 are still down more than half from their year-ago peak.\u201cEvery stock went down largely,\u201d Wang Jing, an investor relations representative at Baofeng, said of the crash in an interview this month. \u201cThis has also had a big impact on the company.\u201dThe move is the latest test of China\u2019s readiness to allow a more open financial system. Despite China\u2019s status as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the United States, the country\u2019s financial markets are still comparatively immature.The leadership in Beijing worries that easing its grip too fast could lead to destabilizing flows of funds in and out of the country. Programs like the Stock Connect are aimed at opening the door wider \u2014 but also at retaining state control over the pace of liberalization.Analysts welcomed the move but questioned whether it would lift markets or lure much new investment. The main Shanghai share index has entered a bull market, having rallied more than 20 percent from its lows in January, but trading volumes remain a shadow of what they were during the boom.Part of the reason is that China\u2019s economic prospects have lost some of their luster, as growth has eased to its slowest pace in a quarter-century. At the same time, a weakening renminbi, the Chinese currency, has also reduced the attractiveness of investing in domestic shares.\u201cFrom the macro point of view there\u2019s obviously a big hill to climb as far as potential renminbi depreciation and the economic outlook,\u201d said Charles Salvador, director of investment solutions at Z-Ben Advisors, a consulting firm based in Shanghai. \u201cHowever, I still find this to be a turning point in the overall scheme of things.\u201dIf Shanghai is China\u2019s answer to the New York Stock Exchange, the traditional home to big, blue-chip industrial and financial companies, then Shenzhen is the country\u2019s answer to the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Nicole Yuen, vice chairwoman and head of equities for greater China at Credit Suisse, said that around two-thirds of Shanghai\u2019s stocks were state-owned companies, while in Shenzhen, the ratio was only about a quarter of stocks.\u201cThe significance of Shenzhen Connect is it brings to the international market a whole new horizon of stocks that are much more representative of the future of China,\u201d Ms. Yuen said this month, \u201cas opposed to the Shanghai Connect, which is very much more a representation of the previous China, so to speak.\u201dBefore the Shenzhen Connect, the only access foreign investors had to shares listed in the southern city was through the 14-year-old qualified foreign institutional investor program, known as Qfii, which is open only to large foreign funds or other big investors and entails a time-consuming approval process to invest or repatriate profits.The new link will open the door to smaller and more active investors, like hedge funds, and give them quicker access to over 800 new stocks \u2014 many of them entrepreneurial tech firms.Appetite for domestic shares \u201c has improved slightly from a very low level,\u201d said Jian Shi Cortesi, an investment manager for Chinese equities based in Zurich at GAM, an asset management firm.Still, Ms. Cortesi added, \u201cShenzhen Connect is not likely to bring large inflows from foreign investors to push up A-share prices.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indians Rush Frantically to Launder Their \u2018Black Money\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 Indians\u2019 ingenuity is being mightily tested as they rush to save their \u201cblack money,\u201d stashes of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of rupees they have accumulated without paying taxes.For decades, Indians have stuffed their mattresses with 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, the most widely circulated bills, worth the equivalent of a few dollars.But Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to tax that money. His strategy was to force Indians to reveal what they had been hoarding. How? He banned the bills and told people that they had to exchange them for new ones.The ban, which was announced on Nov. 8, has thrown the economy into chaos and sent Indians on a desperate search for some way, any way, to launder their accumulated money and avoid a financially disastrous loss.People can exchange the banned notes through the end of the year for smaller denominations or new bills that are being created. Because more affluent Indians are allowed to deposit only 250,000 rupees, or about $3,700, without proof that they paid taxes, some are handing wads of cash to poor people, paying them a fee to hold the money in their accounts and return it later. Others are thronging jewelry stores and designer boutiques, carrying suitcases of banned currency notes, begging to buy something with backdated receipts.\u201cPeople felt, rather than turn my money into toilet paper, let me have a beautiful outfit,\u201d Tina Tahiliani Parikh, the executive director of the Ensemble group of high-end Indian fashion stores, said in an interview.Some have thrown in the towel, rather than risking an investigation into their taxes, filling pillowcases and paper bags with the old currency and dumping them in the trash. Notes of 1,000 rupees, the equivalent of about $15, have been spotted floating down the Ganges River.About a third of all business in India is carried out using black money. Whole industries, like real estate, trading, luxury retailing and wedding services, have been fueled by black money for decades. They have slumped.The chairman of the Indian Banks\u2019 Association said on Friday that all of the nation\u2019s banks would limit the exchange of banned notes to older citizens and their own customers on Saturday so the staff could focus on normal banking.To a certain extent, analysts say, the Indian economy is so dependent on black money that economic dislocation was unavoidable if India was to seriously attack the problem. \u201cIn an emerging market economy like India, where corruption was deep rooted and long lasting, there is no way to put in place reform without significant disruption in the short run,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University.Others were paying for a year\u2019s hairdressing services in the old notes. Still others were pressing personal trainers, yoga teachers and children\u2019s tutors to take cash upfront for months of services.Ms. Devidayal argued in an interview that the wealthy were \u201calways trying to find some bargain by saving on taxes\u201d and were by far the biggest exploiters of the black-money system. \u201cI know wealthy women so used to handling cash they can tell how much money there is by the weight of a bundle,\u201d she said.Ms. Parikh said some customers had shown up with suitcases of cash, beseeching her staff to pretend that the purchases were made days earlier, which the staff refused to do. Some other luxury goods stores not only obliged customers but solicited them, sensing an opportunity, Ms. Parikh said. \u201cEveryone has tricks up their sleeves, backdating bills,\u201d she said.Real estate has been particularly hard hit by the ban on black money, since sale documents filed with the government typically reflect only the portion of the sale price paid by check. As a result, the sellers have no way of explaining to the tax authorities how they received the cash, which can account for as much as 60 percent of the deal.People who had just sold property were particularly out of luck, since they have not had a chance to spend or invest the cash they received. One man who had just received 3.5 million rupees, or about $51,000, in a real estate sale said he was hiring 14 low-income people to deposit the 250,000 rupees in old notes that they are allowed to put into their accounts without raising questions. Such tactics, called bundling, are illegal in the United States.Whether these schemes are successful will depend on the scrutiny of bank officials and the tax authorities. The Modi administration has said it will exercise extreme vigilance to prevent them, but the Indian government\u2019s record in the area of corruption is not strong. Nevertheless, the pledge to crack down has ignited such fear of future income tax investigations that some people have been dumping cash. Several garbage pickers in Mumbai have found pillow cases and sacks filled with cash in recent days, said Saumya Roy, the chief executive of the nonprofit Vandana Foundation, which makes loans to the garbage pickers, among other low-income residents in Mumbai and elsewhere.In a country where government oversight is weak, it has been easy to transact business in cash and to avoid taxes. Paying cash was also a way of avoiding the scrutiny of tax authorities who might question where a family, particularly that of a politician or wealthy business owner, had amassed the resources to spend enormous amounts of money on real estate or a wedding. \u201cIndia is so crazy and complicated,\u201d Ms. Devidayal said. \u201cThe option of not having black money is very much there, but because it\u2019s so habitual and easy, and you can just say, \u2018I had to do it,\u2019 many people did.\u201dIndia\u2019s lavish weddings have taken a big hit. Families that had stashed large amounts of black money to spend in the coming wedding season, which starts in December, are scrambling to make contingency plans. \u201cThis whole business is largely in cash,\u201d from the caterer and musicians to the jeweler and ornate saris, said Satish Arora, a caterer and decorator in Faridabad, a city near Delhi.Several marriages planned for five-star hotels have been downscaled, he said. Now, the best many can manage is \u201ca simple joint reception.\u201dThe luxury goods market also has been flattened. Business at some of Ms. Parikh\u2019s Ensemble shops has dropped 60 percent since Mr. Modi announced his ban, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will be normal in the future,\u201d she said.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about how Indians are responding to the country\u2019s ban on certain currency notes misstated an option available to holders of the notes. They can deposit 250,000 rupees\u2019 worth of notes without proof that they paid taxes, not exchange them. Because of another editing error, the article referred incorrectly to the money that people are lining up for at A.T.M.s. It is the daily limit of 2,500 rupees, not 2,500-rupee notes (there is no such note).Hari Kumar and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

It is used in an estimated 78 percent of transactions, compared with 20 percent to 25 percent in industrialized countries like Britain and the United States. Many people do not have bank accounts or credit cards, and even those who do often must use cash because many businesses don\u2019t accept other forms of payment.Paper currency makes it easy for people to avoid taxes and engage in corruption. For example, real estate sales are often split into two parts: a smaller portion, which is reported to the government, is paid by check, and a larger, undeclared sum is paid with stacks of cash, or \u201cblack money\u201d as it is often referred to in India. Business people and criminals routinely buy off government officials and politicians with envelopes and briefcases of cash.The move, which went into effect last Wednesday, is meant to force tax evaders and corrupt officials hoarding cash to deposit or exchange their old notes at banks by Dec. 30. Those with very large sums will be forced to explain how they amassed so much cash and pay taxes owed on the money.Mr. Modi acknowledged that the currency swap would cause \u201ctemporary hardships\u201d to \u201chonest citizens.\u201d But his government did not appreciate the extent of the pain it would inflict, for what may be only a short-term solution.

He and his colleagues had tallied 137 civilians killed in the past month, and now his own neighborhood, New Aleppo, was under fire as insurgents battled government forces on the edge of the city.\u201cMy wife and family are hiding in the bathroom,\u201d he said.Even as Syria and Russia threatened an all-out assault on the rebel side of Aleppo, saying Friday was the last chance for people there to exit, they had been unable to put down a counteroffensive by a mix of Qaeda-linked and United States-backed insurgent groups.Three Qaeda-linked suicide bombers attacked a military position with explosive-packed personnel carriers on Thursday, military officials said, and mortar fire was raining on neighborhoods that until now had been relatively safe. It was among the most intense rounds in four years of rebel shelling that officials say has killed 11,000 civilians.There was no immediate way to verify their figures, especially since I was stranded inside a government-controlled bubble, the only way international journalists can safely report on Syria.Facts have become increasingly difficult to verify over more than five years of this bloody and chaotic war. Kidnapping threats from extremist factions, as well as government airstrikes, have made insurgent-held areas too dangerous to venture into. And the government tightly controls access to its areas and closely monitors our movements on the rarely approved trips.But one thing is clear: Nearly every Aleppo resident I have talked to in years of covering the war \u2014 those still here and those who have fled; those who support Mr. Assad, those who oppose him and those in between \u2014 knows someone in the government districts who has been killed by a random shell.Aleppo, one of the world\u2019s oldest continuously inhabited cities, has an estimated 1.5 million residents on the government side, including thousands who have fled from the east, where the United Nations says about 275,000 are trapped by government forces, suffering shortages of food and water along with indiscriminate bombing.This is my first visit since 2001, when I wandered around the bustling old souks, which date from medieval times; visited the ancient citadel that towers at Aleppo\u2019s heart; and admired the gleaming uniformity of cream-colored stone-clad buildings in the wealthier districts that turn pink at sunset.Now, the citadel has been returned to its original purpose as a military stronghold, with government troops perched behind its crenelated walls. Much of the old market, whose narrow passageways became a hide-out for rebels, lies burned and bombed.I rode in from Damascus with a dozen other journalists on Wednesday. We made the final approach to Aleppo through a narrow, winding government-controlled corridor, crawling behind delivery trucks and minivans. The bus wound through earthen berms and collapsed buildings, then through a choke point that has changed hands several times. Shells kicked up dust and smoke in the distance.But a closer look revealed small signs of war: Water distribution centers, with tanks filled by wells to supplement shortages. Generators rumbling on sidewalks, to mitigate power cuts that leave the streets pitch-dark at night. And, a few doors down from our hotel, a top-floor apartment smashed by a recent shell.We asked for rooms facing west, away from the bulk of shelling, a war correspondent\u2019s reflex. From a high window, we could see a dark plume of smoke, silhouetted against the sunset, rising over the southwestern neighborhoods, where rebels were trying to advance. Only the next morning did we realize that the eastern face of the hotel was checkered with boarded-up windows from years of shelling.My long absence from Aleppo meant I had missed a whole stage of its development: the restoration and gentrification of parts of the old city, the opening of boutique hotels, the flood of Turkish imports and foreign investment into what was Syria\u2019s industrial and commercial hub.That development push, in the first decade after Mr. Assad took over from his father in 2000, liberalized parts of Syria\u2019s economy and energized the tourism industry. But it also disproportionately benefited Mr. Assad\u2019s inner circle and the rich, fueling imbalances of wealth that helped spur the protests in 2011 that led to a security crackdown and civil war.We had arrived at a critical moment, as Russia said there was only one day left to pass through a corridor it had provided for people to escape eastern Aleppo before the rebel side was flattened, a corridor through which precious few had passed.The government says rebels are preventing civilians from leaving. Rebels refuse any evacuation without international supervision and a broader deal to deliver humanitarian aid.Instead, they are trying to break the siege, with Qaeda-linked groups and those backed by the United States working together \u2014 the opposite of what Russia has demanded.So anxiety was running high on both sides of Aleppo, with people in the west fleeing shelling and people in the east fearing airstrikes more devastating than any they had faced.This visit has been even more tightly orchestrated than usual. Journalists are always required to move around with a government-approved minder. This time, a dozen uniformed soldiers and several Ministry of Information employees have kept us to a tight schedule of planned stops, and refused to let us even walk briefly around the streets without an escort.On Thursday morning, we passed rows of small kiosks selling cigarettes, snacks and other goods. Some kiosks were painted with the Syrian flag; a few were roofed with tarps from the United Nations refugee agency. Families of fallen soldiers and merchants displaced from the old market are granted permits to operate the kiosks as a kind of compensation from a cash-strapped government.A group of factory owners met us at the chamber of commerce, where a picture of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is used as a doormat. They blame him for backing rebel groups that looted factories and sent their machinery to Turkey.We toured the Layramoon industrial district, recaptured from rebels over the summer. Buildings lay pancaked by airstrikes, and stripped of their marble cladding and copper wiring by looters. Soldiers led us down a crumbling staircase to windowless underground rooms that they said had been used as prisons by a rebel group called Division 16.Next stop was a part of the old souk recaptured early in the war, now plastered with posters of Mr. Assad, his father and Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Shiite Lebanese militia that has provided crucial assistance to government forces.We climbed over piles of rubble to reach the Mameluke-era Khan al-Wazir, its vaulted ceilings and cubbylike shops burned and blackened with soot. We peered over a barricade at the walls of the citadel and the pile of rubble that was once the Carlton Hotel, destroyed by rebels with a massive tunnel bomb.\u201cModerate rebels\u201d was a sarcastic refrain we heard often, making fun of the Obama administration\u2019s description of groups it backs; the Syrian government calls them terrorists.At Al Razi hospital, where Ahmed Noor Battal, the newly orphaned 14-year-old, was weeping, we arrived to panic and chaos. One woman wailed and collapsed in the arms of a nurse, who struggled to keep his bloodstained hands off the back of her white sweater.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he died! Don\u2019t!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cI only have this one son.\u201d\u201cHe will survive,\u201d the nurse said, but his eyes said something different. Minutes later, the son, Hazem Sharifa, 26, a doctor, lay dead on a stretcher.Outside, Itidal Shehadeh sat slumped on the sidewalk near the morgue, whimpering. Her husband, Mohammad Ayman Shehadeh, a security guard at the transportation department, had been hit by a shell while parking his car.\u201cI saw my father dying from the balcony,\u201d said his son Adel, 13, crying and trembling. \u201cI saw the mortar landing and smoke coming from my father\u2019s car.\u201dAnother relative shouted at the soldiers, demanding that the army take tougher action. He had been displaced by rebels three times, he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s time to end it.\u201dBut the next morning, the corridors set aside for people to leave eastern Aleppo were empty and silent. Soldiers there said they did not expect the evacuation deal to work.\u201cIt should be finished by bombing,\u201d one said.At one crossing point, Syrian soldiers, and a few Russians, waited at a checkpoint decorated with posters of Mr. Assad. Judges stood by to determine whether evacuees were wanted by security forces.Two shells landed, one less than 100 meters away. Soldiers blamed rebels trying to stop the evacuation; rebel groups denied it. At any rate, the crossing was closed. A senior military official said simply, \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dAn article on Nov. 5 about the chaos of war in the government-held side of Aleppo, Syria \u2014 held out by President Bashar al-Assad as safer than the rebel-held side \u2014 misstated the surname of name of a man who died at Al Razi hospital in Aleppo while his mother wailed. He was Hazem Sharifa, not Sherif.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is Lost by Burying the Trans-Pacific Partnership?", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional leaders confirmed this week what seemed inevitable with the triumph of Donald J. Trump: The far-reaching trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim nations that President Obama hoped to leave as a major legacy, but which Mr. Trump called \u201ca terrible deal,\u201d is dead.Yet there is little likelihood of Mr. Trump seeking a new agreement. That reflects not only his campaign statements, but also his yearslong hostility to past trade accords as well as the sheer difficulty of renegotiating a Pacific pact that was seven years in the making, entailing compromises among a dozen countries including Australia, Canada, Chile and Japan, but excluding China.Another broad trade deal still being negotiated, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between Europe and the United States, is a likely casualty of the Trump election and a global backlash against trade. The discussions \u201care dead, and I think everybody knows it,\u201d Matthias Fekl, the French secretary of state for trade, said Friday as trade ministers met in Brussels. \u201cGlobalization has created lots of losers, lots of difficulties.\u201dBut the Trans-Pacific Partnership, painstakingly negotiated but little understood, will be buried with few in either party to mourn it. It was hailed by its negotiators as the most sophisticated such deal ever, establishing the rules of commerce that would rope both sides of the Pacific together into a 21st-century economy, while cementing the United States\u2019 alliance with Asia.Which raises the question: What would be lost by abandoning it, for the nation and for specific industries from Hollywood to America\u2019s ranches and farmlands?Its specifics were mostly ignored in the political attacks from both parties. Instead, for many voters the Pacific agreement was simply a lightning rod for their broader discontent with stagnant wages and job losses blamed on globalization and past trade agreements. The other parties to the agreement are Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.\u201cPopular understanding of the T.P.P. is very low,\u201d Kevin G. Nealer, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a postelection analysis on Thursday. With its abandonment, he added, \u201cThe risk to America\u2019s role as trade policy leader \u2014 and therefore to the global economy \u2014 is real and immediate.\u201dMr. Obama and his team likewise emphasized the potential geopolitical blow, even as they promoted the economic benefits the trade agreement would offer American exporters by eliminating thousands of tariffs and other trade restrictions in the other countries.That tension could well be evident later this month, when Mr. Obama and his trade representative, Michael B. Froman, attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.The Americans will have to explain their failure on the trade agreement to foreign leaders gathered in Lima, Peru, while China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is there seeking progress toward an emerging alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, known as R.C.E.P., which includes China, Japan and 14 other Asian countries but excludes the United States.\u201cIn the absence of T.P.P., countries have already made it clear that they will move forward in negotiating their own trade agreements that exclude the United States,\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers wrote days before the election. \u201cThese agreements would improve market access and trading opportunities for member countries while U.S. businesses would continue to face existing trade barriers.\u201dOne example is a bilateral agreement between Australia and Japan, which gives Australian beef exporters a price advantage over American producers whose exports are subject to higher Japanese tariffs; those tariffs would ultimately have been removed under the Pacific agreement.\u201cWe are experiencing lost sales without T.P.P.\u201d of about $400,000 a day as a result, said Kevin Kester, a California cattle rancher and vice president of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.\u201cMultiply that over several hundred more products and several dozen more free-trade relationships,\u201d Mr. Froman said in an interview.The T.P.P. would have phased out some 18,000 tariffs that the other 11 countries have on imports from the United States, thus reducing their cost to foreign buyers. Beyond such typical trade actions, it also would have established a number of precedents for international trade rules dealing with digital commerce, intellectual property rights, human rights and environmental protection.A number of countries had agreed to copyright protections, benefiting sectors like the film industry. The agreement would have assured an open internet among the 12 nations, including in Communist-run Vietnam, encouraging digital trade and serving as a contrast to China\u2019s walls to internet traffic.For the first time in a trade agreement, state-owned businesses like those in Vietnam and Malaysia would have had to comply with commercial trade rules and labor and environmental standards. The agreement would have committed all parties to the International Labor Organization\u2019s principles prohibiting child labor, forced labor and excessive hours, and requiring collective bargaining, a minimum wage and safe workplaces.While unions and human rights groups remained skeptical about enforcement, the United States reached separate agreements with Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam in which the three countries committed to specific labor changes, under penalty of the United States\u2019 restoring tariffs for noncompliance. Those side agreements will fall along with the overall trade pact.The Obama administration \u2014 pressed by nearly every other nation, the generic drug industry and nonprofit health groups like Doctors Without Borders, all of which wanted quicker access to affordable lifesaving drugs \u2014 had agreed that drugmakers could keep production data secret for five to eight years, fewer than the 12 years in federal law. Mr. Hatch had demanded 12 years. But administration officials were hindered in how far they could go to appease Republicans given strong opposition in other countries to any change.Without the trade agreement, however, drug companies have no monopoly protections for biologics data in some countries.Democrats, organized labor and the Ford Motor Company were especially opposed to the trade agreement because it did not include what they considered enforceable protections against other countries\u2019 manipulation of their currency\u2019s value to gain price advantages for their products. The pact did have a side agreement that, in another first for trade accords, included the parties\u2019 \u201cjoint declaration\u201d against currency manipulation, required them to report interventions in exchange markets and set annual meetings to discuss any disputes.Another innovation in the T.P.P. was provisions to help small businesses, which lack the resources of big corporations, to navigate export rules, trade barriers and red tape.The administration, however, countered that the trade agreement actually reformed the so-called Investor-State Dispute Settlement tribunals, which are a longstanding feature of trade policy. It called for changes responding to criticisms that the tribunals favor corporations and interfere with nations\u2019 efforts to protect public health and safety.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Earnings Show It Again Defying China\u2019s Slowdown", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Amid concerns about a slowdown in the growth of the Chinese economy, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company is showing that \u2014 for now \u2014 business on its platforms is holding steady.Alibaba Group said on Wednesday that its revenue grew strongly in the three months through the end of September, as the myriad brands and small-time vendors on its online shopping sites kept spending heavily on advertising. Although Chinese economic growth has slowed, more shoppers are also turning to Alibaba sites while abandoning physical retail outlets like malls.Alibaba said its sales rose 55 percent to $5.14 billion in its second quarter from the same period a year earlier. Net profit dropped 69 percent from a year ago, to $1.06 billion, because of a one-time accounting gain that had raised last year\u2019s bottom line.While the company has been mostly immune to China\u2019s slowing growth \u2014 gross domestic product expanded 6.7 percent in the past three quarters, down from 6.9 percent for all of 2015 \u2014 the value of goods sold on Alibaba\u2019s online platforms had begun to plateau. While it has a strong hold on the online market for China\u2019s middle-class shoppers, almost all of them already own a smartphone, so growth through new customers is harder to achieve.To compensate for slowing sales growth on its platforms, Alibaba \u2014 which makes money on advertising and fees paid by the vendors that set up virtual stores on its platforms \u2014 has been doing more to improve targeting of advertisements. It is also seeking to bring in new international brands that pay a fee to sell on its platforms.Given the slowdown, analysts have focused more on other businesses that Alibaba has been building up in recent years. But those businesses, like cloud computing and digital entertainment, all posted losses during the quarter. As Alibaba\u2019s profit margins shrink, investors will put more pressure on the company to extract profit from its newer business.During a conference call with analysts, Joseph Tsai, the company\u2019s executive vice chairman, said that its cloud computing and digital entertainment units were \u201ccoming into their own in terms of scale.\u201d Still, he warned that the company viewed its investments in new businesses as projects that may not yield profit for the next five to 10 years.Many have particularly focused on Alibaba\u2019s cloud services which, much like Amazon Web Services, provide easy-to-use, back-end computing power for a wide range of companies.Revenue from the cloud service more than doubled from a year earlier, to $224 million in the most recent quarter, but posted a $60 million operating loss. Alibaba said it had added 74,000 subscribers to the service over the quarter, raising its total paying users to 651,000. Analysts have predicted that the business could begin producing profit for Alibaba in the coming few years.\u201cAlibaba has gone beyond the position of an e-commerce play,\u201d said Jessie Guo, an analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank, citing its cloud computing and logistics arms as well as its electronic payments affiliate, Ant Financial. \u201cWe see it as an ecosystem. That means its model is going to be more sophisticated.\u201dA new spate of public listings by Chinese logistics firms could help Alibaba, Shi Jialong, a technology analyst at Nomura, wrote in a recent note to clients. These firms, which deliver goods ordered online to customers, have risen on the back of Alibaba\u2019s success, and they could use proceeds from those share sales to expand their networks and enhance delivery capabilities, \u201cwhich eventually would help improve the quality of services for Alibaba\u2019s customers,\u201d Mr. Shi wrote.Alibaba\u2019s logistics unit is part of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company\u2019s accounting. In part because of that investigation, short-seller interest in the company has risen near peak levels in recent days, according to data from Bloomberg. Alibaba has said it is cooperating with the inquiry and has begun to disclose more information about those operations to investors.For many, earnings are simply a prelude to Singles Day, an intense shopping holiday on Nov. 11 engineered in part by Alibaba, in which the company\u2019s vendors offer major discounts. Growth in sales on the day of the event has slowed, and Alibaba is pulling out all the stops this year, featuring a slew of entertainment features including a concert by the American pop star Katy Perry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Drug Kickback Charges, Unqualified Princelings, Tesla-SolarCity Vote", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byAs questions about Valeant Pharmaceuticals International\u2019s business practices have mounted over the past year, its relationship with the mail-order pharmacy Philidor Rx Services has come under the most scrutiny.The Justice Department charged both men with multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy. The arrests are the first charges in multiple state and federal investigations into Valeant\u2019s business practices.According to the complaint, filed Wednesday in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, Mr. Davenport, who pocketed about $40 million after the purchase option agreement went through, used a series of shell companies to transfer a $10 million kickback payment to Mr. Tanner.Mr. Tanner was forced out of Valeant in 2015. Mr. Davenport remained at Philidor until the company shut down in January. Both men said through their lawyers that they intended to defend themselves.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a news conference on Thursday that the investigation was continuing. He would not say whether his office was looking into Valeant\u2019s accounting practices.In a statement, Valeant noted that the company and its top executives had not been charged in the case, and said it was cooperating with the investigation.The authorities\u2019 investigation revealed that as JPMorgan was competing with other big banks for business in China, some bankers concluded that they needed to bring on the children of well-connected parents, known as princelings.\u201cWe lost a deal to DB today because they got chairman\u2019s daughter work for them this summer,\u201d one JPMorgan investment banking executive told colleagues, referring to Deutsche Bank.Many of the job candidates were unqualified, the authorities said, but JPMorgan hired them anyway. For example:\u2022 The son of a powerful executive who had a Wharton degree was described as having a \u201cnot very impressive, poor G.P.A.\u201d and had both an \u201cattitude issue\u201d and a \u201cnapping problem.\u201d\u2022 The son of a Chinese official who did \u201cvery, very poorly\u201d in his interviews still secured a position in New York only to be transferred again. A JPMorgan banker later said that the hire \u201csent out an e-mail (which he inadvertently copied to an H.R. person), where he made some inappropriate sexual remarks.\u201d His peers said he was \u201cimmature, irresponsible and unreliable,\u201d but he kept his job.Tesla said more than 85 percent of its independent shareholders voted for the deal.Under the terms of the transaction, SolarCity shareholders will receive 0.11 of a Tesla share for each share of SolarCity that they own. At Thursday\u2019s closing prices, that offer is worth about $20.75 a share, or just shy of where SolarCity shares closed.Critics have argued that the deal would weigh down Tesla financially. Shares of Tesla have fallen about 14 percent since the company first disclosed its intentions.In after-hours trading on Thursday, shares of Tesla were little changed. Shares of SolarCity rose nearly 2 percent in after-hours trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Waning Competition Deepens Labor\u2019s Plight", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe Communications Workers of America union has learned to appreciate corporate consolidation.The Communications Workers\u2019 leadership is now mulling over whether to support the proposition \u2014 a spokeswoman said the union was evaluating the merger, but she would not comment further. This time the union might want to change its tune.The latest deal may pass muster when viewed in isolation. But collectively, mergers at this scale are reconfiguring the American economy in ways that seem to be tilting the scales toward the interests of ever-larger corporations, to the broad detriment of labor.As Senator John Sherman, the principal author of the nation\u2019s core antimonopoly law, put it more than a century ago, a monopoly \u201ccommands the price of labor without fear of strikes, for in its field it allows no competitors.\u201dStumped by an economy where wages have gotten stuck for all but the most highly educated, where too many men in their prime working years struggle to stay in the job market, and where women\u2019s long march into the work force has stalled, some economists are turning their attention anew to the role that diminishing competition might have in causing workers\u2019 plight.\u201cI think it is an underappreciated part of the problem,\u201d said Jason Furman, President Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser.Competition policy can no longer be understood in the narrow terms of protecting consumers from higher prices.Three years ago, the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz proposed that increasing profits from companies managing to avoid normal competitive forces \u2014 what economists refer to as \u201crents\u201d \u2014 appeared to be an important factor in the rising share of the nation\u2019s income flowing toward corporate profits and top executive pay in recent years. He surmised that weak labor unions \u2014 which represent barely over 7 percent of workers in the private sector \u2014 did not have the clout to protect the workers\u2019 share.In a competitive market, companies will vie with their rivals to hire the best workers, lifting wages up to workers\u2019 \u201cmarginal product,\u201d the last cent where their employers could still turn a profit. As productivity grows, wages will be bid up further. Prosperity will spread. But when there are few or no rivals in a labor market, employers will pay much less.This kind of power doesn\u2019t even require employers to hold absolute monopolies. Employers can collude more easily when there are few competitors. They can more easily impose tough contractual restrictions that make it tough for workers to shop for better jobs.Competition in product markets does not necessarily translate to competition in the labor market \u2014 an exporter that sells into global markets but hires domestically may experience a lot of the former yet little of the latter.Waning competition in employment can muck up the economy in more ways than one. It slows wage growth, of course. Lacking outside options, workers are much less likely to leave a job. But economic output and employment will suffer, too, because fewer workers will be willing to work for the lower wage.Not everybody agrees that a lack of competition is having a big impact on the job market. \u201cThere is evidence of market power,\u201d acknowledged Michael Strain, a moderate conservative at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. But \u201cpending further research, my current view is that big macroeconomic forces like technological change and globalization are significantly more important.\u201dThe main reason for falling wages and declining employment is simply that demand for less-skilled work is falling.Policy makers can push back against employers\u2019 market power. Strengthening labor unions, of course, would give workers more leverage against dominant employers. Raising the minimum wage would provide a higher wage floor. But it seems there is an opportunity to rethink the nation\u2019s approach to antitrust law, too. It should not be seen exclusively as a tool to protect consumers from sticker shock.Antitrust enforcement efforts, Ms. Hesse said, \u201calso benefit workers, whose wages won\u2019t be driven down by dominant employers with the power to dictate terms of employment.\u201dChristopher Shelton is the president of the Communications Workers of America.

{"Headline": "The PG-13 Reporters Covering an R-Rated Election", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byA few weeks ago, Erik Weibel was at a Bernie Sanders rally for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania when he was accosted by a group of young supporters of Donald J. Trump. The boys surrounded him, jeering and chanting, \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d One made a crude comment about Mrs. Clinton.\u201cThey were being really obnoxious, getting right up in my face and shouting things, and I didn\u2019t know how to react,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom stepped in and helped.\u201dIt was just one of the potential pitfalls of being a young campaign reporter during one of the most contentious, polarizing and occasionally perilous elections in history.Erik is 14, a ninth grader from Benton, Pa. He has been closely tracking the presidential race as a reporter for the children\u2019s book publisher Scholastic, which has dispatched 35 children, ages 10 to 14, to the campaign trail.Covering the primary campaigns and general election in Pennsylvania, Erik has witnessed tense encounters between Trump supporters and protesters, heard raw and offensive language from angry crowds and occasionally felt the animosity directed toward the news media. He has had to tiptoe around contentious subjects in his articles, omitting the graphic details of the allegations of unwanted advances on women against Mr. Trump and the obscene language in the leaked tape from \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d in which the Republican presidential candidate bragged about his treatment of women.\u201cI told the truth, told what happened, but also glazed over some of the details that are not appropriate for the age group I was writing for,\u201d Erik said.Scholastic has been providing child-friendly election coverage to teachers and classrooms for nearly a century, starting with the 1924 race between Calvin Coolidge and John W. Davis. It introduced its children\u2019s press corps program in 2000, and for the last five presidential elections, Scholastic has sent precocious young political reporters to cover rallies, debates and stump speeches around the country.Many of the young reporters say it is exhilarating to witness history unfolding before their eyes. But this election has presented challenges, as the race has devolved into one of the most vicious in the nation\u2019s history.Even the most grizzled, jaded campaign veterans have been shocked by the barrage of insults and controversies that have defined this year\u2019s race.\u201cThis election does stand out just for the level of nastiness all around,\u201d said Elliott Rebhun, the editor in chief of Scholastic Classroom Magazines. \u201cIt\u2019s been really tricky.\u201dFor the Scholastic news corps, covering the presidential campaign has at times been an eye-opening initiation into the uglier side of politics.\u201cIt was tense,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a little nervous, but I did feel safe because I was in the press area, and my parents were with me.\u201dOther young reporters have wrestled with how to address reports about allegations of unwanted advances against Mr. Trump, a subject that has scandalized adults.Esther Appelstein, 12, from St. Louis, covered the second debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump at Washington University, which took place just days after the release of the leaked \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording. Wearing a press badge and a red polo shirt that said Scholastic News Kids Press Corps, Esther interviewed Trump and Clinton supporters at a debate viewing party. The atmosphere grew tense as the candidates sparred over Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about women, and Mr. Trump brought up Bill Clinton\u2019s history with women.\u201cI didn\u2019t really elaborate too much on that video because it might be inappropriate for kids to hear about, and I don\u2019t want to create any controversy among the teachers and students,\u201d she said.Esther\u2019s mother, Callie Appelstein, said it had been especially hard this year to indulge her daughter\u2019s curiosity about the election.\u201cShe had heard about the video, the video, the video,\u201d Ms. Appelstein said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Mom, what\u2019s the video?\u2019\u201dMs. Appelstein told her daughter that Mr. Trump had made \u201csexually inappropriate\u201d remarks about women, and left it at that. \u201cI want to be honest with her and tell her what\u2019s happening, but I also don\u2019t want to freak her out,\u201d she said.Of course, there have been uplifting and inspiring moments, too. Several reporters for Scholastic have been able to interview the candidates and mingle with professional reporters at campaign events. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m really becoming part of history, and this is such an unusual election,\u201d Esther said.Kaitlin Clark, 12, from North Woodstock, N.H., has been obsessed with presidential history and politics since she was 6. That year, her father took her to Disney World and they visited the Hall of Presidents. \u201cI asked where all the girls were,\u201d said Kaitlin, who wants to be a lawyer or the president of the United States when she grows up.When her social studies teacher suggested that she apply to the Scholastic program, Kaitlin jumped at the opportunity. She has reported on the primary contests, a Republican town hall meeting, a Trump rally and two Clinton events. She was able to ask Mrs. Clinton a question \u2014 and a follow-up question \u2014 about the economy.\u201cOne of them said, \u2018Prepare to be booed,\u2019\u201d Kaitlin said. \u201cYou could feel that the crowd didn\u2019t really want us there.\u201dErik Weibel said he was disappointed at first when he was denied press credentials to cover a recent rally in Pennsylvania for Mr. Trump. He put on his Scholastic shirt and badge and went to the rally anyway to interview supporters and report on the candidate\u2019s speech.\u201cAt one point at the rally, he made fun of the press, and the crowd, they were booing and going along with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was kind of glad I was not in the media section right then.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Analysts, particularly in the financial markets, worry that an attempt to appease the pro-Brexit wing of her governing Conservative Party by focusing on restricting immigration could leave Britain without tariff-free access to the European Union.Other factors are also complicating things for Mr. O\u2019Connor and his team, who manage 4.7 billion pounds, or about $5.75 billion, across multiple types of assets: stocks, bonds and other investments.With interest rates at or near historic lows, central banks like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have few options left, when it comes to monetary policy, to try to support economies across the region.And years of those near-zero rates combined with quantitative easing \u2014 when central banks effectively print money to buy bonds, hoping to push other investors into riskier assets and bolster economic growth \u2014 have also left bond yields at multidecade lows.For traditional investors, driven by a rule of thumb that 60 percent of an investment portfolio should be in stocks and the remainder largely in bonds to offset those risks, such guidelines no longer seem to apply.Government bonds, Mr. O\u2019Connor said, \u201cdon\u2019t have the role that they once had.\u201dSo where do investors put their money?In his view, with the relative safety of Western economies in question, emerging markets have appeal.\u201cThe political risk in emerging markets is diminishing quietly, while it\u2019s picking up in the major markets,\u201d he said.Stocks in developing countries and emerging markets, he continued, have \u201ca really important role in portfolios.\u201d\u201cI think a world where we get a bit more macro momentum, a world where you have slightly higher inflation, a world where commodities continue to steady or grind higher is quite a constructive one for emerging markets.\u201dFlipping through a PowerPoint presentation, Mr. O\u2019Connor pointed to indicators suggesting it was now a good time to increase investments in emerging markets, given the differences in growth rates among developed and emerging markets, and the relative returns for equities in developing countries.\u201cIt\u2019s time to rebuild some exposure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Has Room for the Dreamers", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byWhat\u2019s at StakeIn a saner time, in a country whose politics were less poisoned, there would be no talk of punishing young immigrants like Sofia De La Vega, Luis Roberto Ursua Briceno and Anayancy Ramos. No one would be threatening to derail their ambitions, stifle their educations, throttle their dreams.But this is the country we live in, with a president-elect who may be preparing to do that, and perhaps worse. When Donald Trump takes office in January, he will have the power to upend the lives of more than 700,000 young people who have grown up in the United States after being brought here illegally as children. And he has said many times that this is exactly what he will do.Should Mr. Trump decide to send a deportation force after them, they could end up being expelled from the only country they know. It would be a relatively simple task: The Department of Homeland Security already has their names, addresses and other personal information and their written acknowledgment that they are living in the country without permission.DACA was never a form of legalization, which only Congress can grant. It was not an executive order. It was a decision by Homeland Security, at Mr. Obama\u2019s direction, to make dangerous criminals and security threats the main priority and to grant this group of young immigrants \u2014 who are culturally Americans, citizens in all but the paperwork \u2014 a reprieve from deportation, renewable after two years. This program is entirely revocable, and revoking it immediately is what Mr. Trump has promised.\u201cWhen I first heard President Obama\u2019s speech on DACA years ago, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Ms. De La Vega wrote. \u201cDACA granted me everything to live a normal life and, for once, belong. It was temporary, but it felt real.\u201d She is pursing an associate\u2019s degree to become a paramedic. \u201cI have a brother that drowned when I was younger. In my home country, you can forget that police and ambulance will arrive or even bother to come if you call. My only hope is to save as many lives as I can, and to die risking my life for another.\u201dThe decision to expand the opportunities of Ms. De La Vega and the others should be obvious. There are 11 million immigrants living here outside the law, a vast majority of them strivers, like these Dreamers. Congress has tried for years to fix the outdated laws that block their paths to legal status, but bipartisan bills have been killed time and again in Congress by mostly Republican opposition.Lacking real immigration reform, DACA is one way to honor a vision of the country, and of the positive contributions of immigrants, that has been badly degraded in this grotesque election year. The program should be continued, as a down payment on the American future. Ending it would be a dreadfully shortsighted, self-harming way to start a presidency.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Asia, a Target of Trump\u2019s Criticism, Greets His Election With Caution", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 For more than half a century, Asia has benefited from an American commitment to free trade and bilateral alliances in the region. But the election of Donald J. Trump left both statesmen and citizens here asking whether that commitment \u2014 and the prolonged era of peace and prosperity that has accompanied it \u2014 might be coming to an end.Even before he began his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Trump was known as a critic of policies that opened markets in the United States to lower-cost Asian goods and helped fuel the dizzying growth that transformed Japan, gave rise to the dynamic economies known as the four Asian tigers, and propelled China\u2019s emergence as a global power.But during his campaign, Mr. Trump made a drumbeat of his criticism, accusing several nations here of currency manipulation and threatening a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports. He also added a geopolitical dimension by suggesting the United States might withdraw its security guarantees to Japan and South Korea unless they agreed to pay more of the cost of defending them.Now, the question in Asia is how much of that rhetoric Mr. Trump will act on.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, sent a conciliatory message of congratulations to Mr. Trump that made no mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to confront Beijing on trade and currency issues. \u201cDeveloping long-term healthy and stable Sino-U.S. relations is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is also the shared hope of the international community,\u201d Mr. Xi said.But a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, offered a cautious rebuttal of Mr. Trump\u2019s views on trade between China and the United States, arguing that trade had \u201cbenefited the people on both sides, including the American people, and has increased employment, rather than the opposite.\u201dSome economic advisers to the Chinese government were skeptical that Mr. Trump would follow through with drastic action that could prompt a trade war. After all, they said, American presidential candidates have been promising to get tough on Chinese trade policies for more than two decades and have invariably backed off after taking office.\u201cNobody takes the electioneering that seriously,\u201d said Andrew Sheng, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission who advises the Chinese government on financial policy. \u201cPeople accept that the American consumers benefit so much from trade that it won\u2019t change that much.\u201dYu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, also had doubts. \u201cAll the things he said during the election were the talk of an amateur \u2014 I don\u2019t think he was in earnest,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter he becomes president, there\u2019ll be advisers at his side to explain to him what the exchange rate is, what capital flows are, what macroeconomic policy is.\u201dBut if there was disbelief that Mr. Trump would follow through on his trade threats, there was also unease that his election could portend a retreat by the United States from the region that could embolden China, force Japan and South Korea to consider alternatives to the American nuclear umbrella and unleash long-suppressed tensions.\u201cMaybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,\u201d said Shin Kawashima, a professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. \u201cBut if he carries out such a policy, China will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against Trump\u2019s policies. It is a little difficult for Trump to just change all the old policies.\u201dIn Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated Mr. Trump and sought to remind him of Washington\u2019s special relationship with his nation. \u201cJapan and the United States are unwavering allies tied firmly with the bond of universal values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law,\u201d he said.And some in Japan expressed hope that Mr. Trump might prove milder in office than he was on the campaign trail.\u201cOnce he becomes the president, he will change, I think,\u201d said Katsuhito Momii, 73, chairman of NHK, the public broadcasting service. \u201cReagan became a great president, so no matter what he said before the election, I think he will change.\u201dSome analysts said they feared that Mr. Trump\u2019s America First vision would embolden Japan\u2019s own right-wing nationalists, who push a revisionist history that denies the Japanese military committed atrocities during World War II. Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo, said that China and South Korea, victims of Japan\u2019s wartime aggression, would object to any resurgence of Japan\u2019s right wing and that this would increase tensions in East Asia.\u201cNorth Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond\u201d to its provocations, a government spokesman, Jeong Joon-hee, warned, adding that the South remained unshakable in its belief that it should maintain a strong military alliance with the United States.Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader and leading contender for the presidency in the election next year, also reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance \u201cno matter who becomes president there.\u201dCheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in Seongnam, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory could \u201copen the way for South Korea to go nuclear\u201d with Washington\u2019s consent to protect itself from the North.The prospect of a nuclear arms race in Asia would certainly unsettle China. But analysts said that was one of many troubling issues that the Communist government could be forced to confront under a Trump presidency.\u201cA weakened and disorganized West like this will surely bring many more additional strategic opportunities for China, which would be even less prudent in its foreign policy, as it has been since 2013,\u201d Mr. Shi said.\u201cThese changes will make it more difficult for China\u2019s economy,\u201d he said, \u201cin a time when it is already facing difficulties at home.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing, Motoko Rich from Tokyo and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

Despite what felt like an excruciatingly long wait \u2014 during which Ms. Newman even delayed by sipping water \u2014 the painting attracted only a single bid.That was from a buyer who had agreed before the auction to guarantee the sale.\u201cI was surprised by that,\u201d Morgan Long, senior director at the Fine Art Group in London, said. \u201cIt was a good picture.\u201dConventional wisdom says that sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach in light of tumultuous world events.\u201cThe sales are thinner,\u201d said James Roundell, the director of Impressionist and Modern art at Dickinson, an art advisory based in London and New York. \u201cPeople have wondered, \u2018Do I sell now, or wait?\u2019 There was an argument for waiting.\u201dStill, Ms. Newman said after the auction that the final price of $54.5 million with fees was \u201cstill the second-highest price for a Munch ever achieved at auction.\u201d She also said \u201cit was a lively room,\u201d though none of the evening\u2019s three big-ticket works with third-party guarantees appeared to attract an external bid.Art auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.Many collectors and dealers deemed the sale solid; the low bids, they said, were more about the quality of works for sale, rather than the state of the world.\u201cNot a single one of my clients has held back because of the election,\u201d Mary Hoeveler, a New York art adviser, said. \u201cBut there is a supply issue. We\u2019ve seen this over the last couple of years. So much of this auction was day-sale quality,\u201d she said, referring to day sales\u2019 less desirable offerings.One of the few lots that generated competition was an early minimalist 1923 painting by the Bauhaus artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, which went for an auction high of $6.1 million on an estimate of $3 million to $4 million. The buyer: Mathias Rastorfer of the Galerie Gmurzynska, who had sold the work to the seller in 1987.\u201cIt was a very good buy, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a work of that importance,\u201d Mr. Rastorfer said after the sale.The Munch, the most high-valued auction lot of the week, was consigned by a collector who had bought the painting for $30.8 million at Sotheby\u2019s in 2008. The composition, showing a gaggle of young girls chatting beside the sinister reflection of a tree, is one of the Norwegian artist\u2019s most celebrated Symbolist subjects. It is one of the earliest of Munch\u2019s 12 known paintings of the subject and is one of just two left in private hands.Sotheby\u2019s also had third-party guarantees for Pablo Picasso\u2019s 1963 painting \u201cLe Peintre et Son Mod\u00e8le,\u201d estimated at $12 million to $18 million, and Vincent van Gogh\u2019s 1886 flower still life, \u201cNature Morte: Vase aux Gla\u00efeuls,\u201d at $5 million to $7 million. The typical late-period Picasso, formerly owned by the New York collector Joan Oestreich Kend, who died in April, sold for $12.9 million to the guarantor. Van Gogh\u2019s darker study of gladioli, painted in Paris before his move to Provence, raised $5.9 million.The opacity of Sotheby\u2019s third-party arrangements has been criticized by the art trade for hiding the true sales prices.Some of this may become a little clearer. New York City\u2019s Consumer Affairs Department recommended in September that the auction houses publish net prices for works that have been backed by external finance. For example, the $54.5 million for the Munch was a net price that reflected a \u201cfixed fee\u201d of about $2 million paid by Sotheby\u2019s to the third-party guarantor.An article on Nov. 15 about an auction of Impressionist and Modern art at Sotheby\u2019s in Manhattan, using information from the auction house, erroneously attributed a distinction to the auctioneer, Helena Newman. Sotheby\u2019s now says that Lorna Kelly, who came to Sotheby\u2019s in the 1970s, was the first female auctioneer to lead an evening sale in New York, not Ms. Newman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Island Village Votes to Disband 6 Years After Incorporating", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byBut now, after an experiment in municipal governance that spawned political infighting, fear of rising taxes and lagging services, residents have voted to abolish the village.\u201cIt sounded good, but ultimately the village government wasn\u2019t working,\u201d said Harry Janssen, an airline mechanic who grew up here and voted on Nov. 16 to disband.Proponents of the village government six years ago had pledged that the 13,000 residents would receive better services, especially in the area of code enforcement, and would pay no additional tax, since the town taxes would fall as village taxes rose. But critics, including the current village mayor, Maura Spery, said residents were sold a bill of goods.\u201cThe village was created on the lie that it would be tax-neutral,\u201d Ms. Spery said in an interview in her cramped office this week. \u201cBrookhaven has the advantage of economies of scale in carrying out services.\u201dLast spring, Ms. Spery proposed a $4.7 million budget that would have raised taxes by 125 percent, resulting in an annual increase of $250 to $300 per household. Instead, she said, the village board rejected the plan, passing a $3.8 million budget that involved layoffs and cuts in services.\u201cA village can be a very effective form of government, but it costs more than being an unincorporated hamlet within the town,\u201d said Ms. Spery, who remained publicly neutral on the issue of dissolving the village.The results of the referendum were somewhat lopsided, with 1,922 residents voting to eliminate the village and 1,215 to keep it. The Town of Brookhaven, which had been widely criticized for ignoring Mastic Beach\u2019s illegal rentals and quality-of-life issues, has promised to work with the village government on the transition of power.Rather than gloat, the town supervisor, Edward P. Romaine, said in a statement that he and other town officials would soon meet with the village board to start transferring responsibility, a process that could take up to two years.\u201cDuring that time, the town will reach out to the residents and community leaders to address their concerns and put together a plan to improve the community of Mastic Beach,\u201d Mr. Romaine said.Some residents expressed mixed feelings about giving up local control, pointing out that the village government had cracked down on unkempt properties. \u201cThe village was good in a lot of ways,\u201d said Angela Nuccio, the owner of John\u2019s Pizzeria, located in the small business district along Neighborhood Road here. \u201cBut people got scared about the taxes.\u201dMrs. Nuccio, who has lived in Mastic Beach for 43 years, did not reveal her position on the referendum. \u201cPeople would be in here yelling and screaming,\u201d she said, \u201cso I tried not to talk about it.\u201dHelen Lefkowitz, a 74-year-old retired home health aide, voted to disband the village but now has some trepidation about returning to Brookhaven. \u201cIt\u2019s an unnecessary layer of government,\u201d she said, referring to the village. \u201cBut I hope the town doesn\u2019t neglect us.\u201dDespite its proximity to the water and its million-dollar views, Mastic Beach has remained a modest community where people can still snap up a house for under $200,000. It was settled after World War II primarily by residents of Brooklyn, in particular working-class Italian-American families from the Bensonhurst neighborhood.There were pleas from both sides, with some, like Nicole Chakmakian, saying that she was willing to pay higher taxes in order to correct the blight that had crept over Mastic Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we remind ourselves why we created our village in the first place,\u201d Ms. Chakmakian posted. \u201cStated simply, it was formed for our survival, as the Town of Brookhaven was slowly destroying our home.\u201dSome residents in favor of abolishing the government criticized village cronyism and renegade operations. They cited the actions of a former village administrator who had conducted illegal background checks on nearly 500 residents.Mr. Janssen, the mechanic who voted to disband the village government, cited the illegal background checks as the final indignity. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were getting our money\u2019s worth,\u201d he said dryly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Made America Feel Great Again", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWhile I cannot verify its provenance, the following appears to be my Sunday column from Nov. 8, 2020, which slipped through a small rift in the space-time continuum while I was writing a panicked, \u201cIt\u2019s the Trump Apocalypse!\u201d column this week.I SHOULD have seen it coming.Throughout the 2016 election \u2014 remember those crazy times? \u2014 I tried to draw a distinction between Donald Trump\u2019s strategy and the man himself. In the primaries I thought that Trump\u2019s pitch to working-class voters, his breaks with Republican orthodoxy on economic and foreign policy, were often politically brilliant \u2026 but that Trump himself was too much of a loose cannon to actually win the party\u2019s nomination.When that assumption was proved wrong, I thought that Trump\u2019s general-election strategy of going hard after Rust Belt votes had the potential to split the Obama coalition \u2026 but that his obvious sexism and white-identity appeals would alienate women and drive minority turnout too high for him to win.Well, that was wrong, too. Which left me with my assumptions about a Trump administration: that in theory an ideologically-flexible president promising a national-interest-first foreign policy could be remarkably popular, but that in practice Trump would give us economic weakness, global instability, and domestic upheaval.Yet here we are four years later, watching Trump bask in the glow of an easy re-election over the Warren-Booker Democratic ticket. And given how successfully he defied expectations all through 2016, the path he\u2019s taken to this point probably shouldn\u2019t have come as such a surprise.Trump\u2019s Keynesianism was mostly defense spending and tax cuts, but it included a huge infrastructure push \u2014 soon nicknamed \u201cTrumpWorks\u201d \u2014 that doubled as a jobs program for his core constituency, blue-collar men. The assumption that the economy had hit full employment in the later Obama years proved to be an artifact of work-force dropouts and increasing illegal immigration. With TrumpWorks hiring, a wall rising (albeit haphazardly) on the southern border and millennials\u2019 entry into the housing market sparking a sudden construction boom, both wages and the work-force participation rate began to sharply climb.In return for letting those bills reach the floor, Paul Ryan was promised Trump\u2019s backing for an omnibus health care bill replacing Obamacare and reforming Medicare at once. But as health care negotiations dragged on across 2017, it became clear that Trump was quietly encouraging a tacit right-left grass-roots alliance against benefit cuts of any sort.This came to a head in what was dubbed \u201cthe Battle of Janesville,\u201d when Ryan found himself shouted down by a crowd of town hall seniors, some sporting \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps, as he tried to defend Medicare premium support. After that scene (which played over and over on Sean Hannity\u2019s nightly propaganda hour) Ryan\u2019s vision withered on the legislative vine \u2014 leaving Obamacare to limp on, its subsidies officially repealed but \u201ctemporarily\u201d extended every year.Other right-wing priorities have fared better, especially on energy and financial deregulation, and the Democrats have found some political footing attacking Trump\u2019s coziness with Wall Street. But overall he has afforded them fewer targets than they expected.Meanwhile his obvious lack of interest in social conservatism has enabled Trump to effectively decentralize the culture wars. His Supreme Court appointments (Mike Lee to fill the Scalia seat, Ted Cruz to replace a retiring Clarence Thomas) have simply kept the court\u2019s Obama-era balance intact; Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer keep taking their vitamins and declining to retire. There have been no nationalizing flash points, no equivalent of Bush\u2019s marriage amendment push or Obama\u2019s mandates on religious institutions; whenever transgender rights come up, Trump\u2019s press secretary, Jeffrey Lord, murmurs \u201cit\u2019s a state issue\u201d and moves on.Whether this boastfulness survives his second term is unclear. Terrorist recruitment has increased in regions affected by Trump\u2019s drone strikes; Putin, after a period of consolidation following the easing of sanctions, is working to destabilize Eastern Europe once more, and Xi Jinping is making forays in China\u2019s near-abroad. The collapse of the Iranian nuclear deal has Tehran marching toward a bomb; Israel and Saudi Arabia are lobbying Trump to strike Iran, but Putin may have his ear instead.On the home front, Trump has total control of the G.O.P. (Ryan having slipped into retirement) but no real program left: He\u2019s unwilling to cut spending and his signal second-term initiative, a Mars Shot headed by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, lacks an obvious political constituency. Democrats charge that the Trump boom is unsustainable, and soaring deficits and creeping inflation suggest they might be vindicated. White House attempts to strong-arm the press into ignoring the rampant corruption of TrumpWorks have been ugly without being particularly successful. The public still has a low opinion of Trump\u2019s ethics; they\u2019ve just been willing to forgive a lot because of a rising G.D.P.So his second term could still look like the disaster that I and so many others feared would arrive in his first one. But here in the fall of 2020, halfway through the Trump era, we also need to reckon with reality: By charting the same distinctive ideological course he followed in his strange political ascent, President Trump\u2019s campaign-trail boast \u2014 \u201cfolks, I made America great again\u201d \u2014 is one that a majority of Americans understandably believe.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump said it would not and argued instead for a protectionist approach, including big tariffs that could end up inciting a trade war.On Sunday, Mr. Obama again made the case that the trade agreement would be \u201ca plus for America\u2019s economy, for American jobs,\u201d and failure to sign on to it \u201cundermines our position across the region.\u201d The Pacific Rim leaders urged the signatories to move ahead with the deal.If done right, the pact could stimulate exports while helping to reduce environmental destruction and improve the lives of workers in countries like Brunei, Peru, Chile and Vietnam, which were part of the negotiation. For example, countries that signed the deal would have to adopt minimum wages, protect endangered species and agree not to discriminate against foreign businesses in the interest of domestic and state-owned firms.The agreement, known as TPP, was intended to play a strategic role in American diplomacy. It was the economic linchpin of Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to reaffirm the nation\u2019s role as a Pacific power and counter the rising influence of China, which was not part of the negotiations. Washington\u2019s abandonment of the pact is widely seen in the region as a blow to American prestige and an opening for China to negotiate trade rules, win friends among Asian nations and assert regional leadership.Some governments took serious political risks to forge the compromises needed for the TPP. For example, the pact would require Vietnam to recognize labor unions that are not affiliated with the ruling Communist Party.Nevertheless, Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, joined Mr. Trump in pillorying the deal as written. Mrs. Clinton proposed changes that would have strengthened it. But with Republicans set to control the White House and Congress, Mr. Obama abandoned plans to seek ratification from the lame-duck Congress.Without TPP, Mr. Obama\u2019s rebalance toward Asia is significantly diminished, and, if it continues at all, will be more dependent on expanded military cooperation. The shift has left friends in the region wondering about America\u2019s future role. Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Asia except to bash China on trade and currency issues and to raise doubts about the need to defend half-century alliances with Japan and South Korea. Some American experts expect him to take a more detached approach to the region, essentially ceding the space to Beijing.There are signs that China will take full advantage of the American shift to press its own trade vision. The Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a rival pact that excludes Washington, is already getting new attention, including from leaders in Peru and Malaysia who signed TPP and now plan to focus on trade negotiations with China.Advertisement"}

Here in North Carolina, Donald J. Trump \u2014 the religiously indifferent, penthouse-dwelling germophobe \u2014 somehow emerged as the victorious defender of the pig farmer and the country church. Meanwhile, our state Republicans spent huge amounts of time stoking fear, not about the sluggish economy or the deteriorating state of public education, but about the grave dangers of open access to public bathrooms.The narrative that grew up around H.B. 2 \u2014 officially, the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act \u2014 turned town against country by persuading both that one\u2019s idea of common sense is the other\u2019s worst nightmare. It stymied the long-running efforts of activists to persuade rural whites to join a progressive interracial coalition.The truth is that the cities and counties have plenty in common. Dwight Mullen, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Asheville who collects statistics on the struggles of local African-Americans, told me that \u201cwhat the data clearly show are that poor whites in Appalachia are the socio-economic cousins of African-Americans in the city. Replace Nascar with the N.B.A., and all of the sudden we start having very similar interests.\u201dThis is the point that the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, president of the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P., has made at rallies from the mountains to the coast, where he has interlaced hard socio-economic facts with quotes from the Psalms and Hebrew Prophets \u2014 all to weave a common story of suffering in this state. \u201cYou can feel the mood is beginning to change, that people are understanding that they\u2019re voting against their own self-interest,\u201d said Wanda Woodby, who helped found a new branch of the N.A.A.C.P. in the western part of the state. \u201cBut then the transgender issue popped up.\u201dMoreover, facts and prayers didn\u2019t work so well in the shadow of a presidential candidate who encouraged his supporters to ignore reality and dismiss the Golden Rule as rigged. Mr. Trump turned the 2016 election into an anti-fact crusade in which laughably vague promises masqueraded as common-sense policy proposals.He also showed a genius for manipulating the anxieties of evangelicals. \u201cIn the South, we have these traditions of reading the Bible as a story of a God who affirms our fears and fights on our side and is going to destroy our enemies in the end,\u201d said Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, a progressive Baptist activist in Durham who collaborates with Dr. Barber. \u201cVery faithful people will say that his instrument right now is Donald Trump.\u201dThe local H.B. 2 campaign stoked fantastical fears under the guise of Christian values and common sense. The law seemed to assert the obvious: no boys in the ladies\u2019 room, and no arrogant city bureaucrats making their own rules. \u201cIt\u2019s a political ploy that raises questions in rural North Carolina that lots of people haven\u2019t had occasion to think about,\u201d Mr. Wilson-Hartgrove told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a way of presenting it that makes it seem like a common sense thing.\u201dJust as Mr. Trump galvanized his followers by conjuring Mexican rapists and terrorists disguised as Syrian refugees, H.B. 2 encouraged North Carolinians to obsess over a chimera \u2014 the mythical cross-dressing predator loitering outside your bathroom stall. Humans tend to prefer fantasies: After all, they allow us to look away from real human suffering. Calls for \u201ccommon sense\u201d are a powerful and insidious political tactic, because the line between common sense and senseless illusion is all too thin.

{"Headline": "Eyeing the Trump Voter, \u2018Fight for $15\u2019 Widens Its Focus", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byLeaders of the labor-financed \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign say they have improved the lives of millions of workers at the bottom of the nation\u2019s pay scale, helping to raise the minimum wage in California, New York State and a host of cities.Now, four years into their crusade, the movement\u2019s leaders are signaling a determination to expand their reach beyond the urban working poor, who were among the chief beneficiaries of their earlier efforts. Among their new targets: working-class Americans frustrated by an economy that is no longer producing the middle-class jobs they or their parents once held.Many of these workers voted for Donald J. Trump.\u201cA whole bunch of us out there are not doing well,\u201d Scott Courtney, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union and one of the chief architects of the Fight for $15 campaign, said in an interview last week.\u201cIn red states, blue states; black, brown, white \u2014 people are hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cSixty-four million of them don\u2019t make $15 per hour.\u201dAs part of the push, thousands of workers turned out in dozens of cities on Tuesday to demand a $15 wage, better working conditions and the right to unionize. Thousands of airport workers, including baggage handlers, cabin cleaners and wheelchair attendants, loomed at the center of the protests, demonstrating and even walking off the job at some of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, like O\u2019Hare International in Chicago.Leaders of the Fight for $15 highlighted the symbolic importance of the airport workers, whose jobs decades ago paid a living wage. More recently, the jobs have become a source of financial hardship as outsourcing to nonunion contractors has taken its toll \u2014 a dynamic arguably central to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.In other cases, blue-collar workers have lost high-paying union jobs at factories and replaced them with lower-paying jobs at nonunion factories or e-commerce fulfillment centers.\u201cWe\u2019re shining a light on a part of the economy that used to be living-wage work,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which has spent tens of millions of dollars on the Fight for $15 campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re joining with fast-food workers, child care, home care, which have never been living wage work.\u201dOrganizers said that in addition to extending the movement to a different profile of job, they believed the Fight for $15 campaign had to become more disruptive to achieve a new round of victories. The campaign had already planned Tuesday\u2019s protests before the election, but leaders say the imperative for sowing chaos became all the more urgent after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.For example, the idea of workers striking at airports, as opposed to just protesting there, came about after the election.In Chicago, hundreds of demonstrators representing labor unions, churches and community groups converged at O\u2019Hare. Stretched along the walkway between Terminals 2 and 3, the protesters chanted, sang, beat drums and blasted trumpets.In Los Angeles, several thousand workers turned up to protest around noon on a major airport access street, including Ashley Adams, 25, who had been arrested earlier at a rally outside McDonald\u2019s on accusations of stopping traffic and disturbing the peace. \u201cWe really need to fight for this,\u201d said Ms. Adams, who takes orders at a pizza restaurant and makes a bit more than $8 an hour. \u201cI want to see my baby grow up being able to afford basic things and survive.\u201dThere is no question that the incoming Trump administration presents obstacles to the Fight for $15 movement. In recent years, the Service Workers and other unions helped change labor law doctrine as it relates to employers like contractors or franchisees that have a relationship with larger, more profitable companies.Under Mr. Trump and his future appointees to the labor board, this so-called joint employer doctrine is almost certain to be undone, making organizing fast-food workers through traditional means nearly impossible.In other ways, however, the Fight for $15 movement is very much built for the Trump era, having never relied excessively on the Washington power structure to sustain itself.Many of the movement\u2019s successes came in cities and states, where its pressure helped enact new minimum wage laws, and with individual employers whom the movement helped persuade to lift wages voluntarily.\u201cIf a messiah was going to save us, that person is in the White House right now,\u201d Mr. Courtney said. \u201cBy himself or herself, no president can make this happen.\u201dJanice Fine, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, said one possible animating principle for the organizations that emerge from the Fight for $15 could be enforcement of minimum wage laws, and other laws affecting paid leave and scheduling, once they are enacted.None of these innovations \u2014 whether the uniquely public form of bargaining or the creation of worker organizations focused on enforcement \u2014 require the assent of officials in Washington or the blessing of federal labor law.Not all of the recent gains for workers are the doing of the Fight for $15 and other advocacy efforts, of course. Some of the changes, particularly in the private sector, simply reflect employers\u2019 need to raise wages to fill jobs in a tightening labor market.Critics argue that while the Fight for $15 has engineered significant wage increases for many workers, the movement will be harder pressed to notch victories in the future.\u201cThey used low-hanging fruit to create a sense of momentum, but it was always limited\u201d to certain states and jurisdictions, said Michael Saltsman of the business-backed Employment Policies Institute.Mr. Saltsman said he expected a backlash to the recent minimum wage increases as \u201cthe bill starts to come due for the policies over the next year,\u201d by which he meant the possibility of layoffs and the outright failure of businesses as wage increases take effect.Other critics have pointed out that whatever the gains for workers, the tens of millions of dollars the Service Employees have poured into the campaign has netted the union little in the way of new members (although existing members have been beneficiaries of the recent wage increases).But Ruth Milkman, a sociologist who studies labor at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York, rejected that analysis. She said unions simply had a different calculus than corporations, which are more focused on the bottom line, and called the Fight for $15 campaign \u201cthe single most important initiative on the labor front in the last few years.\u201dReferring to the tens of millions of dollars that the union spent on the recent presidential election, Ms. Milkman added, \u201cI suppose they could have given more to Hillary Clinton, but that might have been a worse investment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a wheelchair assistant who protested on Tuesday at O\u2019Hare Airport.

{"Headline": "In a Late-Night Move, Russia Arrests a Top Economic Official in a Bribery Case", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russians awoke to an extraordinary scandal on Tuesday with the minister of economic development detained on charges of soliciting a $2 million bribe \u2014 the highest-level official arrested in Russia in decades.The minister, Aleksei Ulyukayev, 60, a liberal stalwart with a trademark porcupine haircut, was detained in the middle of the night, a Soviet-like tactic against officials who had fallen into disfavor that many thought had been retired.Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a $2 million bribe from Rosneft, the state oil giant, as a thank-you for endorsing a deal for it to buy a chunk of Bashneft, a smaller, government-owned oil company that the Kremlin recently confiscated from an oligarch.Late on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin dismissed Mr. Ulyukayev from the minister\u2019s job he had held since 2013, citing a \u201clack of trust.\u201dIt was a rare bribery case to reach behind the high red walls of the Kremlin \u2014 though relatively small in a country where corruption is rampant \u2014 and to an unusual degree parted the curtains on the extended, opaque battle within the ruling elite over the direction and control of the sickly Russian economy.Amid myriad questions about what actually happened, which may never be made public, one explanation emerged as the favorite.The Kremlin and its allies, struggling to right an economy waterlogged by two years of recession, are seeking a life raft, analysts said. Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s mistake was to question their methods publicly.In this line of thinking, Mr. Ulyukayev was being punished for initially trying to block Rosneft from expanding its reach by purchasing Bashneft, and for generally restraining its growth. On a larger scale, the arrest served as a warning from the increasingly dominant security services that no one should challenge them.\u201cI think the purpose of the whole thing was to eliminate resistance,\u201d said Vladimir S. Milov, an opposition politician and former deputy minister of energy who now leads a think tank. \u201cThe message is, \u2018Don\u2019t stand in my way.\u2019 A clear message for all future deals.\u201dThe basic scenario goes something like this:As the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. agent and Putin confidant, is sitting on about $15 billion in cash. With the state\u2019s two main reserve funds dwindling, the Russian government covets that cash.Mr. Sechin\u2019s purchase of state assets transfers that money directly into the Russian treasury. It also increases his power, though there was a small wrinkle in the form of a law suggesting, except in extreme instances, that state assets should be sold into private hands. A private company, Lukoil, also expressed interest at a lower price.As minister of economic development, Mr. Ulyukayev had to sign off on the sale of any state assets. So Bashneft was a major test case.Mr. Sechin wanted it for Rosneft, despite the law and the widespread, negative public perception that the elite was once again, as it did in the 1990s, abusing privatization laws to seize commodity resources at bargain prices.Mr. Ulyukayev tried to postpone the deal, but Mr. Putin backed the sale after initially hesitating. In October, it was announced that Rosneft would acquire a little more than half of Bashneft for more than $5 billion.Mr. Sechin is known for a take no prisoners attitude toward anyone who challenges him, so the bribery charges against Mr. Ulyukayev were interpreted as revenge.For Mr. Putin, the nation\u2019s special reserve funds have served as Russia\u2019s main, tangible economic cushion.\u201cThe reserve funds have been something sacred. Putin always refers to them when he talks about economic difficulties,\u201d Mr. Milov said. \u201cThey have been used as a strong, public indicator that the state still has capabilities.\u201dBut they are shrinking fast with no economic revival in sight. Two sovereign funds, the Reserve Fund and the National Wealth Fund, are now down to less than $104 billion, compared with a combined $160 billion at the beginning of 2015, according to the Finance Ministry\u2019s website.The financial reserves are expected to run out by the end of 2017, just as Mr. Putin faces a campaign for a fourth term in the spring of 2018.The Rosneft stash would help tide over the country for a longer period while the Kremlin ties its hopes to a rebound in the price of oil and the possible lifting of Western sanctions imposed over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the Ukraine crisis. Prospects for the latter brightened with President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s criticism of the American policy of isolating Russia.For now, the Russian economy hovers around zero growth, and consumers still struggle with inflation caused by a sharp drop in the ruble, along with food restrictions imposed in response to the Western sanctions.With minimal outside investment, Russia\u2019s economic fate is increasingly in the hands of the state. New statistics from the federal antimonopoly service show that the government controls about 70 percent of the economy, compared with 35 percent in 2005.Olga V. Kryshtanovskaya, a leading sociologist who studies the Russian elite, said the Ulyukayev case cast a shadow over the entire government. \u201cPeople resent the fact that they had to give up French cheese in order to support the president\u2019s policies and such corruption cases still erupt,\u201d she said in an interview.On Tuesday, the Kremlin cranked its information machinery into high gear to paint the arrest as part of a continuing anticorruption crusade that has included the arrest of three governors in the last two years.A report called \u201cFight Against Corruption\u201d was the top one for much of the day on the main state-run television news network. A caravan of politicians appeared on screen to praise the arrest as evidence that nobody was above the law.Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a large-scale bribe, Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, said on state television. Mr. Ulyukayev threatened to use his official standing to create future problems for Rosneft, she said, and was detained on Monday while accepting $2 million.Russian security services had monitored Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s telephone calls for a year, and Rosneft had put the $2 million in a safe deposit box, according to various news reports, but the accused had not touched it.Timofei Gridnev, identified by Business FM radio as Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s lawyer, said the minister denied all the charges, calling them a \u201cprovocation\u201d by Rosneft against a government official.Mr. Ulyukayev was put under house arrest for two months.Another school of thought, though not as widespread as the revenge story, holds that the bribery scandal was meant to hurt Rosneft, to show that it was a source of corruption and so to weaken Mr. Sechin.Evidence for that was harder to find, however, especially because various politicians had demanded Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s head. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist Party, suggested that Mr. Ulyukayev was happy to enrich himself while denying the funds needed for a children\u2019s cancer hospital in Moscow.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, told Russian reporters, \u201cThis is a very serious accusation which calls for very serious evidence.\u201d He said a court would make the ultimate determination about Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s guilt or innocence.There was some mocking criticism of the charges from business leaders and others.Apparently referring to Mr. Sechin\u2019s reputation, Alexander N. Shokhin, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, told the website Gazeta.ru that anyone who tried to shake down Rosneft for money should be the subject of a psychiatric investigation rather than a police investigation.\u201cIf Alexei Ulyukayev had been accused of running over an old lady while driving a Gelandewagen at high speed through Moscow late at night, even that would look more probable,\u201d Mr. Shokhin said.Ilya Shumanov of Transparency International, which fights corruption, told RBC Daily, a financial newspaper, that a $2 million bribe was a paltry, unrealistic sum in Russia\u2019s moneyed oil industry, suggesting that was the kind of sum a deputy mayor might solicit.A recent shake-up among Mr. Putin\u2019s advisers prompted some analysts to suggest that Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s arrest was part of a trend of replacing seasoned veterans with a younger generation less likely to question the president\u2019s decisions.Many analysts, however, considered the arrest part of a different trend: the increasing power of the siloviki, or members of the security services, over the whole government.Oleg Feoktistov, the head of security at Rosneft and identified in news reports as the main executive behind Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s arrest, used to run internal security and corruption cases in the federal security service, or F.S.B.\u201cIn the past six to eight months, these repressions have become more widespread,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, an independent political analyst. \u201cThis is directly linked to the new people occupying new posts in the F.S.B., who want to expand their turf.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Other energy companies\u2019 reluctance then quickly turned into interest and, eventually, a growing demand.\u201cIf you name a global oil company, we\u2019ve probably worked for them,\u201d said Mr. Blackford, whose clients include Chevron and BP. Since 2014, the start-up has branched out from mere drone inspections, offering clients access to sophisticated data analytics and algorithms that examine gigabytes of sensor information, for onshore and offshore sites, to flag potential problems that cannot be detected by the human eye.\u201cIn the last six to 12 months, we\u2019ve seen a spike in people\u2019s interest in the data that we can bring to the table,\u201d he said, adding that his team can, for instance, analyze the amount of corrosion to be expected on an oil rig over the coming year. \u201cWe can take the data, measure it and look for trends.\u201dThese tech innovations are part of a renewed push to bring the digital world into the oil and natural gas industry.And more advanced efforts \u2014 like rig-inspecting drones and even autonomous vehicles \u2014 are also being tested as the sector tries to catch up with other areas of the economy that have more readily embraced technological advances. The reams of digital data collected from offshore platforms, refineries and oil rigs, among other sites both onshore and offshore, may better detect energy deposits, find more-efficient ways to produce refined oil products like gasoline and even predict where future breakdowns, which can force costly and unexpected shutdowns, are likely to happen.For many in the energy industry, such predictions may sound all too familiar.Over the last two decades, companies have put hundreds of millions of dollars into new digital technologies, often with limited results. Around 2008, when oil hit a record $147 a barrel, analysts said many oil majors spent big on data centers and advanced software programs, only to see such projects be outpaced by those from IBM, Amazon and Microsoft, which could offer similar computing power at a fraction of the cost.\u201cIn the 2000s, resistance to technology was everywhere,\u201d said Nate Clark, an energy partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, in Houston. \u201cPeople tried to do too much, too fast.\u201dDespite some continuing resistance, the industry's technological credibility has been burnished by the recent shale revolution, which is driven by tech advances in drilling techniques, data crunching and other improvements aimed at making the sector more nimble as global oil and natural gas prices fluctuate. Roughly two-thirds of energy companies, according to a recent study by Ernst & Young, the consulting firm, have spent at least $100 million on data analytics over the last two years, a rise over previous years.\u201cThe amount of data is like a tsunami coming at us,\u201d said Keith Grey, who runs BP\u2019s supercomputer center. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining advantages that will be hard for others to try and match.\u201dFinding new ways of using that data also has become a priority.\u201cIt\u2019s easier than ever to leverage this type of data,\u201d said Richard Holsman, global head of the energy, digital and technology practice at the consultancy Accenture, which has worked with Woodside Energy. \u201cWhat they learned is that they can avoid failures by taking a different approach to the data they already have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Promises Will Be Hard to Keep, but Coal Country Has Faith", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byWILLIAMSON, W.Va. \u2014 If a single moment captured coal country\u2019s despair this year, it was when Bo Copley, a soft-spoken, out-of-work mine maintenance planner, fought tears as he asked Hillary Clinton how, having dismissed coal\u2019s future in language that came back to haunt her, she could \u201ccome in here and tell us you\u2019re going to be our friend.\u201dThat was in May. Mr. Copley, 39 and a registered Republican, was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with Donald J. Trump then, he said. But over time, in a paradox of the Bible Belt, Mr. Copley, a deeply religious father of three, put his faith in a trash-talking, thrice-married Manhattan real estate mogul as a savior for coal country \u2014 and America.\u201cGod has used unjust people to do his will,\u201d Mr. Copley said, explaining his vote.The American market for coal is shrinking, industry analysts agree. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal, in part because of President Obama\u2019s aggressive regulations to cut emissions from power plants, but also because natural gas is cheaper. Nationally, about 300 coal-fired power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group.But in this land of staggering beauty and economic pain, Trump backers said over and over again that while coal might never be what it once was, the businessman they helped send to the White House could indeed put them back to work \u2014 if not in mining, then in some other industry.\u201cI don\u2019t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,\u201d Danny Maynard, 59, said after Bible study at the Chattaroy Missionary Baptist Church. Mr. Maynard lost his job at a coal company last year. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to make America great again.\u201dIt is difficult for outsiders to fathom how deeply faith and work are intertwined here, or the economic and psychological depression that sets in when an entire region loses the only livelihood many of its people have ever known. Coal has always been boom and bust; its decline began long before Mr. Obama took office. But in West Virginia alone, 12,000 coal industry jobs have been lost during his tenure.At the Huddle House on Route 119, Kayla Burger, 32, a waitress, has worked three jobs since her husband lost his; they take home less than a quarter of the roughly $100,000 he used to earn. She took an offer for miners\u2019 wives to train as phlebotomists, but with so many miners out of work, the phlebotomy market was flooded. She also substitute teaches and cooks at the school.They have given up cellphones and sold their boat; one car has been repossessed; the only reason they still have their house, she said, is that they saw layoffs coming and saved money. Her husband, who cares for the children, has experienced depression. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like a man,\u201d Ms. Burger said. Her father was a miner, too; he and her mother drive tractor-trailers now.In Williamson \u2014 population roughly 3,100, down from 4,300 two decades ago \u2014 everyone has a story.The city used to market itself as \u201cthe heart of the billion-dollar coal fields,\u201d but it now wraps its tourism pitches around the Hatfield-McCoy trails that run through the nearby mountains. (\u201cWe\u2019re the 50-cent coal fields,\u201d said Natalie Taylor, the executive director of the Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce.) Williamson\u2019s downtown, on the border with eastern Kentucky, sits between the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River and the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks.At the newly opened pulmonary clinic here for patients with black lung disease, Patricia Sigmon, a respiratory therapist, has been caught in the trickle-down. With coal paying less in severance tax to the state, there is less funding for schools. Her husband, a school bus driver in nearby Boone County, was forced to take a $4,000 cut in pay.Larry Gannon, 61, retired early from his job as a coal processing plant foreman so that a younger man could keep his. Mr. Copley\u2019s wife, Lauren, has a photography business, which is how they make do. They used to have \u201cCadillac\u201d health coverage; now they have Medicaid.\u201cWe\u2019re a forgotten people,\u201d Ms. Taylor said, explaining why it did not take much for Mr. Trump to win coal country\u2019s trust. \u201cHe mentions West Virginia, he mentions the coal workers, and that was pretty much all he had to do to seal this deal.\u201d\u201cJust a positive attitude in the White House is enormously important,\u201d he said.While American utilities are shunning coal, Mr. Raney says, some mines are shipping coal overseas. He sees promise in clean coal technology and says that \u201csome plants can get back on line\u201d if Mr. Trump dismantles Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. But that will take time. The plan is tied up in litigation; the Supreme Court was expected to hear the case next year.Mr. Copley, and many others, are waiting \u2014 and contemplating a divided nation.People have asked Mr. Copley if he will run for public office; if God leads him to, he said, he will. As for Mr. Trump, he will give the president-elect time: \u201cHe\u2019s got four years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time to Dump Time Zones", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byOpinionWe will awaken Sunday to yet another disturbance in the chronosphere \u2014 our twice-yearly jolt from resetting the clocks, mechanical and biological. Thanks to daylight saving time, we get a dose of jet lag without going anywhere.Most people would be happy to dispense with this oddity of timekeeping, first imposed in Germany 100 years ago. But we can do better. We need to deep-six not just daylight saving time, but the whole jerry-rigged scheme of time zones that has ruled the world\u2019s clocks for the last century and a half.The time-zone map is a hodgepodge \u2014 a jigsaw puzzle by Dal\u00ed. Logically you might assume there are 24, one per hour. You would be wrong. There are 39, crossing and overlapping, defying the sun, some offset by 30 minutes or even 45, and fluctuating on the whims of local satraps.Let us all \u2014 wherever and whenever \u2014 live on what the world\u2019s timekeepers call Coordinated Universal Time, or U.T.C. (though \u201cearth time\u201d might be less presumptuous). When it\u2019s noon in Greenwich, Britain, let it be 12 everywhere. No more resetting the clocks. No more wondering what time it is in Peoria or Petropavlovsk. Our biological clocks can stay with the sun, as they have from the dawn of history. Only the numerals will change, and they have always been arbitrary.Some mental adjustment will be necessary at first. Every place will learn a new relationship with the hours. New York (with its longitudinal companions) will be the place where people breakfast at noon, where the sun reaches its zenith around 4 p.m., and where people start dinner close to midnight. (\u201cMidnight\u201d will come to seem a quaint word for the zero hour, where the sun still shines.) In Sydney, the sun will set around 7 a.m., but the Australians can handle it; after all, their winter comes in June.The human relationship with time changed substantially with the arrival of modernity \u2014 trains and telegraphs and wristwatches all around \u2014 and we can see it changing yet again in our globally networked era. We should synchronize our watches for real.I\u2019m not the first to propose this seemingly radical notion. Aviation already uses U.T.C. (called Zulu Time) \u2014 fewer collisions that way \u2014 and so do many computer folk. The visionary novelist Arthur C. Clarke suggested a single all-earth time zone when he was pondering the future of global communication as far back as 1976.Perhaps you\u2019re asking why the Greenwich meridian gets to define earth time. Why should only England keep the traditional hours? Yes, it\u2019s unfair, but that ship has sailed. The French don\u2019t like it either. \u201cThe U.K. would turn into a time theme park,\u201d suggested an English Twitter user, John Powers, \u201cwhere you could experience 9 o\u2019clock as your grandparents knew it.\u201dPeople forget how recent is the development of our whole ungainly apparatus. A century and a half ago, time zones didn\u2019t exist. They were a consequence of the invention of railroads. At first they were neither popular nor easy to understand. When New York reset its clocks to railway time on Sunday, Nov. 18, 1883, this newspaper explained the messy affair as follows:\u201cWhen the reader of The Times consults his paper at 8 o\u2019clock this morning at his breakfast table it will be 9 o\u2019clock in St. John, New Brunswick, 7 o\u2019clock in Chicago, or rather in St. Louis \u2014 for Chicago authorities have refused to adopt the standard time, perhaps because the Chicago meridian was not selected as the one on which all time must be based \u2014 6 o\u2019clock in Denver, Col., and 5 o\u2019clock in San Francisco. That is the whole story in a nut-shell.\u201d\u201cThere was much talk of relative time, physiological time, subjective time and even compressible time,\u201d wrote the French novelist Marcel Aym\u00e9 in \u201cThe Problem of Summer Time,\u201d a 1943 time-travel story. \u201cIt became obvious that the notion of time, as our ancestors had transmitted it down the millennia, was in fact absurd claptrap.\u201dAym\u00e9 was reacting in part to the politicization of time zones: The Nazis imposed Berlin time on Paris when they occupied it in World War II. It is no less political today, no less arbitrary, and no less confusing. Last year North Korea set its clocks back 30 minutes to create an oddball time zone all its own, Pyongyang time \u2014 just to show that it could, apparently. China has established a single time zone across its breadth, overlapping six time zones in its northern and southern neighbors.It might seem impossible to imagine all the world\u2019s nations uniting behind an official earth time. We\u2019re a country that can\u2019t seem to get rid of the penny or embrace the meter. Still, the current system is unstable, a Rube Goldberg contraption ready to collapse from its own complexity.The human relationship with time is changing again. We\u2019re not living in the railroad world anymore. We\u2019re living in a networked world \u2014 a zone of experience where the sun neither rises nor sets. What time zone governs Twitter? What time is it on Facebook? There\u2019s plenty to argue about in cyberspace, as in the real world. We could at least agree on the time.James Gleick is the author, most recently, of \u201cTime Travel: A History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Work Loses Its Dignity", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCleveland \u2014 Start with this: When you call us the Rust Belt, you demean our work and diminish who we are.To create wealth in America, we make it, we grow it or we mine it. In the industrial Midwest, we do all three. Ohio has the largest manufacturing work force in the country aside from California (which has three times our population) and Texas (more than twice our size). And we make things with dignity.Many years ago, as a state representative, I spent countless hours at United Steelworkers Local 169 in Mansfield, a small industrial city north of Columbus. I would listen to workers who stopped in at the hall before or after their shifts. I learned how they made steel and how they built cars. I learned that strikes are always an act of back-against-the-wall desperation because workers never make up for the wages lost, no matter how good the new contract is or how briefly they are on the picket line.They worked hard. Most gladly accepted six-day workweeks because of the overtime pay. Most of these workers, especially those lucky enough to carry a union card, had a shot at upward mobility. They owned modest houses, they could buy new cars every four or five years, and they could send their children to the local Ohio State campus or to North Central Technical College.Few of these workers, white or black, expected to have the opportunities I had as a doctor\u2019s kid. But they understood intuitively that their daughter at Johnny Appleseed Junior High could have more than they did.Their goal \u2014 to achieve the American dream and send their children up the economic ladder \u2014 was more difficult for them to reach than it was for my parents. More things could go wrong for them: a layoff, a strike, a work injury, an illness in the family, each coming with more devastating consequences than those life deals out to more affluent white families.I learned about the role circumstance played in success \u2014 where you were born, how much education and income your parents had, what neighborhood you lived in, what school you attended. At the union hall, we often discussed books, articles and news about strikes and heroes of the labor movement. They were novels like Wallace Stegner\u2019s \u201cJoe Hill\u201d and John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d that tell the very real stories of the lives of American workers, stories that too many in Washington have forgotten or ignored for far too long.As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us, all work has dignity and importance, whether done by a street sweeper, Michelangelo or Beethoven. People take pride in the things they make, in serving their communities in hospitals or schools, in making their contribution to society with a job well done.But over the past 40 years, as people have worked harder for less pay and fewer benefits, the value of their work has eroded. When we devalue work, we threaten the pride and dignity that come from it.Ohio workers know they toil harder and are paid less than their parents, and have less power to control the hours they work and their share of the wealth they create for their employer. This diverse force feels betrayed by trade and tax policies that create immense affluence at the top and take wealth from workers. Much of Washington \u2014 and that now includes Donald J. Trump \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem to understand this.Ohio families will watch to see if the new president follows the billionaire agenda of the Republican leadership in Washington, which has called for overturning a new rule that increases overtime pay for many workers \u2014 an action that would strip thousands of dollars in wages from 130,000 of Ohio\u2019s moderate-income workers. They will measure this president to see if he continues to oppose increasing the minimum wage, which is worth nearly 20 percent less than in 1980. Workers will expect the president to keep his promise of a trade agenda that puts their jobs above corporate profits. And they will scrutinize whether he will throw in with Washington\u2019s moneyed interests at the expense of middle-class and working-class families.If President Trump takes the likely path that almost all Washington Republicans hope \u2014 tax cuts for the rich, an easing up on Wall Street, more voter suppression \u2014 Ohio workers will feel betrayed.

I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201dMs. Kirkpatrick, 66, embraced the positions pushed by Hillary Clinton, banking on support from Latino voters, moderate independent voters and disaffected middle-of-the-road Republicans to propel her to victory.Mr. McCain was buoyed by a deep campaign war chest and by help from the Republican establishment. Last week, Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s nominee in 2012, stumped for him in Arizona.The senator, a Cuban-American conservative, fended off a forceful challenge by Representative Patrick Murphy, 33, a Democrat who consistently portrayed Mr. Rubio as an absentee lawmaker with misplaced allegiances \u2014 first to the presidency instead of to his job, and then to Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.In an election pitting two young, ambitious strivers, Mr. Rubio, a Republican who had vowed not to seek re-election to the Senate, has been by far the better-known, better-financed candidate. Before his presidential race and Senate race six years ago, Mr. Rubio began his career in the Florida Statehouse, where he became speaker of the House. But the race proved surprisingly tight as Mr. Rubio, 45, struggled to characterize his support for Donald J. Trump, his onetime opponent in the presidential primary contests. Mr. Trump bested Mr. Rubio in the Florida primary and ridiculed him as \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d Even as Mr. Rubio endorsed Mr. Trump, who is highly unpopular among Hispanics, a crucial constituency for the senator, he mostly avoided mentioning him on the stump.A moderate South Florida congressman, Mr. Murphy, 33, was depicted by Mr. Rubio as overprivileged and overly reliant on his father\u2019s considerable fortune and connections. Mr. Murphy, one of the youngest candidates to run in a high-profile Senate race, was in turn accused of inflating his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and accomplishing little in Congress during his two terms.Mr. Kirk, a centrist Republican with bipartisan alliances, has long walked a delicate line in a state that tends to vote for Democrats, especially in presidential election years. It is a model that has seen success in Illinois in decades past but that has grown increasingly tangled in this battering election year. Some of Mr. Kirk\u2019s stances have appealed to Democrats and independents (he has supported gay rights, for instance), but he has risked annoying his Republican base along the way. (He said he would support Donald J. Trump if he were the party\u2019s presidential nominee, then backed away from him.)\u201cEvan Bayh had his chance, but he put money ahead of us,\u201d Mr. Young, 44, a former Marine, said in one advertisement.Missouri was not expected to be one of the prime battlegrounds in the battle for control of the Senate. But Mr. Blunt, 66, has had to fend off accusations that he is the very type of Washington insider that his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, built his campaign against. And although Missouri has been a reliably red state in recent years, Mr. Blunt\u2019s support of Mr. Trump also turned off some of the moderate voters who have traditionally backed him.Ms. Cortez Masto, 52, a former Nevada attorney general and the granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant, focused her campaign on immigration reform and future Supreme Court picks before the Senate. She capitalized on the extensive ground operation built by Hillary Clinton, and energized Latinos by railing against Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall, while trying to pin Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial views on her opponent.Mr. Heck, 55, a physician and Iraq war veteran, tried to stress a record of across-the-aisle compromise. But he was tripped up by Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on immigration, veterans and women, observers said.Mr. Heck started off critical of Mr. Trump during the primary contests, then threw his support behind him after his nomination, only to call in October for Mr. Trump to step down.\u201cHe was doing a good job trying to thread the middle and not alienate the base until the whole Donald Trump thing,\u201d said David Damore, a professor of political science at the University of Nevada. \u201cThen it was like he couldn\u2019t say anything right.\u201dThe main challenge for both was to keep their bases happy while appealing to the state\u2019s large number of independents. This forced both candidates to emphasize bipartisanship and to try to keep politics out of major issues, like the state\u2019s crushing opioid epidemic.Ms. Ayotte, 48, a former prosecutor, has been a rising star in Washington, where she allied herself with conservative causes, like defunding Planned Parenthood and opposing a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee.Ms. Hassan, 58, a former State Senate majority leader who helped pass same-sex marriage, allied herself with the Democrats\u2019 biggest stars, including President and Michelle Obama, as they flooded the state for Hillary Clinton.Ms. Ross, 53, a lawyer who served from 2003 to 2013 in the State House of Representatives, blasted Mr. Burr, 60, early in the race as a self-dealing politician who exemplified a dysfunctional Washington. She also criticized him for continuing to support the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, after Mr. Trump\u2019s vulgar comments about women, and for being named to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cnational security advisory council.\u201dLate in the campaign, Ms. Ross called attention to an Oct. 29 recording of Mr. Burr in which he said he was \u201ca little bit shocked\u201d that a National Rifle Association magazine with a picture of Hillary Clinton on it did not have a bull\u2019s-eye over the candidate. On the tape, Mr. Burr also vowed that if Mrs. Clinton were elected, he would work to keep her from filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court.Mr. Burr, known for wearing shoes without socks in the Senate, worried some Republican leaders with his decidedly mellow attitude toward campaigning. But both sides viewed Ms. Ross as vulnerable because of her A.C.L.U. background, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee blanketed the airwaves with ads claiming that Ms. Ross opposed a state sex offender registry, an allegation Ms. Ross strongly rebutted.Times reporters provided real-time analysis of Donald J.

{"Headline": "With Philip Hammond\u2019s Plan, U.K. Shelves Austerity", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 After years of tough spending curbs, Britain\u2019s government on Wednesday cast aside the language of austerity as it acknowledged the high economic cost of withdrawal from the European Union, and tried to placate struggling working-class families whose incomes have stagnated.A pledge by the previous chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, George Osborne, to balance the budget by 2020 has been shelved. The current chancellor, Philip Hammond, is replacing it with a vaguer ambition to do so as soon as practical after 2020.Help for workers whose low earnings are supplemented by welfare payments, an increase in the minimum wage and new infrastructure spending were features of the first Autumn Statement, or spending plan, from Mr. Hammond, who became chancellor in July.Mr. Hammond laid out plans to finance construction of 40,000 new affordable homes and to provide more help with child care, though there was also a less welcome increase in the tax on insurance premiums.And there is a bigger catch. For the JAMs, as for others, the specter of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union hovers over the economy. The uncertainties complicate life for Mr. Hammond and threaten to hit living standards just as they were beginning to improve for some.While Brexit has not had the immediate negative effects some economists predicted, Mr. Hammond announced lower growth projections and higher borrowing estimates and inflation forecasts.\u201cOur task now is to prepare our economy to be resilient as we exit the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Hammond told lawmakers.One of the cabinet\u2019s steadiest, and most sober, performers, Mr. Hammond is nicknamed Spreadsheet Phil because of his reputation for approaching politics more as an accountant than a visionary.He was moved from his post as foreign secretary to become chancellor shortly after the June referendum. He, like Mrs. May, had argued against Britain\u2019s withdrawal.That has made him a target of ideological opponents on the right of the governing Conservative Party, who want to speed British withdrawal, fearing that their goal of a swift, clean break with the European Union will be betrayed.Despite the positive economic signs so far, forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility underscored the high price Britain is likely to pay for Brexit over the next five years.During that time, potential growth will be 2.4 percentage points lower than would have been the case, Mr. Hammond said. Over the five-year forecasting period, around $75 billion of a total of $150 billion in additional borrowing can be attributed to Brexit.Driven by the steep fall in the value of the pound, inflation is coming back. \u201cWe expect the pound\u2019s fall to add almost 2 percent to the level of consumer prices over the next two years,\u201d said the Office for Budget Responsibility, adding that \u201creal earnings growth will consequently fall close to zero next year.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.It added that, over all, \u201cthe government has opted neither for a large near-term fiscal stimulus nor for more austerity over the medium term.\u201dBritish businesses have been jittery since the referendum, and there was alarm at Mrs. May\u2019s suggestions in October that she prioritized regaining control of immigration policy over maintaining unfettered access to the bloc\u2019s single market. So Mrs. May\u2019s comments suggested to many that she was aligning herself with those in favor of a clean break.Britain faces some longstanding economic difficulties. According to a research note from three economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, those include \u201cwoeful productivity performance, the already probably undeliverable austerity that is planned in day-to-day government spending and the large long-term deterioration in the finances that will result if the government delivers on its plan to reduce migration to the tens of thousands.\u201dOver all, they added, \u201cBrexit means, eventually, higher taxes, lower government spending or permanently higher borrowing.\u201dWhile much of Mr. Hammond\u2019s address had been telegraphed in previous days, he did throw one curveball: His first Autumn Statement, he said, would also be his last.Starting next year, he will move Britain\u2019s annual budget statement from the spring to the autumn, so that taxation changes can be announced well before the start of the tax year, in April. There will be an annual spring statement responding to economic forecasts, but no regular fiscal event, he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Windmills or Reactor Cores? Inside South Africa\u2019s Energy Clash", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byUPINGTON, South Africa \u2014 In one of the most sun-drenched corners of the planet, a 670-foot tower rises above a desert dotted with 4,160 mirrors. Tracking the sun throughout the day, the mirrors, called heliostats, redirect the sun\u2019s rays into the tower, where water is heated to generate steam \u2014 and electricity.Since the plant, Khi Solar One, began operating early this year near Upington, it has produced enough power for 65,000 homes during the day, but also, thanks to the latest technology, for a few hours after the sun sets.South Africa is experiencing a boom in renewable energy, nonexistent here just a few years ago. Now, dozens of solar plants clustered in the country\u2019s northern reaches and wind farms operating along the southern coast are generating 2.2 gigawatts \u2014 more than what most African nations can produce.But South Africa\u2019s utility, Eskom, and some government officials do not see it that way. Criticizing wind and solar energy as costly and unreliable, they are pressing instead for a huge investment in nuclear energy: three power stations with a total of up to nine reactors to generate 9.6 gigawatts.\u201cA line of attack is that anyone who wants nuclear is linked to President Zuma and therefore is corrupt,\u201d said Matshela Koko, the head of generation at Eskom. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t dispassionate about nuclear. People have taken a political view. If you\u2019re dispassionate, and look at the science and engineering of it, you will conclude that you need nuclear.\u201dDeveloping nations are closely watching the standoff between nuclear and renewables, two forms of low-carbon energy that they hope will power their growing economies. Countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Belarus, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam are adopting nuclear power.As sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most advanced economy, South Africa has about half of the continent\u2019s power-generating capacity. It has operated a nuclear power station, the only one on the continent, since 1984, though coal-fired power plants generate about 80 percent of its electricity.Because of poor planning, the blackouts began in 2008. In 2011, desperate for more juice, the country started a program to attract private solar and wind producers that bid against one another on a number of projects.By this June, the renewable program had attracted 102 projects worth $14.4 billion. Forty-four facilities, built on average in less than two years, are producing 2.2 gigawatts. By contrast, the construction of two huge government coal plants is facing years of delay and severe cost overruns.\u201cThe program has been very successful, clear of any corruption and very well run,\u201d said Wikus van Niekerk, the director of the Center for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies at Stellenbosch University. \u201cIt\u2019s been seen by many people in the rest of the world as one of the most successful procurement programs for renewable energy. It\u2019s something that the South African government and public should be proud about.\u201dAbengoa, a Spanish company, was the first to win contracts to build two concentrated solar plants near Upington. Unlike traditional solar plants, a concentrated solar plant harnesses the sun\u2019s energy to produce steam, which can be stored for a few hours and then used to run turbines after the sun sets.The region surrounding Upington experiences temperatures up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius), and intense sunshine year-round.\u201cSouth Africa is one of the best places in the world for solar power,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 David Cayuela Olivencia, the general manager of Khi Solar One.Concentrated solar power can generate electricity at peak times of the day after the sun sets \u2014 but at a cost. The electricity produced by Khi Solar One, which Eskom must buy as part of a 20-year contract, is significantly costlier than regular solar power.Eskom officials say the supply from traditional solar and wind power plants fluctuates or comes during the day, when it is not needed.At 7 p.m., when demand peaks, \u201cthe wind may not be moving, and the sun has set,\u201d said Brian Molefe, Eskom\u2019s chief executive. He added that further expansion of renewable energy should \u201cgo slow\u201d until cheap and efficient storage technology for renewables is developed.\u201cWe need baseload capacity,\u201d said Mr. Koko, Eskom\u2019s head of generation, referring to plants that can run around the clock. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be coal, so it has to be nuclear.\u201dBut others say that building nuclear reactors, with a life span of 60 to 80 years, would commit South Africa to an energy source just as renewables are getting cheaper. In the past five years, production costs for solar and wind have dropped so much that the most recently approved plants, now under construction, will generate electricity at the cheapest rate in South Africa. Over the coming decades, critics of the nuclear project argue, advances in storage and other technologies will emerge even as South Africa is saddled with nuclear power.Massive nuclear plants will become outdated as national electrical grids are decentralized, critics say. Businesses in South African cities are increasingly installing solar panels, effectively going off the grid. Elsewhere in Africa, it is becoming more and more common to see villagers connecting cellphones to single solar panels outside mud-brick homes.\u201cThe concept of baseload is actually an outdated concept,\u201d said Harald Winkler, the director of the Energy Research Center at the University of Cape Town. \u201cEskom was built around big coal and to a lesser extent big nuclear \u2014 big chunks of baseload power. It\u2019s really myopic in terms of where the future of the grid is going to go. We\u2019re going to see in South Africa and the rest of the world much more decentralized grids.\u201dOpposition to South Africa\u2019s nuclear plans is also coming from the government\u2019s main research agency, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. An expansion of solar and wind energy, in addition to natural gas, could meet South Africa\u2019s future energy needs for a cheaper price, according to a projection by the council.\u201cNo new coal, no new nuclear,\u201d said Tobias Bischof-Niemz, who leads the council\u2019s research on energy. \u201cSouth Africa is in a very fortunate situation where we can decarbonize our energy system at negative cost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the central bank did not require them to issue revised capital plans, given actions they had already taken to strengthen their balance sheets.The weaknesses point to the continuing troubles for Britain\u2019s banking industry, which has struggled to get back on its feet since the global financial crisis that came to a head in 2008. Along with the general economic malaise, the industry has faced a string of scandals.The Bank of England, in a separate assessment about the financial system\u2019s stability, pointed to the potential issues for banks after Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union, as well as the United States election in November, which has prompted a sharp move in global asset prices. Both political developments could create economic ripples.The banking industry\u2019s profitability has been hurt, particularly in Europe, by low interest rates, which are expected to remain so in Britain and on the Continent for the foreseeable future. The industry, and R.B.S. in particular, also continues to face an overhang of potential fines and litigation costs from past misconduct.The stress test modeled the potential impact of a severe recession globally and in Britain, with associated shocks to financial market prices.\u201cToday\u2019s stress tests are the next stage of our efforts to maintain the resilience of our financial system as the U.K. economy adjusts to the U.K.\u2019s new relationship with the E.U. in an environment of elevated global and domestic risks,\u201d Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, said at a news conference in London on Wednesday.The test covered seven of Britain\u2019s largest lenders based on their balance sheets at the end of 2015.

The bank abandoned plans to spin off the business in August and is instead focusing on a possible sale of Williams & Glyn.Jason Napier, a UBS analyst, said that R.B.S.\u2019s revised capital plan was likely to be a \u201cformal inclusion of measures planned and known by the market,\u201d and he expects further cost cuts and restructuring measures to be announced by the bank next year.\u201cWe think R.B.S. remains under pressure to deliver on core profits, principally by achieving further significant cost cuts,\u201d Mr. Napier said in a research note.R.B.S., which is based in Edinburgh, said its revised capital plan would include further cost cuts, reductions in so-called risk-weighted assets and the sale of loan portfolios that the bank does not consider core to its business.The bank said that it expected the updated capital plan to address the shortfall identified by the Bank of England, but that \u201cadditional management actions may be required until R.B.S.\u2019s balance sheet is sufficiently resilient to stressed scenarios.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This Campaign\u2019s Cost America More.", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byThe world, too, is waiting anxiously for this election to be over:But regardless of who wins, after a presidential campaign marred by scandal, political violence, allegations of corruption and fears of voter fraud, America\u2019s image stands tarnished in the eyes of its own people and the world.The United States has always attracted its share of international criticism on foreign policy, especially during the Iraq war. But rarely has its political system been subjected to such widespread scorn and ridicule. Eight short years after the nation was lauded for overcoming its deepest prejudice by electing a black president, this campaign has laid bare an ugly underbelly of American politics. And it has exposed the capacity of a nation defined by its democratic ideals to fall victim to the same antidemocratic forces that have stymied third world countries.But the shift is clear nonetheless. In interviews, Americans who travel overseas and foreign observers say that tourists who once felt themselves the envy of the world now feel the sting of embarrassment. Businesses that once marketed their jeans and fleece jackets internationally as tiny pieces of the American dream are being advised to revamp their ad campaigns.United States diplomats more accustomed to mediating other countries\u2019 disputes are now being called on to defend American democracy in the face of allegations that the election is \u201crigged.\u201d\u201cI think it has affected the way that people see us,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a veteran diplomat who was under secretary of state for political affairs under President George W. Bush. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect that from the United States. We are the people who go and monitor other people\u2019s elections.\u201dAcross the planet, people are contemplating the possibility that the United States might not be so exceptional after all.\u201cMuch of the world is no longer in awe of you,\u201d said Lyall Mercer, managing director of a public relations company in Australia.\u201cOf course I understand this is about the candidate and not the country,\u201d Mr. Mercer said. \u201cBut the very fact that they were willing to do this, with not one M.P. speaking against it \u2014 despite knowing they were ridiculing someone who could be the next president of our most important ally \u2014 I think speaks to the diminishing awe, or even respect.\u201dIn Lebanon, where the United States\u2019 image had already been battered \u2014 first by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, then by President Obama\u2019s disengagement from the region \u2014 its staunchest defenders have been quieted.Arabs skeptical of the United States\u2019 efforts to promote democracy in the region have eaten up allegations of sexual misconduct and embarrassing email leaks in the campaign, Mr. Melhem said: \u201cThey are mocking the American democratic process in ways that I\u2019ve never seen before, and I\u2019ve been covering elections since the early 1980s.\u201dIn Africa, where political contests combining ethnic divisions, violence and the possibility of a challenge to the election\u2019s result are not unfamiliar, some have made snarky suggestions that the African Union broker a \u201cunity government\u201d in the United States, using the Twitter hashtag #Nov8AfricaEdition.The United States\u2019 image abroad has fallen so much that trusty Canadians have begun their own campaign of reassurance: #TellAmericaItsGreat.\u201cThe French fry is an American invention,\u201d read one cheerful post. \u201cThanks America!\u201dAdversaries are also at work, trying to magnify the impression that American democracy is a sham.In Russia, which is accused of hacking into the emails that have dogged Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, newscasters portray the United States as under the control of dark, secretive forces. Vesti, a nightly news program in Moscow, reported that the firebombing of a Trump campaign office in North Carolina was an example of \u201cattempts to kill those who have different views.\u201d\u201cThe overwhelming question that you get about the presidential election is \u2018What are you people thinking?\u2019\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, the Boston-born research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Although Europeans have been troubled by their own right-wing populists, \u201cthey expect the United States to be a rock of stability, a safety net they can rely on,\u201d he said.And the scorn does not fall solely on Mr. Trump.K. Riva Levinson, who leads a boutique international consulting firm in Washington, said that during a recent trip to Ghana, people expressed disillusionment with what they saw as the unfairness of the Democratic primary contest between Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\u201cAmerica is not a monarchy,\u201d she said people told her. \u201cIt is not an office you are entitled to, either by birth or by marriage.\u201dOthers ask what has happened to the United States and its political talent pool, to result in two nominees so widely despised.\u201cThese are the two best candidates they have to run the biggest economy and oldest democracy in the world?\u201d asked Arvind Gupta, national head of digital and technology for India\u2019s ruling party.Perhaps the most important change in the image of the United States, however, is the one taking place within its own borders.\u201cI believe, like Trump does, that the system is rigged,\u201d said Ted Gregory, 79, of Camp Hill, Pa.To Mr. Gregory, a retired business owner who travels abroad frequently, that loss of faith has gone hand in hand with what he sees as a decline in America\u2019s stature, starting under Mr. Bush and continuing under Mr. Obama.\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when you told someone that you were from the United States, they thought, \u2018Lucky you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know what they think.\u201dAnd so a Pandora\u2019s box of unimaginables has been opened. America\u2019s greatness, once considered a fact, is now a matter of debate. Its ironclad commitment to its allies seems less ironclad. Core values have been thrown into dispute. And for the first time since the republic\u2019s earliest days, many wonder if there will be a peaceful transfer of power.For months, many in government and business have sought to assess the damage. Big corporate leaders, including the chief executives of Starbucks and Wendy\u2019s, have fretted about a tougher climate for American companies.In July, Matt Levatich, the chief executive of Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2014 featured prominently at rallies of bikers supporting Mr. Trump \u2014 blamed politics for sagging sales. \u201cOur brand identity is connected strongly to the ideals of America, and when the ideals of America seem to no longer be our ideals anymore, it can\u2019t help things,\u201d he told TheStreet.com.Ruth Bernstein, the co-founder of YARD, an ad agency known for its fashion campaigns, said she was advising American companies that sell overseas to move away from marketing an idealized version of America, because it no longer feels authentic.\u201cThe brand of America relies heavily on the perception that the American dream is alive and well, that anyone can make it here and is welcome,\u201d she said. The election has cast doubt on all that.How long those doubts will linger is an open question.Its image is unlikely to suffer lasting damage, he said, as long as the country does not carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to scrap trade agreements and military alliances.\u201cPeople don\u2019t like countries that withdraw from the international sphere,\u201d Mr. Anholt said, pointing to the tarnishing of Britain\u2019s image after it voted to leave the European Union.Even as the United States experiences an eye-opening look in the mirror, people in younger, shakier democracies are seeing a silver lining.Amara Nwankpa, director of public policy initiatives at the Yar\u2019Adua Foundation, which promotes good governance in Nigeria, expressed hope that \u201cAmerica will emerge from this experience a more empathetic partner\u201d to third world countries.\u201cThere\u2019s some ironic reassurance in the fact that even the great United States of America could struggle this much with elections,\u201d Mr. Nwankpa said.If America can get it so wrong, he added, maybe one day Nigeria \u201ccould get it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Auto Lending Rises, So Do Delinquencies", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byRegulators are airing \u201csignificant concern\u201d about the millions of Americans who are falling behind on their car loans, even as auto lending continues to boom at a near record pace.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted increasing distress among auto borrowers with shaky credit, as subprime delinquencies rose in the third quarter.In the third quarter, 2 percent of subprime auto loan balances became at least 90 days delinquent, up from 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014.In the depths of the recession, in the second quarter of 2009, that rate peaked at 2.4 percent.The report is the most strident warning yet from the New York Fed about stresses in subprime auto lending. The New York Fed analyzes trends in borrowing by American households each quarter.The swelling delinquencies come at a time when unemployment is low and borrowers typically should be able to make their payments.That such serious trouble is emerging in a relatively good economy suggests that lenders have been loosening their standards and letting borrowers take on more debt than they can afford.Violette Morin, of Pulaski, N.Y., a 74-year-old grandmother, said she did not need or particularly want to buy a car. But after receiving a mailing from a local dealership promising a prize of a pearl necklace and a fishing rod, she visited the used car lot in May 2015.The dealer qualified her for a $20,350 loan, according to her lawyer, to purchase a 2011 Ford Fusion. Earlier this year, she stopped making the payments. \u201cI eventually had them come and get the car because I couldn\u2019t pay for it,\u201d said Ms. Morin, who lives on Social Security, receives food stamps and lives in subsidized housing.Economists fear that if the economy dips into another recession, the already large number of Americans on the verge of losing their cars to repossession \u2014 about six million \u2014 will swell to record levels.Although the subprime delinquency rate may be lower today than it was in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, economists are concerned about the sheer number of Americans who are behind on their car payments because so many more have subprime auto loans than in 2009.But industry experts have dismissed comparisons between subprime auto loans and the mortgage bubble that led to the global financial crisis. Back in 2008, trillions of dollars of investments were correlated to the American housing market. The auto loan market is huge \u2014 with $1.1 trillion in outstanding loans \u2014 but defaults are not very likely to have the cascading effects on the banking system that home foreclosures did.If anything, the New York Fed report notes that delinquencies on auto loans originated by banks remained low, while many of the troubled loans were made by finance companies, which are not large enough to harm the broader financial system.Still, widespread repossessions could deliver a stinging hit to the economy, as Americans struggle to get to work or go about their daily lives in areas with limited public transportation.Nashua Moore, 28, gets up at 2 a.m., takes two buses, and reaches her office in Las Vegas by the time her shift as a medical dispatcher starts at 5 a.m. She schedules plenty of time to avoid being penalized for being late. By car, her commute takes about 20 minutes, she said.\u201cI was desperate to get a car,\u201d said Ms. Moore, who went back to work this spring after her daughter was born.She borrowed $6,580 at a 30 percent interest rate to purchase a 2008 Chevrolet Impala. Her car was repossessed this fall, after she got in a dispute with the dealership. She is now working with a legal aid lawyer to get her down payment back and other damages.\u201cI see this all the time,\u201d said her lawyer, Sophia Medina, of the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.Auto loans are one of the few types of lending that has not been curtailed after the financial crisis.Lenders have been willing to take more risks with auto lending based on a belief that Americans \u2014 even those who are struggling \u2014 will keep making car payments because they need their cars to keep their jobs and to keep their households functioning.As competition becomes fierce, banks, private equity firms and credit unions have been extending loan terms as long as seven years \u2014 longer than many used cars are on the road.Most of the growth in subprime lending has been driven not by traditional banks but by finance companies that specialize in making loans to borrowers on the financial margins. Subprime lending is more profitable because lenders charge interest rates as high as 30 percent and they often bundle the loans and sell them to investors \u2014 much as mortgages were securitized before the financial crisis.The New York Fed noted in the report that overall delinquencies among prime auto borrowers remained low, despite \u201cnotable deterioration in the performance of subprime auto loans.\u201dAnalysts at Fitch Ratings said that although losses on subprime loans were rising, they were within the firm\u2019s expectations.Annualized net loss on an index of subprime auto loans hit 9.6 percent in October, up from about 8 percent a year earlier, according to Fitch.\u201cSubprime auto performance could decline further if there are any stresses to the underlying economy,\u201d Kevin Duignan, Fitch\u2019s global head of structured finance, said in an interview.As auto lending has boomed, regulators and investigators have been looking into increased cases of fraud where dealers have misstated borrowers\u2019 income to qualify them for loans.Ms. Morin, the borrower from New York, said that when she asked for a copy of her loan application, she noticed that the document listed her monthly income as more than $3,300, which was false. She collects about $850 a month in Social Security.Ms. Morin worked with the consumer law clinic at the Syracuse University law school, which contacted the lender, a credit union, on her behalf. Ms. Morin\u2019s loan was forgiven and her default was scrubbed from her credit report.\u201cI wasn\u2019t car smart, I was just an average person,\u201d Ms. Morin said. \u201cI am car smart now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Doesn\u2019t Have to Appease Trump. It Can Fight Back.", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThis year, for the first time since Ronald Reagan assailed the Soviet Union in 1980, an American presidential candidate actively campaigned against another country\u2019s national interests. By threatening to deport all undocumented immigrants, about half of whom are Mexican; to build a wall on the Mexican border; and to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is far more important for Mexico than for the United States, Donald J. Trump made Mexico one of the central issues of the campaign.How should Mexicans respond now that Mr. Trump has been elected?Mexico doesn\u2019t have to appease Mr. Trump like this. It can fight back. It will not win every battle, but it may achieve more through obstruction, and making life miserable for the new president by increasing the cost of his anti-Mexican policies, than it will achieve by appeasement.On Nafta, Mexico should simply tell Washington that it refuses to renegotiate the treaty. There may be reasons to create side agreements to supplement the treaty and to address issues like currency devaluation or wages. But the idea of renegotiating Nafta, as Mr. Trump says he intends to do, should be completely unacceptable to the government of Mexico.If the Trump administration, in return, threatens to leave Nafta, so be it. Mr. Trump would be responsible for breaking up a deal that was maintained by three American presidents, five Mexican ones and six Canadian prime ministers over the past 22 years. And, despite some flaws, it has worked reasonably well.The blame for withdrawing from the treaty would be his, and many American commercial interests and political forces, including numerous Republicans, would come to resent Mr. Trump for it. The damage to Mexico\u2019s economy would undoubtedly be great. But a prolonged renegotiation of Nafta could potentially do even more damage, with years of uncertainty discouraging investment in the country.Regarding deportations, Mexico can legally maintain that it will welcome back only those people who the United States can prove are indeed Mexican. This would have to take place while they were still in the United States.Since many unauthorized Mexican immigrants have no documents, this would shift the political and economic cost of deportation from Mexico to its northern neighbor. There would be backlogs, litigation and crowded detention centers. The news media would broadcast scenes of children separated from their parents who are stuck in legal limbo.This could amount to a humanitarian catastrophe, something no one wants to see. But the comparison cannot be with the status quo; rather, it should be with the millions of deportations promised by Mr. Trump. His supporters might not care, but many other Americans would. The outcry could conceivably force him to abandon detestable attempts at mass deportation.And what about the wall that was so central to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign? It is absurd for Mexico to say it doesn\u2019t care as long as it doesn\u2019t pay for it. The Mexican government should fully oppose its construction. Building a border wall is a hostile act. It would send a terrible message to the world. The cost and danger of crossing without papers would rise, making smuggling even more lucrative for organized crime syndicates.Once Mexico announces that it opposes the wall, the government should resort to every legal, environmental, political, social, cultural and regional tool to halt construction. It should mobilize binational communities in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas against the construction of the wall, until the price of pursuing this nonsensical idea becomes too high for Mr. Trump. These binational cities, like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez-El Paso, should hold demonstrations and file lawsuits to try to ensure that a hostile American-built wall does not divide them.Finally, Mexico should take advantage of California\u2019s decision to legalize recreational marijuana. Regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the approval of the proposition in the United States\u2019 most populous state makes Mexico\u2019s war on drugs ridiculous. What is the purpose of sending Mexican soldiers to burn fields, search trucks and look for narco-tunnels if, once our marijuana makes it into California, it can be sold at the local 7-Eleven?But with Mr. Trump\u2019s aggression against Mexico, there is an additional reason for the country to adopt a pragmatic \u201cwink and nod\u201d attitude on marijuana exports to the United States: The Mexican government has no reason to cooperate with a hostile administration in Washington. Our authorities should instead simply look the other way when it comes to marijuana.None of these positions will be risk-free for Mexico. There could be American reprisals, a backlash in some regions, and humanitarian crises. A weak and unpopular Mexican government might not resist the Trump administration\u2019s pressure. But if business as usual is not an option, these suggestions may be. Leaders on both sides of the border should contemplate them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richard Rorty\u2019s 1998 Book Suggested Election 2016 Was Coming", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIt\u2019s worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs:[M]embers of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers \u2014 themselves desperately afraid of being downsized \u2014 are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else.At that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for \u2014 someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots. \u2026One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. \u2026 All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.Donald J. Trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman. But the essence of Mr. Rorty\u2019s argument holds up surprisingly well. Where others saw positive trends \u2014 say, a full-throated dawn chorus praising the nation\u2019s diversity \u2014 Mr. Rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine.His basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country, for all its flaws, was both perfectible and worth perfecting. Hope was part of its core philosophy. But during the 1960s, shame \u2014 over Vietnam, over the serial humiliation of African-Americans \u2014 transformed a good portion of the left, at least the academic left, into a disaffected gang of spectators, rather than agitators for change. A formalized despair became its philosophy. The system was beyond reform. The best one could do was focus on its victims.The result was disastrous. The alliance between the unions and intellectuals, so vital to passing legislation in the Progressive Era, broke down. In universities, cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice. By 1997, when Mr. Rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d few of his academic colleagues, he insisted, were talking about reducing poverty at all.\u201cNobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies, homeless studies, or trailer-park studies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause the unemployed, the homeless, and the residents of trailer parks are not \u2018other\u2019 in the relevant sense.\u201dDoes this overlooked category sound familiar?Mr. Rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities. But it just so happened that at the very moment \u201csocially accepted sadism\u201d \u2014 good phrase, that \u2014 was diminishing, economic instability and inequality were increasing, thanks to globalization.\u201cThis world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great American capitalists of the year 1900.\u201dAgain: Ring any bells?This group included intellectuals, by the way, who, he wrote, are \u201courselves quite well insulated, at least in the short run, from the effects of globalization.\u201dWhich left the white working-class guy and gal up for grabs \u2014 open to right-wing populists, maybe even strongmen. In Mr. Rorty\u2019s view, no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white working-class anxiety. This was a problem. \u201cOutside the academy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cAmericans still want to feel patriotic. They still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place.\u201dSounds an awful lot like Make America Great Again.At the time, Mr. Rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape. But it wasn\u2019t that different, ultimately. Today\u2019s just has more mature trees.In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d he wrote about the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement; today, he\u2019d probably have cautioned against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d Mr. Rorty railed against the \u201cscurrilous demagogue\u201d Pat Buchanan, who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the Mexican border; today Mr. Rorty would have railed against Mr. Trump and his proposed wall.\u201cWhy could not the left,\u201d he asked, \u201cchannel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed?\u201dIs his analysis a bit oversimple? Yes. Even within universities, there have always been optimistic champions of America, those who ever-passionately believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work ever-diligently on formulating concrete, actionable policies that would make the country more just.By focusing only on his own environment, academia, Mr. Rorty\u2019s arguments also seem strangely parochial. During the 1960s, the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty, but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it: Robert F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia; Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society.But it wasn\u2019t enough, obviously. \u201cUnder Presidents Carter and Clinton,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote, \u201cthe Democratic Party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution.\u201d Mr. Clinton was particularly guilty of this charge, passing Nafta, appointing Robert Rubin as his Treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation. Mr. Obama pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And he was one of those fancy elites.Which brings us to Hillary Clinton. She may have had a plan to relieve the misery of the working class, but she didn\u2019t speak about it much. (Bernie Sanders did. And lost.) She was in favor of the Partnership until she was against it. In a paid speech to a Brazilian bank, she spoke of a \u201chemispheric common market\u201d for energy. And though her slogan was \u201cStronger Together,\u201d her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating difference, in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her.Here, Mr. Rorty\u2019s most inflammatory words are most relevant, and also most uncomfortable: \u201cThe cultural Left has a vision of an America in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized groups.\u201d Mrs. Clinton tried this strategy. It didn\u2019t win her the Electoral College. \u201cThis Left wants to preserve otherness rather than ignore it,\u201d he also wrote. That didn\u2019t work either.People are furiously arguing about what played a key role in this election \u2014 whether it was white working-class despair, a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change. It seems reasonable to think that all three played a part.What\u2019s so striking about \u201cAchieving Our Country\u201d is that it blends these theories into a common argument: The left, both cultural and political, eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity politics, leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored.\u201cIt is as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote. \u201cAs if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money, or vice versa.\u201dYou may quarrel with his argument; you may say that he was projecting onto the larger world what was happening within his own cloistered, ivied walls. But Mr. Trump is now our president-elect.Achieving Our CountryLeftist Thought in Twentieth-Century AmericaBy Richard Rorty159 pages. Harvard University Press. $23.50.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vast and Pristine, Russia\u2019s Lake Baikal Is Invaded by Harmful Algae", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byLAKE BAIKAL, Russia \u2014 Yury Azhichakov set out early by bike for Senogda Bay, his favorite beach, on the northwestern shore of Lake Baikal in Siberia. The world\u2019s oldest, deepest and most voluminous lake, Baikal holds 20 percent of the planet\u2019s unfrozen freshwater. It is often described as the world\u2019s cleanest lake.As Mr. Azhichakov discovered, that is no longer the case. Senogda\u2019s once pristine sands were buried under thick mats of reeking greenish-black goo.\u201cThis stuff stretched far into the distance, for several kilometers,\u201d said Mr. Azhichakov, 61, a retired ecological engineer. \u201cThe beach was in terrible condition.\u201dThe muck, scientists have discovered, follows mass algal blooms at dozens of sites around Lake Baikal\u2019s 1,240-mile perimeter. Confined to shallow water and shores near towns and villages, the problem seems to stem from an influx of untreated sewage \u2014 the result of inadequate wastewater treatment.Algal blooms threaten iconic freshwater bodies around the world, including the Great Lakes, Lake Geneva, and Lake Biwa in Japan. But Lake Baikal is especially precious: a World Heritage site home to more than 3,700 species, more than half found nowhere else.\u201cPeople are dumping sewage, waste and rubbish around the lake, creating pretty appalling conditions in some places,\u201d said Anson MacKay, an environmental scientist at University College London.Runoff from fertilizers and other pollutants leads to so-called eutrophication, an excessive growth of algae. These blooms eventually deplete the water of oxygen, suffocating aquatic plants and animals.Russian scientists had assumed that Lake Baikal is simply too vast to suffer such a fate, but recent growth in tourism and development seem to be changing the calculus.\u201cWe have a saying in Russia: A clever person is trained on the mistakes of others,\u201d said Oleg Timoshkin, a biologist at the Russian Academy of Science\u2019s Limnological Institute in Irkutsk, 40 miles from Baikal\u2019s southwestern shore. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re now repeating the mistakes of so many other countries.\u201dDr. Timoshkin and his colleagues have found that Spirogyra, a type of green algae that had rarely grown in Lake Baikal\u2019s shallow zones, accounts for the outbreaks.In Severobaikalsk, Mr. Azhichakov\u2019s town, the researchers traced Spirogyra blooms to locations downstream of the town\u2019s wastewater facility, as well as to an illegal sewage dumping site.The researchers also found little difference in phosphorus and nitrogen content \u2014 indicators of synthetic detergents and fecal material \u2014 in treated and untreated water entering the lake. And, as it turned out, Russian Railways had been adding industrial-grade waste to the town\u2019s sewage system, overwhelming it.Despite remedial action, high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in Severobaikalsk\u2019s wastewater persist even today, and fecal bacteria in treated wastewater have turned up at various sites around Lake Baikal. Dr. Timoshkin\u2019s team is trying to figure out which nutrients are fueling Spirogyra\u2019s growth.Spirogyra smothers other species of algae, and thousands of empty snail shells \u2014 gastropod cemeteries, as Dr. Timoshkin calls them \u2014 regularly wash up alongside the blooms. But the damage is more extensive than that.Underwater forests of native Lake Baikal sponges have begun dying off. In nearly 90 dives around the lake, researchers have found that 30 to 100 percent of sponges are affected in a given area. The green stalks \u2014 some a century old \u2014 are turning a dull brown, reminiscent of cattails.The cause of death is unknown, although Dr. Timoshkin and his colleagues suspect that pathogens from sewage may be causing disease outbreaks, or that the influx of nutrients is causing symbiotic algae to vacate the sponges.Along Lake Baikal, some locals say they can no longer drink water from their taps during blooms. Fishermen complain of Spirogyra tangling in their nets.\u201cWill Baikal be able to attract the same amount of tourism, which is a major part of the economy, if tourists show up and see a green lake?\u201d said Ted Ozersky, a limnologist at the University of Minnesota Duluth.But such fixes will probably be slow to come.\u201cOne of the tragedies of Baikal is that top-level, senior scientists who are themselves never on a field expedition mistakenly believe that the lake can never be eutrophied because it is too huge, too pure and full of too much water,\u201d Dr. Timoshkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy idea to have, but it\u2019s wrong.\u201dEven as federal aid stalls, some people are attempting to address the problems where they live, organizing beach cleanups and trying to find ways to put the thousands of pounds of washed-up Spirogyra to use as fertilizer or material for making traditional Siberian paper.Eutrophication, however, is not the only threat to Lake Baikal.Mongolia is planning to build up to eight hydroelectric dams on the Selenga River and its tributaries, the source of 50 percent of Lake Baikal\u2019s surface water. Despite hearings and protests in Russia and Mongolia, the Mongolian government \u2014 which imports around 8 percent of its energy from Russia and 12 percent from China \u2014 argues that the dams will help achieve energy independence and cut back on coal use.Some experts think there must be a better way. Mongolia can technically produce around 100 gigawatts of power from wind and solar in their part of the Gobi Desert alone \u2014 about 90 times the country\u2019s current capacity, said Eugene Simonov, an international coordinator with the nonprofit Rivers Without Boundaries Coalition.\u201cInstead, the plan is to first build dams, then to develop a huge capacity to produce thermal energy from coal, then to build the next generation of big dams to offset the negative effects of coal on the climate and then, finally, to use some of the proceeds to build true renewables.\u201dResearchers predict that Mongolia\u2019s dams would have significant ecological effects on Lake Baikal, including disrupting the flow of water and sediment into the lake, effecting the quality of breeding sites for birds and fish, and blocking migration routes.\u201cThis is likely to be yet another step toward biotic homogenization, where widely distributed, cosmopolitan species like pike increase while unique endemic species like taimen lose ground,\u201d said Olaf Jensen, an aquatic ecologist at Rutgers University. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the ecological equivalent of Starbucks replacing the local bodega.\u201dHeeding such warnings, China, which is funding the largest of the projects, in July froze all dam construction until Mongolia and Russia jointly assess potential effects on the lake. \u201cThis is important, but just a small step in the right direction,\u201d Dr. Simonov said.\u201cEven if the project is tightly regulated by the government, I\u2019m unsure whether the coastal zone could be developed sustainably without harming it,\u201d she said. \u201cNutrient pollution from human waste and shoreline erosion will be enormous problems.\u201dAnother unanswered question is how the triple stressors of pollution, dams and climate change might combine to produce even greater effects on the lake. As Dr. Moore said, \u201cCorrecting the problems that we do have control over will help the lake respond as best it can to climate change.\u201dBut that first requires acknowledging that Lake Baikal is \u201cabsolutely ill,\u201d Dr. Timoshkin said.\u201cWill we Russians be able to show the world that Baikal can avoid the common fate of so many other lakes? That is a question I ask from the bottom of my heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Can Latin America Move to Low-Carbon Energy?", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 Climate negotiators convened in Morocco, this month to discuss how to turn the Paris climate accord into action. The accord, signed by almost 200 countries last year, came into force on Nov. 4. Many questions persist about how each country can move toward the zero carbon-energy target that experts say is necessary to avoid destructive climate change. Some parts of the world are better positioned than others to take this test. Latin America is a good example.To reduce per capita emissions consistent with this goal, by 2050 Latin America would not only have to stop deforestation and reduce emissions from agriculture and other non-energy sources, it would also have to cut consumers\u2019 energy use by 40 percent through huge improvements in efficiency. The region would also need to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d 90 percent of its power sector and electrify its entire transportation sector, according to a study by the Inter-American Development Bank. Decarbonization would require replacing high-carbon energy sources like oil and gas with zero carbon sources, like solar or wind energy.As middle-income economies, the region\u2019s countries have among the highest growth rates of car ownership in the world. In lower-income countries, like many in Africa and South Asia, only a small portion of the population owns cars, while in high-income countries like the United States car ownership has already peaked.However, hydropower has become less reliable because of increasingly frequent droughts and social opposition to new projects. As a result, several countries are expanding natural-gas-fired power to provide a reliable source of baseload power. While this helps meet short-term emissions targets because natural gas is cleaner than coal or oil for power generation, these investments will encourage the use of fossil fuels for decades, making it more difficult to reach long-term goals.Cutting energy emissions is increasingly important for reducing Latin America\u2019s total carbon footprint. Historically, two-thirds of the region\u2019s emissions have come from land-use changes and one-third have been energy-related \u2014 the reverse of the world average. But more recently, deforestation has fallen, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, and energy has emerged as one of the primary drivers of emissions growth in the region.To meet the ambitious Paris agreement Latin American countries would have to build infrastructure that supports low-carbon energy systems. At the same time, they will need to increase hydropower generation to ensure more sources of baseload power and expand electrical grid integration, both domestically and regionally, to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy.Enormous investments must also be made in electric vehicles and public transportation. Consumers should be encouraged to adopt these cleaner options through incentives like tax breaks, congestion charges and preferential parking and driving lanes. Capacity for electricity generation will also need to expand substantially to accommodate increased electricity demand for transportation. The low cost of renewables in Latin America could help accelerate its transition to sustainable energy.Many of the commitments that Latin American countries made under the Paris agreement include conditional pledges dependent on international finance and technology transfer. This month\u2019s climate talks are expected to clarify access to such assistance.The climate goals for the next decades will require major transformations in the way people consume energy as well as technological breakthroughs to find new energy uses and sources. In Latin America, countries will have to define their own paths, but they all need to start planning their long-term climate change strategies today.Lisa Viscidi is the director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue, where Rebecca O\u2019Connor is a program assistant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Slump Coming?", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byLet\u2019s be clear: Installing Donald Trump in the White House is an epic mistake. In the long run, its consequences may well be apocalyptic, if only because we have probably lost our last, best chance to rein in runaway climate change.In fact, don\u2019t be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years.Why am I, on reflection, relatively sanguine about the short-term effects of putting such a terrible man, with such a terrible team, in power? The answer is a mix of general principles and the specifics of our current economic situation.First, the general principles: There is always a disconnect between what is good for society, or even the economy, in the long run, and what is good for economic performance over the next few quarters. Failure to take action on climate may doom civilization, but it\u2019s not clear why it should depress next year\u2019s consumer spending.Beyond these general principles, the specifics of our economic situation mean that for a time, at least, a Trump administration might actually end up doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.Many economists have known this all along. But they have been ignored, partly because much of the political establishment has been obsessed with the evils of debt, partly because Republicans have been against anything the Obama administration proposes.True, handing out windfalls to rich people and companies that will probably sit on a lot of the money is a bad, low-bang-for-the-buck way to boost the economy, and I have my doubts about whether the promised surge in infrastructure spending will really happen. But an accidental, badly designed stimulus would still, in the short run, be better than no stimulus at all.In short, don\u2019t expect an immediate Trump slump.Now, in the longer run Trumpism will be a very bad thing for the economy, in a couple of ways. For one thing, even if we don\u2019t face a recession right now, stuff happens, and a lot depends on the effectiveness of the policy response. Yet we\u2019re about to see a major degradation in both the quality and the independence of public servants. If we face a new economic crisis \u2014 perhaps as a result of the dismantling of financial reform \u2014 it\u2019s hard to think of people less prepared to deal with it.And Trumpist policies will, in particular, hurt, not help, the American working class; eventually, promises to bring back the good old days \u2014 yes, to make America great again \u2014 will be revealed as the cruel joke they are. More on that in future columns.But all of this will probably take time; the consequences of the new regime\u2019s awfulness won\u2019t be apparent right away. Opponents of that regime need to be prepared for the real possibility that good things will happen to bad people, at least for a while.Advertisement"}

Even when it seems as if there were nowhere left to go, the city, with its manifold appetites, could not be contained. Thanks to new concrete technologies, we have witnessed an eruption of very slender, very tall (some might say very crass) buildings. But for every heroic skyscraper, there are more than a few more humble, human-scale ventures \u2014 a salt shed, a library, a residential hyperbolic paraboloid (see No. 10, above).Test your New York City skyline knowledge and see how many of these buildings you recognize.Today, apart from the Empire State or Chrysler Building, there are few icons of the skyline.

In particular, some small midblock apartment buildings that used to just be generic redbrick monstrosities are now getting designed with some character. Chelsea Modern is just a very solid piece of architecture that exceeds the ordinary. It\u2019s an interesting facade that pushes and pulls you.

As far as a beacon, you could do far worse. It\u2019s not fake, either, but an exemplar of adaptive reuse. Most people who are visiting the Wythe, they have no use for an old barrel factory. You\u2019re not displacing people, but you do have this very industrial-ish waterfront area that is very recognizably Williamsburg.

VIA 57 WESTManhattan, 2016Bjarke Ingels GroupThe 32-story building may resemble an off-center pyramid, but the architects prefer to describe it as a hyperbolic paraboloid. The shape developed from taking a typical apartment block and stretching out the northwestern corner to increase views of the Hudson River.\u201cMany of the new towers currently going up are those pencil shapes. The Bjarke Ingels project on the West Side is especially interesting because it is beginning to show that when there\u2019s collaboration between architects, designers, developers and the city, you can start to do different things. This mashing of the conventional skyscraper and a typical courtyard building generated this rather unique shape that\u2019s standing out in the skyline rather nicely. And it includes affordable units, as well, which is obviously important. The lesson would be to start experimenting on all levels. Our city is so interesting because of the diversity of its people and opinions, and you want to see that reflected in the built environment.\u201dDavid van der Leer, Executive director, Van Alen Institute11. NEW YORK BY GEHRYManhattan, 2011Gehry PartnersThis 904-unit luxury tower may be an unusual symbol of Lower Manhattan\u2019s rebirth, but with roughly $200 million in post-Sept. 11 bond financing, the 76-story edifice is a reminder of the many ways the area has been reshaped since 2001.12. THE NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ARTManhattan, 2007SanaaExquisite execution with simple materials is one of the chief attributes of Japanese design, which helps explain how Sanaa turned some offset boxes of aluminum mesh into a beloved museum. And all for a mere $50 million (the new Whitney Museum of American Art cost almost nine times that).\u201cThe jagged skyline of the building, surrounded mostly by brownstones and tenements, really creates a stunning contrast that so speaks to what it is.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio Increases New York\u2019s Budget by $1.3 Billion", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byThe de Blasio administration announced late on Thursday that it now anticipated spending over $1.3 billion more than it had originally forecast in the current budget, part of an annual recalibration of spending and revenue in New York City that takes place each November.The new $83.5 billion plan does include new savings from city agencies of roughly half a billion dollars, and another $151 million in savings from adjustments to the projected cost of debt service. The savings were amassed through many small changes across the municipal government, including moving away from paper billing, having agencies share more vehicles to reduce the number of unused vehicles in the city\u2019s fleet, and even by better managing how New York deals with dirt.Officials found that the city spent a significant amount of money on storing dirt dug out of the ground during construction projects; now, the city is projecting savings by better matching those projects with others where the dirt is needed, said Carol Kellermann, the president of the independent Citizens Budget Commission, who was briefed on the changes on Thursday morning.But Ms. Kellermann said the biggest issue in the revised numbers was the underperformance of the city\u2019s pension accounts, which required New York to inject another $120 million to cover obligations in the next fiscal year. (At this rate, budget experts said, the city would in a few years be spending about $10 billion of its budget on pension costs.)The Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, celebrated the focus on savings but said in a joint statement with Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, a fellow Democrat who is the finance chairwoman, that they \u201cremained concerned about rising shelter costs and pension obligations.\u201dThe plan appeared to reflect an effort by Mr. de Blasio to account for headwinds in the economy and uncertainty in the city\u2019s financial future, budget experts said. That uncertainty has only grown with the election of Donald J. Trump, a Republican; New York City receives billions from the federal government each year.But the increase in overall spending, which includes $1 billion set aside in reserves by the administration, did not appear to come from the city\u2019s own coffers.\u201cFunding from city funds seems to be flat,\u201d said Doug Turetsky, of the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office. \u201cAny increase in the overall budget seems to be driven by state and federal aid.\u201dThe budget has grown steadily under Mr. de Blasio, as he has expanded social services, signed contracts with unions, expanded the Police Department and moved to address a steady rise in the number of homeless New Yorkers.Advertisement"}

Kennedy Airport in New York City to Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The trip costs $6,588 for two, compared with $10,190 if airfare and hotel were booked separately.And because the Mandarin Barcelona is a part of Virtuoso, members who book this package receive the property\u2019s Virtuoso amenities such as an upgrade, if space is available, and breakfast.Lola, a free chat-based iPhone membership app, is also a Virtuoso member, with around 1,100 of the app\u2019s 250,000 bookable hotels being Virtuoso properties where clients receive extra benefits, said Lola\u2019s chief marketing officer, Robert Birge.One example is the Ritz Paris, where perks might include a room upgrade, early check-in and checkout, breakfast and airport transfers.Lola and Skylark are coming into the market at an opportune time, said the travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, the founder of Atmosphere Research Group, because affluent consumers rely on digital technology for much of their travel planning. But these high-income travelers also use travel agents, and both search engines offer a chance to work with agents.Booking and Expedia, both around since 1996, are also getting into the luxury game.On Booking.com, reservations at five-star properties grew 40 percent from September 2015 to September 2016, compared with the same period a year earlier, said Leslie Cafferty, a vice president and head of global communications.Expedia, meanwhile, is pursuing luxury travelers with the premium package business it introduced last year \u2014 the packages pair flights in business and first class with upscale hotels and sell them to consumers for an average of 20 percent savings, compared with the cost if each were booked separately.\u201cThere is a shrinking price gap between economy and premium cabin airfare, and we saw an opportunity to offer discounted packages that bundle these airfares with stays at luxury hotels,\u201d said Sarah Gavin, a spokeswoman for the company.Some luxury hotels see an upside to being a part of third-party travel sites.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Signals It\u2019s on Track to Raise Interest Rates in December", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday continued its slow march toward higher interest rates, signaling that it remains on track to raise its benchmark interest in December for the first time this year but holding off on an increase this month.After a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed delivered the expected news that it would not adjust rates during the final days of a contentious presidential election. But the Fed\u2019s post-meeting statement reinforced expectations that Fed officials do not plan to wait much longer.\u201cThe committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives,\u201d the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, said.The language was carefully calibrated to go just a little further than the Fed\u2019s statement after its previous meeting in September.The Fed\u2019s assessment of economic conditions was also just a little more upbeat than the September statement. The most significant change reflected evidence of stronger inflation. The November statement said inflation \u201chas increased somewhat,\u201d rising closer to the Fed\u2019s preferred annual pace of 2 percent.The health of the economy has continued to improve. The unemployment rate stood at 5 percent in September, close to a historically normal level. Inflation rose 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, up from 0.8 percent during the 12 months ending in July. And the economy expanded at an annual pace of 2.9 percent in the third quarter.Two Fed officials dissented. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, both voted to raise rates a quarter-point. But Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who voted to raise rates in September, this time voted with the majority.Mr. Rosengren said before the meeting that he did not see much difference between raising rates in November and raising rates in December, suggesting he was willing to wait a few more weeks for the Fed to act.The Fed signaled after its last meeting in September that it would raise rates \u201crelatively soon,\u201d as long as economic growth continued. But it was widely anticipated that the Fed would not move at its November meeting, just days before a contentious presidential election.Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.Higher rates slow economic growth. But proponents of a rate increase argue that raising rates slowly could extend the current economic expansion. If the Fed waits, they say, it may then need to raise rates more sharply, which has often pushed the economy into recession.But a December increase is not a foregone conclusion. The Fed has repeatedly backed away from planned increases when the economic data has taken a turn for the worse. Officials entered the year predicting four rate increases; if they do move in December, it would be the first.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pulling Democrats Back to \u2018It\u2019s the Economy, Stupid\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Democrats\u2019 stunning defeat in the presidential race and continued struggles in lower-level contests have jolted party leaders into concluding that their emphasis on cultural issues has all but crippled them by diverting voters\u2019 attention from the core Democratic message of economic fairness.But even as Democrats agree about the need to promote their agenda more aggressively for the middle class and voters of modest means, especially in parts of the country where the party has suffered grievous losses, they are divided over how aggressively to position themselves on the economic left, with battle lines already forming over the lightning-rod issue of foreign trade.While the country has moved steadily to the left on such social issues as same-sex marriage and gender equity, it is increasingly apparent that Democrats cannot win in much of the country without a more coherent and overriding economic message.The debate over what that message should be comes not only against the backdrop of Hillary Clinton\u2019s astonishing loss to Donald J. Trump \u2014 a race decided by a handful of Rust Belt states that for decades had favored Democratic nominees \u2014 but also after the third campaign in the past four election cycles in which the party was routed across vast sections of the nation, leaving Democrats out of power in both chambers of Congress and in most governors\u2019 mansions.The direction the party chooses now could have ramifications for years to come: In 2018, Democrats face Senate races in 10 states that favored Mr. Trump. And there will be 38 elections for governor in the next two years that could decide whether Democrats are able to play a role in drawing more favorable congressional maps after the 2020 census.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have Democratic governors there to veto these maps after the 2020 redistricting, the next 10 years for us in Congress and state legislatures are going to be brutal,\u201d said Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, the only Southern state that Mrs. Clinton carried last week.Over President Obama\u2019s two terms, Democrats have embraced a down-the-line cultural liberalism that energized his coalition of millennials, minorities and college-educated whites.But the growing nationalization of politics and the Democrats\u2019 drift to the left doomed a number of candidates running in more conservative states during the 2014 midterm elections, when turnout fell.Yet despite Democrats\u2019 near extinction in much of the South and in parts of the Great Plains \u2014 two regions that had for decades elected Democrats to statewide office \u2014 the party had little in the way of a debate about Mr. Obama\u2019s approach.Now, without rebuking the still-popular president directly, many Democrats share a growing recognition that Mr. Obama\u2019s way may not be the best course in a country where many voters have experienced little income growth and where high-paying jobs can be scarce.Even Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the presumptive incoming Democratic leader and someone who is eyed warily by the left, has taken steps to signal that he recognizes the need to embrace a more populist economic orientation.\u201cThe party started looking at people through interest group coalitions, and we thought, \u2018If we talk to them all in different ways, that will be enough to cobble together an election coalition,\u2019\u201d said Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona. \u201cBut I think there is a common interest in our economic policies between the laid-off white worker in Flint, the African-American and the Latino in Phoenix.\u201dRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the growing importance of social issues in the national debate and Democrats\u2019 reliance on wealthy donors on the two coasts who are more focused on cultural liberalism than on economic solidarity had, together, left the party somewhat disconnected from the working class.\u201cSocial issues now have become central, rather than class issues,\u201d said Ms. Weingarten, who recommended what she called a \u201cboth/and\u201d approach.Such talk bears a striking resemblance to the fierce debates Democrats engaged in 30 years ago when they suffered repeated White House losses and many party moderates concluded that they were too captive to interest-group politics. Except now, it is not centrists calling for a greater focus on economic issues, but a broader constellation of Democrats.\u201cThe Democratic Party can no longer be led by the liberal elite,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, calling for a party \u201cprepared to stand up to Wall Street and the greed of corporate America.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who may run in 2020, sounded a similar message in a speech last week to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., ignoring Mrs. Clinton entirely, praising Mr. Sanders and calling on her party to address the economic grievances that she conceded \u201cPresident-elect Trump spoke to\u201d in the campaign.The Democratic shift toward a more unapologetic brand of populist economics gained steam when Mr. Sanders electrified many on the left, and even some more moderate party activists across the Midwest, in his primary race against Mrs. Clinton.Yet while Mr. Sanders\u2019s brand of confrontational populism \u2014 characterized by his fierce attacks on international trade and Wall Street \u2014 may be favored by many liberal activists, it does not sit well with party leaders who fear that his call for an economic \u201crevolution\u201d may turn off moderate voters.\u201cAmericans want to hear a stronger economic message from the party,\u201d said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, \u201cbut this shouldn\u2019t be about a revolution, but about fairness.\u201dOther Democrats are more explicit about their concerns with Mr. Sanders\u2019s broadsides, especially on trade, which Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump used to great effect in the campaign. It is an issue that highlights regional differences among Democrats from states that have been hit hard by manufacturing plants\u2019 being shut down and replaced overseas, and those from states that depend on a robust export market.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can be anti-trade,\u201d said Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who is mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. \u201cIn the modern world, we need consumers overseas for our products as well.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a market for our products,\u201d said Ms. Heitkamp, who has implored her party to have a more robust rural agenda.What is striking, though, is that there is no larger appetite in the party to move fully toward the political centrism that marked Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.Jason Kander, a Missouri Democrat who lost to Senator Roy Blunt by just three percentage points while Mrs. Clinton lost the state by 19, dismissed what he called \u201cthe old construct about Blue Dogs,\u201d referring to the moderate-to-conservative Democratic group that was once robust in the South and in border states.\u201cI ran on a progressive message: economic fairness, college affordability and equality for the L.G.B.T. community,\u201d Mr. Kander said. \u201cWe should not hide from our beliefs or apologize. We should lean in, full force.\u201dMore worrisome to a range of Democrats is that they are struggling in states with significant rural populations, where some of the most competitive Senate races in two years will take place: North Dakota, Missouri, Montana and West Virginia.\u201cWe have to be bigger than a coastal party,\u201d said Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who eked out re-election last week and went deer hunting with his son over the weekend.The good news for Democratic officeholders and candidates \u2014 and something many of them gingerly brought up \u2014 is that they may fare better the next two years thanks to Mr. Trump than they would have if Mrs. Clinton had been elected. The party of the sitting president often loses seats in the first midterm election, and many Democrats expect a backlash to Mr. Trump if he is unable to fulfill his grandiose promises.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier, certainly, to be able to run against the White House and have that contrast,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.Mr. McAuliffe said the Democratic governors had convened a conference call after the election to begin planning for governors\u2019 races. He said he planned to push for a larger session with congressional Democratic leaders in the coming weeks to impress on them how important those contests would be to the party\u2019s future.\u201cIt\u2019s time for everybody to get in the game,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said.One Democrat who seems ready to do just that is Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and acolyte of Mr. Sanders\u2019s who is eyeing a run for her state\u2019s governorship in 2018.In an interview, Ms. Turner made clear that she had an unambiguous, and familiar, focus. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Taps Hollywood\u2019s Mnuchin for Treasury and Dines With Romney", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Steven Mnuchin, a financier with deep roots on Wall Street and in Hollywood but no government experience, is expected to be named Donald J. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, people close to the transition say.Mr. Mnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and his selection would elevate a wealthy loyalist to a pivotal economic post. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling hits like the \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise and \u201cAvatar.\u201dIf confirmed, Mr. Mnuchin would play a critical role in carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s promised economic policy changes, including the enactment of a large package of tax cuts, sweeping changes to foreign trade agreements and the fulfillment of a huge new infrastructure spending program. He could also help lead any efforts to roll back President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and the administration\u2019s opening to Cuba by reimposing sanctions on Tehran and Havana.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s selection fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign attacks on the financial industry. Mr. Trump, in a campaign ad intended as a closing argument, portrayed the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as the personification of a global elite that the ad said had \u201crobbed our working class.\u201dThe selection of Mr. Mnuchin (pronounced mi-NEW-chin) came as Mr. Trump moved on Tuesday to fill the ranks of his domestic policy team with seasoned Washington insiders chosen to help smooth the way in Congress for his two marquee campaign promises: the repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s health insurance coverage law and the large package to repair infrastructure, which could reach $1 trillion.Mr. Trump also took time Tuesday night to have dinner with Mitt Romney, whose name has been mentioned as a potential secretary of state, and who has become a source of contention among members of the transition team.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who called Mr. Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d during the Republican primaries, sat down for a four-course meal Tuesday night at Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan.Mr. Romney emerged several hours later to heap compliments on the president-elect, who has bristled privately that Mr. Romney never apologized for insulting him during the race.There was no apology, but Mr. Romney said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory speech on election night, his transition effort and his personnel decisions.\u201cHe did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing: He won the general election,\u201d Mr. Romney told reporters.And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump will announce Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor, as his secretary of commerce, according to the transition team.The moves suggested that Mr. Trump was seeking experienced policy makers who have deep relationships in Washington to shepherd his most sweeping pledges.Ms. Chao, who was born in Taiwan, brings a third woman to cabinet-level positions in a Trump administration and an additional degree of diversity to the president-elect\u2019s team, so far filled largely with conservative white men who have scoffed at political convention.Democrats said they were cautiously optimistic about working with Ms. Chao to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. \u201cI hope Secretary Chao shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work with Democrats to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs along the way,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is set to become the new minority leader.But Ms. Chao was quickly criticized by liberal groups who said she was emblematic of the very corporate-driven political establishment Mr. Trump had promised to dismantle. Some policy analysts argued that as labor secretary she had inadequately protected employee rights, and the Center for American Progress called her selection an \u201cominous sign for workers.\u201dThe selection of Mr. Price, who has served in Congress since 2005, revealed deeper partisan divisions.Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called Mr. Price \u201ca brilliant choice,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m glad that we\u2019ll have a doctor who knows health care inside and out leading the way.\u201dBut Democrats and their allies voiced alarm.Richard J. Fiesta, the executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which represents retired union members, said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the selection of Mr. Price. Marcia D. Greenberger, a president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, a research and advocacy group, said Mr. Price \u201cwould have a devastating impact on women\u2019s health.\u201dIn Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump has an ally whose nomination is expected to be well received on Wall Street, a number of traders and bankers contacted on Tuesday said.Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, United States equity markets have hit record highs, with financial institutions leading the way. Having a Treasury secretary with broad experience as a financier is likely to sustain the view that a Trump administration will look favorably on Wall Street, not least in terms of pulling back some regulations put in place by Mr. Obama.Mr. Mnuchin was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump won New York\u2019s Republican presidential primary contest in April, Mr. Mnuchin attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation to become the campaign\u2019s national finance chairman.Mr. Mnuchin, the son of a Goldman Sachs partner, joined the firm after graduating from Yale. He worked there for 17 years, rising to oversee trading in government securities and mortgage bonds.He would be the third Goldman Sachs alumnus to serve as Treasury secretary, and the announcement of his appointment drew swift condemnation from liberal groups who said he had cashed in on the country\u2019s financial collapse.\u201cHe purchased a bailed-out bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families,\u201d Jon Green, a spokesman for the Take on Wall Street campaign, said in a statement. \u201cAnyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.\u201dThe group was apparently referring to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s role in 2009 in a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government. He became the chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation\u2019s largest small-business lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid.During Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed a complaint with the federal government, claiming that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods.Mr. Mnuchin has conducted past business deals with the president-elect \u2014 but not always under the best of circumstances. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, helped finance construction of a Trump project in Chicago. In 2008, Mr. Trump sued Dune and other lenders to extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled.The selections on Tuesday came as Mr. Trump huddled with advisers and potential cabinet officials in Trump Tower in Manhattan.Among the issues is whether Mr. Trump should name Mr. Romney as his secretary of state. After their dinner, Mr. Romney told reporters that Mr. Trump \u201ccontinues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct since winning the election gives \u201cme increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "Californians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California, Massachusetts and Nevada legalized marijuana on Tuesday in what advocates said was a reflection of the country\u2019s changing attitude toward the drug.Leading up to the election, recreational marijuana use was legal in four states: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, along with Washington, D.C.With the addition of California, Massachusetts and Nevada, the percentage of Americans living in states where marijuana use is legal for adults rose above 20 percent, from 5 percent.Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon and a supporter of legalization, said Tuesday\u2019s votes would add to the pressure on the federal government to treat cannabis like alcohol, allowing each state to decide on its own regulations.\u201cThe new administration is not going to want to continue this toxic and nonproductive war on drugs,\u201d Mr. Blumenauer said.The federal government\u2019s ban on the drug precludes the interstate sale of cannabis, even among the states that have approved its use. But Tuesday\u2019s votes created a marijuana bloc stretching down the West Coast, and Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, said he saw an opportunity for the states where recreational marijuana is now legal to \u201ccoordinate and collaborate\u201d on the issue, including applying pressure in Washington to relax the federal ban.Support is rising even though some public health experts warn that there have been insufficient studies of the drug\u2019s effects and that law enforcement agencies lack reliable tests and protocols to determine whether a driver is impaired by marijuana.Supporters in California portrayed legalization as both a social justice and a criminal justice issue, saying the measure would help redress the disproportionate numbers of arrests and convictions among minorities for drug crimes.\u201cI think of this victory in California as a major victory,\u201d said Lauren Mendelsohn, the chairwoman of the board of directors of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, a group that has campaigned against the government\u2019s war on drugs. \u201cIt shows the whole country that prohibition is not the answer to the marijuana question.\u201dMs. Mendelsohn spoke at a celebration in Oakland for the passage of Proposition 64, as California\u2019s legalization measure was known.As of Nov. 6, pro-legalization committees in the state had raised around $23 million, according to the California secretary of state\u2019s office. Chief among the backers were marijuana companies and tech entrepreneurs, including Sean Parker, a founder of the file-sharing service Napster and a former president of Facebook, who was the single largest donor to the campaign. The anti-legalization campaign had spent less than $2 million in California.Kevin Sabet, the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, one of the country\u2019s major funders against marijuana legalization initiatives, attributed the imbalance in campaign spending to investments by marijuana companies hoping to profit if the industry was legalized.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made if marijuana is legal, not a lot of money to be made if it remains illegal,\u201d he said.Opponents of legalization say the adoption of medical marijuana laws in more than 25 states has led to a popular perception that cannabis is good for you. They have called for more studies on the drug\u2019s long-term effects, particularly on the developing brains of young people.\u201cThere is likely medical promise in the marijuana plant, but that is different than saying smoked marijuana is medicine,\u201d Mr. Sabet said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t smoke the opium plant to get the beneficial effects of morphine.\u201dA bill to legalize marijuana in Vermont, supported by Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, failed earlier this year. But in Massachusetts, public support for legalization rose during the fall, even with bipartisan opposition from the state\u2019s top elected officials \u2014 including Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, and Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat \u2014 and an organized anti-legalization campaign.Lawmakers in Rhode Island were watching Massachusetts closely, and they are expected to take up a legalization measure of their own now that one has passed there.Two other states \u2014 Arizona and Maine \u2014 were voting on recreational marijuana legalization Tuesday. Arizona voted against the measure. In Maine, a state with a libertarian streak that began decriminalizing marijuana decades ago, the referendum on legalization drew scant funded opposition.Still, proponents of legalization said California would represent the biggest victory because of its huge economy and population and also its fertile soil and amenable climate.Tuesday\u2019s vote reinforced the state\u2019s position as the epicenter of marijuana cultivation for the country, a role it has had illicitly for decades. Marijuana companies have been positioning themselves for the prospect of interstate commerce, buying large plots of land in areas that now grow vegetables and other crops.The California measure, which passed with 56 percent approval, allows people over 21 to possess limited amounts of marijuana for personal use and also permits the personal cultivation of up to six plants in private residences, provided they are shielded from public view. The sale of recreational marijuana will not be allowed until licenses are issued, a process that will take at least two years, said Steve DeAngelo, the founder of Harborside, a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland.California officials expect additional tax revenue of around $1 billion from marijuana sales. The revenue is earmarked for the study of medical marijuana, for the California Highway Patrol to develop procedures to determine driver impairment due to marijuana consumption, for youth education on drugs, and for the prevention of environmental damage from marijuana production, among other programs.A large majority of Republicans in the poll, 65 percent, were against the measure, compared with 72 percent support among Democrats.In addition to Tuesday\u2019s votes on recreational marijuana, Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota had medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot. All four passed the legislation.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston and Melissa Wen from Oakland, Calif.videoAdvertisement"}

For a growing number of individuals and families, those days are long gone.Today\u2019s investors increasingly want other kinds of returns as well. They want to travel with friends to faraway places, collect fine wines \u2014 and even own the winery. They want to scour galleries for the next up-and-coming artist or style. They want to take action to aid people or areas in need, spending a vacation helping to build a school in Africa, perhaps, rather than just lounging on a secluded beach.Bottom line: Investors want to put their money into products and companies they admire, causes they care about and personal passions that bring them joy.\u201cThey can purchase a $100,000 Tesla to minimize their use of fossil fuels,\u201d says Tom Corley, author of \u201cRich Habits: The Daily Success Habits of Wealthy Individuals.\u201d \u201cThey can create a financial plan that invests their money in companies producing products that are in line with what's important to them.\u201dIn fact, says Demetri Argyropoulos, founder of business-advisory firm Avant Global, those who own equity in a brand are 54 percent more likely to use that brand\u2019s product.For health-minded people, organic foods have become mainstream as genetic modification and pesticides have ingrained themselves in our food supply.Many cities and states now require recycling.

In addition to its environmental benefits, this technology is helping to create better ways to harness the energy.Solar power has been around for decades, but technology has finally caught up as demand is increasing for more environmentally friendly energy sources.Turn on the news and you will see companies jumping toward renewable energies. The growth within the market has been exponential as technologies create new kinds of renewable energy and better ways to harness it.Of all the things driving change in the art world, technology has had the greatest impact, fueling a jump in online art-buying as well as new ways to create art.The urge to see the world has combined with the urge to do good, essentially creating a new way of vacationing. Millennials in particular are driving this cultural change.A cultural shift to be more environmentally conscious has created a surge in the use of sustainable fabrics. Technology is only helping to grow the industry as it creates new fabrics.Technology has helped the 3D-printing market grow exponentially, which has fueled cultural exploration. The technique is now being used in everything from fashion design to medical innovation.Private aviation is a growing market among affluent individuals because of the experiences it offers. As the technology has gotten better, the cost has also gone down, increasing demand.Working out is more than just exercise, it has become an experience unto itself. This cultural movement is especially seen in the boutique gym market and the devotion of its members. Health food has been a cornerstone of the wellness movement as living a healthy lifestyle has become a kind of cultural movement. Healthy food is also impacting the environment as people look to \u201ceat clean.\u201dBicycles are more than just an evironmentally friendly way to get around.

For Dascal, health is a way of life. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have your health, you have nothing,\u201d she says.Dascal started investing in health-and-wellness companies before most of her peers. Now, though, many of her friends are also buying wellness products, adopting healthier lifestyles and seeking rejuvenating experiences. \u201cPeople are now very interested in this,\u201d she says.The rise of small, high-end gyms supports that perception. In 2016, boutique gyms accounted for 42 percent of the total U.S. fitness-club market, double what it was in 2014. Members typically paid $80 to $140 a month for access to these gyms in 2014, significantly more than the $52 average for overall gym memberships. Organic foods and immersive wellness experiences \u2014 including healthy-eating retreats, outdoor fitness challenges and expert seminars on wellness-related topics \u2014 are also doing well. This growth is being seen in the uptick in IPOs of health and wellness companies over the past couple of years, including well-known gyms and healthy-snack makers.Investing in sustainability is another way people are putting their values to work \u2014 installing solar panels on their roofs, holding shares or making direct investments in renewable-energy technology, buying organic foods and purchasing electric cars. One indicator of the strength of the market for environmentally friendly products is the revenue gains enjoyed by electric-car manufacturers, who have built their business on the premise that people will pay a significant premium for sustainable products. From 2013 to 2015, Tesla\u2019s revenue doubled, to about $4 billion.And with individuals now building more environmentally friendly homes, interest in Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Powerwall is growing. The home battery will use electricity generated by solar panels to power the house. In some setups, homeowners will even be able to sell unused power back to the grid.Another area attracting investors with a purpose: water. David Wilson, head of the strategic analysts group at Capgemini, which tracks the habits of affluent individuals, says he\u2019s seeing people make direct investments in technology firms that support water purification or companies aiming to improve water sustainability in emerging markets. \u201cThey\u2019re making investment choices based on clearly defined objectives,\u201d Wilson says.As a result, desalination companies are likely to become a major focus. As droughts have become more frequent and widespread, there\u2019s greater urgency to develop cheaper and more efficient ways to remove the salt from seawater to make it drinkable. Once that technology is up and running, investors in these projects are likely to want to travel to see the results of their efforts in action.40% of high-net worth individuals consider themselves early adopters of technologyMany investors are also passionate about technology \u2014 they want everything from mobile gadgets and smart-home devices to optimized financial technology and personal robots. Some 40 percent of individuals in this income bracket say they are early adopters of technology, according to a study by Accenture.The same report found that 87 percent of investors with a net worth of at least $750,000 are using digital products to handle their financial needs. They\u2019re also upping their investments in FinTech-related endeavors \u2014 895 projects in 2015, four times more than in 2010. Meanwhile, venture capital firms have poured more than $4 billion into wearable-technology players in the past two years, up from just $333 million in 2011.Then, of course, there\u2019s the investment that has beckoned the heart and the portfolio of the affluent from time immemorial: art.The value of the online art market is estimated to increase by 193 percent between now and 2020In 2015, financial advisors surveyed by Knight Frank\u2019s Wealth Trends reported 63 percent of their clients were becoming more interested in buying paintings and sculpture. Wilson says he\u2019s seen a rise in art collecting among the wealthy, noting that \u201cpeople buy art for the aesthetic value \u2014 they can get a personal benefit from it every day, while at the same time it\u2019s an uncorrelated asset.\u201dThe difference today is that it\u2019s so much easier for potential collectors to explore what\u2019s out there than it used to be. Galleries are everywhere \u2014 not just in major international hotspots. But perhaps even more important has been the rise of online purveyors of paintings and sculpture, all vying to disrupt the closed and secretive global network of high-end art exchange. Online art sales rose 24 percent year-over-year in 2015, and the value of the online art market is forecast to soar 193 percent by 2020.Finding the best ways to invest in your values and passions isn\u2019t easy, but a financial advisor with experience counseling the wealthy can help, says Corley. \u201cThe good ones are continuously updating their knowledge (of investment options.)\u201dMeanwhile, investors\u2019 determination to use their money to express who they really are will no doubt continue to spread and strengthen. \u201cPeople are living longer,\u201d says Argyropoulos. \u201cSo they want to make a difference while they\u2019re alive. They want to be able to realize their dreams while they can.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "In Brazil, Inward-Looking Investors Eye Opportunities Outside", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionTurim Family Office and Investment Management, a Brazilian wealth management firm led by Gustavo Marini, had a front-row seat. The office is within walking distance to the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, the site of the Olympic rowing events in August, and to some of the Rio Olympics\u2019 hobnobbing hospitality suites like Club France \u2014 where the swimmer Ryan Lochte\u2019s infamous adventure began.Now all is quiet on the lagoon, and Latin America\u2019s largest economy remains mired in its worst recession in decades. So what can an investor in Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy, do?Cariocas can often seem insular. That attitude is evident among the wealthy and business classes here, where old money predominates. When new Brazilian entrepreneurs start companies, they usually move to S\u00e3o Paulo rather than to here.Yet Turim and its founding partner, Mr. Marini, who is 57 and a Carioca, seek to chart a different course. He and his partners increasingly say they need to be proactive to diversify their portfolio better even if Brazil\u2019s economy eventually recovers \u2014 and they are cautiously optimistic that it will.The firm\u2019s partners visited India in September, and they have traveled to Silicon Valley three times this year. Despite widespread concerns over \u201cBrexit,\u201d they are keeping one partner, Nelson Isaac Abrah\u00e3o Jr., in London to lead overseas investments.Turim, founded in 1999, had about $1.38 billion (4.50 billion Reais) in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2015, according to an annual filing with Brazil\u2019s securities regulator, the C.V.M.Brazil\u2019s family offices, which manage assets for very rich families, hold immense wealth, but they have an aversion to risk that has long puzzled foreign institutional investors. During an interview at his firm, Mr. Marini said at least four times, \u201cWe are very conservative investors.\u201dStill, Turim is among the largest and most respected family offices. One private equity firm manager called it \u201cthe most sophisticated.\u201dTurim\u2019s bullishness on India, even though the country is a tiny part of its portfolio, is noteworthy. The business classes in India and Brazil still know very little about each other and do very little business together. But Turim is impressed with the economic management of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. \u201cHe is doing a good job with economic reforms,\u201d said Mr. Marini, who visited the country with Mr. Abrah\u00e3o.The firm made its first small investment there in public equities. Turim also plans to invest in the country\u2019s private equity market. Over all, India \u201cis a huge opportunity,\u201d Mr. Marini said.In 2015, the firm made its maiden investment in Silicon Valley, in the NEA 15 fund run by the venture capital firm NEA.In London, Mr. Abrah\u00e3o is monitoring the continuing fallout from the Brexit vote. He said that the business intelligence concentrated in London would most likely continue unabated, which would help the firm make decisions on investments in Asia from that office. \u201cLondon will still be a gateway to Asia,\u201d Mr. Abrah\u00e3o said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think any other city in Europe is equal.\u201dTurim invested overseas in its early days, but no more than about 30 percent of its total assets. That started to increase in 2011 as Brazil\u2019s economy showed signs of problems, and reached 60 percent by the second half of last year.The firm is not a stranger to global transactions. It invested in deals to acquire Heinz in 2013 and Kraft in 2015, led by the global investment firm 3G Capital, whose founders include the Cariocas Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Herrmann Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira.Until now, the firm has allocated much of its capital to Brazilian treasuries, which have payouts that are indexed to inflation plus interest rates. Brazil has long had some of the highest interest rates among emerging economies, giving family offices an easy way to make money.But in October, the country\u2019s central bank lowered its benchmark Selic rate to 14 percent, from 14.25 percent, the first decrease since 2012. That may be a sign of things to come. \u201cWe think interest rates will continue to fall,\u201d Mr. Marini said.That will create new investment opportunities in Brazil. \u201cWe are increasing our exposure to public equities in Brazil,\u201d he said, adding that infrastructure was likely to rebound and become attractive.Mr. Marini said he and his partners also saw signs of a Brazilian rebound. They think the current crisis will force the country to finally confront needed economic reforms, and they like the economic team of the new government.\u201cI think we currently have the right conditions for these reforms to pass,\u201d Mr. Marini said, which would mean \u201ca real opportunity for Brazil.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also raises questions about the company\u2019s growth plans as it looks to expand beyond ride-hailing to food delivery and other online services.In its defense at the hearing, the company framed itself as a new player in Europe\u2019s often lackluster digital economy, offering users and drivers new ways to connect and helping to support cities\u2019 existing transportation networks.\u201cUber\u2019s services can\u2019t be reduced to merely a transport service,\u201d Cani Fern\u00e1ndez, Uber\u2019s lawyer, told the Court of Justice during a lengthy session here that also included arguments from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and several European countries.If the company is defined as a transportation service, it must comply with national laws that may restrict how Uber grows in Europe.Yet if the judges rule the company is just an intermediary that connects drivers with passengers, legal experts say, Uber may gain greater freedom to offer more transportation, food delivery and other services to European consumers.\u201cWe can\u2019t allow for a business model to develop in Europe that could undermine the rights of consumers,\u201d said Montse Balagu\u00e9, a lawyer for the Spanish taxi association that filed the original complaint against Uber to a Barcelona-based judge in 2014. A year later, the same judge referred the case to the European Court of Justice to decide how to define Uber\u2019s services \u2014 a ruling that will apply across the 28-member bloc.\u201cWe must not be misled by labels,\u201d Ms. Balagu\u00e9 said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a transport service provided, then a company can\u2019t hide behind a thin veil, calling itself a different service.\u201dSeveral American states have taken legal action to question whether Uber\u2019s drivers are independent contractors \u2014 as the company claims \u2014 or should be offered workers\u2019 rights as employees.On Tuesday, Uber received backing from several European countries, including the Netherlands, where the company has its European headquarters, as well as the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. In legal briefings to the court, lawyers for these countries and the commission stressed that the company could not be defined as a transportation service under European law.Other countries, including Spain and France, sided with the Spanish taxi association, putting forward arguments that tried to connect Uber\u2019s digital platform with traditional transport rules.Several of the European judges also questioned Uber in the Tuesday hearing about its relationship with drivers and about who should be held responsible if a passenger was hurt.Such consumer protection issues were not part of the original case referred from the Spanish judge but could form part of the final decision when it is made next year.\u201cWhat liability does the platform have?\u201d asked Daniel Svaby, one of the European judges. \u201cThe customer doesn\u2019t know the driver who will pick her up.

{"Headline": "Why Washington Needs Wall Street", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneThe latest round of drumbeating has begun to prevent anyone with a Wall Street background from filling the top economic positions in the next administration. Not only is that not right, it hurts the American people by preventing those who have the best understanding of how financial markets work from taking a much-needed role in policing and fixing them. It is a form of discrimination. The time has come for it to stop.Not to be outdone by Mr. Reich, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont lawmaker who gave Mrs. Clinton a run for her money during the Democratic primaries, wrote in an email to The Times, \u201cWe need a secretary of the Treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street.\u201dAs I have previously written, Mr. Weiss had impeccable progressive credentials and shared many of Senator Warren\u2019s political views. But that was not good enough for her. That he had Wall Street experience meant he was unacceptable to her. And somehow, she had enough political power in Washington to block Mr. Weiss\u2019s appointment. Senator Warren wouldn\u2019t even deign to meet with Mr. Weiss. In short order, the nomination was withdrawn. (Disclosure: Mr. Weiss and I worked together for a few years as bankers at Lazard, more than 20 years ago.)But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. For the last two years, Mr. Weiss has served as a \u201ccounselor\u201d to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, an appointment that does not require Senate approval. In that role, Mr. Weiss has a leading responsibility in trying to resolve the financial crisis shaking up Puerto Rico and in trying to make the capital markets operate more smoothly. He has accomplished much during his nearly two years in Washington, even without the authority he would have had as a confirmed under secretary, and he remains highly regarded for his work there.Mr. Weiss\u2019s success in Washington makes one wonder just what Senator Warren accomplished by blocking a hearing on his nomination, other than showing us all that she could. Senator Warren\u2019s demagogy is impressive. She has lots of power and is not afraid to use it. Sometimes, she almost gets it right \u2014 for instance, when she took down John G. Stumpf, the former chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, during his Senate hearing in September about the cross-selling scandal at the bank. She called for his resignation, and he handed it in on Oct. 12. But most of the time, she goes overboard and seems like she is receiving way too much gratification getting headlines and television time for her stern and condescending lectures.The fact is that many jobs in Washington could be filled by someone with a Wall Street background to the benefit of the American people. What better way to improve the inner workings of the capital markets than by having someone with the authority to regulate them who knows precisely how they work, or how they are manipulated?There has been a long and mutually beneficial history of Wall Street types working in Washington. For instance, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who was the Treasury secretary before, during and after the 2008 financial crisis.With help from Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Paulson had the good sense to realize that what the big Wall Street companies needed eight years ago to prevent further disaster was an enormous infusion of capital to restore confidence to the financial markets at the moment they had stopped working.Contrary to what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders believe, not everyone who works on Wall Street is evil. Not everyone who works, or worked, on Wall Street or at a private equity firm or at a hedge fund should automatically be barred from government service.On the contrary, we need the best minds in our society working in government to solve our many problems \u2014 climate change, the rising cost of health care, our $20 trillion of federal debt and our annual budget deficits \u2014 and believe it or not, Senator Warren, some of our nation\u2019s best and brightest work in finance. If they are willing to give up their high-paying jobs to serve in government and can get through a Senate confirmation hearing, why in the world wouldn\u2019t we want them working for us in Washington?Advertisement"}

How did this loose-lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far? Who were the Americans supporting him and why?When I started my unusual assignment of covering the American presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent \u2014 for this, an American news organization \u2014 one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers. The bulk of them revolved around Mr. Trump, whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the party\u2019s nomination \u2014 and ultimately to the presidency.Going back through my monthslong journey across America, there were many clues to Mr. Trump\u2019s rising tide, although not all were easy to read. I drank with Trump supporters in bars and casinos. I approached them at rodeos. I chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies.The broad topography of Trump country is, in many respects, easy to trace. It is a place of anger and frustration, gripped by a feverish anti-establishment sentiment. People wanted change \u2014 and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life.Yet other factors were at play, too, in this unruly insurgency, factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly: racism, xenophobia, bigotry, talk radio, social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country. It wasn\u2019t always clear which elements were powering the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d as the movement called itself, and which were being buoyed along.In Williamson, I also saw how Mr. Trump\u2019s message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on Sunday, many Christians glossed over the candidate\u2019s three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. (\u201cIt\u2019s scary, like Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Trump told Howard Stern in 1997.)It was hard to square, but perhaps that was the lesson: that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election, one in which outrageous rule-breaking might offer a route to success.Around that time, Apple released its seventh iteration of the iPhone, that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every iPhone are the words \u201cDesigned in California. Assembled in China.\u201d As if California is a separate country. And that\u2019s how many in Trump country saw it \u2014 that instead of being part of the iPhone economy, they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas.One thing that I, like many Europeans and other foreigners, had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate self-belief. Mr. Trump, though, traded on pessimism. His slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the country\u2019s military and business, but also scapegoated immigrants, minorities and Muslims.At Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about \u201cthe blacks.\u201d Broad-brush prejudice toward Muslims was openly expressed: Danny Popma, a factory owner in Michigan, told me that children in Dearborn, which has the country\u2019s largest percentage of Muslims, had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks.The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or loutish, there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding twist, a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat categorization: a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami; a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas; a Guyanese doorman in Queens, N.Y.What was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating. Maybe these were just the hard-core loyalists. State-by-state polls suggested that Mr. Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political professionals, including Republicans, dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters.\u201cIt\u2019s like the hunt for the lost tribes of the Amazon,\u201d was how Stuart Stevens, a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, put it early on. \u201cIf you paddle your canoe far enough up the river, and bang your drum hard enough, they will come to the riverbank. But they\u2019re just not there.\u201dBut when I mentioned the polls showing Mr. Trump lagging to his supporters, they snorted derisively.Everyone they knew was voting Trump \u2014 colleagues, relatives, children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who hadn\u2019t voted for decades. The polls, they said, were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media \u2014 the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow.At the time, I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the Facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad terms, the Trump supporters were right \u2014 in key states, their votes were undercounted by pollsters.The winning margin in many states, like Michigan, was tight, and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. Daryl, the Uber driver who took me from a Trump rally to the airport, was a case in point: he was an African-American, a registered Democrat, and he did not intend to vote.\u201cNone of them look any good to me,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump, then, benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international readers: Why did so many Americans seem to hate her so much?The answer had many dimensions: Fatigue from her decades in public life, unfinished business from her husband\u2019s time in power in the 1990s, distaste for how she had handled his sexual escapades, outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street bankers, unfiltered sexism.And Mrs. Clinton simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it.In San Francisco, while I was visiting my brother, one of his friends offered an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting socks for Christmas \u2014 again \u201d he said. \u201cSocks, socks, bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like that.\u201dMr. Trump, in the end, found the \u201clost tribe\u201d of white voters. They heard his drumbeat, and voted as a bloc like never before.Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning victory echoes jolting changes in Britain, France and other countries where a new brand of right-wing politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of forces, or represented a more fundamental shift, may now be answered under the Trump presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Throwing Anna Under the Train", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s TakeDear Mr. Tolstoy:It has come to our attention that you have offered for sale a book that purports to describe the world from the point of view of a woman \u2014 even as actual women everywhere are, in practice, erased. You try to disguise your appropriation by taking this woman\u2019s name as the title of your book. But women everywhere see through your ruse. Real-life Anna Kareninas understand that you are projecting your ignorant, arrogant phallocentric fantasies onto a female character whose humanity you have stripped away.You have, in other words, appropriated the experience of a subordinate group, liquidating her actual experience to capitalize on your own privilege and exalt your own reputation. Actual women are silenced while you arrogate to yourself the overweening role of ventriloquist.From the available evidence, you are male \u2014 a white male, in fact. If you are not literally Caucasian, we know you invaded the Caucasus in your youth. Likely, it was there that you learned the ultimate male power \u2014 to kill.Although your book is praised for laying bare the inequities of the Russian feudal system, a closer reading shows that you refuse to imagine any alternative to that system. In fact, the woman who is its most tormented victim must, in the end, be struck dead, lest she live to serve as a role model for women!Were you yourself female, you would be able to penetrate, as it were, the suffering of a woman who lacks any independent means of support, reduced to dependency on a man, bouncing helplessly from her superannuated stiff of a husband to her swashbuckling, military-industrial lover, and forced to renounce her child when she attempts to fulfill her deepest desires, desires which have been inscribed in her by her lifelong subordination.Even your celebrated opening \u2014 \u201cHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\u201d \u2014 serves patriarchal interests by obscuring the way in which unhappiness is, in reality, structured. Unhappiness is neither equitably nor randomly distributed. It is structured, in fact, by the dominance of the male and the subordination of the female within the form of the bourgeois, not to say pre-bourgeois family, a formation that is, after all, backed by the threat of force and secured in an economy dominated by men.Worst of all, you are unable to reveal and develop the complex strength of a strong woman. True, Anna Karenina in her doomed adventure with Count Vronsky seems for a while to exercise agency, but you produce this effect only to prepare her ultimate surrender. You have been quoted as saying that it wasn\u2019t you who sentenced Anna to throw herself under a train; it was Anna herself. Such bad faith, Count Tolstoy! You conceal your own murderous impulse beneath this spurious attribution!If this is not enough, we note that you leave the last words of your novel to the liberal male Konstantin Levin, who arrogates to himself the power of goodness, having just declared his desire to express \u201cknowledge in reason and words.\u201d So in your eyes it is the male who deploys reason and words to declare knowledge, while poor Anna is left with the torments of emotion \u2014 torments that cannot help but propel her under the train.No doubt, Count Tolstoy, your privileged upbringing drives your abuses. You may object that we condemn you in an ad hominem spirit. But in truth we do not judge you for the accident of having been born to a so-called noble family. We know well the power of caste. We are aware that your serfs were freed when you were 33 years old. We are also aware that despite your high-minded claims, you continued to live on the economic surplus harvested from their unpaid labor. We know that you fathered a child with a serf \u2014 an unhappy woman who was not, of course, free to reject your advances. It is for your bottomless vanity that we condemn you.Do not think, either, that we are unaware of the selfless devotions of your much younger wife, Sophia, or how rejected she felt when, while writing your book, you cut her off from the joy she had previously derived from copying your manuscripts. You used her and you discarded her, as you did indeed with your invented Anna. It is a wonder, in fact, that Sophia herself has not jumped under a train.The Critic\u2019s Take feature on Nov. 13 about Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d misidentified the character who, near the end of the novel, declares his desire to express \u201cknowledge in reason and words.\u201d It is Konstantin Levin \u2014 not Nikolai, his brother, who died earlier in the book.Todd Gitlin is chairman of the Ph.D. program in communications at Columbia University and the author of \u201cThe Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Family. Six Decades. Myriad Views of Fidel Castro\u2019s Revolution.", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 When Fidel Castro rode victoriously into Havana on Jan. 8, 1959, Juan Montes Torre rushed into the streets to cheer. A poor, uneducated laborer from the eastern countryside of Cuba, he had arrived in the capital a few years earlier and, like most of his neighbors, could hardly believe what was happening.\u201cIt was an emotional shock,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cThese bearded men, poorly dressed \u2014 they won! And on behalf of the lower classes!\u201dBut that allegiance slipped from generation to generation in Mr. Montes\u2019s family, and in Cuba as a whole. His son\u2019s views darkened decades ago, during tussles with the Castro government\u2019s restrictions. His teenage granddaughter, Rocio, has spent most of her youth feeling glum about the conditions in her country.\u201cThere are too many Cubans who get up every day and struggle and struggle, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cMy dream is to leave.\u201dThe Montes family\u2019s story of faith and disillusion is common. Cuban families have been arguing about Mr. Castro since he came to power. His death has again produced an intense clash of emotions for many Cubans who recognize that he was more than just a political figure. He was also a brother, a father and a grandfather to various Cuban generations \u2014 a familiar presence whose ideals, whims and ego shaped everyone\u2019s identity and daily life.His relationship to the country was remarkably personal. Robert A. Pastor, a former Latin America adviser to President Jimmy Carter, used to say that Mr. Castro was one of the few world leaders referred to by just their first names. Many Cubans have grown comfortable with calling him a complicated relative.\u201cYou have to look at this in a very cool way \u2014 this is like the father who has been there all the time that has taken the family through thick and thin,\u201d Carlos Alzugaray Treto, a former Cuban diplomat, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cMaybe at times you don\u2019t agree with him, but most of the time you agree with what he has done.\u201dYet Mr. Castro was not exactly a common loved one. He was also the maximum leader \u2014 charismatic but quick to anger, a guerrilla whose name Cubans were often afraid to utter. Because he ruled for decades, Mr. Castro\u2019s impact \u2014 and the perception of it \u2014 changed over time. Cubans born before the revolution saw him as a transformative force for good or ill. Those born later, especially after the Soviet Union started collapsing in 1989, tend to view him as an obdurate barrier to economic opportunity and to integration with the rest of the world.In life, he was often an enigma; in death, for Cuban families like the Monteses, he is a collage of competing images, from the inspiring young rebel to the out-of-touch old man.Mr. Montes first heard of the barbudos, or bearded rebels, when he was picking coffee and fruit in the fields in Cuba\u2019s eastern province of Guant\u00e1namo. It was the early 1950s, and poor farmers in the area had started banding together, revolting against wealthy landowners. Mr. Castro was among many leaders said to be demanding better working conditions.On July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro staged his first major attack, raiding the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, now the country\u2019s second-largest city. Mr. Castro was caught, and he defended himself in court three months later with a lengthy speech that included the line \u201cHistory will absolve me.\u201d Mr. Montes had decided by then to move to Havana \u2014 and to root for Mr. Castro and his guerrillas.\u201cThere was a lot of injustice back then,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cCoups, crime. The government didn\u2019t care at all for the people.\u201dCompared with its neighbors, Cuba was well off, with a per-capita income in 1958 that was exceeded in Latin America by only Argentina and Venezuela, according to United Nations statistics. But the Cuban economy was essentially stuck in place, with yawning inequality. In rural areas like those where Mr. Montes grew up, more than 90 percent of the homes lacked electricity. In Havana, the streets were clogged with a mix of shark-fin Cadillacs and ragtag beggars.After taking power in 1959, Mr. Castro promised radical change. \u201cWe have fought to give democracy and liberty to our people,\u201d he said days after his triumphant arrival in Havana. He delivered, Mr. Montes said. Over the next few months, the Castro government announced plans for land reform to grant property to the poor, taxes of 80 percent on expensive cars and additional government spending to decrease unemployment.In December that year, Mr. Montes was hired as a police officer. It was his first steady job since his arrival in Havana and came with free schooling, leading him from a fourth-grade education to a high school diploma. The pride he felt at his rise into the middle class can be seen in family pictures from that era, with his wife wearing new necklaces beside her smiling husband. Even in his 80s, he speaks of his first few years on the police force with the excitement of a new cadet.\u201cWhen someone committed a crime, we arrested them, but always with a sense of justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t abuse anyone. It was a process for everyone. It wasn\u2019t just for the upper classes.\u201dFrom the outside, especially in Washington, Mr. Castro seemed to be upending Cuba\u2019s justice system, summarily executing opponents and filling Cuban jails. Mr. Montes, however, said he had seen a police force once viewed as a collection of corrupt thugs becoming professional. From 1959 to 1962, Mr. Montes said, Cubans all over the country were eager to serve Mr. Castro.But there were enemies close by \u2014 mostly wealthier Cuban exiles who had fled when Mr. Castro began nationalizing property. They had the support of the United States, and when their attack came at the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961, Mr. Montes was guarding the home of Celia S\u00e1nchez, a famous guerrilla fighter and Mr. Castro\u2019s longtime lover and confidante.Around 4 a.m., Mr. Montes said, there was a flurry of activity inside. Moments later Mr. Castro emerged, surrounded by armed escorts.\u201cHe looked calm,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cNo one knew what was happening. No one knew they attacked us.\u201dThe Cuban missile crisis and the American trade embargo only strengthened the siege mentality that Mr. Castro relied on for decades, as he argued repeatedly that Cuba must remain under tight control lest the northern imperialists invade and turn the island into an American fief. In an interview in late 2012, Mr. Montes said he had never questioned that assessment, even when he was with critics of Mr. Castro\u2019s authoritarian ways. In 1970, during the government\u2019s effort to harvest a record 10 million tons of sugar, Mr. Montes helped guard 300 political prisoners forced to cut sugar cane.Mr. Montes said they had not seemed to be bad people. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, with what sounded like a touch of disappointment, \u201cthey were wrong.\u201dHe said he had often felt the same way about relatives who at times were critical of Mr. Castro, including some who had moved to the United States. \u201cThe revolution is a process,\u201d he said. Shifting in his seat, on a flowered couch at his home in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, he looked toward his son\u2019s house next door. \u201cThey don\u2019t see things very clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that they have the greatest opportunity in the world; they have the opportunity to study.\u201dHe said he wished younger Cubans in his family could see the broader context. \u201cWe were a poor, uneducated, humble family before the revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there was a change. It\u2019s a radical change that\u2019s still maturing.\u201dThe entrance to Juan Carlos\u2019s home is covered in green vines with bunches of bitter grapes. More than a decade ago, he ran a private restaurant, or paladar, beneath the greenery. He also used to rent rooms to tourists until he developed a new business in which he uses his newly acquired Spanish passport to travel to Panama to buy clothes and other items to sell in Havana.He is a member of what might be called the \u201cresolver\u201d generation \u2014 those who learned to resolve or negotiate their way around the shortages, regulations and inefficiencies of Cuban socialism in its later stages. If his father\u2019s image of Mr. Castro and the revolution was shaped by the changes of the 1950s or \u201960s, his views have been sculpted by the transition from the flush 1980s to the scavenging \u201990s.The shift was significant. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Cuba lost a patron that had provided around $4 billion a year in credits and subsidies. The economy contracted by 34 percent from 1990 to 1993, with chronic shortages of fuel, soap, food \u2014 just about everything.He was 31 at the time and had already become frustrated with the way the Castro government worked. In his 20s, he worked at Cuba\u2019s customs agency, as his father had after his tenure on the police force. What Juan Carlos saw, he said, was an antidemocratic system that rewarded silence instead of initiative.He said his frustration peaked in the late 1980s when he was rebuffed by Communist Party officials for gathering recommendations from colleagues for improving the agency. He believed he was doing what socialism revered: organizing workers.\u201cBut the party guys,\u201d he said, \u201cthey just told me: \u2018That\u2019s not right. Here are the things we are going to talk about, and you, don\u2019t stand up and talk.\u2019\u201dJuan Carlos shook his head and laughed as if expressing a sentiment that Cubans have long relied on to describe run-ins with the government: \u201cNo es f\u00e1cil\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not easy.He left his job just before the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. Over the next few years, he found work in hotels. When Mr. Castro legalized small restaurants, Juan Carlos decided to open one with his wife, but there was a problem: He needed permission from the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, the neighborhood party watchdog, and the group had not met in years. So he nominated himself to lead the group and got his neighbors to support his candidacy.\u201cI became the president so I could open the restaurant,\u201d he said.The Castro government was never far away, however. The 1990s led to relative economic openness, but in fits and starts as Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal, who took over presidential powers in 2006, limited change. Businesses must stay small under laws that restrict how many employees can be hired. Supplies must be bought from the government, and crackdowns are common.\u201cIt\u2019s like an accordion \u2014 they open a little, they close,\u201d Juan Carlos said. \u201cBut they never open it up all the way.\u201dSuccess, then, has tended to play favorites. Economic and racial inequality, after improving in the early years of the revolution, has gotten worse since the 1990s. Cubans with small businesses and more lucrative jobs in tourism are typically lighter-skinned, with advantages built up over time. Some have relatives in Miami. Others have connections in government or, in the case of Juan Carlos, Spanish ancestry and a home in Vedado with extra space.He acknowledged that he had done relatively well through much hard work. During one winter visit, he popped a tape into a VCR, showing his daughter\u2019s quincea\u00f1era \u2014 her 15th birthday party \u2014 at the Hotel Nacional. The girl, Rocio, wore a light floor-length gown and thanked her parents as the guests drank and danced. It looked like a small prom. But for Juan Carlos, and especially for his daughter, one night of fun is nowhere near enough to create contentment.Rocio dreams of becoming an art historian. Tall and thin, she described Cuba with the nuanced sophistication that comes from a good education and plenty of time to think things through. In her eyes, Cuba is purgatory, and even before he died, Mr. Castro was a specter of the past, studied in textbooks more than seen.\u201cFidel had an enormous vision,\u201d she said.And, yes, there a lot of things she said she loved about Mr. Castro\u2019s Cuba: the breezy liberty of the streets, crime-free and rarely snagged with traffic; the emphasis on education and culture. She said she sometimes feared that violence would return once Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro were gone.But mostly, as she has grown from adolescence to adulthood, she has wanted to leave. Her older sister already lives in Spain. Her best friend went to Miami for a vacation one summer and stayed, telling Rocio about the crowded shopping malls and the impressive facilities at her new school. Most of Rocio\u2019s friends, she said, hope to get out of Cuba as soon as they can.\u201cMy generation, we\u2019re not worried about politics or ideals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to get out. Abroad you can achieve so much more. You can be recognized for your work, internationally, by the world.\u201dFidel Castro\u2019s era of speeches, ideology and Cold War standoffs is not what today\u2019s ambitious young people want. Like many young Cubans, Rocio mostly wants Cuba to catch up. Why is there no open and affordable access to the internet? Why can\u2019t she easily get on Facebook to say hi to her sister in Barcelona? Why is it so hard to visit the Louvre, in person or virtually?\u201cI think everyone has a right to get the information they want to think and study,\u201d she said.She said that the American trade embargo clearly did not help, but that most young people considered their own government responsible for creating a society of limits.\u201cFidel and Ra\u00fal started out with a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t achieve what they said they would achieve.\u201dShe wants the same thing her grandfather and Fidel Castro wanted when they were young: radical change and a fair shot at making a life for herself on her terms. The changes of the past few years under Ra\u00fal Castro, allowing more private enterprise and travel, offer some hope, she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not changing at the pace it needs to.\u201dFidel Castro is gone \u2014 \u201cHe was a man of the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Montes said in an interview on Saturday night \u2014 and his granddaughter has long been ready to move on. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samantha Cameron, From 10 Downing Street to Selfridges", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayNot quite three months after standing supportively, and silently, behind her husband, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, as he resigned his position after losing the Brexit vote, Samantha Cameron is about to do what, to my knowledge, no spouse of a global leader has ever done before.Start a fashion brand.The new line, which consists of 40 styles, will be called Cefinn and will be available at Net-a-Porter, Selfridges and cefinn.com.As to the clothes and their style, \u201cWell obviously you\u2019re thinking about yourself, but at the same time it can\u2019t be all about yourself because that would be pointless,\u201d she said to British Vogue. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying stuff on my friends.\u201dAn image released by the magazine shows her in an ecru midcalf trumpet skirt with a white windowpane print and matching belted shell. It looks perfectly proper and accessible (and less obviously \u201cfashion-y\u201d than some of the looks she wore during her husband\u2019s time in office).And, given the way pretty much anyone with a public profile and popular image, from rock stars to athletes, has seized on fashion as a career forward, it was probably only a matter of time before politicians or their spouses joined the trend.Especially considering how much time and thought they are now forced to devote to what they wear, and all its possible meanings, they may as well put all that background research to good use. (A crisis strategist once told me he spent hours discussing tie color with a client who was a head of state when they could have been talking about the peace accords.)Mrs. Cameron is in her mid-40s \u2014 she clearly has more career left in her \u2014 so why not? And other former Downing Street wives (and other political wives) have continued their pre-government careers post-government.It\u2019s just that the next step has been a little more obviously worthy than fashion.Or Sarah Brown, the wife of Gordon Brown, another former prime minister, who founded the children\u2019s charity Theirworld and became the executive chairwoman of the Global Business Coalition for Education (among other things).There are exceptions: Carla Bruni Sarkozy, a former model and the wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, became the face of Bulgari jewelers the year after her husband left office, and it didn\u2019t raise many eyebrows.But in this case, \u201cThe response to what she does is going to be in part about how we process political figures,\u201d Robert Burke, a luxury consultant and founder of Robert Burke Associates, said of Mrs. Cameron. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be judged through the lens of her name, and her name is Cameron.\u201dAnd that\u2019s even if the name on the label in the clothes is different; even if they are clothes for many, as opposed to the exclusive few. Especially if she continues to be her own best model.Her products will be assessed not just as a nice skirt, say, or a pretty dress, but as a nice skirt and a pretty dress by the woman married to the former Conservative prime minister of Britain, the man who lost the Brexit vote, with all the implications and emotions that are attached to perceptions of him and his party. It is thanks to both, after all, that Mrs. Cameron is as well known as she is. You can\u2019t detach the designer and her history.And though the new generation of first ladies has taught us that fashion is an increasingly powerful personal and political tool, and a universal one, it is still widely dismissed as frivolous and unseemly. (I have the social media responses to many column about the politics of dress to prove it.)As a result, for someone in her position, to make clothes her focus is a risk.I honestly hope her brand is a success, because if it is, it may legitimize fashion as the serious choice it clearly is, and help break yet another expectation that wives of leaders behave a certain way and reside in a certain box. But I don\u2019t think it will necessarily be a seamless transition.Something to watch for in the new year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Banks Cheer Trump. So, After a Pause, Do Big Ones.", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWashington lobbyists, financial and policy analysts and Wall Street insiders are all trying to figure out what the Trump administration will mean for the banking industry.But Rusty Cloutier never doubted that Mr. Trump would be good for the small bank he runs in Lafayette, La.Mr. Cloutier sees in the new administration a chance not just for regulatory relief, but for a reordering of priorities away from the wealthy interests of the big cities and toward the rural and blue-collar communities where he operates.\u201cMy customers are very hard-working people,\u201d said Mr. Cloutier, the president of MidSouth Bank. \u201cThey work in the oil fields and they hear they are racist, and they just got tired of it being slammed in their face.\u201dHe added, \u201cTell your editors that they need to run a headline that says \u2018Main Street Won.\u2019\u201dAnd yet, in the weeks since Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election, Wall Street has been winning, too.The stocks of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years \u2014 a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise.The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo\u2019s share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in September.For now, banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the president-elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the industry, including the fees banks can charge, whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold.Banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a Trump administration\u2019s fiscal stimulus program revives inflation. Higher rates would increase the value of some of the banks\u2019 holdings and would widen banks\u2019 margins on loans.But like nearly all of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy positions, his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail. Mr. Trump\u2019s feelings on banks, perhaps more so than other industries, are difficult to sort out.On one hand, he has called for dismantling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits. On the other, he has railed against Wall Street elites for keeping down small-town America.How, then, will Mr. Trump justify policies that bolster bank profits, while also delivering on his promises of economic populism?Community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot. They say Mr. Trump can limit regulations \u2014 particularly on banks with less than $10 billion in assets \u2014 while still being tough on the Wall Street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public.Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural America Mr. Trump championed in his campaign.Several community bankers said they also wanted the Trump administration to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by installing a five-person bipartisan oversight board, rather than a single director.Among community bankers, support for Mr. Trump has been pervasive and consistent.Roughly 84 percent of community bankers supported Mr. Trump, according to a poll that the industry\u2019s trade group conducted after the political conventions this summer.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any Trump signs in my yard,\u201d said Tim Zimmerman, president of Standard Bank, which operates in communities outside Pittsburgh. \u201cBut I want the bank to do well and to be able to help people in the community. And I can\u2019t do that if things go the way they are going.\u201dIn reality, the nation\u2019s roughly 5,800 community banks represent a relatively small part of America\u2019s banking activity. About half of the nation\u2019s deposits are held by just a handful of mega-banks, where there was deep support for Hillary Clinton.Many on Wall Street helped bankroll Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in the hope that she would protect the forces that drive their global profits, like free trade. Many executives at large banks feared that Mr. Trump was a loose cannon who could destabilize the economy.The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, went so far as to publicly voice support for Mrs. Clinton. He made a cameo in a pro-Trump ad \u2014 along with Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and the investor George Soros \u2014 that painted the Democrats as puppets of the global financial elite. Critics called the ad anti-Semitic because it focused on Jewish figures.But as the stock market soared, the big banks began talking about the upside of a Trump presidency. Two days after the election, Mr. Blankfein said at the DealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times that he believed Mr. Trump\u2019s policies would be \u201cmarket supportive.\u201dUnprepared for a Trump victory, executives inside the big banks began drawing up lists of regulations or rules that the new administration and the Republican-controlled Congress might change for their benefit.They are not arguing for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, which large banks have spent hundreds of millions of dollars complying with.Nor do they want a less powerful consumer protection agency, which some credit with helping big banks by cracking down on players on the industry\u2019s margins, like payday lenders.At the top of their wish list: rolling back the so-called Durbin Amendment, which limits the fees banks can charge on debit cards, and tweaking the Volcker Rule so that large banks can engage in more types of trading activity to help their clients.As banking lobbyists seek inroads with the new administration over regulation, Democrats are trying to pressure the industry to denounce other actions by Mr. Trump, including his selection of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist. The former executive chairman of the Breitbart News Network, Mr. Bannon has been criticized for inflaming racist and xenophobic views.In a letter last week, Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking member of House Financial Services Committee, and other Democrats said the banking industry had a \u201cmoral obligation to speak out against this appointment as contrary to the values of this country and to the values of your industry.\u201dThe banking groups are declining to weigh in. Some say their input is not relevant because Mr. Bannon is not likely to have a direct role in regulating the financial industry.\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think he is a racist,\u201d Scott McComb, chief executive of Heartland Bank, which operates across Central Ohio, said of the president-elect. \u201cI think it is propaganda that is made to make him look bad.\u201dMr. McComb said while Mr. Trump said things during the campaign \u201cthat are not becoming of a president,\u201d he expected that Mr. Trump would act with more decorum in the White House.\u201cHe conducted himself like a New York City developer,\u201d during the campaign, Mr. McComb said. \u201cThat is how a New York City developer acts.\u201dMr. Cloutier, the Louisiana banker, said even if Mr. Trump appointed someone like Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman executive, to a top economic post, the president-elect would not forget his promises to working-class America \u2014 and by extension small banks.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be taking care of the sugar daddies who look down on the hardworking people of America,\u201d Mr. Cloutier said. \u201cBut if he don\u2019t deliver on that, he won\u2019t be around four years from now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles Wolf Jr., Who Clashed With Pentagon Papers Leaker, Dies at 92", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byCharles Wolf Jr., an economist, a founding dean of the RAND Corporation\u2019s graduate school and the supervisor who tried to oust Daniel Ellsberg in 1969 before he leaked the secret Pentagon Papers, died on Oct. 24 in Los Angeles. He was 92.The cause was heart failure, said Jeffrey Hiday, a spokesman for RAND, a nonpartisan global research organization.Dr. Wolf was among the first to predict the economic disintegration of the Soviet Union in the 1980s.Dr. Wolf wrote prolifically, including for The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. In his writings, he not only identified weaknesses in the Soviet economy but also cautioned, in the late 1980s, against fears that Japan would overtake America\u2019s economy and that the United States was in decline.\u201cThe rhetoric of decline,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis wrong because it portrays a past that wasn\u2019t, a present that isn\u2019t and a future that probably won\u2019t be.\u201dAt RAND, Dr. Wolf was Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s direct supervisor in 1969 when Mr. Ellsberg was writing a report titled \u201cLessons of Rebellion and Insurgent Forces,\u201d a subject on which \u201cthe record of American experience in Vietnam over 25 years offers a wealth of data,\u201d another RAND report hinted vaguely in 1970.After Mr. Ellsberg signed a letter to The Washington Post urging the United States to withdraw unilaterally from Vietnam, Dr. Wolf and several other RAND colleagues responded with their own letter suggesting that their co-workers had underestimated the dangers posed by outside aggression and advocating instead a \u201cresponsible reduction\u201d in American military support that would eventually let the South Vietnamese government defend itself.When Mr. Ellsberg agreed to testify about his opposition to the Vietnam War before a Senate committee in 1969, Dr. Wolf accused him of exploiting RAND\u2019s reputation and demanded that he resign, according to Mai Elliott in the 2010 book \u201cRAND in Southeast Asia: A History of the Vietnam War Era.\u201dMr. Ellsberg refused, but he left the next year, before the Pentagon Papers were released but while he was feeling more pressure at RAND and seeking more freedom to speak out.Dr. Wolf, still \u201cdripping with venom\u201d when he was interviewed about Mr. Ellsberg 30 years later, according to Alex Abella in his 2008 book \u201cSoldiers of Reason,\u201d said Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s leak of the Pentagon Papers was irrational, because President Richard M. Nixon had already committed to withdrawing American troops from Vietnam.\u201cAll Ellsberg achieved was to besmirch the reputation of the place that had nurtured him and encouraged his talent,\u201d Dr. Wolf said.Charles Wolf was born on Aug. 1, 1924, in Manhattan. His father, also named Charles, was a doctor. His mother, the former Rosalie Zeamans, was an opera singer.After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Harvard, where he later also received a master\u2019s and a doctorate. He enlisted in the Army and served in the Office of Strategic Services in Italy during World War II. After the war, he worked in the foreign service and taught at Cornell and the University of California, Berkeley.He is survived by his wife, the former Theresa Van de Wint, an artist; his sons, C. Theodore and Timothy; and two grandsons.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Impact Will Trump Have on Tourism?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayWith Donald J. Trump set to become the 45th president of the United States, the spirit of openness that has permeated everything from our increasingly global economy to how we travel may be poised to change.Less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, travel experts and economists were asked to try and read the tea leaves. Below, they offer some early thoughts about how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency might affect tourism, including foreign travel to the United States, Americans traveling abroad, access to Cuba, the cost of airfare, and, of course, Trump Hotels.TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATESYet experts say that how attractive the United States continues to be to foreign tourists will depend on how affordable it is to visit; what, if any, policies the Trump administration puts into place (new immigration procedures that make the customs and border process harder, the scrutiny of particular groups of people); and the perception of how welcoming and safe (or not) the United States is.\u201cThere are people in Mexico, Latin America, the Middle East who view Trump with suspicion and concern,\u201d continued Mr. Harteveldt, who is also a former marketing director for Trump Shuttle, an airline that Mr. Trump used to own, \u201cand I think he is going to have to show that he can be magnanimous and can have a broader vision, which will be very important for international trade and inbound tourism.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether those sentiments last, and if there will be actual policy changes that help or hurt travel to the United States.Mr. Sacks of Tourism Economics said policy proposals that would undermine longstanding alliances, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could certainly hurt tourism to the United States. But by how much?AMERICANS AND THE COST OF TRAVELING ABROADWhether Americans travel internationally depends largely on the health of the U.S. economy. A weaker dollar could hurt outbound tourism.\u201cTravel is a discretionary product,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt. \u201cIf the economy isn\u2019t good, travel is always one of the first areas where consumers start to cut back.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group said that if high-earning Americans end up seeing tax cuts under Mr. Trump, they might decide to travel more.While that would be a boon to travelers, Mr. Leff said that the legacy airlines are hoping to prevent it by capitalizing on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cprotectionism\u201d to keep their competitors at bay. If that protectionist attitude prevails, options will continue to be limited and prices will continue to be high.Still, the decision to travel will ultimately be about more than money. It will also hinge on how Americans think they will be treated when they go abroad, something people typically gauge based on what they\u2019re seeing in State Department reports, news media and on their fellow travelers\u2019 Facebook and Twitter feeds. They will ask themselves whether they feel it\u2019s safe to travel, or whether they think, by virtue of their president, they will be targets of anti-American sentiments. \u201cWe are all ambassadors of our country,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be attacked or harassed or looked down upon as an American.\u201dTRAVELING TO CUBACuba is only just opening up to the United States, yet it is already on many travelers\u2019 bucket lists.\u201cThere\u2019s some risk to Cuba policy changing,\u201d said Mr. Leff, because Mr. Trump could issue his own directive. Additionally, Mr. Leff said that the uncertainty surrounding Cuba could delay investment there in terms of new hotels and other travel-related infrastructure, slowing tourism.Mr. Harteveldt, however, thinks that Mr. Trump won\u2019t necessarily back off international trade with Cuba and other places because four years from now, \u201che probably would like to see Trump-branded hotels open in more cities and more countries.\u201dTRUMP HOTELSBut now that Mr. Trump will be the next president of the United States, things could be looking up.Brand Keys, a customer loyalty research consultancy based in New York, seemed to underscore that notion in a report the day after the election, saying that Trump, \u201ca brand that was once deemed toxic by many consumers is now seen as not only a safe option, but an emotionally desirable option.\u201dNEW INFRASTRUCTURE\u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d Mr. Trump said during his victory speech. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201dChange is one thing the industry can be sure of when Mr. Trump takes office.\u201cHe could be one of the most travel-friendly presidents in modern history,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt, noting that Mr. Trump has long been part of the travel industry and was deeply involved in the marketing of the Trump Shuttle in its early days \u2014 experience that could he put to use thinking of ways to make the United States a more welcoming and appealing destination. Or, Mr. Harteveldt continued, Mr. Trump could be one of the most travel-unfriendly presidents. \u201cHe has the potential to be at either end of the continuum.\u201dThe only unlikely outcome, Mr. Harteveldt added, is that Mr. Trump will be in the middle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Is Good for China", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSHANGHAI \u2014 Perhaps no country has taken more hits from Donald J. Trump than China. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump made it sound as if making America \u201cgreat again\u201d meant defeating China.But much of the Chinese public supported him. And President Xi Jinping was among the first world leaders to congratulate him. Mr. Xi, in his message to the president-elect, expressed hopes of building on the \u201ccommon interests\u201d between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Beijing is looking forward to change in Washington. For the Chinese, the Obama era has been the most difficult period in United States-China relations since President Richard M. Nixon renewed ties in 1971. The Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, made its \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d about containing Beijing, aiming to strengthen and enlarge the American alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region while increasing America\u2019s military footprint there. The pivot was backed by an economic plan, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a now-moribund trade pact created in part to isolate Beijing.Since the end of the Cold War, from President Bill Clinton to President Obama, the United States has been trying to remake the world in its own image \u2014 building an American empire in the name of globalization. Through ever larger and more complex alliances and global institutions that the United States designed, Washington has sought the global standardization of rules in trade, finance and international relations. It has used political, economic and military might to push other countries to adopt electoral democracy and market capitalism.China has refused to yield. While the Chinese have been great beneficiaries of this era, Beijing has engaged globalization on its own terms. China\u2019s gains from globalization have helped turn the country from a poor agrarian economy into an industrial powerhouse within one generation. Yet Beijing has insisted on strengthening its one-party political system and opening its market only so much.This approach is working for China. The Chinese economy continues to advance in both size and technological sophistication, so much so that China looms in the minds of many American elites as the most potent long-term threat.But these elites fail to realize \u2014 and Mr. Trump appears to understand \u2014 that while they have been obsessed with the rise of China as a threat to the United States-led liberal order, America\u2019s domestic political foundations have been decaying. The tendency of American elites to try to mold the world to their liking created a conflict in their own country, between Americans with power and ordinary people. The American empire was built at the expense of the American nation.Globalization has benefited those Americans at the top with concentrated wealth and influence while the middle class has stagnated or shrunk. The country\u2019s industrial base, the economic bedrock of the middle class in the postwar era, has been shattered. America\u2019s infrastructure is in disrepair, its education system badly underperforming, and its social contract in shambles. It has 4.5 percent of the world\u2019s population and about 20 percent of its gross domestic product, yet accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s military expenditures.With Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, there may be some tough days ahead between China and the United States. Relations may nose-dive in the short run over trade, for example.But in the longer term, Chinese-American relations could become healthier as the Chinese prefer a relationship with a United States that doesn\u2019t try to remake the world. The Chinese know how to compete and can deal with competitors. What the Chinese have always resented and resisted is an America that imposes its values and standards on everybody else.Mr. Trump\u2019s America is likely to break from this pattern. He has shown no desire to tell other countries how to do things. China is run by competent leaders who are strong-minded and pragmatic. Mr. Trump is a resolute businessman with little ideological underpinning. Without the shackles of ideology, even the most competitive rivals can make deals. This is a new day for the world\u2019s most consequential bilateral relationship.The Obama pivot is failing. It was unable to produce a more peaceful Asia-Pacific region, and even America\u2019s closest ally in the region, the Philippines, is abandoning it. It was a project in costly global policing at the expense of American national interests.Beijing harbors no design to rival the United States for global dominance. But it is only natural that it seeks to reclaim a leading role in its Asia-Pacific neighborhood. China desires its own space to reach its development goals. At the same time, America with Mr. Trump as president needs to turn its attention to rebuilding itself.In the long term, Mr. Trump\u2019s America and China are more likely to work with each other than in any other period in recent memory.Eric Li is a venture capitalist and political scientist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Has TAG Heuer Bucked the Swiss Watch Downturn?", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byReports of crisis in the Swiss luxury watch industry have come thick and fast this year, with the independent Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry announcing that exports fell 10.2 percent by value in the nine months to the end of September, compared with the same period in the previous year.\u201cWe have done three things,\u201d said Jean-Claude Biver, TAG Heuer\u2019s chief executive and president of the watch division at its parent company, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. \u201cWe worked on innovation, on affordable luxury and on perceived value. What do people want when there is a crisis? They want perceived value that is higher than the price.\u201dSince Mr. Biver took the TAG Heuer reins in late 2014, the company has introduced its first smartwatch, the Connected (60,000 have sold this year, he said) and a number of in-house movements. After his arrival, the brand also ended its unsuccessful attempt to move upmarket and reduced its average price to position the brand as a consumer\u2019s \u201cfirst luxury watch.\u201dBut it was a sweeping array of new marketing initiatives \u2014 intended to activate what Mr. Biver calls his \u201czero separation concept,\u201d meaning that his brand must be \u201cwherever my customer is\u201d \u2014 that have dramatically altered TAG Heuer\u2019s profile, and with it, the sales results.So there have been deals with the Premier League, England\u2019s top soccer league; the supermodel Cara Delevingne; and the \u201cAvenger\u201d movies\u2019 Thor, Chris Hemsworth, all intended to put the brand in the youthful mainstream.\u201cWhere we are innovating is in music,\u201d Mr. Biver said. \u201cMusic and football are two universal languages that young people speak and understand. If you are not in music and only in sport, you don\u2019t have zero separation.\u201dDespite its apparent success, Mr. Biver is confident that other Swiss brands won\u2019t try to duplicate his zero separation concept. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what it means,\u201d he said. And he confirmed that the company had no plans to extend its marketing portfolio and would not go into tennis or golf. \u201cI would never go into a sport where you have a leader like Rolex,\u201d he said. \u201cIn tennis, Rolex has the tournaments and the best players, so what are you going to do? You are going to be No. 2.\u201dAt its headquarters in Switzerland, TAG Heuer is investing in infrastructure. Mr. Biver said that after laying off 49 staff members in 2014 as part of a restructuring plan, the company has added more than 100 people in the past 12 months. It has also begun work on a factory that will cover almost four acres in La Chaux-de-Fonds and is due to open in 2019. (Currently, the company rents its factory.)Although he declined to say how many watches the brand would make this year or next, Mr. Biver said he intended to increase the production of movements from 85,000 this year to 150,000 in 2017, and to 200,000 by 2021.The current rate of sales growth is unlikely to continue, Mr. Biver conceded. \u201cI do not believe we will be able to do plus 18 next year, because the crisis will not last,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t outperform the industry. I don\u2019t look at how much we do; I look at how much we do better than the others.\u201dAt 68, Mr. Biver is an industry veteran, responsible for reviving Blancpain in the 1980s, putting Omega on the wrists of James Bond and Cindy Crawford in the 1990s and turning Hublot into a global phenomenon in the 2000s. He has said he intends to keep working until he is 75.His methods, although sometimes unconventional, are widely considered to have played a significant role in the industry\u2019s revival over the past 30 years. Among them is his ability to inspire confidence.For example, he allows TAG Heuer\u2019s international sales teams to travel first class, while other brands are cutting costs by flying economy. \u201cHow much is a first-class ticket for a big company?\u201d he said. \u201cNothing. These are little psychological things that you should do in a crisis. You must be contrarian \u2014 that\u2019s the best way to make money in business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fannie and Freddie\u2019s Status Continues to Provoke Criticisms", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe presidential campaign that just ended was notable for a lack of debate about housing \u2014 in particular the uneven state of the United States mortgage market nine years since the start of the financial crisis.Neither President-elect Donald J. Trump nor Hillary Clinton spent much time discussing housing policy, even though the financial crisis in the United States began with the collapse of home prices nationally. And neither candidate laid out a plan for dealing with the two biggest engines in the mortgage market \u2014 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 which remain under a controversial federal government conservatorship.Laurie Goodman, a longtime housing industry guru on Wall Street and now with a Washington research organization, said she did not think federal legislators would make it a priority to address the fates of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 two government-sponsored entities that were rescued by the Treasury eight years ago with a $187 billion taxpayer bailout.\u201cI am very pessimistic on G.S.E. reform,\u201d said Ms. Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, referring to the government-sponsored enterprises, as Fannie and Freddie are known. \u201cI don\u2019t see the impetus for change.\u201dShe is not alone.There is a growing sense among housing policy experts that it may take another crisis \u2014 a recession or more big losses at the mortgage giants \u2014 to get the new president and Congress to come up with a more permanent way to handle the responsibilities now shouldered by Fannie and Freddie. Until then, it is very likely that both agencies will go on in a state of limbo: run by their own management teams, but with strict oversight by the relatively new Federal Housing Finance Agency.A handful of plans have been proposed for reforming Fannie and Freddie, the agencies whose prime responsibilities are to effectively guarantee 30-year mortgages, which are packaged into bonds. But none of those proposals have galvanized widespread support from legislators or the financial community, so the current unpopular conservatorship has been permitted to go on and on.Some favor merging Fannie and Freddie into a single entity, while others want to turn them into a government-run housing finance corporation \u2014 a mortgage finance utility of sorts. Others want to replace them with a number of smaller independent firms that will guarantee mortgages against default and maintain hefty regulatory oversight.And still others, mainly investors owning shares in Fannie and Freddie, want to see them recapitalized, set free and returned to the public markets as independent companies with minimal government control.\u201cPeople want to preserve the 30-year mortgage, they want private capital and they want to preserve a role for the small lender,\u201d said Ms. Goodman.But there is little consensus on what kind of ownership structure should prevail to achieve those goals. Ms. Goodman said gridlock and inertia were bad because they discourage innovation in the marketplace, which could make mortgages more widely available to consumers.Also, she said, there is the potential for Fannie and Freddie to become more \u201cpoliticized\u201d the longer they remain in conservatorship and de facto agents of the Treasury.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got into hot water because they took on too much risk in the time leading up to the financial crisis.The companies, which were chartered by the federal government, operated as independent companies and largely made their own decisions about which 30-year mortgages to buy and guarantee against default.For decades, both entities were largely conservative about which mortgages to guarantee or buy for their own investment portfolios. But over time both became more aggressive in buying loans that turned out to be risky but were not considered traditional subprime loans at the time. The companies saw the value of those investments plummet when the housing market collapsed.The bailouts of both companies in September 2008 were viewed as a critical step to prevent an even greater financial calamity. But the conservatorship has grown controversial over time, particularly given that hedge funds and other investors continue to own shares in both of them.Over the last four years, as the economy has revived and much of the housing market has recovered, Fannie and Freddie began paying dividends to the federal government, leaving little behind for the company\u2019s private shareholders.To date, Fannie and Freddie have paid more than $250 billion in dividends to the federal government. The bailout has generated a profit for the Treasury.The fiercest critics of the conservatorship want Fannie and Freddie to keep much of any additional dividend payments and return to the public markets as independent entities \u2014 much like the way they operated before.Some hedge funds and institutional investors have sued the federal government over this issue, claiming it has deprived private investors of billions of dollars in potential profit by taking all the dividends paid out by Fannie and Freddie.The hedge funds and investors contend that the federal government is effectively profiting from the conservatorship at the expense of private shareholders.\u201cIt is frustrating these entities have been in conservatorship for eight years,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chairman and chief executive of CapWealth Advisors, who heads a coalition of investors in Fannie and Freddie called Investors Unite. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cake that\u2019s been mixed and been refined, and all you have to do is add capital and put them back out because nothing else has worked.\u201dMr. Pagliara\u2019s organization regularly sends out news alerts to the media criticizing the conservatorship and the Treasury for continuing to take in dividends from the mortgage companies.Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with the Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a research note on Wednesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s election would most likely \u201copen the door for the government to return Fannie and Freddie to private ownership.\u201d But Mr. Seiberg does not foresee the companies returning \u201cto their former selves.\u201dSome say that allowing Fannie and Freddie to operate as they did before the crisis might prompt them again to expose the government to guaranteeing too many risky mortgages. The fear is that Fannie and Freddie will return to their old ways of trying to maximize profits at the expense of prudence.\u201cIf they are public companies, that would simply return them to the need to drive profits and increase risk-taking, and that\u2019s what created the problems in the first place,\u201d said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic, a business analytics company.Still, finding a permanent fix for Fannie and Freddie will not address another problem confronting the housing market after the financial crisis: a paucity of small-dollar mortgages being underwritten by banks.Besides loans guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie, big banks have focused much of their lending on what are known as jumbo mortgages, home loans issued to wealthier borrowers with pristine credit histories who are borrowing more than $400,000.Jumbo mortgages are more profitable and less risky for banks than smaller loans.But the dynamic has left a huge void in the market for borrowers with limited incomes who are looking to buy a house with a mortgage for less than $100,000.Nationwide, in 2016, financial institutions operating in the largest metropolitan areas wrote 146,039 mortgages of $100,000 or less as of the end of August, according to CoreLogic. During that same time, lenders underwrote 1,475,637 mortgages of $100,000 or greater.The percentage of small-dollar mortgages being underwritten by banks is at its lowest level in at least a decade.The lack of mortgage credit for borrowers seeking smaller loans is a big problem in a troubled city like Detroit.The Urban Institute reports that the vast majority of homes sold in 2015 in Detroit were bought in all-cash deals. For all of last year, just 653 homes were bought with a mortgage in Detroit.This lack of small mortgages is helping to fuel a postcrisis revival in Detroit and elsewhere in seller-financed home sales \u2014 arrangements known as a contract for deed or a rent-to-own deal.However, these deals often are lacking in important consumer protections and have a long history of abuse.It is not known how many lower-income consumers are buying homes through a contract for deed because in many states, such as Michigan, there is no requirement for sellers to record such deals until title to the property is ultimately transferred.But RealtyTrac, a property data service, estimates that on average 20,000 homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since 2009, and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis.\u201cWithout these small mortgages, sales evaporate, houses go to investors who have cash on hand, or families opt to use seller financing vehicles,\u201d said the Urban Institute in a recent report penned by Ms. Goodman and others at the organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cashless Economy in Zimbabwe? With Little Cash, There\u2019s Little Choice", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 The time came for worshipers to surrender their tithes on Sunday morning. But instead of dropping bills into a collection plate, the congregants at a large Pentecostal church rose and filed toward the deacons clutching hand-held card-reading machines. With a swipe, they were done.\u201cYes, it looks like shoppers in a supermarket,\u201d said Mercy Chihota, 33, a member of the church, the United Family International Ministries, in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital. \u201cIt feels good, but strange at the moment, because it\u2019s very new.\u201dOf all the places speeding toward a cashless economy, this nation in southern Africa may not come to mind. About 90 percent of Zimbabweans work in the informal economy, where cash is usually a must. The country, despite the spread of cheap smartphones in recent years, remains low-tech. Blackouts are part of everyday life.Debit card machines are proliferating in Zimbabwe\u2019s cities \u2014 not only in churches but also in supermarkets, betting parlors, nightclubs, parking areas and every other business happy to accept paper cash but unable to dispense it. If there are no card-reading machines around, many shoppers now text payments on their cellphones.\u201cWe had to migrate to electronic platforms as a matter of necessity, rather than as a matter of choice,\u201d said Clive Mphambela, an advocacy and marketing executive at the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe. \u201cZimbabwe is unique in many, many respects, and this is just one of them.\u201dThe cash crunch remains so severe that the government started a media campaign this week to publicize the imminent introduction of so-called bond notes, paper notes that it says will be backed by the African Export-Import Bank and will be interchangeable with the American dollar. But most Zimbabweans already view the notes with deep distrust, suspecting a government ploy to reintroduce a local currency.\u201cI wish I could withdraw my money just at once than to keep visiting the bank every day, and I pray I could do this before bond notes are distributed,\u201d said Precious Makaza, 28, a schoolteacher who was standing in a long line in front of ZB Bank on Robert Mugabe Road.When the country\u2019s political and economic crisis of a decade ago led to hyperinflation, people spent their Zimbabwean dollars as fast as they could before the money lost its value.But in the latest crisis, the surest thing in Zimbabwe is the American dollar, which people prefer keeping instead of spending.Desperate for a financial lifeline, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government has re-engaged in talks with the International Monetary Fund in the hope of securing loans. But progress appears to have stalled because the Zimbabwean government has retreated on economic reforms, including slashing the bloated government work force, which accounts for an eye-popping 97 percent of government spending.Surrounded by so much uncertainty, many Zimbabweans are just keeping hard cash out of circulation.\u201cPolitically exposed people are afraid of keeping their money in the country,\u201d said Prosper Chitambara, an economist at the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute in Harare. \u201cI also know a number of businesses that are no longer banking their money. They would rather keep their cash in their safes. When you bank, it\u2019s difficult to get the money when it\u2019s required.\u201dTo withdraw money from their accounts, many Zimbabweans must spend hours in lines or make multiple visits to their banks. Credit cards are accepted at very few establishments in Zimbabwe.To keep cash inside the country, the government has banned imports of certain goods. It has also encouraged the use of debit cards and mobile money. In August, there were more than four million debit card transactions in the country, more than three times the total in January, according to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.For months, business was languishing at the Tipperary\u2019s nightclub, a popular spot for professionals in Harare. Patrons simply did not have the cash to hang out.\u201cSince the introduction of swiping machines, business has improved a bit,\u201d said Edmund Rukweza, a bartender at the club.Some have discovered the strange change in consumer behavior induced by plastic.\u201cI\u2019ve found it less painful to use my card than taking out hard cash from my pocket,\u201d said Edward Vambire, 32, who had spent $3 on three lottery tickets at the MegaGame Sports Betting parlor.In churches, offerings had plummeted because parishioners used the little cash they could withdraw for food and other basic necessities. Now many churches accept tithes by debit cards, cellphone payments or wire transfers.\u201cIf one wants to swipe, let them swipe,\u201d said Douglas Rowedi, an elder at the Church of the Pentecost Zimbabwe. \u201cIf one is able to bring cash, let them bring it as it is.\u201dBut some parishioners said the growing use of debit cards had sharpened the economic cleavages in the congregation.\u201cWe now see the rich in church showing off their status as they stand up to swipe their cards, while those with no bank cards are made to feel like outcasts as we throw our offerings in containers passed around by deacons,\u201d said Agrippa Muvhaku, 26, a member of the United Family International Ministries. \u201cBefore the coming of swiping machines, we were all equal in the church.\u201dNearly 70 percent of Zimbabweans do not have bank accounts, restricting the use of debit cards to a minority. Many without bank accounts use mobile money through their cellphones; they are allowed to turn digital cash into legal tender at designated outlets.But Mr. Chitambara, the economist, said that mobile money users were often being charged informal fees to withdraw cash.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of rent-seeking and arbitrage,\u201d Mr. Chitambara said. \u201cThere are some people who are making a killing out of the situation.\u201dPerhaps the biggest killing was being made in rural areas like Mutoko, a district about 90 miles northeast of Harare.In Nyamuzuwe, a village where there is no electricity and cellphone coverage is very spotty, the cash shortage had ground business to a halt.Residents no longer sold vegetables by the roadside because passing drivers lacked cash. Ezra Mbigu, the owner of a solar panel who used to charge customers 50 cents to recharge their cellphones, now reluctantly accepted a cup of beans instead. Villagers traded two pounds of sugar for a bucket of corn, or livestock for basic items.But Fambai Mudzaniri, 48, a trader in a neighboring village, was earning monthly profits of $500 from the cash shortage. In Harare, Mr. Mudzaniri bought Chinese-made cellphones for $13 each and then sold them to villagers for one goat or three or four chickens, depending on their size.He then took the goats to Harare and sold them to restaurants for $40 to $50 each.\u201cSo to me,\u201d Mr. Mudzaniri said, as he and his three assistants came to peddle their wares in Nyamuzuwe, \u201cthe cash crisis in the village here is time to make money.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare and Mutoko, Zimbabwe, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Painful Steps Help Egypt Secure $12 Billion I.M.F. Loan", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 The International Monetary Fund approved a $12 billion loan for Egypt on Friday, in a move intended to stave off economic collapse in the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation as it grapples with a plunging currency, soaring inflation and shortages of staple foods.The monetary fund signed off on the loan at a board meeting in Washington after Egypt raised $6 billion in external financing and agreed to significant economic changes, including allowing the currency to trade freely and reducing energy subsidies. Those measures, although painful, are intended to increase confidence in the government and attract foreign investment.The first installment of the loan, $2.75 billion, was immediately disbursed. Tarek Amer, the governor of the central bank, confirmed that it had been received Friday. The rest will be paid out over three years.But some economists warned that the monetary fund\u2019s loan was only the first of several painful yet urgently needed steps to stabilize Egypt\u2019s economy, and in the short term, conditions for ordinary Egyptians may continue to deteriorate, a worrisome prospect for the country\u2019s leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Mr. Sisi has relied heavily on Saudi Arabia to bolster the economy, which started to tumble in 2011 during the uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. The Saudis and, to a lesser extent, other Persian Gulf countries have given Egypt $30 billion in aid over the past three years.Saudi Arabia did not send expected shipments of discounted petroleum products for October and November, and Egypt was forced to spend precious currency reserves to buy those products from other sources.Reluctantly, Egypt turned to the monetary fund.To meet the fund\u2019s requirements, the government agreed to painful policy changes that it had long avoided. It created a value-added tax. It raised the price of gasoline, to about 21 cents from 16 cents per liter \u2014 still extremely cheap, but expensive for low-paid Egyptians. It has progressively peeled back electricity subsidies.\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening, they are making the right choices,\u201d Mr. Blair said. Referring to fellow bankers, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, but they are pleased that there is new thinking, which is what Egypt needed.\u201dBut the loan could imperil the Egyptian authorities, who have had to take steps that have created hardship across the country.Nearly all Egyptians have been affected by the economic crisis, from wealthy students who can no longer pay the rising tuition fees at private universities to families who can no longer afford basic foods like tomatoes.But on Friday, few Egyptians turned out for protests against the rising cost of living, which were called for before the announcement about the monetary fund\u2019s loan.Security forces in armored personnel carriers, including masked men carrying assault rifles, were deployed across Cairo and other parts of the country to discourage such demonstrations. Worshipers were sparse in mosques. Roads were nearly abandoned, and shops that are normally open on Friday remained closed.Hardships are likely to worsen in the near future for Egyptians. Inflation is likely to keep rising this year as the floating currency begins to push up the price of essential goods.The government recently rolled out social service programs that it says will increase assistance for the poor, but only five million Egyptians have benefited so far. One-quarter of the more than 90 million Egyptians live under the poverty line, and many more live hand to mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s only enough for food,\u201d said Olfa el-Sellami, a media adviser for the Social Solidarity Ministry, which oversees the program. \u201cThey can buy chicken, some ducks, some vegetables to sell, some sewing thread.\u201dThe monetary fund has said that it supports food subsidies and that the Egyptian government will try to increase aid and opportunities for the poor, including efforts to build public nurseries and provide vocational training for women.Despite the new loan, some economists expressed doubts that Egypt would be able to recover. Samer Atallah, a professor of economics at the American University in Cairo, suggested that it was unrealistic to expect that Mr. Sisi\u2019s government, which had ravaged the economy, would now save it.Mr. Atallah, noting the estimated $30 billion that Saudi Arabia and other gulf states had given Egypt, asked, \u201cWhere has it gone?\u201d\u201cThe policy instability, the corruption, the bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Attallah said. \u201cWhen domestic investors are thinking twice, why would international investors come?\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting from Cairo, and Declan Walsh from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Sent a Strong Signal on Trump ... Then Changed Their Minds", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe stock market\u2019s turbulent response to the election of Donald J. Trump \u2014 first down, then up \u2014 presents an interesting quandary: Was the election result good or bad for investors?Right now, it appears that they have made peace with the prospect of a Trump presidency. The S.&P. 500 \u2014 a broad-based index of stocks \u2014 closed last week 1.5 percent higher than its election-eve level. But this is a striking reversal from the initial judgment. Throughout the campaign, stocks rose whenever campaign developments made it less likely that Mr. Trump would be elected.If this was right, then a surprise Trump win should have led stocks to fall, and fall sharply. Just how sharply depends how much markets had already priced in the possibility of a Trump win, and our best guess was that it would lead stocks to fall by 8 to 10 percent.As predicted, traders in overnight markets responded savagely, and stocks plummeted. When the decline in S.&P. 500 futures hit 5 percent, it triggered the circuit breakers at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Foreign stock indexes were also cratering. While markets had yet to fall by as much as we had predicted, they appeared to be on their way.But then an unexpected second act began. The futures market reopened, and traders \u2014 who by now had had some time to digest the reality of a Trump presidency \u2014 reversed course. Over the next four hours, stock futures recovered around two-thirds of their earlier losses. By the time major markets in the United States opened the next morning for regular trading, stocks were almost back to pre-election levels. Stocks rose again on each of the following two days.What explains this roller-coaster?Some commentators have suggested that markets rallied in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s relatively conventional victory speech. His emphasis on infrastructure spending, in particular, might have boosted near-term growth expectations. But the speech began just before 3 a.m., three hours after the market turnaround. The speech was simply a rehashing of Mr. Trump\u2019s previously announced policies. A major infrastructure push might be good for stocks, but it\u2019s hard to believe that what was said at 3 a.m. changed the odds of its implementation. Moreover, the size of the stimulus \u2014 which would most likely be partly countered by a Fed tightening \u2014 is not large enough to explain a major market movement.Perhaps markets were responding to some other source of good news about the economy? I\u2019ve scoured news feeds from election night for other events that might have moved markets, and can\u2019t find anything.When conventional explanations fail, it\u2019s time to look for something more unorthodox.Mr. Zitzewitz thinks what happened is analogous to polling error. Overnight futures markets are populated by a relatively small number of traders who are attempting to predict how the broader market will respond the next day. Just as polling errors arise when pollsters survey more Democrats or Republicans than there are in the broader population, overnight markets can send faulty signals when they reflect more bears or bulls than the broader market.In his telling, the market turnaround really gathered steam when the European financial markets opened for regular trading at around 2 a.m. (Eastern time). And it continued with greater force as more of the world\u2019s traders awoke to discover that Mr. Trump had won and stocks were cheap.It\u2019s a story suggesting that it\u2019s worth listening to the signals from overnight markets, because they get it right on average. But it also suggests interpreting signals with greater caution than we showed, because they\u2019re an imperfect gauge of broader market sentiment.My own view is that last week\u2019s stock market gyrations reflect a more fundamental market failure.Call it a failure of imagination. Investors simply failed to imagine how they might feel when they woke up to President-elect Trump.Savvy investors are meant to be forward-looking and hungry for profits. There were huge potential profits \u2014 the opportunity to buy stocks when they were cheap \u2014 available for any investor who had the forethought on election eve to imagine that their colleagues would wake up and interpret what they already knew about Mr. Trump in a more broader or optimistic light.This failure to fully imagine the implications of the new world is not rational, but it\u2019s very human. I know that my thoughts in the days after Mr. Trump\u2019s win are different than those that dominated my election-eve conversations.What should I make of our forecast that stocks would fall if Mr. Trump were elected? One answer is that we were right, and that \u2014 at least until midnight \u2014 markets did fall sharply. A more humble answer is that we got this call totally wrong. It\u2019s not that we mis-measured what markets were telling us \u2014 I\u2019m confident we got that part right. It\u2019s that markets can change their minds, and we still lack a method for predicting that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thoughts for the Horrified", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported bySo what do we do now? By \u201cwe\u201d I mean all those left, center and even right who saw Donald Trump as the worst man ever to run for president and assumed that a strong majority of our fellow citizens would agree.I\u2019m not talking about rethinking political strategy. There will be a time for that \u2014 God knows it\u2019s clear that almost everyone on the center-left, myself included, was clueless about what actually works in persuading voters. For now, however, I\u2019m talking about personal attitude and behavior in the face of this terrible shock.First of all, remember that elections determine who gets the power, not who offers the truth. The Trump campaign was unprecedented in its dishonesty; the fact that the lies didn\u2019t exact a political price, that they even resonated with a large bloc of voters, doesn\u2019t make them any less false. No, our inner cities aren\u2019t war zones with record crime. No, we aren\u2019t the highest-taxed nation in the world. No, climate change isn\u2019t a hoax promoted by the Chinese.So if you\u2019re tempted to concede that the alt-right\u2019s vision of the world might have some truth to it, don\u2019t. Lies are lies, no matter how much power backs them up.And once we\u2019re talking about intellectual honesty, everyone needs to face up to the unpleasant reality that a Trump administration will do immense damage to America and the world. Of course I could be wrong; maybe the man in office will be completely different from the man we\u2019ve seen so far. But it\u2019s unlikely.Unfortunately, we\u2019re not just talking about four bad years. Tuesday\u2019s fallout will last for decades, maybe generations.I particularly worry about climate change. We were at a crucial point, having just reached a global agreement on emissions and having a clear policy path toward moving America to a much greater reliance on renewable energy. Now it will probably fall apart, and the damage may well be irreversible.The political damage will extend far into the future, too. The odds are that some terrible people will become Supreme Court justices. States will feel empowered to engage in even more voter suppression than they did this year. At worst, we could see a slightly covert form of Jim Crow become the norm all across America.And you have to wonder about civil liberties, too. The White House will soon be occupied by a man with obvious authoritarian instincts, and Congress controlled by a party that has shown no inclination to stand up against him. How bad will it get? Nobody knows.What about the short term? My own first instinct was to say that Trumponomics would quickly provoke an immediate economic crisis, but after a few hours\u2019 reflection I decided that this was probably wrong. I\u2019ll write more about this in the coming weeks, but a best guess is that there will be no immediate comeuppance.Trumpist policies won\u2019t help the people who voted for Donald Trump \u2014 in fact, his supporters will end up much worse off. But this story will probably unfold gradually. Political opponents of the new regime certainly shouldn\u2019t count on any near-term moment of obvious vindication.So where does this leave us? What, as concerned and horrified citizens, should we do?One natural response would be quietism, turning one\u2019s back on politics. It\u2019s definitely tempting to conclude that the world is going to hell, but that there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, so why not just make your own garden grow? I myself spent a large part of the Day After avoiding the news, doing personal things, basically taking a vacation in my own head.But that is, in the end, no way for citizens of a democracy \u2014 which we still are, one hopes \u2014 to live. I\u2019m not saying that we should all volunteer to die on the barricades; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come to that, although I wish I was sure. But I don\u2019t see how you can hang on to your own self-respect unless you\u2019re willing to stand up for the truth and fundamental American values.Will that stand eventually succeed? No guarantees. Americans, no matter how secular, tend to think of themselves as citizens of a nation with a special divine providence, one that may take wrong turns but always finds its way back, one in which justice always prevails in the end.Yet it doesn\u2019t have to be true. Maybe the historic channels of reform \u2014 speech and writing that changes minds, political activism that eventually changes who has power \u2014 are no longer effective. Maybe America isn\u2019t special, it\u2019s just another republic that had its day, but is in the process of devolving into a corrupt nation ruled by strongmen.But I\u2019m not ready to accept that this is inevitable \u2014 because accepting it as inevitable would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The road back to what America should be is going to be longer and harder than any of us expected, and we might not make it. But we have to try.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Expected to Seek Deep Cuts in Business Regulations", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe unwinding of Dodd-Frank. The firing up of shuttered coal plants. The rollback of rules that increase overtime pay for low-wage workers.Hours after Donald J. Trump won the race for the White House, scores of regulations that have reshaped corporate America in the last eight years suddenly seemed vulnerable.While many questions remain about how Mr. Trump will govern, a consensus emerged Wednesday in many circles in Washington and on Wall Street about at least one aspect of his impending presidency: Mr. Trump is likely to seek vast cuts in regulations across the banking, health care and energy industries.\u201cThis is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan,\u201d Stephen Moore, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThere are just so many regulations that could be eased.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump is a maverick politician, his anti-regulation stance is that of an old-school Republican. It is driven by a belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from the long arm of the federal government.Or at least that is what some analysts and economists say they think is Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale. Even after a long campaign of endless rallies and debates, Mr. Trump and his closest advisers have disclosed relatively few specific economic policy proposals.And some of what he has proposed seems contradictory. For example, he has said he would roll back the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, while his party platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Trump will probably find common ground with many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, on cutting regulation. They clashed during the campaign over Mr. Trump\u2019s past conduct toward women and inflammatory statements about ethnic groups, and many Republicans do not see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on immigration and trade.\u201cBut Ryan and Trump are like-minded on regulation in a way they are not on trade and immigration,\u201d said Ted Gayer, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThat is red meat for both of them.\u201dHere is a rundown on how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could gut regulations from Wall Street to Silicon Valley:A clean Republican sweep of the White House and Congress would normally be greeted by loud cheers across Wall Street.But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is not a clear boon for bankers and financiers in the way that past Republican wins have been.On paper, many of his campaign proposals appear to favor banks and investors, including a promise to undo Dodd-Frank, which was passed after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet repealing the law and its many rules seems unlikely to gain much traction in Congress. And even many banks admit they have spent so much time and money complying with the law, they would rather keep it.Several Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that they did not expect Congress to completely repeal Dodd-Frank. Instead of undertaking such a costly and controversial effort, one likely possibility is that the Trump administration and Congress would take aim at a handful of specific rules that most irritate the banks, including what is known as the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of Dodd-Frank that prohibits banks from placing risky bets with their own money.Otherwise, many of the expected changes would benefit small and midsize banks rather than Wall Street banks. Regulators, for example, could raise the size at which a bank is subject to Dodd-Frank\u2019s enhanced oversight.Other pieces of Dodd-Frank could be picked off, like reining in the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a hallmark of the Obama administration.Mr. Trump could prune other low-hanging financial regulations, including a newly enacted Department of Labor rule that holds investment advisers liable for certain advice to their clients.He also promised on the campaign trail to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that increases the wealth of private equity executives.And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign took aim at the honey pot of global banking revenue: free trade. For decades, banks have benefited from facilitating deals and lending to companies worldwide.\u201cProbably more so than any president in modern history it will be difficult to predict what issues he latches onto,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official in the Obama administration, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.MICHAEL CORKERY, BEN PROTESS and LESLIE PICKERIn the energy industry, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first targets, according to Mr. Moore, an economic adviser, is President Obama\u2019s effort to limit carbon emissions at coal-fired utilities.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say the rule drove coal companies into bankruptcy, even though the industry says that its problems are mostly caused by waning demand.It is unclear whether the election of Mr. Trump can help struggling coal miners get back their jobs, but it will almost certainly upend the world\u2019s efforts to curb the impact of global warming.While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete dismemberment of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, a Trump administration could significantly weaken or slow them.Mr. Trump has said that he would do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. The rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and not arguing for the rules, Mr. Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.A Trump administration could weaken, or even repeal, the rules governing fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for new cars and trucks.Oil and natural gas executives are hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver for them, too. They want a loosening of methane emission standards for existing oil wells and the opening of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a big difference,\u201d said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, an Oklahoma company.CORAL DAVENPORT, CLIFFORD KRAUSS and HIROKO TABUCHIAs income inequality and stagnant wages became a major preoccupation among voters, the Obama administration brought regulations and enforcement actions intended to increase the leverage of workers. Most of these efforts are now endangered by the prospect of a Republican president and Republican Congress.In theory, the regulation could be undone by the Trump administration through a rule-making process similar to the one that produced it. But this could take months, if not years. Instead, some lobbyists expect Congress to pass a legislative compromise that would rein in the overtime rule, by phasing it in over a number of years, and by limiting or undoing the automatic upward adjustment in the salary threshold every three years.Mr. Obama enacted a number of other policies through executive order rather than a more involved rule-making process, and these could be undone by a President Trump almost immediately, with the stroke of a pen. These include rules that increased the minimum wage and granted paid sick days to workers hired by federal contractors.Trump administration appointees could quickly reject such interpretations and enforce the law differently, said Marc Freedman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the N.L.R.B. could easily reverse such rulings.NOAM SCHEIBERThe idea of a Trump presidency triggered a sense of dread among many people in the liberal-leaning technology business.Mr. Trump is seen as less favorably disposed toward the concentration of power among the handful of large companies that dominate the internet, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate firm\u201cI think Donald Trump may be facile with Twitter but mostly feels hostility towards these companies and their size,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.During the campaign, Mr. Trump told an audience in May that \u201cwe\u2019re going get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\u201dMany technology executives have called that idea far-fetched since most of Apple\u2019s supply chain, including many of its parts makers, are in Asia.Mr. Trump also blasted Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, saying that he was using the political influence of The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns, to discourage government action against Amazon on tax and antitrust issues.And Mr. Trump has called for the rejection of AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner.Still, analysts expect that he will appoint antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department who will largely follow traditional Republican approaches to the free market.Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment.Mr. Trump will be under pressure by major telecom and cable firms to roll back aspects of net neutrality. The rule inhibits how broadband providers manage traffic on their networks to ensure any website is equally accessible to consumers.Telecom and cable firms continue to challenge the rules in court and Mr. Trump, with the encouragement of Republicans in Congress, may seek to abandon the regulation.NICK WINGFIELD, VINDU GOEL and CECILIA KANG\u201cThe truth is, who knows?\u201d said Ron Cohen, chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics and the chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry trade group. \u201cWe still have to deal with the basic issues that are confronting us as an industry, and those have not changed just because of an election.\u201dOutrage over the rising cost of prescription drugs has spiked in recent years as Americans struggle to pay for their medicines. Egregious examples of price increases, like those on Mylan\u2019s EpiPen and older drugs sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, prompted congressional hearings and investigations.At the same time, the drug industry has gone to war with insurers and employers who pay for their workers\u2019 health coverage. Those dynamics, several people said, have not changed, and outrage over high drug prices is seen as a bipartisan issue.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump placed less emphasis on the issue than Mrs. Clinton did during the campaign.KATIE THOMASAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latest Fed Discussion Reflects More Confidence in Raising Rates", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byThe exuberant reaction of financial markets to Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory has strengthened the case for higher rates, and solidified expectations that the Fed will act at its next meeting in December.But the latest meeting\u2019s account portrays a sense of growing urgency among the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed committee that sets the course of monetary policy.\u201cMany judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low-interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital,\u201d it said. The account was published after a standard three-week delay.The meeting account is in the same key. Two officials voted to raise rates in November, and the minutes said others were already convinced that the Fed should move in December, given its stated objectives. Moreover, the account said, \u201cMost participants expressed a view that it could well become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon, so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress toward the committee\u2019s objectives.\u201dInvestors are responding in part to Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans. He has promised to collaborate with congressional Republicans on a large tax cut and other measures intended to stimulate economic growth. Fed officials have all but begged for fiscal authorities to take a stronger hand, in part because they are eager to dial back their own efforts, and push rates up toward more normal levels.Yet the markets\u2019 reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory also creates some new problems.\u201cThe timing and scope of these actions is still highly uncertain,\u201d said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank. \u201cIn the meantime, interest- and exchange-rate sensitive sectors of the economy like housing and trade will take a hit, suggesting some downside risk to economic growth.\u201dThe Fed has kept its benchmark rate between 0.25 and 0.5 percent since last December. The policy is intended to bolster economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, but it has raised concerns that the Fed is encouraging too much borrowing and risk-taking.In addition, Fed officials have concluded that labor market conditions are unlikely to further improve, although the share of adults with jobs is significantly below the prerecession level.The account takes pains to emphasize that the Fed is planning a slow retreat. And it sounded a cautionary note about the strength of growth in the third quarter. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, but Fed officials pointed to a number of unusual factors, including a boom in soybean exports.\u201cExcluding these factors, underlying economic growth had been relatively modest,\u201d the account said. \u201cGrowth of consumer spending had slowed from its brisk pace earlier in the year, residential investment had fallen again, and business fixed investment had remained soft.\u201dInflation has increased a little faster than the Fed expected in recent months, although it remains below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as healthy. Some officials advocating a rate increase argue that inflation will begin to rise more quickly as labor markets tighten. That, in turn, could force the Fed to raise rates more quickly, potentially disrupting economic activity.But the Fed\u2019s concerns about inflation remain relatively subdued. Ms. Yellen told Congress last week that she saw little chance of a sharp rise in inflation. The weakness of the global economy continues to weigh on domestic inflation, in part by pushing up the value of the dollar.Mr. Trump\u2019s election also has pushed the dollar sharply higher.Advertisement"}

But on June 23, nearly 52 percent of voters decided that Britain should leave the 28-nation bloc. Prime Minister David Cameron resigned, leaving his successor, Theresa May, with the weighty task of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure from the union, a process that is just beginning to unfold, creating uncertainty in one of the world\u2019s largest economies and beyond.The jury was not asked to consider Mr. Mair\u2019s motivations.

{"Headline": "The Incendiary Appeal of Demagoguery in Our Time", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBrexit, Erdogan, Putin and now Trump. Something is rotten in the state of democracy.The stink first became unmistakable in India in May 2014, when Narendra Modi, a member of an alt-right Hindu organization inspired by fascists and Nazis, was elected prime minister. Like Donald Trump, Mr. Modi rose to power demonizing ethnic-religious minorities, immigrants and the establishment media, and boasting about the size of a body part.To paraphrase Jean-Paul Sartre: If the truth remains cloaked in the motherland, in the colonies it stands naked. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s election in America exposed the failures of democracy, they had been revealed in Mr. Modi\u2019s India. Most disturbing, in both places, the alt-rightists were enabled by the conceits, follies and collusion of impeccably mainstream individuals and institutions.The fervent rhetoric about private wealth-creation and its trickle-down benefits openly mocked, and eventually stigmatized, India\u2019s founding ideals of egalitarian and collective welfare. It is this extraordinary historical reversal, and its slick agents, that must be investigated in order to understand the incendiary appeal of demagoguery in our time.Writing after its explosion in 20th-century Europe, Karl Polanyi described in his 1944 book \u201cThe Great Transformation\u201d how civil society and individual liberty are threatened as never before when a society has to reconfigure itself to serve the \u201cutopian experiment of a self-regulating market.\u201d Social and political life in India, America and Europe was drastically remade by neoliberal economism in recent decades, under, as the legal scholar David Kennedy has argued, the administration of a professional global class of hidden persuaders and status-seekers.The sheer potential of India\u2019s market \u2014 1.2 billion consumers, many of them young \u2014 bred intoxicating illusions among businesspeople, investment consultants and financial journalists. Never mind that it was the extraction of natural resources, cheap labor and foreign capital inflows, rather than high productivity or innovation, that was fueling India\u2019s economy. Or that economic growth, of the uneven and jobless kind, was creating what the economists Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen have called \u201cislands of California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa.\u201dIndifferent to poverty and inequality, and immune to evidence or irony, India\u2019s largely corporate-owned press and television reveled in the fame and wealth of corporate magnates and of cricket and Bollywood stars. All the while they stoked hatred against such enemies of rising India as Kashmiri separatists and their Pakistani supporters.But in 2010 corruption scandals began to expose India\u2019s government \u2014 headed then by technocrats trained at Oxford, Harvard Business School and the World Bank \u2014 as both venal and inept. Mr. Modi and his hawkish Twitter account emerged into national politics just as growth faltered and many frustrated aspirers and also-rans started to think of the promise of widespread enrichment as an elaborate hoax. He noticed that they were venting against flailing political representatives and their apparent cronies among newsgatherers. He accordingly packaged himself as an efficient executive, exploiting Indians\u2019 great esteem for technocratic managerialism. (\u201cMein Kampf\u201d is a perennial bestseller in India, Hitler being seen as an exemplary nationalist-cum-people-manager.)B.R. Ambedkar, the main framer of India\u2019s constitution, warned in the 1950s that democracy in India was \u201conly a top dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.\u201d Now the top dressing is being hosed away.Two years after he became India\u2019s most powerful leader, Mr. Modi appears to be an opportunistic manipulator of disaffection with little to offer apart from the pornography of power and a bogus fantasy of machismo. Mr. Trump looks set to follow his lead.Such firebrands emerged out of economic and political crises in almost every major European country in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, distracting angry citizens with the demonization of minorities, cosmopolitans and liberals. Drawing a cautionary tale from this blood-stained history, Polanyi assumed that the catastrophic triumph of economism over social and political necessities would be reversed. The three decades after World War II proved him right. Social-welfare policies underpinned national reconstruction in war-ravaged Europe, as well as in postcolonial Asia and Africa after decades of imperialism.In our own time, a global network of elites has tried to restart the discredited utopian experiment of a self-regulating market. The experiment failed, and again the rage of cheated masses has spawned demagogues who simultaneously promise to avenge the left-behinds and to rewire their alliances with the elites. Any attempt to rebuild democracy must reckon with the deeper reasons for its great and drastic transformation \u2014 above all in India, where Hindu supremacism, in its cruelty and callousness, anticipated the big, big American fan of Hindu.Pankaj Mishra\u2019s new book, \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present,\u201d will be published in January 2017.Advertisement"}

In 2014, the club had come under scrutiny after the deaths of four others in the previous three years, which police had blamed on drug use.But in a hearing on Monday at Highbury magistrates court in North London, the Borough of Islington, home to the club, said it would allow Fabric to reopen after its owners had agreed to tough new antidrug measures, including preventing anyone under the age of 19 from entering, scanning identifications, and banning for life anyone caught dealing drugs or possessing them.Judy Griffith, promotions manager at Fabric, said by phone from Saint Philip, Barbados, that she was ecstatic about the news, which she said would give a big lift to London\u2019s night life and help secure an important sphere in British culture. \u201cI am over the moon, and very grateful for everyone that supported us. The reopening is a powerful sign that London is open at last,\u201d Ms. Griffith said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to planning an epic reopening.\u201dMr. Khan, who has been pressing to make the capital a 24-hour city by offering all-night service on subways on weekends, welcomed Fabric\u2019s reopening, noting that over the last eight years, London had lost half of its nightclubs and 40 percent of its live music venues.\u201cThis decline must stop if London is to retain its status as a 24-hour city with a world-class night life,\u201d Mr. Khan said.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s pragmatic. At least he\u2019s willing to try something different.\u201dThe seeds of the biggest upset in American politics in recent memory were sewn here, in the Midwest, where decades of economic decay largely ignored by Democrats came back to haunt Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump\u2019s populist economic message electrified blue-collar workers in ways that those of previous Republican candidates had not.The result was overwhelming support for Mr. Trump that polls utterly failed to predict, lifting turnout among Republican voters and even turning some reliably blue counties red. Stark County, a former manufacturing center south of Cleveland where voters have chosen Democrats in the past three presidential elections, was one of more than 215 that flipped to Mr. Trump.\u201cHis points really hit home for us,\u201d said Jacob Hawk, 23, an electrician from Minerva, Ohio, who voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. \u201cA huge portion of it was just bringing jobs back to Ohio.\u201dIn many ways, the vote here was just as much a rebellion against Mrs. Clinton as a choice made for Mr. Trump. Some say they saw her as the queen of a political dynasty whose reputation was tarnished in the 1990s. Her message felt flat and uninspiring. Perhaps most damaging, she was tainted by 1990s trade deals associated with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that cost the Midwest, and Ohio in particular, many jobs, a point Mr. Trump hammered away at.\u201cOur guys bring that up to this day,\u201d said Tim McCort, the director of a training center for electricians and a union member. \u201cThat was devastating to this area.\u201dHe added: \u201cThey didn\u2019t like Hillary. She just didn\u2019t come off as being honest.\u201dPolls got wrong something that residents in swing states plainly saw: Enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was boundless, while the feeling for Mrs. Clinton, outside of a handful of liberal strongholds, was like a body on life support. John McCall, 70, a lawyer who drove from his daughter\u2019s house in Philadelphia to his home in Canton, Ohio, said he was surprised by the difference in yard signs.\u201cWe were amazed,\u201d Mr. McCall, who voted for Mr. Trump, said as he ate lunch at Athens Restaurant in Canton. \u201cOnce you got to the middle of Pennsylvania, it was Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. But where were her signs? There was just a complete lack. It was the same in Ohio.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhen we got home, I told my wife that this election is a complete lock.\u201dThe numbers in Stark County tell the tale. In the 2012 presidential election, there were about 79,000 registered Democrats, compared with about 63,000 registered Republicans, according to the county\u2019s Board of Elections. In this election, the number of Democrats had fallen to about 42,500, while the number of Republicans had risen to more than 72,400. (Unaffiliated registrations also rose, and some said Democrats were changing parties to block Mr. Trump in the primary race.) Ultimately, Mr. Trump took 56 percent of the county\u2019s vote, to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 39 percent.\u201cPeople are starting to say, \u2018Hey, I think we\u2019ve had enough,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Noble, who estimated that about half of his colleagues in the union also voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve promised us so many things,\u201d he said, referring to the Democratic Party, \u201cand you don\u2019t deliver. Show us how you are going to help us.\u201dMichael Hanke, a former editor of The Repository, a local newspaper, said support for Mr. Trump grew out of a deep vein of despair stretching back to the 1980s, when wages began to stagnate and factory jobs started going away. Young people left for college and never came back. Drugs arrived. Families fell apart.It did not help that their problems were barely noticed by the news media or Washington policy makers. (Opioids have been devastating towns in Ohio since at least the 1990s, but wider attention to the problem has come only recently.)\u201cPeople feel despair when they hear that the economy is getting better but their own personal economy is not,\u201d Mr. Hanke said. He added that as journalists became more educated, they also became less connected to the broader community. \u201cLocally, I\u2019m not so sure we caught it, either. Even though we were here.\u201dBut the election here was about more than just a rejection of Mrs. Clinton. It was also an affirmation of Mr. Trump and his message. It caused a strange new split in the voting patterns of the electrical workers local. Most union leaders voted, as they always do, for the Democrat, Mrs. Clinton. But many rank-and-file electricians did not.\u201cI can\u2019t say I would have been extremely upset if she had won,\u201d he said while at a night class at a job training center, where he is studying to boost his credentials. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have seen it like the country\u2019s going to end if she became president. I was just pro what he was selling more than what she was selling.\u201dMr. McCort, the training center director, is skeptical that any president has the power to unleash a flood of jobs, and worries that Mr. Trump, instead of stamping out moneyed interests in Washington, will be ushering in an era of new ones.\u201cYou know darn well he\u2019s going to be shooting from the business side of the fence,\u201d Mr. McCort said. Still, he added: \u201cOne day at a time. I\u2019ve got to trust that our country is a good place and it\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201dAs for the Democratic Party, he said, \u201cThey really have some soul-searching to do in Ohio.\u201dMr. Hawk believes Mr. Trump will deliver the essence of what he has promised.\u201cDo I think he\u2019s going to accomplish building a wall? No. Do I think there will be some reforms of how immigration works and protection of the borders? Yes. And that would be nice.\u201dMr. Hawk has been too busy to watch television, working a full-time job and taking night classes, so he has missed most of the scenes of the anti-Trump protests across the country. But he has been turned off by the constant talk of racism. Mr. Hawk cast the first vote of his life for Mr. Obama because, he said, \u201cI liked his demeanor. The way he inspired people to be better.\u201d\u201cThey tried really hard to sell the whole racism thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnytime you turned on the TV or were listening to the radio, it was always there.\u201dResidents of swing counties like Stark are far less likely to be bubbles of like-minded people. But lately, that has been causing some stress. Disagreements over the election have ruined Thanksgiving plans, and even sundered some friendships. Some are in mourning. Fred Haymond, 70, roasted a turkey, \u201ccomfort food,\u201d he said, and invited over his adult children.\u201cMy country, as I remember it, would not have voted for this man,\u201d he said.At 12:47 a.m., on the night of the election, Bill Theiss, 70, a wine merchant from Canton and an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Trump, got a text message from his daughter, who is 37 and lives in Hawaii.\u201cI am disgusted,\u201d she wrote.He sent one back: \u201cYou know what your father thinks.\u201dShe replied with a long rant, full of angry words about fears for her daughter.\u201cI knew she had some feelings, I just didn\u2019t know how deep,\u201d Mr. Theiss said. \u201cIt was tough. It was very hard for me to read.\u201dHe has not written back yet.Sarah Cohen contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Trump Team\u2019s Economic Promises Will Be Hard to Execute", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The middle class will see a big tax cut, but the wealthy will not. American businesses will pay much lower taxes, and as a consequence bring back billions of dollars from overseas. All this will create sustained growth of 3 to 4 percent a year and prevent the budget deficit from exploding.That is the economic future described on Wednesday by the people President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s has chosen to lead the Treasury and Commerce Departments, Steven Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross.But in making those bold promises, the two men have contradicted some of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledges, promised economic growth targets that will be difficult to achieve given modern demographics, and committed to plans that even sympathetic analysts project will vastly widen the budget deficit.The comments shed light on how two men tapped as top economic policy makers in the Trump administration view their job ahead \u2014 but also expose what will be challenging about getting campaign goals accomplished.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.But Mr. Mnuchin was talking big: \u201cThis will be the largest tax change since Reagan.\u201dMr. Mnuchin suggested closing some tax loopholes would counter the effect of lower tax rates for the rich, but he mentioned only one: a cap on the mortgage interest deduction. Tax reformers have long suggested that mortgage payments should either no longer be deductible or be capped for mansions and second homes. Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury pick did not clarify what he meant.It was not clear whether the comments on Wednesday represented a shift in Mr. Trump\u2019s tax policy intentions or political spin.\u201cWhat he described there doesn\u2019t match the plan unveiled in September,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation. \u201cThis statement could be a legitimate pivot, or it could be hand waving. I don\u2019t know which.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to cut corporate taxes, which will bring huge amounts of jobs back to the United States. We\u2019re going to get to 15 percent, and we\u2019re going to bring a lot of cash back to the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross suggested that the plans would not widen the budget deficit thanks to \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d or forecasts that assume tax cuts will release much faster economic growth and therefore pay for themselves.But the Trump tax cuts would need to unleash far faster growth than the historical record suggests is likely to avoid rapidly increasing the budget deficit. The Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis of the September Trump campaign plan found that even with dynamic scoring, the plan would reduce federal revenue by $2.6 trillion to $3.9 trillion over the next decade, which absent spending cuts would enlarge the deficit by up to one-third over levels the Congressional Budget Office projects.And the Trump nominees stuck with a bullish forecast for long-term growth. \u201cOur No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told reporters gathered at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday. \u201cWe believe that\u2019s very sustainable.\u201dIt is true that economic growth averaged around 3.5 percent a year in the second half of the 20th century, before falling to around 2 percent a year in the last 15 years. In trying to achieve that goal, though, the Trump administration will face significant demographic headwinds.The speedy growth of the last century was helped along by the enormous baby boom generation entering the work force, and more women joining the ranks of the working. Now, the baby boom is retiring and the proportion of women working is stable.For those reasons, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the United States labor force will grow by 0.6 percent a year over the next decade. By contrast, from 1949 to 2000 it rose by an average of 1.7 percent a year.Another complication to the Trump team\u2019s predictions? Mr. Trump has promised tight controls on immigration, the one lever that could increase work force growth.To achieve the economic strength that the Trump administration is aiming for, either something will need to change existing demographic trends, such as higher immigration levels or would-be retirees working longer, or American businesses will need to find ways to become sharply more productive than they have been in recent years.In other words, as the Trump economic team forms and tries to turn bold campaign promises into policy reality, it may find that the biggest limit of all is economic math.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of Identity Liberalism", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOpinionIt is a truism that America has become a more diverse country. It is also a beautiful thing to watch. Visitors from other countries, particularly those having trouble incorporating different ethnic groups and faiths, are amazed that we manage to pull it off. Not perfectly, of course, but certainly better than any European or Asian nation today. It\u2019s an extraordinary success story.But how should this diversity shape our politics? The standard liberal answer for nearly a generation now has been that we should become aware of and \u201ccelebrate\u201d our differences. Which is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy \u2014 but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism\u2019s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.One of the many lessons of the recent presidential election campaign and its repugnant outcome is that the age of identity liberalism must be brought to an end. Hillary Clinton was at her best and most uplifting when she spoke about American interests in world affairs and how they relate to our understanding of democracy. But when it came to life at home, she tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to African-American, Latino, L.G.B.T. and women voters at every stop. This was a strategic mistake. If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them. If you don\u2019t, those left out will notice and feel excluded. Which, as the data show, was exactly what happened with the white working class and those with strong religious convictions. Fully two-thirds of white voters without college degrees voted for Donald Trump, as did over 80 percent of white evangelicals.The moral energy surrounding identity has, of course, had many good effects. Affirmative action has reshaped and improved corporate life. Black Lives Matter has delivered a wake-up call to every American with a conscience. Hollywood\u2019s efforts to normalize homosexuality in our popular culture helped to normalize it in American families and public life.But the fixation on diversity in our schools and in the press has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to Americans in every walk of life. At a very young age our children are being encouraged to talk about their individual identities, even before they have them. By the time they reach college many assume that diversity discourse exhausts political discourse, and have shockingly little to say about such perennial questions as class, war, the economy and the common good. In large part this is because of high school history curriculums, which anachronistically project the identity politics of today back onto the past, creating a distorted picture of the major forces and individuals that shaped our country. (The achievements of women\u2019s rights movements, for instance, were real and important, but you cannot understand them if you do not first understand the founding fathers\u2019 achievement in establishing a system of government based on the guarantee of rights.)When young people arrive at college they are encouraged to keep this focus on themselves by student groups, faculty members and also administrators whose full-time job is to deal with \u2014 and heighten the significance of \u2014 \u201cdiversity issues.\u201d Fox News and other conservative media outlets make great sport of mocking the \u201ccampus craziness\u201d that surrounds such issues, and more often than not they are right to. Which only plays into the hands of populist demagogues who want to delegitimize learning in the eyes of those who have never set foot on a campus. How to explain to the average voter the supposed moral urgency of giving college students the right to choose the designated gender pronouns to be used when addressing them? How not to laugh along with those voters at the story of a University of Michigan prankster who wrote in \u201cHis Majesty\u201d?This campus-diversity consciousness has over the years filtered into the liberal media, and not subtly. Affirmative action for women and minorities at America\u2019s newspapers and broadcasters has been an extraordinary social achievement \u2014 and has even changed, quite literally, the face of right-wing media, as journalists like Megyn Kelly and Laura Ingraham have gained prominence. But it also appears to have encouraged the assumption, especially among younger journalists and editors, that simply by focusing on identity they have done their jobs.Recently I performed a little experiment during a sabbatical in France: For a full year I read only European publications, not American ones. My thought was to try seeing the world as European readers did. But it was far more instructive to return home and realize how the lens of identity has transformed American reporting in recent years. How often, for example, the laziest story in American journalism \u2014 about the \u201cfirst X to do Y\u201d \u2014 is told and retold. Fascination with the identity drama has even affected foreign reporting, which is in distressingly short supply. However interesting it may be to read, say, about the fate of transgender people in Egypt, it contributes nothing to educating Americans about the powerful political and religious currents that will determine Egypt\u2019s future, and indirectly, our own. No major news outlet in Europe would think of adopting such a focus.But it is at the level of electoral politics that identity liberalism has failed most spectacularly, as we have just seen. National politics in healthy periods is not about \u201cdifference,\u201d it is about commonality. And it will be dominated by whoever best captures Americans\u2019 imaginations about our shared destiny. Ronald Reagan did that very skillfully, whatever one may think of his vision. So did Bill Clinton, who took a page from Reagan\u2019s playbook. He seized the Democratic Party away from its identity-conscious wing, concentrated his energies on domestic programs that would benefit everyone (like national health insurance) and defined America\u2019s role in the post-1989 world. By remaining in office for two terms, he was then able to accomplish much for different groups in the Democratic coalition. Identity politics, by contrast, is largely expressive, not persuasive. Which is why it never wins elections \u2014 but can lose them.The media\u2019s newfound, almost anthropological, interest in the angry white male reveals as much about the state of our liberalism as it does about this much maligned, and previously ignored, figure. A convenient liberal interpretation of the recent presidential election would have it that Mr. Trump won in large part because he managed to transform economic disadvantage into racial rage \u2014 the \u201cwhitelash\u201d thesis. This is convenient because it sanctions a conviction of moral superiority and allows liberals to ignore what those voters said were their overriding concerns. It also encourages the fantasy that the Republican right is doomed to demographic extinction in the long run \u2014 which means liberals have only to wait for the country to fall into their laps. The surprisingly high percentage of the Latino vote that went to Mr. Trump should remind us that the longer ethnic groups are here in this country, the more politically diverse they become.Finally, the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored. Such people are not actually reacting against the reality of our diverse America (they tend, after all, to live in homogeneous areas of the country). But they are reacting against the omnipresent rhetoric of identity, which is what they mean by \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d Liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in American politics was the Ku Klux Klan, which still exists. Those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.We need a post-identity liberalism, and it should draw from the past successes of pre-identity liberalism. Such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them. It would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. As for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale. (To paraphrase Bernie Sanders, America is sick and tired of hearing about liberals\u2019 damn bathrooms.)Teachers committed to such a liberalism would refocus attention on their main political responsibility in a democracy: to form committed citizens aware of their system of government and the major forces and events in our history. A post-identity liberalism would also emphasize that democracy is not only about rights; it also confers duties on its citizens, such as the duties to keep informed and vote. A post-identity liberal press would begin educating itself about parts of the country that have been ignored, and about what matters there, especially religion. And it would take seriously its responsibility to educate Americans about the major forces shaping world politics, especially their historical dimension.Some years ago I was invited to a union convention in Florida to speak on a panel about Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s famous Four Freedoms speech of 1941. The hall was full of representatives from local chapters \u2014 men, women, blacks, whites, Latinos. We began by singing the national anthem, and then sat down to listen to a recording of Roosevelt\u2019s speech. As I looked out into the crowd, and saw the array of different faces, I was struck by how focused they were on what they shared. And listening to Roosevelt\u2019s stirring voice as he invoked the freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want and the freedom from fear \u2014 freedoms that Roosevelt demanded for \u201ceveryone in the world\u201d \u2014 I was reminded of what the real foundations of modern American liberalism are.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Victory Was Built on Unique Coalition of White Voters", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump\u2019s America flowered through the old union strongholds of the Midwest, along rivers and rail lines that once moved coal from southern Ohio and the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania.It flowed south along the Mississippi River, through the rural Iowa counties that gave Barack Obama more votes than any Democrat in decades, and to the Northeast, through a corner of Connecticut and deep into Maine.And it extended through the suburbs of Cleveland and Minneapolis, of Manchester, N.H., and the sprawl north of Tampa, Fla., where middle-class white voters chose Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton.One of the biggest upsets in American political history was built on a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate, according to election results and interviews with voters and demographic experts.Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition comprised not just staunchly conservative Republicans in the South and West. They were joined by millions of voters in the onetime heartlands of 20th-century liberal populism \u2014 the Upper and Lower Midwest \u2014 where white Americans without a college degree voted decisively to reject the more diverse, educated and cosmopolitan Democratic Party of the 21st century, making Republicans the country\u2019s dominant political party at every level of government.Mr. Trump spoke to their aspirations and fears more directly than any Republican candidate in decades, attacking illegal immigrants and Muslims and promising early Wednesday to return \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d to the symbolic and political forefront of American life. He electrified the country\u2019s white majority and mustered its full strength against long-term demographic decay.\u201cA lot of stuff he\u2019s talking about is just God-given common sense, which I think both parties have lost,\u201d said Tom Kirkpatrick, 51, a Trump supporter who used to work in an industrial laundry plant and is now on disability. He stood near the Florida State Capitol on Tuesday, holding an American flag. \u201cLet\u2019s put him in. And if he doesn\u2019t do what he says, I\u2019ll help you vote him out.\u201dBut Mr. Trump also won over millions of voters who had once flocked to President Obama\u2019s promise of hope and change, and who on Tuesday saw in Mr. Trump their best chance to dampen the most painful blows of globalization and trade, to fight special interests, and to be heard and protected. Twelve percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters approved of Mr. Obama, according to the exit polls.Mrs. Clinton won by a greater margin than Mr. Obama among affluent whites, particularly those living in the Democratic Party\u2019s prosperous coastal strongholds: Washington and Boston, Seattle and New York. In Manhattan, where Mr. Trump lives and works \u2014 and where his fellow citizens mocked and jeered him as he voted on Tuesday \u2014 Mrs. Clinton won by a record margin, amassing 87 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump\u2019s 10 percent. Around the country, she won a majority of voters over all, harvesting the country\u2019s growing and densely packed big cities and a plurality of the suburbs.But Mr. Trump won low-income white voters to the Republican ticket, reversing a partisan divide along class lines that is as old as the Democratic and Republican Parties \u2014 a replay of the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June, when the old bastions of England\u2019s Labor-left voted decisively to leave the European Union. His breakthrough among white working-class voters in the North not only erased the Democratic advantage but reversed it, giving him a victory in the Electoral College while he lost the national popular vote.Most strikingly, Mr. Trump won his biggest margins among middle-income white voters, according to exit polls, a revolt not only of the white working class but of the country\u2019s vast white middle class. He did better than past Republicans in the sprawling suburbs along Florida\u2019s central coasts, overwhelming Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains among Hispanic voters. He held down Mrs. Clinton\u2019s margins in the Philadelphia suburbs, defying expectations that Mrs. Clinton would outperform Mr. Obama by a wide margin.Magnified by the constitutional design of the Electoral College, and aided by Republican-led efforts to dampen black and Latino voting in states like North Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s America proved the larger on Election Day. It smashed through the Democrats\u2019 supposed electoral \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2014 the 18 states carried by Democrats in every election since 1992, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, plus the diverse and well-educated parts of the country that Mr. Obama attracted in his two races, like New Mexico, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado.Starting Wednesday, you could walk from the Vermont border through Appalachian coal country to the outskirts of St. Louis without crossing a county Mr. Trump did not win decisively. You could head south through rural and suburban Georgia all the way to South Florida, or northwest through the Upper Midwest, or make a beeline for the West Coast, skirting only the rising Democratic communities of Colorado and the booming multicultural sprawl of Las Vegas before finally reaching Mrs. Clinton\u2019s part of the country.\u201cIt\u2019s not that he was the most polished of politicians,\u201d said Justin Channell, 36, of Brewer, Me., who works at a health insurance company. \u201cI liked the message of the anti-establishment, that corruption in D.C. is so prevalent.\u201dMrs. Clinton won the America of big, racially diverse cities and centers of the new economy, from Silicon Valley to the Silicon Slopes of Utah, where many traditionally Republican voters rejected Mr. Trump. But lining up for Mr. Trump was a parallel urban America of smaller cities \u2014 places like Scranton, Pa.; Youngstown, Ohio; and Dubuque, Iowa \u2014 that boomed during the industrial era, and are still connected by the arteries of the old American economy.She had hoped for a surge of voting by Latinos, immigrants and African-Americans, a manifestation of the rising American electorate long predicted by liberal strategists and feared by the Republican elite in Washington. But exit polls suggest that Mr. Trump \u2014 despite his attacks on immigrants, Muslims and Mexicans, and his clumsy invocation of black neighborhoods mired in chaos and decay \u2014 did not fare worse among the African-American and Latino voters who showed up to the polls than Mitt Romney did four years ago.In Miami-Dade County, where Mr. Trump had more room to lose ground among Hispanic voters than anywhere else in the country, Mrs. Clinton inched up to only 64 percent from Mr. Obama\u2019s 62 percent of the Hispanic vote. Turnout dropped considerably in black communities across the country, from the rural South to Cleveland, Milwaukee and Detroit.By Wednesday, the notion of a Democratic electoral map advantage bolstered by rising Hispanic power seemed distant. Even if Mrs. Clinton had won Florida, Mr. Trump would have powered to victory through the new Republican heartland, in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where Hispanic voters represent just a fraction of the electorate.Nor was the growing Hispanic vote \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength among well-educated voters \u2014 enough to pull her especially close in either Arizona or Texas, the only two heavily Hispanic states that could have plausibly joined Florida to put her over the top.Even where Democratic-leaning Hispanics are growing as a force, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters were waiting on Tuesday.Anthony Brdar, 42, stood in front of his West Miami polling station, holding a handmade \u201cVote Trump\u201d sign, and waved a T-shirt of Mr. Obama\u2019s face made to look like the Joker. It called him a tyrant. An out-of-work lawyer who lives in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood in Miami, Mr. Brdar said he had never felt so compelled to vote.\u201cI feel our country is on the verge of becoming a third world country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur children are not going to have a future. We are not going to have a future.\u201dAlan Blinder, Jess Bidgood and Frances Robles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byIt was a rough night for number crunchers. And for the faith that people in every field \u2014 business, politics, sports and academia \u2014 have increasingly placed in the power of data.Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory ran counter to almost every major forecast \u2014 undercutting the belief that analyzing reams of data can accurately predict events. Voters demonstrated how much predictive analytics, and election forecasting in particular, remains a young science: Some people may have been misled into thinking Hillary Clinton\u2019s win was assured because some of the forecasts lacked context explaining potentially wide margins of error.The election prediction business is one small aspect of a far-reaching change across industries that have increasingly become obsessed with data, the value of it and the potential to mine it for cost-saving and profit-making insights. It is a behind-the-scenes technology that quietly drives everything from the ads that people see online to billion-dollar acquisition deals.But data science is a technology advance with trade-offs. It can see things as never before, but also can be a blunt instrument, missing context and nuance. All kinds of companies and institutions use data quietly and behind the scenes to make predictions about human behavior. But only occasionally \u2014 as with Tuesday\u2019s election results \u2014 do consumers get a glimpse of how these formulas work and the extent to which they can go wrong.This year, Facebook\u2019s algorithm took down the image, posted by a Norwegian author, of a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs. The software code saw a violation of the social network\u2019s policy prohibiting child pornography, not an iconic photo of the Vietnam War and human suffering.This week\u2019s failed election predictions suggest that the rush to exploit data may have outstripped the ability to recognize its limits.\u201cState polls were off in a way that has not been seen in previous presidential election years,\u201d said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who is a co-founder of the Princeton Election Consortium. He speculated that polls may have failed to capture Republican loyalists who initially vowed not to vote for Mr. Trump, but changed their minds in the voting booth.Beyond election night, there are broader lessons that raise questions about the rush to embrace data-driven decision-making across the economy and society.The enthusiasm for big data has been fueled by the success stories of Silicon Valley giants born on the internet, like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The digital powerhouses harvest vast amounts of user data using clever software for search, social networks and online commerce. Data is the fuel, and algorithms borrowed from the tool kit of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, are the engine.The early commercial use for the technology has been to improve the odds of making a sale \u2014 through targeted ads, personalized marketing and product recommendations. But big-data decision-making is increasingly being embraced in every industry, and to make higher-stakes decisions that crucially affect people\u2019s lives \u2014 like helping to make medical diagnoses, hiring choices and loan approvals.The danger, data experts say, lies in trusting the data analysis too much without grasping its limitations and the potentially flawed assumptions of the people who build predictive models.Mr. Brynjolfsson said that people often do not understand that if the chance that something will happen is 70 percent, that means there is a 30 percent chance it will not occur. The election performance, he said, is \u201cnot really a shock to data science and statistics. It\u2019s how it works.\u201dSo, what happened with the election data and algorithms? The answer, it seems, is a combination of the shortcomings of polling, analysis and interpretation, perhaps both in how the numbers were presented and how they were understood by the public.Mr. Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, and Mr. Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium said state polling errors were largely to blame for the underestimates of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning.In addition to the polling errors, data scientists said the inherent weakness of election models might have caused some forecasting errors. Before an election, forecasters use a combination of historical polls and recent polling data to predict a candidate\u2019s chance of winning. Some may also factor in other variables, such as giving higher weight to a candidate who is an incumbent.But even with decades of polls to analyze, it is difficult for forecasters to predict accurately a candidate\u2019s chance of winning the presidency months or even weeks ahead of time. Dr. Mutalik of Yale compared election modeling to weather forecasting.\u201cEven with the best models, it is difficult to predict the weather more than 10 days out because there are so many small changes that can cause big changes,\u201d Dr. Mutalik said. \u201cIn mathematics, this is known as chaos.\u201dBut, unlike weather prediction, current election models tend to take into account only several decades\u2019 worth of data. And changing the parameters of that data set can also significantly affect calculations.Advertisement"}

But the bitterness toward Fidel Castro, the Cuban dictator who died over the weekend, remained.At the counter, Pedro Morales dunked his buttered roll into his caf\u00e9 con leche. He was more pleased about how President-elect Donald J. Trump was going to improve the economy of the United States than about Mr. Castro\u2019s death. But he wanted to keep a low profile.\u201cBecause politics put me here,\u201d Mr. Morales, 83, said.Philip Flores, 70, sitting on a nearby stool, preferred not to dance on the man\u2019s grave. \u201cHistory is going to judge him,\u201d Mr. Flores said.In the decades to come, Cubans were the ones being imprisoned for opposing Mr. Castro\u2019s government. When they were released, they came to join relatives or friends in Union City or neighboring West New York, a town in Hudson County.But by the late 1990s, many Cuban families had outgrown Bergenline Avenue and moved to the suburbs. Factories started closing. Immigrants from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru moved in, opening businesses that cater to a Latin American audience. By 2014, only 6,583 Cubans lived here, according census data.One longtime customer at El Artesano had an explanation for the dwindling number of Cubans. \u201cThey\u2019re either in Florida or they are in the cemetery,\u201d said Jose, an 87-year-old who, 48 years after fleeing Cuba, was still too frightened to give his full name. So was his wife of 58 years. She had ordered a hamburger, with a Cuban flag toothpick planted on its bun.The heart of Union City\u2019s Cuban neighborhood is 43rd Street, which was renamed Celia Cruz Way for the Cuban-born singer who defected in 1960. On that block stands the tallest building in Union City, one which once housed embroidery factories. Now the tenants include a Dominican-owned dressmaking factory and a Cuban-owned fabric company. The building is not fully occupied.\u201cI am so happy because Castro destroyed my family in more than one way,\u201d said Jose Gutierrez-Solana, 75, who had been a political prisoner for 10 years and is the group\u2019s secretary. \u201cHe destroyed all of our country. We wanted to kill him. This is one step to a different country.\u201dBut how much will things really change, since Mr. Castro\u2019s younger brother, Ra\u00fal, is still in charge? \u201cNo, they don\u2019t change anything,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez-Solana said. \u201cThey are in power and they do whatever they want.\u201dThat is the sentiment shared by certain retirees who gather in the local restaurants with newspapers to trade gossip about life and the country they have not seen for a half-century.From El Artesano, Mr. Morales headed to El Unico, another nearby restaurant, to continue his day. In a Fairway market bag, he carried the Cuban newspaper \u201cLibre,\u201d sent from Miami, to share.They all considered themselves American, more than Cuban, even if they did not speak fluent English.\u201cI live here 50 years, more than in Cuba,\u201d said Augusto Same, 73, who fled the island in a boat that he said took him and his family four days to reach Nassau, in the Bahamas.\u201cI left Cuba because I lost my business,\u201d said Pedro Comas, 87, wearing a Notre Dame baseball cap, the alma mater of his granddaughter.They talked about returning to Cuba, perhaps one day, but then shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming now,\u201d Mr. Same said. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise. So we wait.\u201dArecia Hernandez, 60, the owner of Arecia\u2019s Creations, a bridal store in Weehawken, arrived in 1967 when she was 10. Her father had been on a list of boat owners allowed to leave the country.The memories she prefers are of Havana on the Hudson.As a teenager, Ms. Hernandez recalled, \u201cwe used to go up and down on Bergenline Avenue, the stores were beautiful, everything was so nice and clean.\u201d\u201cWe were all decked out, makeup, heels,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe were gorgeous; we looked like models.\u201dShe and her best friend, Carmen Pino, would walk the avenue during the day.

{"Headline": "Crowds Line Up at India\u2019s Banks to Exchange Banned Rupee Notes", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Thousands of security forces were deployed on Thursday to keep the peace at India\u2019s banks, where crowds of people had formed jittery, snaking lines in the early morning, desperate to exchange now-useless currency notes.For the next two weeks, citizens will be able to exchange 4,000 rupees a day, or about $60. But they will have difficulty converting large cash holdings because they will have to declare them to the tax authorities. Money that cannot be exchanged will be, as officials put it, \u201cextinguished.\u201dThe plan, top secret until Mr. Modi\u2019s announcement, was hailed by financial analysts as bold and potentially transformational for India. It is also a high-stakes experiment: Though other Indian leaders have withdrawn currency notes, none have reduced the country\u2019s supply of cash so drastically or so abruptly. The two bills being withdrawn make up 80 percent of the cash in circulation.Many people on the street this week said they were stunned and angry. Brawls broke out in lines outside banks, where many had to stand for hours, uncertain whether the stockpile of bills would run out.We want to hear from those living in India on Mr. Modi\u2019s move, and the impact it has had on you and your family.\u201cI am in a very foul mood, and for business, this government is not good at all,\u201d said Ayush Singhal, 26, a trader in packing tape, whose shop was all but deserted after the currency was withdrawn. The Old Delhi wholesale market, one of the largest in Asia, operates almost entirely on a cash basis, Mr. Singhal said.\u201cWe have to figure out some other way of conducting business,\u201d Mr. Singhal said, his face grave. \u201cFor now, I am at a loss for words.\u201dPoor migrants to the city said the sudden move had stranded them without enough money to eat.Umeshwar Prasad Rao, a farmer, had traveled hundreds of miles to New Delhi so that his daughter could have an operation, carrying his life savings of 10,000 rupees in 500-rupee notes.Because he did not have a government identification card, Mr. Rao could not exchange the money for usable notes. By midday on Thursday his family had consumed nothing but tea. Scores of families sprawled on the sidewalk around the hospital, with similar complaints.\u201cI am at my wits\u2019 end,\u201d Mr. Rao said. He was hoping to get food from a charity. \u201cOtherwise, we will be fasting,\u201d he said.The people who help others unload \u201cblack money\u201d were doing a booming business. Gold merchants saw the price for 10 ounces of gold nearly double, so eager were customers to dispose of their large bills.Nishant Verma, who runs a family jewelry shop, kept his doors open until 1 a.m. two nights in a row to accommodate what he called a \u201cmad rush.\u201dBut the busiest of all were money launderers \u2014 small-timers who converted stacks of 1,000-rupee bills to 100-rupee notes for a 500-rupee fee; and larger-scale cash-on-hand firms, which provide companies with cash for undeclared payments, or bribes, registering the sum as a loan or an advance.Other businesses might backdate the receipts, suggesting that the invalid bills were exchanged before Mr. Modi\u2019s announcement, said Ajay Shah, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. \u201cThere is infinite ingenuity out there,\u201d he said.Hospitals and crematories, which are exempted from the ban, may also turn a profit by exchanging large numbers of bills for a fee.

{"Headline": "Climate Change in Trump\u2019s Age of Ignorance", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionStanford, Calif. \u2014 THE good news got pretty much drowned out this month: Yes, 2016 is on track to become the hottest year on record, but thankfully also the third year in a row to see relatively flat growth in global greenhouse gas emissions. With global economic growth on the order of 3 percent a year, we may well have turned a corner toward a sustainable climate economy.The bad news, of course, is that the world\u2019s wealthiest nation, home to many of the scholars scrambling to reverse global warming, has elected a new president with little or no interest in the topic. Or an active disinterest. Donald J. Trump is surrounding himself with advisers who are likely to do little to challenge his notion of climate change as a Chinese hoax. People like to think of us as living in an age of information, but a better descriptor might be \u201cthe age of ignorance.\u201dHow did we get into this predicament? Why are we about to inaugurate the most anti-science administration in American history?As a graduate student at Harvard in the 1970s and early 1980s, I was astonished to find how little concern there was for the beliefs of ordinary Americans. I was in the history of science department, where all the talk was of Einstein and Darwin and Newton, with the occasional glance at the \u201creception\u201d of such ideas in the larger literate populace.How the president-elect deals with climate change could make him the man who shrunk America or the man who helped save the planet.I had grown up in a small town in Texas, and later in Kansas City, where the people I knew often talked about nature and God\u2019s glory and corruption and the good life. At Harvard, though, I was puzzled that my professors seemed to have little interest in people outside the vanguard, the kinds of people I had come from, many of whom were fundamentalist Christians, people of solid faith but often in desperate conditions. Why was there so little interest in what they thought or believed? That\u2019s Point 1.Point 2: Early in my career as a historian, I was further bothered by how little attention was given to science as an instrument of popular deception. We like to think of science as the opposite of ignorance, the light that washes away the darkness, but there\u2019s much more to that story.Here my Harvard years were more illuminating. I got into a crowd of appropriately radicalized students, and started to better understand the place of science in the arc of human history. I learned about how science has not always been the saving grace we like to imagine; science gives rise as easily to nuclear bombs and bioweapons as to penicillin and the iPad. I taught for several years in the biology department, where I learned that cigarette makers had been giving millions of dollars to Harvard and other elite institutions to curry favor.I also started understanding how science could be used as an instrument of deception \u2014 and to create or perpetuate ignorance. That is important, because while scholars were ignoring what Karl Marx dismissively called \u201cthe idiocy of rural life\u201d (Point 1), tobacco and soft drink and oil companies facing taxation and regulation were busily disseminating mythologies about their products, to keep potential regulators at bay (Point 2).The denialist conspiracy of the cigarette industry was crucial in this context, since science was one of the instruments used by Big Tobacco to carry out its denial (and distraction) campaign. Cigarette makers had met at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on Dec. 14, 1953, to plan a strategy to rebut the evidence that cigarettes were causing cancer and other maladies. The strategy was pure genius: The claim would be that it had not been \u201cproved\u201d that cigarettes really cause disease, so there was room for honest doubt. Cigarette makers promised to finance research to get to the truth, while privately acknowledging (in a notorious Brown & Williamson document from 1969) that \u201cDoubt is our product.\u201dFor decades thereafter, cigarette makers poured hundreds of millions of dollars into basic biomedical research, exploring things like genetic and viral or occupational causes of cancer \u2014 anything but tobacco. Research financed by the industry led to over 7,000 publications in peer-reviewed medical literature and 10 Nobel Prizes. Including consulting relationships, my research shows that at least 25 Nobel laureates have taken money from the cigarette industry over the past half-century. (Full disclosure: I\u2019ve testified against that industry in dozens of tobacco trials.)Now we know that many other industries have learned from Big Tobacco\u2019s playbook. Physicians hired by the National Football League have questioned the evidence that concussions can cause brain disease, and soda sellers have financed research to deny that sugar causes obesity. And climate deniers have conducted a kind of scavenger hunt for oddities that appear to challenge the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists.This latter fact might be little more than a historical quirk, were it not for the fact that we\u2019ll soon have a president whose understanding of science is more like that of the people in the towns where I grew up than those scholars who taught me about Darwin and Einstein at Harvard.We now live in a world where ignorance of a very dangerous sort is being deliberately manufactured, to protect certain kinds of unfettered corporate enterprise. The global climate catastrophe gets short shrift, largely because powerful fossil fuel producers still have enormous political clout, following decades-long campaigns to sow doubt about whether anthropogenic emissions are really causing planetary warming. Trust in science suffers, but also trust in government. And that is not an accident. Climate deniers are not so much anti-science as anti-regulation and anti-government.Part of the strategy, according to Mr. Nesbit, who worked for a group involved in the effort and witnessed firsthand the beginning of this devil\u2019s dance, was to sow doubt by corrupting expertise, while simultaneously capturing the high ground of open-mindedness and even caution itself, with the deceptive mantra: \u201cWe need more research.\u201d Much of the climate denial now embraced by people like Mr. Trump was first expressed in the disinformation campaigns of Big Oil \u2014 campaigns modeled closely on Big Tobacco\u2019s strategies.We sometimes hear that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, but a \u201crepeat\u201d is perhaps now the least of our worries. Judging purely from his transition team, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration could be more hostile to modern science \u2014 and especially earth and environmental sciences \u2014 than any we have ever had. Whole agencies could go on the chopping block or face deliberate evisceration. President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan may be in jeopardy, along with funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Grumblings can even be heard from Europe that if the Paris climate accord is abandoned, the United States may face carbon taxes on its export goods. Ignorance and its diabolic facilitator \u2014 the corruption of expertise \u2014 both have real-world costs that we ignore at our peril.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Helped Create Trump, and That\u2019s Bad for It", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the election of Donald J. Trump, technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency.Facebook and Google, for example, have both carried fake, frequently incendiary, articles that were highly shared by their users; Twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well, while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far-right hate groups organize and recruit, frequently targeting women and minorities on the site.The leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldn\u2019t try to police political debates. Facebook explains that it can\u2019t be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization.Nice try. These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels. They see America as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The American auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia. Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, said on Twitter that \u201cDetroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity. That is what is to be avoided.\u201dHere is the explanation from Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn\u2019s founder and a Clinton supporter, for Detroit\u2019s failures: \u201cThe overriding problem was this: The auto industry got too comfortable,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cThe Start-Up of You\u201d (the title alone speaks volumes). \u201cThe moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular.\u201d He also attacked any notion of continuity: \u201cInstead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst, they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism.\u201dMr. Hoffman goes further, arguing that it\u2019s not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world. People must harness them, as well.\u201cThe conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Information is limited. Resources are tight. Competition is fierce. The world is changing. And the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking. This means you need to be adapting all the time. And if you fail to adapt, no one \u2014 not your employer, not the government \u2014 is going to catch you when you fall.\u201dIt\u2019s an exhausting, Darwinian life he is describing \u2014 endlessly adapting to a changing, pitiless world. And it\u2019s precisely the opposite kind of life that Mr. Trump was espousing. His voters wish to return to the inefficient, enthusiastically nepotistic (you might call it family-based) factory life of the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 when America was great. Mr. Trump promised to bring his supporters\u2019 jobs back; the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy.It\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy. But at least he wasn\u2019t publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working Uber driver.There is one final irony. Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals. In the election, the biggest beneficiary of disruption was Mr. Trump, who defied all rules around decency, responsibility, truthfulness, consistency and even social custom, like releasing tax returns. And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied. Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalism also threatens the global consensus that is so important to the expansion of the tech giants. Yesterday, Russian authorities blocked LinkedIn over a data storage law.How do you like your disruption now?Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Secret to Iceland\u2019s Tourism Boom? A Financial Crash and a Volcanic Eruption", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byReykjavik JournalREYKJAVIK, Iceland \u2014 Iceland has discovered the secret to a booming tourist industry: First have a mammoth financial implosion, then an enormous volcanic explosion.The collapse of the Icelandic krona after the 2008 financial crisis transformed this Arctic island packed with 35 active volcanoes into a top destination by making it cheap for visitors.\u201cIceland has been saved by the crash and the eruption,\u201d said Fridrik Palsson, who owns Hotel Ranga, a luxury resort just 19 miles from the slopes of Eyjafjallajokull, the 16-letter volcano that is often shortened to E-16 by foreigners. \u201cI have never seen anything take off so fast,\u201d he said.The combined effect of the catastrophes has been an invasion on a scale possibly unseen since Vikings raided the island hundreds of years ago. Tourists are expected to outnumber the local population of 330,000 by seven to one next year, according to official data. By comparison, last year visitors to France outnumbered the French by two to oneTourism is now the island\u2019s biggest industry, taking over from fishing and aluminum smelting, much as the financial sector did in the years before the crash.The number of tourists has risen by as much as 30 percent every year for the last four years, according to Iceland\u2019s Tourist Board. They brought in revenues of $3.2 billion in 2015, a third of the country\u2019s export earnings. Tourism is the single biggest employer, and many Icelanders are pouring money into services and new construction.Mr. Palsson, who used to sell Iceland as a place to see the Northern Lights, employs an astronomer in his hotel. He has also invested in three expensive telescopes that are powerful enough for guests to see the rings on Saturn or the fuzzy glow of a distant dying star.Landsbref, a fund management company that was spun off from one of three failed Icelandic banks, set up a $37 million tourism fund.Reykjavik looks like a Scandinavian version of Singapore: compact, clean, orderly, and rich. Streets are lined with Crayola-color houses and Mercedes cars. Chic coffeehouses sell kale-and-date sandwiches, and play Ethiopian jazz. Restaurants offer inventive Nordic cuisine using local ingredients like puffin and shark. (One chef also proudly announced that Iceland now grows cucumbers, albeit in a greenhouse.)The 101, a boutique hotel that was once an exclusive hangout for bankers (101 is also the city\u2019s richest postal code), is now filled with tourists. In a possible dig at the hotel\u2019s former denizens, a sculpture of what looked like a gray-suited banker hung on one wall, with a cryptic instruction, \u201cDisconnect the battery, remove the rear hood and hinge brackets,\u201d inscribed beneath it.Tourists come from as far as Hong Kong. They chase the Northern Lights. They scale glaciers. They dive in the Arctic Circle with puffins, go horseback riding or take helicopter tours listening to ethereal, whale-like sounds by the Icelandic band Sigur Ros. Fans of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d flock to filming locations around the island, some, apparently, genuinely in search of Wildlings.Outside the capital, thick white plumes of steam, which are harnessed for Iceland\u2019s energy needs, rise in the sky, as if the earth were vaping. Hot springs are everywhere, even in people\u2019s backyards.But there is growing concern that uncontrolled tourism is placing too large a burden on this small island. Housing prices and rents are rising quickly, forcing young people to live with their parents. Car rentals have tripled, clogging traffic. Littering and light pollution are spoiling parts of the landscape, many Icelanders say.\u201cIt\u2019s like the city is not my city anymore,\u201d Birgitta Jonsdottir, the leader of the Pirate Party, complained last month. \u201cIt\u2019s like Disneyland downtown.\u201dA poll in October conducted by the national broadcaster RUV reported that 87 percent of Icelanders want the government to raise fees or taxes on tourists.The tourist boom is making some Icelanders uneasy. Another crash like the one that hit the banks is just a matter of time, and many said they are saving money or investing in hard assets.Pessimists say all it takes to prick the tourism bubble is a sudden drop in visitors, triggered by something like a financial crisis overseas or the adverse effects of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\u201cIt\u2019s happening all over again,\u201d said Kristjan Asjaersson, 51, a cabdriver. During Iceland\u2019s short-lived heyday, he recalled having to crisscross the island just to deliver fish caught by Icelandic billionaires \u2014 they had forgotten to pack their catch before flying off in their private jets.\u201cToo many people rely on tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen tourist numbers fall, the economy will collapse again. I know it will happen. But I will be prepared.\u201dDiddi Bardarson, a tall man with russet locks that reveal his Viking roots, also predicted another crash. Instead of relying so heavily on tourism, he is putting his financial security into a living asset: Iceland\u2019s famous horses.Mr. Bardarson breeds hundreds of Icelandic horses on a 900-acre ranch in Hella, a small town 55 miles southeast of Reykjavik that straddles the salmon-rich Ranga River. Iceland exports nearly 4,000 horses a year, many of them to the United States and Canada. A fine stallion can fetch more than $2 million.\u201cHorses are deep in our soul,\u201d Mr. Bardarson said, feeding a 21-year-old black stallion named Markus, eyes hidden under luxuriously thick bangs, who has sired more than 150 horses. \u201cHorses were, and still are, our lifeline.\u201dMr. Bardarson has also benefited from the tourism boom. Demand for his horses has grown sevenfold over the past few years, he said, partly because some rich tourists become so enamored of the animals that they just have to have one or two.Icelandic horses are purebred; because of contamination fears, once a horse leaves the island it is prohibited from returning. Unlike other breeds, Icelandic horses have five gaits and can travel up to 74 miles a day on rough terrain, breeders say.Most important, Mr. Bardarson said, the hardy animals are reliable currency during times of financial instability. When the krona\u2019s value evaporated during the crash, they came to his rescue \u2014 he bartered horses for cars and tractors.Mr. Bardarson said he and his horses were preparing for leaner times. \u201cHorses start slowing down their heartbeat. They try to get fatter and grow a thicker coat for the coming hard winter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo should humans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Slide Into Tribal Politics Inevitable?", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald J. Trump\u2019s victory could well push the American party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and college-educated whites.In recent years, the Democrats and Republicans have battled along a liberal-conservative axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity. During the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, for instance, John McCain and Mr. Romney ran against Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy.Mr. Trump\u2019s approach has the potential to transform the party system. First, the success of his campaign may encourage other Republicans to adopt his model. He has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an ethno-nationalist style can have significant electoral advantages.Second, though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic policy, they can help define the issues on the political agenda. In the choices that he makes, Mr. Trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national identity, immigration and culture.Finally, few Republicans are likely to want to cross Mr. Trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in 2018.A focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for Democrats given the changing demographics of the country, but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college degrees, dividing the electorate by race and class even more.Nothing about this process is preordained, of course. Republicans may yet succeed in steering Mr. Trump toward a traditional G.O.P. agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. But the effects he could have on America\u2019s party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose.Advertisement"}

So did the oil refinery in Delaware City.In the span of a year during the financial crisis, once-prosperous northern Delaware had to confront post-industrial devastation.It\u2019s the sort of devastation that now has the country\u2019s attention. Donald Trump won the presidency with huge margins in places left behind. He lost the popular vote, but won 26 of the 30 lowest-income states, including the old powerhouses of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.I came here to New Castle looking for a jolt of hope after the terribly dispiriting presidential campaign. I came to see one of the more promising attacks on the Great American Stagnation.In the wake of the financial crisis, Delaware\u2019s new governor, Jack Markell, and other officials did obvious things, like using stimulus money to stem the damage and even managing to reopen the refinery. But Markell, who\u2019d run as an insurgent Democrat, understood that nostalgia alone wouldn\u2019t help families pay their bills. So he began looking for ways both to save old jobs and to create new ones. His answer wasn\u2019t original \u2014 but that\u2019s O.K., because it was right.It\u2019s too early for a final verdict in the state, but the signs are encouraging. High school graduation rates have jumped. Educational attainment is above average \u2014 as are incomes.

They drop out because they think what they\u2019re learning is not relevant to the rest of their lives.\u201dWilliam Penn reorganized itself into 20 different \u201cmajors,\u201d and every student must pick one, be it manufacturing, computer science or agriculture. (The state has a broader version of the program, called Pathways to Prosperity.) One goal, of course, is to prepare students for a career. When William Penn tried to start a nursing major, the state pushed back, pointing to a glut of such programs \u2014 and the school started a medical-diagnostics major instead.But having a major can also help students who don\u2019t know what they want to be when they grow up. It connects book learning to real life. It can help launch them into college or a certificate program and avoid the epidemic of academic drift. No wonder enrollment at William Penn has improved.Kiara Roach, a senior, told me that she didn\u2019t care about her grades, or do very well, until she became passionate about cooking.

It has a will of its own.\u201d And here\u2019s Penny, decrying the save-the-world claims that start-up companies make to their investors, even when all they\u2019ve got is \u201can app that tells you when to refill the dog dish.\u201d And Anka, commenting on Rob\u2019s popularity: \u201cIt\u2019s a market. The heterosexual economy that Rob dominates with his scarcity.\u201dThe nastiest threat to everyone\u2019s happiness comes from Penny\u2019s half brother, Matt, who designs ultrasleek garbage trucks, drives an Audi A5 and dumps women as fast as he can pick them up and maul them. When Matt is asked by Penny\u2019s mother, now a bank executive, once an indigenous Kogi runaway from Colombia, to rid the Jersey City house of the squatters, he responds: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re in such a rush. It\u2019s like having bedbugs that do the dishes.\u201dMaybe what\u2019s most bootylicious in this novel is Zink\u2019s warmhearted embrace of her subjects. With a straight face, she gives them space to do their quixotic thing. The book affirms that there\u2019s salvation to be had in connection, no matter how gnarly, and that includes a karmic comeuppance involving 52 precariously perched buckets of human waste. I won\u2019t say more.In the early scenes, Penny is reading to her father from Norman O. Brown\u2019s \u201cLife Against Death,\u201d a copy of which happens to sit on my shelf. Maybe they\u2019re reading the section in which Brown writes that Freud, in \u201cWit and the Unconscious,\u201d \u201caffirms the connection between art and childishness; however, childishness is not a reproach, but the ideal kingdom of pleasure which art knows how to recover.\u201d This pleasure is what Zink understands. The book works toward the achieving of a comic utopia, the lost kingdom of childishness. As much as one is aware of their vulnerabilities, one enjoys every minute with these obliging kooks. At one point Jazz says, \u201cI love this salad so much, I want to make out with it.\u201d There may be some readers who want to make out with this book.Elizabeth McKenzie\u2019s latest novel is \u201cThe Portable Veblen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 16, 2016Akhil Reed AmarCharles FriedWe have a direct democracy: Senators, representatives and members of the Electoral College are all elected directly by the people. They do not, however, elect the president directly. This is a feature of the kind of government we have chosen from the beginning in which the states are important subsidiary (in some instances, primary) units of government. Even after a civil war and two world wars, the states control a large measure of the laws, administration and finance that have an impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. The states have  their own political cultures, personalities and traditions which persist in spite of our far more transient population, an interconnected national economy and national news media. In order to reflect this mode of governance, the interactions between the national government and the states in important matters often utilize the local units and personnel. The notion is that the states are not simply administrative units of the national government or its local offices. In that context it is quite appropriate that the head of state is elected state-by-state, albeit by popular vote in each state. That way at the most focused democratic moment, every four years the candidates and parties must take the states into account.  And sometimes it will happen that, as this year,  there will be a significant divergence -- millions of votes -- between who is chosen by the Electoral College and the winner of the overall popular vote.  Sometimes that disparity can act as a caution to the elected president, but where the House and Senate are in the hands of the elected president's party that caution is less likely to operate.\nI prefer direct national election of our president. I take states seriously and value federalism, but in a different way than do most defenders of the status quo.  Consider the fact that each state picks its own president-equivalent \u2014 its governor \u2014 quite directly:  one person, one vote.  All votes are counted equally and in close races recounted carefully.  America should copy this state-tested model when choosing the governor of us all: the president."}

The court\u2019s suggested fix: Allow the president to fire the agency\u2019s director at will.The decision has taken on added significance with the surprise election of Donald J. Trump. If the ruling stands, the new president would have the power to dismiss the director of the bureau, Richard Cordray, and reshape the agency in his own mold.The consumer bureau\u2019s petition temporarily stops the clock on that possibility. Until the court rules on the petition, Mr. Cordray cannot be removed without cause, and if the court agrees to revisit the case, the earlier ruling will be vacated.In its petition, the consumer bureau said that the court\u2019s previous ruling \u201csets up what may be the most important separation-of-powers case in a generation.\u201d It added that it could have spillover effects on a number of other independent agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.Legal scholars say that the case will probably end up at the Supreme Court.

{"Headline": "With Trump in Power, the Fed Gets Ready for a Reckoning", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve chairman, received an urgent warning two weeks after Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election. Some of the president-elect\u2019s advisers, he was told, wanted to abolish the central bank and replace it with a computer program that would manage interest rates and monetary policy.Today, a Democratic Fed leader is once again bracing to see whether victorious and emboldened Republicans will try to overhaul the central bank.In almost three years as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen has led an aggressive campaign to stimulate economic growth. Donald J. Trump, the president-elect, has embraced criticism that the Fed is causing more problems than it is solving, and he has surrounded himself with advisers who would like to rein in the institution that has the greatest influence over the direction of the nation\u2019s economy.Mr. Trump can fill a majority of the Fed\u2019s seven-member board with his own nominees over the next 18 months, including replacing Ms. Yellen in February 2018. He also could work with Congress on new constraints, including some form of an old idea on the right that a formula should dictate the Fed\u2019s movements of interest rates.Or Mr. Trump could emulate Mr. Reagan and leave the central bank alone.When the two men finally met, Mr. Reagan asked Mr. Volcker why the country needed a central bank. He apparently found the answer convincing. Like other presidents in recent decades, he decided the Fed was reasonably effective and useful as a scapegoat. And in 1983, he nominated Mr. Volcker for a second term.Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions are unclear in part because there is a tension between his personal preferences and his political commitments. He is a borrower who now heads the political party that has long represented the interests of lenders.Mr. Trump has described himself as \u201ca low-interest-rate person,\u201d reflecting his background as a real estate investor who drew heavily on other people\u2019s money. He also has promised to deliver stronger economic growth, a goal that could be inhibited by higher interest rates. Politicians \u2014 their careers dependent on short-term economic performance \u2014 generally favor low rates, even at the expense of future inflation. That is the very reason the Fed is insulated from political pressure.Many of the advisers surrounding Mr. Trump, however, have long advocated that the Fed focus on controlling inflation, even at the expense of short-term growth. They have argued that the Fed has little power to increase economic activity beyond Wall Street \u2014 and on Wall Street, they warn, the Fed is encouraging excessive speculation.Over the course of the campaign, Mr. Trump increasingly echoed those views. In early September, he said the Fed was supporting a \u201cvery false economy\u201d by driving asset prices to what he described as unsustainable heights. \u201cWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the first presidential debate, a few weeks later.It may be surprisingly easy, however, for Mr. Trump and Ms. Yellen to find common ground. Like Mr. Reagan before him, Mr. Trump has promised tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure and the military, which could provide a large dose of fiscal stimulus. If the economy starts growing quickly, it would be easier for the Fed to raise rates.Financial markets climbed last week, reflecting optimism among investors that single-party control of government will lead to faster growth. Both parties wanted to take steps to encourage faster economic growth and more jobs. Republicans will now get to do it their way.After the election, it was widely predicted that markets would crash \u2014 and that the Fed would back away from increasing rates in December. So far, those predictions have failed to materialize. The odds of a December increase, as implied by asset prices, stood at 76 percent on Friday.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have called repeatedly in recent years for a healthy dose of fiscal stimulus, and it seems likely they would greet faster growth with relief.\u201cIt certainly breaks gridlock in Washington, which has been a key complaint of how the economy has operated,\u201d James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, told reporters on Thursday. And Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said the prospect of increased infrastructure spending was \u201cgood news.\u201dMoreover, there are signs Mr. Trump would like to focus on fiscal policy and leave the Fed to its devices. David Malpass, who is leading Mr. Trump\u2019s economic transition team, said in an email that there had been too much focus on the direction of monetary policy. \u201cThere should be focus on growth-oriented structural reforms including reforms of taxes, trade, regulatory policy and energy policy,\u201d he said.Other advisers to Mr. Trump also emphasize that his goal is to drive economic growth through changes in fiscal policy, easing the burden on the central bank.Mr. Trump could quickly overhaul the Fed\u2019s leadership. Ms. Yellen\u2019s four-year term as Fed chairwoman ends on Feb. 3, 2018. Stanley Fischer\u2019s four-year term as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman ends a few months later, on June 12, 2018.Mr. Trump also can move immediately to fill two open seats on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board. Senate Republicans have refused to consider President Obama\u2019s nominees for those vacancies. In effect, that means Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees could control a majority of the board well before the 2018 midterm elections. The seven Washington-based board members hold a majority of the decision-making power on a larger group, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, that sets monetary policy.\u201cA core view of many Trump advisers is that the extended period of emergency policy settings has promoted a bubble in the stock market, depressed the incomes of savers, scared the public and encouraged capital misallocation,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cRight now, these are minority views on the F.O.M.C., but Trump appointees are likely to shift the needle.\u201dOther observers, however, are less certain that Mr. Trump will want to hit the brakes. Mr. Shepherdson acknowledged that it was \u201cunusual\u201d for politicians to push for higher interest rates. And Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist and a fellow at the Peterson Institute on International Economics, said Mr. Trump\u2019s own statements suggested he might decide he likes what the Fed is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be Trump against his advisers, or against the Republicans in Congress,\u201d he said.Presidents in recent decades also have sometimes backed away from replacing the Fed\u2019s leadership, because transitions can roil financial markets. President Clinton twice reappointed the Republican Alan Greenspan. In 2010, President Obama reappointed Ben S. Bernanke, first nominated by President George W. Bush, before naming Ms. Yellen in 2014.But Mr. Trump said in May he would \u201cmost likely\u201d replace Ms. Yellen. \u201cShe is not a Republican,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC. He also has attacked her personally, declaring in September, \u201cI think she should be ashamed of herself.\u201dIf Ms. Yellen is replaced at the end of her first term, she will have served the shortest stint as the Fed leader since G. William Miller came and went quickly in the 1970s.Congressional Republicans also are likely to renew their calls for changes in the Fed\u2019s operating instructions. They have repeatedly criticized the Fed\u2019s monetary policy in recent years as opaque, inconsistent and misguided, and they have advanced a number of proposals to constrain it.\u201cIt is way past time for the Fed to commit to a credible, verifiable monetary policy rule, to systematically shrink its balance sheet and get out of the business of picking winners and losers in credit markets,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing in June.Last year, Mr. Hensarling\u2019s committee passed legislation requiring the Fed to describe a rule for moving interest rates and to justify any deviations from that rule.Another proposal would subject the Fed\u2019s decisions to a regular external review.And some Republicans may now be emboldened to pursue larger changes that would impose even tighter constraints on the movement of interest rates. Some conservatives have long favored the restoration of a gold standard \u2014 a system in which the value of the dollar is determined by the price of gold, limiting the Fed\u2019s ability to print money and, in theory, constraining inflation. The idea of a monetary policy computer program was advanced by the economist Milton Friedman as an improvement on the gold standard, allowing steady growth in the money supply.Fed officials have strongly opposed any increase in congressional oversight, describing such measures as infringements on the Fed\u2019s operational independence that might interfere with the central bank\u2019s ability to promote growth.Mr. Gagnon said they might come to regret not having embraced modest reforms.\u201cI have thought that all the proposals so far are not as horrendous as people at the Fed seem to think they are,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there could be more proposals.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Nandan Nilekani, an Infosys Billionaire, Invests His Money", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionNEW DELHI \u2014 Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of one of India\u2019s biggest information technology services companies, is an older billionaire but a young investor. In his nearly 30 years of starting and then building up Infosys, he did not have the time to focus on investing anywhere else, he said. Not to mention that most of his wealth was tied up in the company.His next step was public service, as he set up India\u2019s unique identification system, where, once again, he did not have the luxury to think about personal investments. Now that he is finally a free man at the age of 61, he is more focused on what to do with his money.Mr. Nilekani says he is concerned about the bad debt piling up on the balance sheets of banks in India, but he worries more about an increase in anti-globalization sentiment.\u201cBetween \u2018Brexit\u2019 and Trump, are we entering a world that\u2019s less enchanted with globalization?\u201d he asked. His concern is because of his continuing investment in Infosys, which has a strong global exposure with nearly 90 percent of its revenue coming from the United States and Europe.But Mr. Nilekani is betting on India. \u201cEnormous aspirations have been unleashed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a huge hunger to improve lives,\u201d which he said had inspired him. \u201cThe question is if we as a nation can provide that opportunity to everyone.\u201dBeing true to his I.T. services roots, he is more interested in services than in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing, he says, is vulnerable to automation and Chinese overcapacity. (In the last few years, several Indian companies of all sizes have complained about the dumping of goods by their Chinese competitors in sectors as varying as steel, solar power equipment and tires.)While he has some of his money in real estate and debt, most of it is in equity. But he is investing 5 percent of his large pie in start-ups.\u201cI\u2019m a believer in technology-led disruption,\u201d Mr. Nilekani said. In the next 20 years, he said, a large part of the Indian economy will go from the unorganized or informal sector to the organized and formal sector. \u201cI\u2019m looking for technology that can do that,\u201d he added.He thinks he might have found a few. One of his recent investments is in 10i Commerce Services, an e-commerce company that, through its ShopX app, is recruiting small neighborhood businesses to sell their products online (nearly 40,000 retailers in 180 towns have signed up).\u201cTechnology can be used to organize India,\u201d Mr. Nilekani said. \u201cAbout 80 to 85 percent of Indian retail sales are done through mom-and-pop shops, so aggregating them makes a lot of sense.\u201d Some of these entrepreneurs, he said, are \u201ctrying to go into the root of what\u2019s happening in the country and see if tech or new tools can make a difference.\u201dHe is also optimistic about Fortigo Network Logistics, which has developed technology that lets truck drivers and owners, as well as brokers and transport companies, look for cargo for their next destination at the best rates possible. It is a sort of Uber for truckers, with cargo as the passenger.Mr. Nilekani has a couple of guidelines he follows as he looks for investments: the quality of the entrepreneur and how susceptible a sector or the company is to domestic policy, which can vacillate depending upon the political whims of the party in power.\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve realized in the last two years is that the quality of the entrepreneur is key,\u201d he said. \u201cGood ideas are common. Many people have ideas, but the ability to execute and make a strategy is relatively rare.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen: Too Soon to Predict Economic Effects of Election", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Thursday it was too soon to predict the economic impact of Donald J. Trump\u2019s election as the next president of the United States.Markets have rallied on optimism that Mr. Trump, in concert with Republicans in Congress, would cut taxes and increase federal spending on road-building and the military, measures that might stimulate economic growth.Ms. Yellen, who has repeatedly called for Congress to join the Fed in its efforts to lift the economy from prolonged doldrums, suggested the celebrations were premature.She added, \u201cWe will be watching the decisions that Congress makes and updating our economic outlook as the policy outlook becomes clearer.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s election has not altered the Fed\u2019s short-term plans. Ms. Yellen made clear in her testimony that the central bank remained likely to raise its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting, in mid-December.\u201cThe evidence we\u2019ve seen since we met in November is consistent with our expectation of strengthening growth and an improving labor market,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cI do think the economy is making very good progress toward our goals.\u201dExactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.A rate increase, she said, \u201ccould well become appropriate relatively soon.\u201dMs. Yellen also set to rest questions about her own plans. Her term as chairwoman ends in February 2018. \u201cIt is fully my intention to serve out my term,\u201d she said.\u201cChair Yellen struck a reasonably \u2014 but still somewhat subdued \u2014 positive tone on the economy, and her words will be seen as signaling a high likelihood that the F.O.M.C. will be tightening policy at next month\u2019s meeting,\u201d wrote Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.The Fed has not raised its benchmark interest rate since December, leaving it in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent. The low level is intended to encourage borrowing and risk-taking, driving faster economic growth. Several times this year, the Fed has suggested it might raise rates, only to pull back over concerns about the fragility of the economy.But the Fed\u2019s outlook has brightened in recent months as evidence has rolled in that the economy, on most measures, is in its best shape in years.\u201cU.S. economic growth appears to have picked up from its subdued pace earlier this year,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, adding that job growth had also continued at a healthy clip. She noted, among other things, that soybean exports had surged in recent months.The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in October, and inflation has increased modestly.And Republicans could provide a fresh jolt to economic growth. Senator Dan Coats, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, cited a \u201cgrowing consensus\u201d that there is a need for fiscal stimulus, like tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and regulatory reforms. \u201cThe past seven years have clearly taught us that low interest rates alone cannot cure an ailing economy,\u201d Mr. Coats said.He added, however, that Congress needed to remain \u201cmindful\u201d of the relatively high level of the federal debt. And, in a preview of the role reversal that is likely to occur in the next Congress, Democrats on the committee chided Republicans for their spending plans.Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.\u201cI am interested to see how President Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan can be reconciled with past Republican opposition to fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat and the ranking party member of the committee.Interestingly, Republicans made little mention of their various proposals to rewrite the Fed\u2019s operating instructions to limit future economic stimulus campaigns. The only mentions of such plans, a staple of Fed hearings in recent years, came from Democrats.Ms. Maloney warned that Republican proposals would \u201clead to disaster.\u201d She also noted such a push might not play well in the Midwestern states where voters turned to Mr. Trump in part because of his promises to revive their economic fortunes.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that people in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states would respond well to that suggestion,\u201d she said dryly.Democrats also asked Ms. Yellen to address Republican proposals to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 legislation that overhauled financial regulation after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cI certainly would not want to see all the improvements we\u2019ve put in place, I would not want to see the clock turned back,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen offered a now-familiar assessment of the choice facing the Fed in December.On one hand, Ms. Yellen said, there was room for improvement. \u201cWhile above-trend growth of the labor force and employment cannot continue indefinitely,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, \u201cthere nonetheless appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market.\u201dShe noted that stronger growth was pulling some Americans back into the labor force.She cautioned, however, that the Fed did not want to wait \u201ctoo long.\u201d Monetary policy exerts gradual influence on economic conditions; the full effect of an interest-rate increase plays out over several years. And some Fed officials are increasingly concerned that the central bank needs to start moving now, or else it will need to raise rates more quickly in coming years.Ms. Yellen also acknowledged a related concern that low interest rates were encouraging imprudent speculation. \u201cHolding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long,\u201d she said, \u201ccould also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Chabon Returns With a Searching Family Saga", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Michael Chabon\u2019s new book is described on the title page as \u201ca novel,\u201d in an author\u2019s note as a \u201cmemoir\u201d and in the acknowledgments as a \u201cpack of lies.\u201d This is neither as confusing nor as devious as it might sound, since \u201cMoonglow\u201d is less a self-conscious postmodern high-wire act than an easygoing hybrid of forms. Chabon has what sounds like a mostly true story to tell \u2014 about characters whose only names are \u201cmy grandmother\u201d and \u201cmy grandfather,\u201d and also about mental illness, snake hunting, the Holocaust and rocket science \u2014 and he may not have wanted to be bound too tightly by the constraints of literal accuracy in telling it.At the same time, he has shaken loose the formal conventions of fiction, liberating himself in particular from the tyranny of plot. In his previous books, Chabon has always shown great skill at operating the novelistic machinery of cause and effect, foreshadowing and surprise, especially in semi-fabulist confections like \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d and \u201cThe Yiddish Policemen\u2019s Union.\u201d But in more realistic books the humming of those narrative engines can sometimes drown out the interesting cacophony of life. For me, that was the case in \u201cTelegraph Avenue,\u201d a well-observed slice of gentrifying urban life clogged with a bit too much Dickensian contrivance to work as well as it should have.\u201cMoonglow,\u201d in happy contrast, wanders where it will, framing a series of chronologically disordered episodes from the past with conversations involving the narrator (who never tries to persuade us that he is anyone other than Michael Chabon) and various kinfolk, principally his mother and grandfather. This isn\u2019t to say that the book lacks structure, but rather that its structure is determined by the logic of memory, and that the author has resisted the urge to do too much tidying and streamlining. The action zigzags across time and geography \u2014 from Germany in the last days of World War II through a grab bag of American locations in the decades after \u2014 with blithe indifference to the usual rules of linearity or narrative economy. A sensational and tragic revelation that might have been at the volcanic center of a more familiar kind of book is disclosed almost in passing. There are moments at which you can feel the irresistible temptation to embellish and invent, to infuse reality with Chabonesque touches of wistful Jewish magic realism, being resisted.But not entirely. \u201cAfter I\u2019m gone, write it down,\u201d Chabon\u2019s grandfather instructs him. \u201cExplain everything. Make it mean something. Use a lot of those fancy metaphors of yours. Put the whole thing in proper chronological order, not like this mishmash I\u2019m making you.\u201d \u201cMoonglow\u201d both obeys these instructions and rebels against them, preserving the mishmash and mixing in generous dollops of meaning, a sprinkling of fancy metaphors and an abundance of beautiful sentences so that it becomes a rich and exotic confection. Too strict a recipe would have spoiled the charm of this layer cake of nested memories and family legends, which have been arranged with painstaking haphazardness.Mementos, curios and old photographs figure prominently, as evidence of past actions and symbols of their hidden significance. Through these objects, recollected dialogue and his own powers of speculation, Chabon constructs a loving, partial portrait of an unlikely, volatile and durable marriage. At a synagogue gala in Baltimore in 1947, an irascible veteran from Philadelphia meets a melancholy refugee from France with a fetching accent, a young daughter and a concentration camp tattoo. The daughter will be Chabon\u2019s mother. His scapegrace father, whom readers of \u201cThe Mysteries of Pittsburgh\u201d will recognize, makes a few brief appearances later on, but this book dwells mainly on the mysteries of the maternal line.The union of Chabon\u2019s grandparents is disrupted by hospitalizations and imprisonment. His grandmother, who grew up near a tannery in Lille, is haunted by visions of a \u201cskinless horse,\u201d a monstrous creature that seems to embody the unspeakable, intimate horrors of Nazism. Her delusions test her husband\u2019s patience, but they also illuminate his loyalty and ardor. A tough man whose temper is hot enough to bring him close to murdering an employer (which earns him 20 months in a New York State prison), he is guided by ethical instincts that seem to him as inarguable as the laws of physics. Promises must be kept, bullies must be brought down, hypocrites must be exposed, and the weak must be protected. He is stubborn and chivalrous, blunt and generous, physically brave and intellectually nimble.In literary terms, Chabon\u2019s grandfather might be the humbler cousin of Swede Levov, Philip Roth\u2019s tragic paragon of American Jewish manhood from \u201cAmerican Pastoral.\u201d He occupies a similar mid-Atlantic, rapidly assimilating geographical and cultural space and embodies similar secular Jewish virtues. But the book, rather than witnessing his fall, elevates him. It\u2019s not a chronicle of filial revenge; it\u2019s a grandchild\u2019s testament of wonder and devotion. Grandpa chases the Nazi rocket-builder Wernher von Braun in Germany at the end of the war and stalks a pet-killing reptile in a Florida retirement community many years later. Fascinated by space travel, he designs rockets, builds a model moon base and drives for hours to watch the shuttle launch.Grandma, meanwhile, fascinates young Michael with her old-world mannerisms and her witchy association with tarot cards, scary puppets and haunting tales. \u201cAlmost 50 years later I still remember some of her stories,\u201d Chabon writes. \u201cBits of them have consciously and unconsciously found their way into my work.\u201d And this book, a love letter to two temperamentally opposite grandparents \u2014 one a rational, practical American, the other a dreamy, romantic European \u2014 is also an account of their formative influences on the writer their grandson would become.These are not so much explained as felt, woven into the very fabric of Chabon\u2019s supple and resourceful prose. He brings the world of his grandparents to life in language that seems to partake of their essences. When he describes an asylum pageant staged by his grandmother, the feverish poetry of the images seems like the product of her tormented, enchanted consciousness: \u201cDarkness falls over the field of clover, dawn breaks on the moon. Jagged moon mountains glow cool and silvery blue in the background as the bee herder, hatchet restored, strolls along unfazed by his new surroundings. He passes silver moon trees like the skeletons of cacti.\u201dThis fantastical landscape coexists with an all-too-real one \u2014 a blasted German town described in the precise, engineer\u2019s language of the grandfather: \u201cThe stray 88 had knocked the square tower off the shoulders of St. Dominic\u2019s Church. The beams holding up the roof, which was clad in metal, had collapsed and caught fire. In their collapse, the roof beams had formed a kind of bowl or funnel into which the metal roof, now a molten pool, had poured. The glowing drizzle had burned a hole in the sandstone floor, then flowed through to fill the crypt. What missed the hole spread in ripples across the floor, setting fire to everything it touched that was not made of stone.\u201dWhatever else it is \u2014 a novel, a memoir, a pack of lies, a mishmash \u2014 this book is beautiful.A.O. Scott is The Times\u2019s co-chief film critic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Rides a Wave of Fury That May Damage Global Prosperity", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisA populist insurrection is gaining force in much of the world, drawing middle-class and blue-collar recruits who lament that they have been left behind by globalization. This upheaval threatens to upend the economic order that has prevailed since the end of World War II.This was evident before Donald J. Trump\u2019s triumphant rogue campaign for the American presidency. Now it is beyond argument.National leaders in Europe and North America are scrambling to placate energized, often unruly groups of people demanding change and a more generous share of the economic spoils. But the options for addressing the deficiencies of capitalism are severely constrained \u2014 both by traditional political realities and by the broader truths of the global economy.In Britain, which shocked the world in June with its so-called Brexit vote to abandon the European Union, and now in the United States, with its stunning elevation of Mr. Trump, electorates have essentially handed governments a mandate to limit free trade. Voters have unleashed this action plan in the name of lifting the fortunes of working people.But trade is such an elemental part of the modern global economy that impeding it is almost certain to produce the opposite effect. It will damage economic growth, diminishing prosperity for all.Mr. Trump has promised to slap tariffs on Chinese imports and to punish American companies that manufacture their wares in Mexico. Britain\u2019s new Conservative government has signaled that it may depart Europe\u2019s vast single market as it negotiates divorce terms.But speeches do not translate into viable job creation strategies.The American economy depends on access to a global supply chain that produces parts used by innumerable industries, along with a great range of consumer goods. Mexico and China are central actors. Disruption threatens to increase costs for American households. Tariffs on China might provoke a trade war that could slow economic growth, while most likely just shifting factory work to other low-wage nations like Vietnam and India.Britain sells half of its exports to the nations of the European Union. If the country leaves the single market, tariffs could apply to its goods, diminishing sales and costing jobs.Mr. Trump\u2019s election and Brexit together underscore a central facet of these times. The old ideological divisions of left and right have effectively been eclipsed by a new economic taxonomy \u2014 those who have benefited from globalization and those who have not.In Britain, affluent communities of professionals who hire Romanians to clean their homes and who enjoy getaways to Spain overwhelmingly voted to stay in the European Union. Industrial communities that have lost jobs as manufacturing has shifted east \u2014 to Eastern Europe, Turkey and Asia \u2014 generally voted to leave.In the United States, college-educated urbanites making a comfortable living in the quintessential trades of globalization \u2014 finance, technology and media \u2014 disdained Mr. Trump. People in the center of the country who lack degrees and have seen jobs transferred to China and Mexico played a leading role in delivering the White House to Mr. Trump.In northeastern England (something like the Rust Belt of Britain) people who voted to leave Europe speak openly about doing so to punish those who beseeched them to vote to stay \u2014 people like the exceedingly unpopular former prime minister David Cameron. The situation is so depressed, it cannot get worse, the logic runs. Any economic pain will fall on wealthy Londoners, people say.But that is almost certainly nonsense. A rupture of trade with Europe is likely to hit these industrial communities hardest. And if that happens, the people living there will be angrier than ever.Mr. Trump drew support from factory town laborers who have traditionally voted for Democrats but did not trust Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Many recall how her husband forged the North American Free Trade Agreement, which helped cause a shift of American manufacturing to Mexico. If Mr. Trump does not find a way to satisfy their high expectations, these people are likely to feel deceived.And any proposals need to navigate the reliably treacherous politics of Washington. The latest piece of Trump real estate, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, sits just down the street from a Capitol full of people who got themselves elected in part by railing against deficits and promising to cut federal spending.The soon-to-be President Trump has vowed to counteract the problems afflicting workers by unleashing a wave of infrastructure spending that will generate jobs for skilled hands. Perhaps he will have more luck than his predecessor, President Obama, whose own plans for infrastructure spending died time and again at the hands of Republican deficit hawks. Mr. Trump is \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 a fellow Republican.But whatever happens from here, one may assume that populist ferment is unlikely to exhaust its vast reservoir of grievances anytime soon.Eight years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the people who caused it \u2014 reckless investment bankers \u2014 have bounced back almost as if it never happened, while many American homeowners and wage earners have yet to recover their lost wealth.Many of Europe\u2019s problems represent a failure to reshape its policies to spur growth. Germany is the most powerful actor in Europe, and Germany maintains an obsession with budget austerity as the response to all economic problems.Since Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe, some regional leaders have argued that Brexit amounts to a warning for the European Union: Absent a new economic philosophy, the situation will continue to generate hostility among a populace that cannot pay its bills.\u201cIf you want to close this divide and you want to persuade your citizens that there is opportunity in the internationalization of the economy and innovation, you need to invest a lot,\u201d said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda, during a recent interview in Rome. \u201cOtherwise populism will prevail, and this is a risk that we are seeing all around the world, also in the United States. And this will be a disaster for the economy, and for the geopolitical situation.\u201dHe said this before Mr. Trump was elected.But Germany remains implacably opposed to spending more aggressively, continuing to put stock \u2014 against all empirical evidence \u2014 into the idea that cutting spending and eliminating worker protections are the keys to prosperity.Democracy is fundamentally a means by which citizens get to tell their leaders what they want. What many now want is to banish their leaders.Either the new leaders will find a way to make global capitalism a more enriching proposition for larger numbers of people, or they, too, risk being swept aside as anger builds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visiting Europe, Obama Warns Against Rise of \u2018Crude Sort of Nationalism\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported by\u201cI do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an \u2018us\u2019 and a \u2018them,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks came in an hourlong news conference in Athens on his final trip overseas as president. He had come to Greece partly to bolster Greek hopes of further debt relief from its European partners, which will meet on Dec. 5 to consider giving this ailing nation another pass on its mountain of debt.But Mr. Trump\u2019s election last week subverted Mr. Obama\u2019s top foreign policy priorities, and he seemed to have arrived in Athens in a reflective mood.By Tuesday, however, Mr. Obama seemed to reverse himself, making pointed remarks about the dangers of overturning his administration\u2019s track record on race relations or returning to decades-old forms of bigotry.\u201cIn the United States, we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just for the minority groups that are subjected to that kind of discrimination or, in some cases in the past violence, but because we don\u2019t then realize our potential as a country when we\u2019re preventing blacks or Latinos or Asians or gays or women from fully participating in the project of building American life.\u201dMr. Obama was unapologetic and unequivocal on his record of inclusiveness.\u201cSo my vision\u2019s right on that issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it may not always win the day in the short term in any particular political circumstance, but I\u2019m confident it will win the day over the long term.\u201dMr. Obama said that the desire for change was a huge factor in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.\u201cSometimes people just feel as if we want to try something to see if we can shake things up, and that I suspect was a significant phenomenon,\u201d he said.He said that while Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and Britain\u2019s surprising vote in June to leave the European Union differed in important respects, the two electoral earthquakes both grew out of dislocations that have resulted from of a rapidly changing and globalizing world.\u201cGlobalization combined with technology combined with social media and constant information have disrupted people\u2019s lives, sometimes in very concrete ways,\u201d Mr. Obama said while standing next to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece. \u201cA manufacturing plant closes, and suddenly an entire town no longer has what was the primary source of employment.\u201dHe said the effects can be psychological as well, making people \u201cless certain of their national identities or their place in the world.\u201d\u201cWhen you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders, very unconventional candidates, having considerable success, then obviously there is something there that is being tapped into,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cA suspicion of globalization. A desire to rein in its excesses.\u201dThe increasing pain felt by working people had led to a growing suspicion of elites and governing institutions, he said.\u201cAnd that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity and that can be a volatile mix,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Obama complimented Mr. Tsipras on the political and structural reforms he had pushed through \u2014 reforms that severely damaged Mr. Tsipras\u2019s popularity in Greece. And he said he planned to urge others in Europe to forgive more of Greece\u2019s debt.Mr. Obama will fly on Wednesday to Berlin, where he will spend at least two days in meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and then in a meeting with the leaders of France, Britain and Spain.Mr. Trump has questioned the value of NATO, the bedrock Western military alliance between Europe and the United States. But Mr. Obama said that Mr. Trump had assured him during their Oval Office meeting last week that he remained committed to NATO.Also on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said he believed that \u201cthere is a window in the next few weeks\u201d to resolve the 42-year-old standoff between Greece and Turkey on the island of Cyprus. Turkish troops have occupied the northern third of the island since an invasion in 1974.For his part, Mr. Tsipras again denounced Europe\u2019s decision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to embark on a program of \u201cdisastrous austerity, which made the problems more acute instead of resolving them.\u201dHe noted that Greece\u2019s economy at its worst had contracted by 25 percent and that its unemployment rate had peaked at 27 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Movement in Liberal Economics That Could Shape Hillary Clinton\u2019s Agenda", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewIf you want to know what economic policy would look like in a Hillary Clinton administration, you can read her speeches or policy positions or look at the backgrounds of the advisers she surrounds herself with.Labor market monopsony is the idea that when there isn\u2019t enough competition among businesses, it is bad news for workers. When an industry includes only a few big companies, they don\u2019t have to compete with one another as hard to attract employees \u2014 and so end up paying their workers less than they would if there were true competition. It\u2019s the flip side of how monopoly power lets companies charge higher prices to consumers.The talk of monopsony is part of a shift in the policy tools that many left-of-center economic thinkers see as most promising for addressing the economic challenges of poor and middle-class Americans. Rather than focusing on policies that amount to redistribution \u2014 tax rates, the social welfare system \u2014 they are looking at how the rules of the economic game shape people\u2019s outcomes.Some use a term for this set of policies coined by the Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker: predistribution policy. This is policy that shapes how the market works in the first place, as opposed to redistribution policy, which assumes a free market will generate growth and then uses taxes and spending to give a lift to the economy\u2019s losers.To understand the dueling approaches, think of a professional sports league that finds that richer, big-market teams are consistently at an advantage, making games less entertaining. One approach would be to tack on a few extra points to the small-market team\u2019s score when it plays a larger rival. That\u2019s the equivalent of redistribution.The predistribution approach would examine the factors that make rich teams more competitive, and try to remedy the situation by changing the rules around, say, the league\u2019s salary cap or the amateur draft.\u201cThe idea is that if we\u2019re going to deal with rising inequality and income insecurity, we can\u2019t just let the market rip and clean up afterward,\u201d Mr. Hacker said.\u201cI think when I was coming up and started engaging with economic policy issues, a lot of the emphasis was on the idea that capitalism works, and that\u2019s over on one side, and then the question is after you\u2019ve gotten the gains from growth, if it\u2019s a little unequal or if some people are in poverty, you can just redistribute the gains,\u201d said Heather Boushey, the executive director of the group.\u201cAnother way to think about it is that the interaction between policy and economics is really important, and how the gains from growth are distributed to begin with has a huge impact on the path of the economy moving forward,\u201d she said.Many of the policies under discussion \u2014 a higher minimum wage, or tougher antitrust enforcement \u2014 have long been supported by liberal economists and politicians. What has changed is that they are being emphasized as a first-order set of priorities, and as part of a unified body of work.There are pragmatic reasons for taking this approach, too. With Republicans controlling Congress and resolutely opposing tax increases on the affluent or a stronger social safety net, redistributionist policy hasn\u2019t been on the table politically. That has left the Obama administration looking for other ways of dealing with rising inequality.Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged a variety of reasons for the shift. \u201cOne is the increased understanding among economists about the increasing concentration in the economy and the ramifications that can have for some of the biggest problems we face,\u201d he said.But it\u2019s no accident that the administration can use administrative tools, such as the Labor Department\u2019s rules requiring more workers to receive overtime compensation, to shape policy even when Congress is deadlocked. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where we can actually do something,\u201d Mr. Furman said.If liberal economists keep focusing on these issues, and if Mrs. Clinton is elected and indeed makes market structure, labor rules and other predistribution policies a top economic priority, there are more subtle risks.For example, there\u2019s always a temptation to overrate the benefits of whatever policy you favor as a solution for all that ails the economy. Among conservatives, this may take the form of arguing that tax cuts will solve every problem. Liberal economists may be engaging in wishful thinking of their own as they suggest that more powerful labor unions generate not just higher wages but stronger productivity growth and a faster-growing overall economy.\u201cI certainly think these are important things to think about, but I guess the question is whether they\u2019re first-order or not,\u201d said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cWhen I think about the biggest challenges facing the U.S. economy, monopsony is not one of them.\u201dAnd adjusting taxes and spending has the advantage of directness, even if it is a political nonstarter. It is much less certain just what policies focused on predistribution would do. Tweaking overtime rules or preventing mega-mergers might help reduce inequality, in other words. But raising taxes on the wealthy and using the money to increase benefits for the working class definitely would.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Victory Bodes Well for Investors \u2014 for Now", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseAs the presidential election approached, they were falling all over themselves to predict a Hillary Clinton victory and, afterward, a modest stock market rally. The prospect of a win by Donald J. Trump was so remote as to be deemed a \u201cblack swan,\u201d an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial markets.Among the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump victory were analysts at Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Keith Parker, head of cross-asset strategy research at Barclays, forecast a drop of 11 to 13 percent in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further, warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2,000 points.With benefit of hindsight, what\u2019s extraordinary is how few professional investors saw it coming. Mr. Trump was derided as the candidate of \u201cuncertainty,\u201d which markets typically abhor, and many of his stated policies are vague, incoherent or inconsistent. But there was nothing uncertain about his overall pro-growth, pro-business and America-first tendencies, now backed by the firepower of a Republican House and Senate.He is, after all, a real estate developer.\u201cWe see tremendous opportunity for economic growth,\u201d said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of chief executives that was often at odds with Mr. Trump during the campaign, especially over trade and immigration. Now that the results are in, though, Mr. Engler sees a silver lining. \u201cThe Republicans understand,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they\u2019re on the spot to produce results.\u201dSimon Lack, founder of SL Advisors, an investment advisory firm and operator of a mutual fund that focuses on energy, carried the theme further. \u201cTrump\u2019s win is unambiguously positive\u201d for many sectors of the economy, \u201cespecially energy infrastructure,\u201d he said.The doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions to presidential elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve done extensive research that suggests presidential elections don\u2019t affect markets,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cThe reality is that the market is influenced to the greatest extent by economic factors and monetary policy.\u201d\u201cIn almost all technical and macro aspects, this is still a bull market,\u201d Mr. Stack said, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election does not change that.Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election, said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Traders Almanac, because elections, whatever their outcome, eliminate a measure of uncertainty. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a Republican or Democrat,\u201d he said. Returns tend to be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes, as happened this week. And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed, on average, by a first-year performance of 14 percent.There are more specific reasons as well that investors applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s victory:Economists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Mr. Obama\u2019s stimulus plan saved 2.1 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009, bolstering the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2.1 percent.Construction company stocks rallied on Wednesday. Shares in Caterpillar, which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction, jumped more than 8 percent.Whatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates \u2014 not to mention worsening income inequality \u2014 tax cuts are another form of economic stimulus.\u201cTax modernization is our top priority,\u201d said Mr. Engler of the Business Roundtable, arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that if you want to grow gross domestic product by 1 percent, get tax legislation done. The House Republican plan is a great blueprint. One percent growth over 10 years would be $3 trillion.\u201dNeedless to say, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and Wall Street nemesis who Mr. Trump mocked as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d will not have a starring role in a Trump administration.Some of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely to be banks, drug companies and oil and gas pipelines. On Wednesday, shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, the biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent, and the pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose 4.5 percent.Whether the \u201cTrump rally\u201d persists is another question. In their rush to buy stocks this week, investors seemed all too willing to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s hostile stands on immigration and free trade, as well as his seeming indifference to the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. All of those have the capacity to damp growth or even tip the economy into recession.Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, was, like many others, surprised by the strong market rally. \u201cIf we get a large stimulus on top of a full-employment economy,\u201d he said, \u201cit may give you some juice in the near term, but longer term, it\u2019s going to hurt\u201d by driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investments.\u201cI was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense at 5 percent.\u201dMr. Parker of Barclays said he expected a sell-off initially, but also called for a recovery by year-end once investors absorbed signals from key economic policy makers. \u201cWhat we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours,\u201d he said, pointing to Mr. Trump\u2019s early-morning victory speech, which made no mention of trade or immigration, as one catalyst.Like many, Mr. Parker now sees more gains for stocks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy, if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up. \u201cThe backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Reaches Tentative Deal With Union in Canada", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byAs with the Canadian branches of General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the union focused on preserving jobs as much as traditional contract issues like wages.Jerry Dias, the union\u2019s national president, said that the company would invest about 700 million Canadian dollars, or $522 million, to introduce a new engine at one of three engine factories Ford has in Windsor, Ontario. He said that the two older of those Windsor factories, which had been widely expected to close, would probably remain open.\u201cAre we better off today than we were yesterday in Windsor?\u201d Mr. Dias said. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201dHe added that with the new investment, the company\u2019s employment in the city would probably increase.The contract, which covers about 6,400 workers, otherwise generally mirrors agreements Unifor had made with the two other companies. Among other things, the contract will accelerate the rate at which new employees move to their new, higher wages. In turn, the union agreed that those workers would only have pension plans that paid out depending on performance, rather than the traditional plans, which have payments of a guaranteed size.As Monday\u2019s strike deadline neared, Unifor\u2019s leadership was torn between contradictory demands from Ford and a rift among its members who work at the company.According to the union, Ford\u2019s negotiators said that the company would match the agreements that Unifor had signed with General Motors of Canada and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Canada only if the union agreed to accept cost cuts.Under a system known as pattern bargaining, Unifor has always taken the position that it would not give any of the three Detroit-based automakers special concessions. Doing so, it has contended, would create an unfair advantage for one company.Ford declined to answer specific questions about the negotiations before the settlement was announced. After the talks ended, Mr. Dias said that the union did not make any cost concessions like allowing the use of temporary workers.In an unusual move, the president of the Unifor local that represents Ford\u2019s biggest plant in Canada, a sport utility vehicle assembly plant west of Toronto in Oakville, Ontario, said that his members opposed the agreement reached with G.M. and Fiat Chrysler.Mr. Thomas reiterated his position after Fiat Chrysler accepted the terms of the pattern contract.But the local chapter that represents workers at the three Ford engine factories in Windsor accused the Oakville local of jeopardizing the future of Ford in Canada.The Windsor local, using language normally reserved for denouncing employers\u2019 demands, reprimanded its Oakville counterpart.\u201cWe have never seen a bargaining committee that openly wants to gamble on the future of all Canadian operations and call a bluff,\u201d the bargaining committee wrote in the post. It said, \u201cIt\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair to all Unifor Ford members.\u201dEarly Tuesday, Mr. Dias said the union had successfully negotiated some gains with Ford beyond what was included in the pattern agreement. But he declined to describe them and noted that the contracts with all three companies included some unique terms.There are few concerns about Ford\u2019s Oakville plant, where 5,000 Unifor members produce the Ford Flex, the Ford Edge and two Lincoln models, the MKX and MKT. It has received substantial investment over the last decade. Mr. Dias said that the plant now had an additional mandate to make vehicles for sale outside North America.But two of the plants in Windsor are in adjacent factories that date from 1923. Their 600 employees make large, V-10 truck engines. Tighter fuel economy and emissions standards have darkened the outlook for such engines.Mr. Dias said that plant would continue to make V-10s for the foreseeable future, although he suggested that employment might fall there.The new engine will be made in a comparatively new factory elsewhere in the city that currently builds V-8s for the Ford Mustang and the F-150 pickup truck.An earlier version of this article, and an earlier correction, misstated the number of Ford Motor engine factories in Windsor, Ontario. There are three; a fourth factory, an assembly plant, is in Oakville.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Macau, Skipping the Casinos, but Embracing the Past", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerOwing to its colonial past, Macau, with its cobblestone streets, old Catholic churches and narrow alleyways, has an almost European feel to it, along with an interesting local cuisine that fuses Portuguese and Chinese flavors. And my focus, naturally, was putting this trip together without causing undue strain on my budget.My attack plan was simple: to see as much as I could, by foot and by public transportation. Macau is traditionally divided into three sections: the peninsula and the islands of Coloane and Taipa. (A fourth \u201cregion\u201d of land reclaimed from the ocean, Cotai, now connects Coloane and Taipa and is the home to many of the newer casinos.) I particularly had my eye on rustic Coloane Village in the south.Though I had no plans to indulge in the casinos, one lesson I\u2019ve learned in my travels is that where there\u2019s gambling, cheap rooms follow \u2014 it\u2019s how they lure you in. I was able to land a very comfortable, relatively luxurious room at the Sofitel on the western side of the peninsula for 650 Hong Kong dollars, a little over $80. Close to the center of the city, it was an ideal jumping-off point. I was able to check another essential off the list by walking to Yin He Dian Xun (roughly, Galaxy Telecommunications) and purchasing a 500-gigabyte SIM card from a very helpful young woman for 50 Macanese patacas (about $6).Ah, yes, the currency. The Macanese pataca and Hong Kong dollar are separate currencies but virtually interchangeable in Macau. Change will sometimes come in patacas, sometimes in Hong Kong dollars. A dollar is, however, slightly more valuable than a pataca. If you\u2019re considering making a big souvenir purchase (like gold or jade jewelry, which is plentiful on the main drag of Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro) either use a credit card with no foreign transaction fee, or walk into a bank to exchange for patacas \u2014 I was able to do both without difficulty.Senado Square, within walking distance of my hotel, was a good place to begin exploring. Beautiful old yellow and pink pastel buildings with arched doorways and green shuttered windows frame the historic square, which is paved with small tiles. It was a perfect place to stroll and enjoy the egg tart I\u2019d purchased for 9 dollars from Koi Kei Bakery.The egg tart is one of Macau\u2019s signature delicacies, a local interpretation of the Portuguese pastel de nata \u2014 perfectly creamy custard with a pleasantly caramelized top, encased within a delicate, flaky pastry cup.Another distinctive item is the pork chop bun. I stopped into the celebrated Tai Lei Loi Kei, a nearly 50-year-old Macanese chain, and paid 48 dollars for a small, bone-in pork chop that had been slapped somewhat unceremoniously onto a buttered white roll. Fortunately the meat was simply seasoned and well cooked (just be careful not to break a tooth).In addition to its cuisine, Macau has memorable architecture. Catholic influence is still very much present, at least aesthetically. St. Dominic\u2019s Church, a beautifully restored, custard-colored 16th-century structure, is free to enter, as is a three-story art museum housed in the church\u2019s bell tower. I looked over the icons and relics of the church on display, including beautiful old wooden carvings.I could walk to the ruins and St. Dominic\u2019s from my hotel, but despite Macau\u2019s compact size, not everything is walkable. I would not recommend driving in Macau, nor riding one of the city\u2019s ubiquitous scooters. I found a bike rental shop called Si Toi in Taipa that charged 20 dollars per hour (only $2.50, remember) but I ultimately decided on the bus: I found it cheap and fairly reliable.The casinos? Didn\u2019t need them. They do provide a useful benefit, though: When it came time to head back to the ferry terminal, I happily used the hotel\u2019s free shuttle bus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Fingerprints on Attacks Obliterating Yemen\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "The Saudi-led coalition is hitting civilian targets, like factories, bridges and power stations, that critics say have no clear link to the rebels. In the rubble, the remains of American munitions have been found.Supported byThe attack killed 10 employees and wiped out a business that had employed dozens of families.\u201cIt was everything for us,\u201d Mr. Elaghil said.But instead of defeating the rebels, the campaign has sunk into a grinding stalemate, systematically obliterating Yemen\u2019s already bare-bones economy. The coalition has destroyed a wide variety of civilian targets that critics say have no clear link to the rebels.The bombing campaign has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, where cholera is spreading, millions of people are struggling to get enough food, and malnourished babies are overwhelming hospitals, according to the United Nations. Millions have been forced from their homes, and since August, the government has been unable to pay the salaries of most of the 1.2 million civil servants.Publicly, the United States has kept its distance from the war, but its decades-old alliance with Saudi Arabia, underpinned by tens of billions of dollars in weapons sales, has left American fingerprints on the air campaign.Many strikes are carried out by pilots trained by the United States, who fly American-made jets that are refueled in the air by American planes. And Yemenis often find the remains of American-made munitions, as they did in the ruins after a strike that killed more than 100 mourners at a funeral last month.Graffiti on walls across Sana reads: \u201cAmerica is killing the Yemeni people.\u201dPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has not said whether he will continue United States support for the war, but has been very critical of Saudi Arabia, saying it does not \u201csurvive without us.\u201d At a rally in January, he said Iran was \u201cgoing into Yemen\u201d and was \u201cgoing to have everything\u201d in the region, but he did not clarify how he would respond.The sweeping destruction of civilian infrastructure has led analysts and aid workers to conclude that hitting Yemen\u2019s economy is part of the coalition\u2019s strategy.\u201cThe economic dimension of this war has become a tactic,\u201d said Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations\u2019 humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. \u201cIt is all consistent \u2014 the port, the bridges, the factories. They are getting destroyed, and it is to put pressure on the politics.\u201dIn a written response to questions, a coalition spokesman, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Asseri, said the air campaign had halted the rebels\u2019 advance, destroyed 90 percent of their rockets and aircraft and pressured them to join talks aimed at ending the war. He denied that the coalition sought to inflict suffering on civilians and said only facilities connected to the war effort had been hit.He blamed the rebel group, the Houthis, for the humanitarian crisis.\u201cThis is primarily the responsibility of the rebels, who have displaced Yemen\u2019s legitimate government and who are impeding the flow of humanitarian supplies,\u201d General Asseri said.Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries are also among the top donors of aid to Yemen. So even as they undermine its self-sufficiency, they help sustain the population.The air campaign\u2019s civilian toll has led to calls by some American lawmakers to postpone arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\u201cIt is a significant moral outrage that we continue to provide arms to Saudi Arabia and to participate in military operations in Yemen,\u201d said Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California who was a military prosecutor in the Air Force. \u201cThe United States is at risk of aiding and abetting war crimes in Yemen.\u201dThe difficulty in just getting to Yemen demonstrates how much the war has upended the country.The internationally recognized government is based in Saudi Arabia and in the south of Yemen. For a recent 10-day trip to Sana and surrounding areas, a photographer and I had to obtain visas from the Houthis.We could not book flights into Sana because the Saudi-led coalition had halted all commercial air traffic. The United Nations allowed us onto an aid flight. As soon as we touched down, we saw traces of the war: the scattered carcasses of destroyed airplanes along the runway.Once in Yemen, we were told that we could not go anywhere without a representative of the Houthis. He was with us whenever we left the hotel. We did not visit military sites, which the coalition has heavily bombed to destroy the ballistic missiles that the rebels have fired into the kingdom, killing civilians.But the damage and suffering caused by the war were everywhere.Beggars displaced by the fighting thronged our car, pleading for money and food. Buildings destroyed by airstrikes dotted the capital: the Defense and Interior Ministries, the army and central security headquarters, the Police Academy and Officers\u2019 Club, the Sana Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the homes of officials who had joined the rebels.The conflict has split the country, with forces backed by gulf nations and nominally loyal to the exiled president in the south and east, where Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have staged deadly attacks.But in the areas we visited in Yemen\u2019s northwest, the rebels were firmly in control, their gunmen running checkpoints alongside police officers who had joined them. In Sana\u2019s Old City, posters of \u201cmartyrs\u201d killed in the war covered entire buildings. Trucks with mounted machine guns, carrying fighters, occasionally sped by.Spray-painted across the city was the Houthis\u2019 rallying cry: \u201cGod is great. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse on the Jews. Victory for Islam.\u201dUnited Nations officials gave us photos of remnants found at the site that indicated it had been hit with at least one American-made, 500-pound, laser-guided bomb. American warplanes routinely use that class of bomb, and the United States has provided such bombs to the Saudi military.On an expanse of rocky ground near the town of Khamer northwest of the capital, where they have been since fleeing their homes last year, hundreds of families have built shelters out of canvas, plastic sheeting and mud bricks. Most survive on charity, eating rice and bread cooked on mud stoves fired with wood or garbage.In August, the government could no longer afford to pay Mr. Gayid his $200 monthly salary.\u201cNow my children beg in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the situation continues like this, there is no future.\u201dWhile the war spawned Yemen\u2019s humanitarian crisis, aid workers say coalition bombings of critical infrastructure have exacerbated it.Before the war, Yemen imported 90 percent of its food, mostly through the Red Sea port of Hodeida.\u201cIt is an all-encompassing, applied economic suppression and strangulation that is causing everyone here to feel it,\u201d Mr. McGoldrick said. \u201cThe collapse of the economy is starting to bite very hard.\u201dThe suffering is clear in the capital.\u201cWhat\u2019s missing? Everything!\u201d said Manal al-Ariqi, a doctor in Sana\u2019s main pediatric hospital. \u201cWe lack medical staff, nurses and medicine.\u201dUpstairs, nearly every room contained a malnourished baby. Most had been born to mothers who had fled the war and were too disturbed or malnourished to breast-feed normally, said Ali al-Faqih, a nurse.In one room lay 7-month-old twin girls, Ruqaya and Suqaina, both with sunken cheeks.\u201cWe lost everything because of the war,\u201d their grandmother Shariya al-Awaj said when asked why the girls were so small. \u201cAll we brought with us were our clothes.\u201dThe destruction in Yemen could cripple its economy long into the future, and it is unclear how the country will rebuild.\u201cThey have hit many factories on the basis of suspicion, but we never get the real reasons,\u201d said Abdul-Hakeem Al Manj, a lawyer at the Sana Chamber of Commerce and Industry who is helping businesses document the strikes with an eye toward future prosecution. \u201cAny institution that has a big hangar, they hit it directly.\u201dSome businesses said they suspected they were targets only because they continued to operate after the Houthi takeover.Plant workers showed us the remains of munitions they had collected, including pieces of at least one CBU-105, a cluster bomb unit that contains 10 high-explosive submunitions. They are manufactured by Textron Defense Systems of Rhode Island.General Asseri, the coalition spokesman, said it had \u201cno interest in damaging any aspect of the Yemeni economy,\u201d and had made great efforts to avoid harming civilians. He declined to provide details about specific sites, but said the coalition had \u201caccurate intelligence\u201d that the sites we visited were \u201cbeing used by militias to store weapons and ammunition or a command-and-control center.\u201dThe war has left nothing untouched for the Alsonidar brothers, Khalid and Abdullah, who own a group of factories outside Sana.Twice in September, the compound was bombed, destroying all three factories.Saudi news reports said the factories had produced rockets for the rebels, a charge the brothers denied. They and their Italian partners have written to the United Nations to state that the factories could not produce military technology, and to call for an investigation, which is continuing, they said.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about something useless,\u201d Abdullah Alsonidar said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about infrastructure and people\u2019s lives. Strikes like this can bring a family to the ground.\u201dRemains of munitions that the brothers found at the site indicate that it was hit with American-made weapons, including one with laser-guidance equipment that was made in October 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Letting Bankers Off the Hook May Have Tipped the Election", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byFair GameThere are many facets to the populist, anti-establishment anger that swept Donald J. Trump into the White House in Tuesday\u2019s election. A crucial element fueling the rage, in my view, was this: Not one high-ranking executive at a major financial firm was held to account for the crisis of 2008.As millions of foreclosures and job losses followed, the failure to go after fraudsters confirmed the suspicion that the powerful got protection while those on Main Street were kicked to the curb. When Mr. Trump asserted that the system was rigged, he tapped directly into such misgivings.Many readers of The New York Times, particularly if you live in Manhattan, San Francisco or another affluent enclave, may not see how an accountability failure of years ago could still resonate. But the failure to prosecute even one or two high-profile bankers \u2014 or force them simply to pay fines and penalties out of their own pockets \u2014 left millions of Americans believing that our justice system was unjust.Embarrassed, perhaps, by their passivity, Justice Department officials recently pledged to take a more aggressive approach to white-collar crime. But the memo issued last September by Sally Quillian Yates, deputy attorney general, outlining new ways the department would hold individuals to account, has not translated into results.These kinds of cases, of course, take time to mount. Still, data supplied by the Justice Department and compiled by Syracuse University shows that white-collar crime prosecutions are actually down significantly in 2016 from previous years. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse indicates that through August \u2014 the first 11 months of the government\u2019s most recent fiscal year \u2014 prosecutions of all types were down almost 18 percent from five years ago.That tally is far fewer than in previous periods. Compared with five years ago, for example, the number of cases is down 39 percent; going back a decade, near the height of the mortgage mania, cases have fallen by 19 percent.\u201cCriminal enforcement is required to deter criminal behavior, and the current Justice Department has more and more abandoned such activities,\u201d said David Burnham, co-director of the records clearinghouse, who compiles the data.While the Fed concluded that more Americans than in previous studies were comfortable or \u201cO.K.\u201d with their financial positions, the researchers made a disturbing finding. If faced with emergency expenses of $400, almost half of the 5,600 respondents said they either would not be able to cover the costs or they would have to sell something or borrow to do so.Another troubling statistic from the study: 22 percent of workers in the survey said they were holding down two or more jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s important to identify the reasons why so many families face continued financial struggles and to find ways to help them overcome them,\u201d said Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, at the time the study was published.I\u2019d call that an understatement.The degree to which these voters favored Mr. Trump is something of a paradox, given his persona of the wealthy real estate mogul. Jailing bankers wasn\u2019t one of his campaign\u2019s main themes.Still, Mr. Trump did call for bringing back Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separated commercial banking from investment banking. And he threatened to revoke the special tax treatment known as carried interest that enriches private equity executives and hedge fund managers.On the other hand, he also promised to dismantle aspects of the Dodd-Frank legislation, Congress\u2019s response to the 2008 mayhem.\u201cTrump\u2019s personal background does not necessarily strike a populist chord,\u201d Mr. Stanley said. \u201cBut his campaign rhetoric portrayed a situation where the economy was being rigged by powerful insiders. We\u2019re going to be holding him accountable to deliver on some of that rhetoric.\u201dThat points to one of the risks to Mr. Trump of riding a populist wave. If voters come to believe that he is actually more interested in protecting his friends or dispensing favors to the powerful, they will turn on him.The first inkling of whether Mr. Trump is truly on the side of Main Street may emerge when his administration sets out to change Dodd-Frank.There is much to dislike in the legislation \u2014 its rules are maddeningly complex and were weakened by Wall Street lobbyists. Changes to the law could help protect the system, Mr. Stanley said, or leave it vulnerable to another collapse.\u201cAre you going to return to the situation under Bush and Clinton where Wall Street wrote its own rules in the back room?\u201d Mr. Stanley asked. \u201cOr are you going to put forward something that constitutes a genuine alternative and that will prevent Wall Street from rigging the economy?\u201dIt seems pretty clear that\u2019s what voters are looking for. Will they get it? Stay tuned.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Know What Virtual Reality Might Become? Look to the Past", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byFeatureThe Phantasmagoria came to London in 1801, after a decade or two of development in Germany and France. Relying heavily on ghostly magic-lantern projections, the show submerged its patrons in a multisensory vault of dread and illusion \u2014 in contemporary terms, a cross between the immersive theater of \u201cSleep No More\u201d and Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion. Shortly after its arrival, the success of the Phantasmagoria and a handful of similar shows set off a kind of entertainment version of the Cambrian explosion. Bizarre new species of illusion proliferated across the West End. The names themselves, with their strange Greek neologisms, suggest just how far the language strained to tout the novelty of the experiences. According to \u201cThe Shows of London,\u201d by Richard Altick, a visitor to the city in the early to mid-1800s could enjoy a \u201cnovel mechanical and pictorial exhibition\u201d called the Akolouthorama; a rival spook show called the Phantascopia; an exhibition called the Spectrographia, which promised \u201ctraditionary ghost work!\u201d; an influential mechanical exhibition dubbed the Eidophusikon; and the Panstereomachia, \u201ca picto-mechanical representation,\u201d in the words of The Times of London.Brewster himself was something of a natural magician. Right around the period he was studying the Phantasmagoria, he invented the kaleidoscope, which for a few years was the PlayStation of the late Georgian era. (Brewster barely made a penny from the device, as imitators quickly flooded the market with clones of his original idea.) Decades later, he invented the lenticular stereoscope, a hand-held technology that fools the eye into perceiving two distinct flat images as a single 3-D scene. This time around, Brewster managed to build a successful business selling his contraption, branded as a \u201cBrewster Stereoscope.\u201d Queen Victoria famously marveled at one during the Great Exhibition of 1851. Oliver Wendell Holmes published a paean to the stereoscope in The Atlantic, rhapsodizing over the new technology with an enthusiasm that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in an early issue of Mondo 2000 or Wired:Oh, infinite volumes of poems that I treasure in this small library of glass and pasteboard! I creep over the vast features of Rameses, on the face of his rockhewn Nubian temple; I scale the huge mountain-crystal that calls itself the Pyramid of Cheops. I pace the length of the three Titanic stones of the wall of Baalbec \u2014 mightiest masses of quarried rock that man has lifted into the air. ...By the dawn of the 20th century, almost every species in the 19th-century genus of illusion was wiped off the map by a new form of \u201cnatural magic\u201d: the cinema. The stereoscope, too, withered in the public imagination. (It lingered on as a child\u2019s toy in the 20th century through the cheap plastic View-Master devices many of us enjoyed in grade school.) But then something strange happened: After a century of irrelevance, Brewster\u2019s idea \u2014 putting stereoscopic goggles over your eyes to fool your mind into thinking you are gazing out on a three-dimensional world \u2014 turned out to have a second life.This is how, a few months ago, I found myself holding an original 19th-century wooden stereoscope. I was visiting the headquarters of RYOT, a Los Angeles-based media company that produces stories in virtual reality, and that maintains a collection of stereograms from the heyday of the device. It\u2019s easy to see why, because the family resemblance to today\u2019s V.R. goggles is unmistakable; in fact, the stereoscope I held was literally forward-compatible with today\u2019s smartphones. RYOT\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, Bryn Mooser, slid an iPhone into the slot behind the lenses, and as I pulled the contraption up to my eyes, I was transported to the banks of the Ganges River. It felt like a moment from some steampunk novel: a Victorian contraption conjuring a world through natural magic of a distinctly digital kind.The moment suggested a tantalizing possibility: that the mass extinction of all those 19th-century spectacles, all those illusion palaces and contraptions, might itself prove to be a kind of mirage. What if those marvels of the past only went into a 100-year hibernation? Like all forms of new media, virtual reality is frequently described in terms of its immediate predecessors: movies or video games. But if we are trying to imagine the future of V.R., we may well have more to learn from the immersive shows of 19th-century illusionists than from some franchise superhero movie or Call of Duty. No doubt some future V.R. creators will figure out how to tell cinematic stories or make compelling game experiences. But if history is any guide, it\u2019s very likely that we will eventually discover that V.R. is actually better at something else.The question is: What is that something else?Indeed, the study of delight and amusement often turns out to be a way of predicting the future. The idea of a true global economy was first visible in the market for entirely frivolous spices like cinnamon and nutmeg; the first programmable machines \u2014 predating modern digital computers by a millennium \u2014 were automated toys and music boxes. The mathematics of probability theory, which now underpin everything from insurance to airplane design to clinical drug trials, were first developed to analyze dice games. When those Victorian technophiles stared through stereoscopes and projected themselves into distant worlds, they were also, unwittingly, projecting themselves into a future that wouldn\u2019t appear for another century and a half.Optical illusions occupy a special place in the history of play and wonder, straddling the border between parlor trickery and high art. Until the invention of cinema in the late 19th century, which fooled the eye into seeing motion in a series of still images, the most famous and influential \u201ctrick of the eye\u201d was the invention of linear perspective, generally credited to the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, though the fundamental rules that governed the technique were first outlined in the book \u201cOn Painting,\u201d by Leon Battista Alberti, published in 1435. Technically speaking, linear perspective is nothing more than an optical illusion, but it is rightfully considered one of the most transformative innovations of the Renaissance.For a brief period at the end of the 18th century, it seemed as though an Irish painter named Robert Barker had stumbled across an innovation of comparable significance. At some point in the mid-1780s, Barker took a stroll to the top of Calton Hill in Edinburgh. Standing near the current site of the Nelson Monument and gazing out over the city, Barker hit upon the idea of painting the entire 360-degree view by rotating a sequence of square frames around a fixed spot, sketching each part of the vista and then uniting them as a single wraparound image. (He had to invent a new technique to compensate for the visual distortions that appeared when painting on a concave surface.) Barker was granted a patent in 1787 for \u201can entire new Contrivance of Apparatus ... for the Purpose of displaying Views of Nature at large.\u201d At the suggestion of a \u201cclassical friend,\u201d Barker hit upon a name for his creation, drawing on the Greek phrase for \u201call-encompassing view.\u201d He called it the Panorama.By 1793, Barker had constructed a six-story building near London\u2019s Leicester Square, custom-designed for the exclusive purpose of displaying two separate Panoramas to crowds of paying spectators. The lead attraction was an immense vista of London encompassing 1,479 square feet. Barker ran advertisements that modestly suggested his technique was \u201cthe greatest improvement to the art of painting that has ever yet been discovered.\u201d For a time, the bombast seemed warranted. The show was a runaway success. The king and queen requested an advance viewing, though Queen Charlotte later reported that the illusion made her dizzy.Surveying the illusion artists of the early 19th century, a young Charles Dickens described the technology in terms that echo much of the recent enthusiasm over virtual reality and its potential:It is a delightful characteristic of these times, that new and cheap means are continuously being devised, for conveying the results of actual experience to those who are unable to obtain such experiences for themselves; and to bring them within the reach of the people \u2014 emphatically of the people; for it is they at large who are addressed in these endeavours, and not exclusive audiences. ... Some of the best results of actual travel are suggested by such means to those whose lot it is to stay at home. New worlds open out to them, beyond their little worlds, and widen their range of reflection, information, sympathy and interest. The more man knows of man, the better for the common brotherhood among us all.Dickens saw the virtual explorations of the Panorama and the stereoscope as a way for human beings to extend the range of their perceptions \u2014 literally to see the world through the eyes of others. Today this sentiment has become a slogan of sorts for the V.R. medium. The director Chris Milk, in a widely circulated TED talk, called V.R. systems \u201cempathy machines,\u201d a description echoed by other V.R. auteurs. At the RYOT studios, a director named Angel Manuel Soto showed me a short V.R. film called \u201cBashir\u2019s Dream,\u201d which tells the story of a young Syrian boy who was paralyzed after being shot by a sniper. The film \u2014 though \u201cfilm\u201d is almost certainly the wrong word to describe it \u2014 shifts between live-action shots of Bashir\u2019s wheeling his way through battle-scarred urban landscapes and an animated reconstruction of the shooting that nearly killed him. At the end, you are projected into a kind of dream landscape, as Bashir imagines escaping the twin prisons of a war zone and a wheelchair. The film is haunting, to be sure, but watching it, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if the empathy it evoked was really all that different from the kind of enlarged perspective that great documentary films already provide.I had navigated my way through a warren of vacant hallways to meet with the British artist and V.R. creator Barnaby Steel, a founder of a group known as Marshmallow Laser Feast, which seems to oscillate between a commercial creative agency and an experimental art collective. When I finally found my way to the mysterious Room 530, in the rear of their Los Angeles offices, Steel welcomed me into an undecorated open-plan space filled with a dozen or so black workstations. Steel and his colleagues were working on a project for the V.R. music-experience company Redpill with a curious goal: to summon a shimmering oversize jellyfish that would adapt, in real time, to any music that you feed into the simulation. Each new song triggered a different set of jellyfish behaviors: flashes of color in its gelatinous body, tentacles pulsing with the rhythm. The contrast between the banal exterior of the setting and the psychedelic alternate reality being created there was almost comical, like stumbling upon an ayahuasca ceremony in some conference room from the set of \u201cOffice Space.\u201dSteel strapped the Oculus goggles to my head and placed two controllers in my hands. Inside the simulated world, I could lift my hands and see two ghostly images of them, as though contemplating a live X-ray of my own body. Looking up, I saw the jellyfish hovering above, bobbing softly in the blackness like an immense Portuguese man-of-war. The music part of the simulation wasn\u2019t operational yet, so I could hear the real world around me as I gazed at the imaginary dancing creature. \u201cYou can smack the side of it,\u201d Steel said, and I did; the jellyfish flinched, and a blast of purplish color rippled off from the point of impact.I found myself trailing my fingers through the tentacles, watching them dance. At Steel\u2019s encouragement, I pulled the whole creature over my head, as through grabbing the ends of a blanket, and suddenly I was inside the body, draped by tentacles on all sides. It was, by a wide margin, the most sensual encounter I have ever had with an invertebrate.\u201cOur starting point when we first began experimenting with virtual reality was: What does it enable that wasn\u2019t possible before?\u201d Steel explained, after I emerged. \u201cAnd then, what are we interested in? How can we expand our experience of reality?\u201d The world that we experience is obviously limited by our senses, he pointed out, but many more potential senses exist than those we possess.That line of thinking led not just to the jellyfish but to another V.R. installation called \u201cIn the Eyes of the Animal,\u201d which Steel and his colleagues staged in a forest in Britain\u2019s Lake District. Donning V.R. goggles, visitors entered a parallel version of the forest, where they could shift in and out of the perspectives of different creatures, from midges to frogs to owls. As you switched among the animals, the software simulated the unique perceptual tools of each organism. The midge, for instance, could detect carbon dioxide being exhaled in an ordinary human breath from hundreds of feet away. When you adopted the midge\u2019s perspective, carbon-dioxide density was represented by swirling red points in the forest. \u201cWe tried to imagine the trees breathing,\u201d Steel explained. \u201cWhat it would look like if you could see the chemical composition of the air.\u201dA detailed inventory of the show that toured the United States gives some sense of the scale of the production. Movable frames representing the buildings of Moscow \u2014 the Kremlin, church spires, castles \u2014 were designed to collapse or explode on cue. Behind the skyline, Maelzel hung a transparent painting that suggested a haze of smoke and fire; behind it another painting depicted other buildings in the distance ablaze, with a moon glowing in the night sky above the carnage. At the front of the stage, two bridges and a causeway carried more than 200 miniature Russian and French soldiers. Fire screens enabled actual flames to creep across the urban landscape without damaging any of the equipment.The story conveyed by \u201cThe Conflagration of Moscow\u201d was the least interesting thing about the show. Yes, events followed a preordained sequence on the stage: Napoleon\u2019s army advanced; the Russians retreated; flames surged across the skyline. But the true appeal of the spectacle came from the sense of immersion, just as it had with Barker\u2019s Panorama. You didn\u2019t go to see these illusion shows because you wanted to follow the arc of a compelling character; you went because you wanted to be present in some stunning place, or time, or perspective, that would otherwise be impossible to inhabit.Something similar is likely to happen with virtual reality. One thing that is striking about \u201cIn the Eyes of the Animal\u201d and Steel\u2019s musical jellyfish is that there is nothing narrative about the experiences. They\u2019re powerful, evocative; they fill you with an undeniable sense of wonder. But they don\u2019t tell you a story.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an evolution from cinema,\u201d Bryn Mooser said after we put down the stereoscopes at the RYOT offices. \u201cThis isn\u2019t storytelling.\u201d If V.R. allows you to project yourself onto the deck of the Titanic, I suspect we won\u2019t want the entire James Cameron-style back story about a dashing artist and his fleeting romance with a wealthy young woman facing an arranged marriage. We\u2019ll just want to experience the sinking of the ship. Plot points will be a nuisance. A V.R. equivalent of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d won\u2019t bother with the relationship between John Hammond and his grandkids; we\u2019ll just stroll through the grassy plain and gaze at the brontosaurus.\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it really,\u201d Steel says about the process of creating \u201cIn the Eyes of the Animal,\u201d \u201cbut by the end of it, we were all thinking, If you\u2019d had a stressful day, it\u2019s super nice to just put it on and just explore. You always find new perspectives and angles. With these bigger trees, you\u2019re scanning so much detail that you notice stuff in V.R. that you wouldn\u2019t notice in real life. We\u2019re stuck at five to six feet high, and so you rarely go down and put your chin on the floor. But in V.R., you just stick yourself down there, and you\u2019re like: \u2018I love it down here! Look at all these pine cones!\u2019\u2009\u201dIt\u2019s possible, of course, that the next generation \u2014 acclimated to these merely stereoscopic explorations \u2014 will agitate for the medium to take on the kinetic qualities of the cinema: not just the intricacies of plot but the rapid cuts, the action sequences. But think of all those countless thousands of spectators who thrilled to the \u201cnatural magic\u201d of Barker\u2019s Panorama, standing in silent contemplation, traveling to a distant place for a few minutes before venturing back out into the chaos and smog of the great city. A similar sense of quiet contemplation may well be what differentiates V.R. from its immediate predecessors. In an age when action movies have acclimated our eyes to multiple cuts per second, and in which video games bombard us with nonstop carnage, there turns out to a surprisingly meditative quality to the world we inhabit with V.R. goggles on. This could well turn out to be the most magical trick of all: harnessing all this advanced technology to slow us down and make us wonder again.Steven Johnson is the author of 10 books on the history of science, technology and innovation, and the host of the Emmy Award-winning PBS series \u201cHow We Got to Now.\u201dThis article is adapted from \u201cWonderland: How Play Made the Modern World,\u201d to be published this month by Riverhead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lufthansa Joins Germany\u2019s List of Companies in Distress", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Lufthansa was once a proud symbol of Germany Inc., standing for the quality and smooth functionality of Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy. But that was before the last week, when a strike by the airline\u2019s pilots stranded more than half a million passengers.As of Wednesday, 4,461 flights had been scratched over six days, with no end in sight to a dispute over wages for pilots.Lufthansa\u2019s troubles have become Exhibit A in demonstrating how the changes of the 21st century are eating away at decades of cooperation between labor and management that allowed Germany to rebuild and grow after World War II.Those deals, which have given labor a say in management, have allowed Germany to avoid the crippling strikes and violence seen in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s union-busting Britain, say, or over decades in France.But Lufthansa is also the latest example of how the fabled efficiency and competence of some major German companies have fallen into crisis.Bosch is under investigation in the writing of the illegal software Volkswagen used to manipulate results of emissions tests. Vehicles are Germany\u2019s biggest export, and the country\u2019s economy would instantly suffer from any decline in sales.Germany\u2019s once-mighty banking industry is also struggling to avoid slipping into irrelevance. After the financial crisis in 2008, Deutsche Bank was the only European institution that remained a strong presence on Wall Street.But the bank has been pummeled by accusations that it took part in a wide array of financial malfeasance. The authorities in the United States have threatened Deutsche Bank with $14 billion in fines related to its sale of mortgage-backed securities, although that amount is just the starting point in negotiations, and the final amount is expected to be lower.The bank\u2019s shares have fallen about 36 percent in the last year because investors fear its ability to compete could be hobbled for years to come.For Lufthansa, the fight is ostensibly over wages for its pilots, who earn about 30 percent above the global average, according to Gerd Pontius of Prologis, an aviation consultant, where he advises more than 50 airlines. The highest-ranked captains easily earn 250,000 euros a year (about $265,000).While Lufthansa has tried to rebook passengers and keep them moving, impatience is mounting. \u201cCompetitors are getting more attractive,\u201d Mr. Pontius said. \u201cThe strike really drives passengers into the arms of the competition.\u201dPhilipp Goedeking, an airline consultant based in Frankfurt with the investment company Avinomics, had his own lament. On Wednesday, he flew British Airways to London for a meeting, and paid \u20ac1,100 ($1,167) for a return ticket \u2014 \u201creally a chunk of change,\u201d he said, as the absence of Lufthansa flights drove him to seek an alternative.Those are the kinds of costs not reflected in Lufthansa\u2019s estimate that each day of the strike costs the airline from \u20ac10 million to \u20ac15 million. The damage over all to the German economy is unknown at this time.Mr. Goedeking said it was once unthinkable that anyone at the airline would go on strike. The motto for what he called a \u201cvery, very valuable brand\u201d used to be, \u201cIf it says Lufthansa on the outside, it must be Lufthansa inside,\u201d referring to the quality of work from the ground crews to personnel aboard its planes.Carsten Spohr, the former pilot who is Lufthansa\u2019s chief executive, knows he has to adapt that motto and squeeze costs.For Lufthansa, budget airlines like easyJet and Ryanair are advancing in Europe while Middle Eastern and Asian airports have become rivals on long-haul flights. Istanbul; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Doha, Qatar, are taking business away from traditional European hubs like Frankfurt.Mr. Goedeking noted that Istanbul in particular could prove a threat to Lufthansa when it opens a giant airport about 22 miles northwest of the Turkish commercial capital, probably by 2018.That will lure customers from Middle Eastern and European hubs, Mr. Goedeking said. \u201cIt is perfectly placed,\u201d he added, \u201cright in the path of natural traffic flows.\u201dFor now, nobody wants to rattle the cage and abandon Germany\u2019s hallowed post-Nazi principle of tarifautonomie, or bargaining on wages that is independent of any state interference.Lufthansa hopes to return to normal service on Thursday, when there is no strike scheduled. Workers have given at least 24 hours\u2019 notice before going on each of the 15 strikes that have occurred since 2014.The outsize power wielded by the pilots\u2019 union in the Lufthansa strike is testing not only passengers but also the tens of thousands of the airline\u2019s employees who are not pilots.The mood has grown more heated. Both the pilots and other Lufthansa employees, who are among the 95 percent who have already reached deals with the company, demonstrated outside the airline\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt on Wednesday.The pilots might deserve more money, said Dominik Fries, who works in technical operations and was among some 250 demonstrators who were not pilots. \u201cBut they shouldn\u2019t get it through a strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have got to negotiate. This is slowly getting to be too much \u2014 they are the drops of water that make the cup run over.\u201dChristopher Heim, a captain flying Airbus A380s and one of the few pilots willing to talk to reporters, cast the struggle in the light of current politics.\u201cRight now, we are standing at the forefront fighting for the rights of workers,\u201d he said, predicting that \u201cit\u2019s going to get better for the workers\u201d as government and employers realize from the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States that \u201cright-wing parties are gaining momentum\u201d and \u201cthey can\u2019t just hit us as they did.\u201dBy Wednesday afternoon, Lufthansa had made another offer, which the pilots said they would examine.The offer was late and of little solace to Antonio Bellon, 24, who was huddled in Tegel Airport in Berlin on Tuesday. Mr. Bellon, a student in Hamburg, was trying to get home to Venice. His direct flight on Lufthansa was canceled.The bus that ferried him from Hamburg had been delayed, he said, causing him to miss a connection in Berlin and forcing him to fly through Zurich.\u201cThe worst part was waiting for the bus in minus 7 degrees Centigrade,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever been so cold.\u201dAn article on Dec. 1 about a pilots\u2019 strike at Lufthansa, the latest German company in distress, referred imprecisely to fines sought by the United States against Deutsche Bank, a German institution accused of financial malfeasance. Although the authorities have threatened fines of $14 billion, that amount is the starting point in negotiations \u2014 not the final amount, which is expected to be lower. The article also misstated the location, relative to Istanbul, of a new airport expected to compete for passengers with traditional European hubs like Berlin. It will be about 22 miles northwest \u2014 not northeast \u2014 of the Turkish city. And because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to Istanbul. It is the commercial capital of Turkey, not the administrative capital.Jack Ewing and Rhea Wessel contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Oil Help Mexico Withstand Trump\u2019s Attack on Trade? It\u2019s Hard to See How", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byCIUDAD DEL CARMEN, Mexico \u2014 The town that oil built is emptying out.\u201cFor Sale\u201d signs are plastered on concrete-block houses and sun-bleached bungalows alike. The idled oil workers who used to cluster in the main square, hoping to pick up odd jobs, have moved on.Here in Ciudad del Carmen, on the gulf coast of Mexico, even the ironclad union positions are slipping away. Some roughnecks on the offshore rigs of the national oil company, Pemex, have not worked in months, and their voices are filled with anxiety.\u201cWhat do you think is going to happen?\u201d some ask.Now, that mammoth undertaking has become all the more critical with the United States\u2019 election of Donald J. Trump. As Mexicans steel themselves for an American president who made upending his nation\u2019s relationship with Mexico a cornerstone of his campaign, officials on this side of the border have hastened to reassure the country that Mexico\u2019s economy is sound.If Mr. Trump goes through with his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, deport migrants and tax remittances to pay for his border wall, Mexico will face severe economic shocks, particularly to the vibrant manufacturing base, whose products replaced oil as the country\u2019s main export years ago.The Mexican peso remains at record lows. The central bank raised interest rates this month, citing \u201cheightened uncertainty.\u201d And last week, it cut growth forecasts for this year and next. The bank\u2019s governor, Agust\u00edn Carstens, told a local radio station that understanding the Trump administration\u2019s policies was \u201clike trying to put a jigsaw puzzle together without having all the pieces.\u201dMany are pessimistic that the government can come up with a backup plan. \u201cMexico lacks a credible Plan B to offset the anti-trade wave,\u201d analysts at Morgan Stanley warned in a recent note to investors.The damage that Mr. Trump could inflict on the busy factories that ship cars and computers to the United States has given a sharp urgency to Mexico\u2019s efforts to jump-start parts of the economy that do not rely on Nafta \u2014 particularly its dilapidated oil industry.To that end, when Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, the finance minister, lists the Mexican economy\u2019s strengths, he singles out the importance of the new energy laws that broke the 75-year monopoly held by Pemex.The laws, part of a package of economic overhauls that President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto pushed through Congress three years ago, allow for private investment in Mexico\u2019s oil sector for the first time since foreign companies were expelled in 1938.Only days before the American presidential election, Pemex\u2019s chief executive, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya, presented a timetable of projects he expected to offer to potential partners and promised to begin returning the national oil company to solvency.He and the finance minister met with investors in New York this month to argue that Mexico\u2019s economy was solid and that \u201cthe oil sector will continue to be an engine of national economic growth,\u201d according to a joint statement from Pemex and the Finance Ministry. The pair followed up with a visit to London.\u201cThe only way to bring back production in the next five, six years is to bring more investment to Pemex,\u201d said Juan Carlos Zepeda, the president of the National Hydrocarbons Commission, Mexico\u2019s oil regulator. \u201cThere is no other way.\u201dBut after the new energy laws were approved, the company stalled, the promised joint ventures did not happen, and oil prices plunged.Pemex reeled as its debt soared and production dropped. Falling oil revenue means oil funds less than 20 percent of the government budget, down from as much as 40 percent when prices were at their peak.\u201cThe government was never prepared for sustained low oil prices,\u201d said John Padilla, a managing director of IPD Latin America, an energy consulting firm. \u201cThey never saw a Pemex implosion in the way it occurred.\u201dThe president chose Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya, a Harvard-educated economist known for efficiency, to take over at Pemex in February. He quickly announced the first joint venture proposal: a deepwater oil field just south of United States waters.Experts believe that Mexico\u2019s untapped deepwater oil fields are its next great prize. But they are risky and expensive, a concern at a time when low oil prices have forced international oil companies to scrap many planned investments.Still, major companies like BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell have qualified to bid in a deepwater auction in December.In an interview in his office at the top of the Pemex tower in Mexico City, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya warned not to expect too much.\u201cSome people have said to me, \u2018Look, Pemex won\u2019t go back to producing three million barrels.\u2019 Well, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame \u2014 but no. What I can say and demonstrate is the company\u2019s solidity.\u201dNot everyone is sure that companies will jump at the chance to team up with Pemex.\u201cTwo years ago, everybody wanted to partner with Pemex,\u201d Mr. Padilla said. \u201cThey were being courted like the homecoming queen. Fast-forward two years later, and how can you go to your board and say, \u2018Pemex is good for the money\u2019?\u201dAnother question is whether the government can speed up the transformation as a defense against Mr. Trump\u2019s promised policies. Even if the government attracts private investment, the effect on production could take years to materialize.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to turn the economy around on energy reform,\u201d said Jeremy M. Martin, an energy expert at the Institute of the Americas in San Diego.In the meantime, Mexico must fix the company\u2019s many problems.Pemex\u2019s rusty refineries operate at about 60 percent capacity, forcing the country to import more than half of its gasoline. The company loses billions of dollars every quarter, and it owes almost $100 billion in debt and an additional $68 billion in pension liabilities. Budget cuts have halted exploration for next year.An explosion on a fuel tanker in September was the latest in a series of fiery and often fatal accidents. Gangs routinely tap Pemex\u2019s pipelines to steal gasoline, tipped off from inside the company.The government continues to tax Pemex heavily, and the oil workers\u2019 union \u2014 an ally of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party \u2014 remains powerful.Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya\u2019s first action after arriving at Pemex was to slash the budget by 22 percent, halting expensive projects and cutting waste.\u201cWe haven\u2019t finished,\u201d he said. Referring to his effort to rein in overspending, he added, \u201cWe continue, continue, continue.\u201dFor decades, Pemex made many people very rich. The company granted inflated contracts to local business executives who cultivated political connections, according to interviews with contractors in Ciudad del Carmen. Mayors in oil states demanded Pemex cash for public works.\u201cThe budget has been converted into plunder,\u201d said Mariano Ruiz Funes, a former Pemex chief of staff.Analysts argue that Pemex may have to sell off parts of the company.\u201cWe will see a much smaller Pemex in the years to come,\u201d Mr. Ruiz Funes said, predicting a \u201clong and painful\u201d adjustment. \u201cPolitically it will be difficult.\u201dMr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya is not prepared to make that decision.Pemex \u201cis not just any company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a national oil company to be Exxon.\u201dBut in Ciudad del Carmen, the riches of that national oil company are long gone. The city has lost about 23,000 jobs since the end of 2014.\u201cWhat we\u2019re living through in Carmen, we have never lived through something like this in contemporary Mexico,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Domingo Berzunza, the economic development secretary for Campeche, the surrounding state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungry Venezuelans Flee in Boats to Escape Economic Collapse", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byWILLEMSTAD, Cura\u00e7ao \u2014 The dark outlines of land had just come into view when the smuggler forced everyone into the sea.Afraid of the authorities, the smuggler refused to land. Ms. Bello said he gruffly ordered her and the others into the water, pointing toward the distant shore. In the panic, she was tossed overboard, tumbling into the predawn blackness.But Ms. Bello could not swim.\u201cIt was worth the risk,\u201d said Ms. Bello, 30, adding that Venezuelans like her \u201care going after one thing: food.\u201dVenezuela was once one of Latin America\u2019s richest countries, flush with oil wealth that attracted immigrants from places as varied as Europe and the Middle East.But after President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez vowed to break the country\u2019s economic elite and redistribute wealth to the poor, the rich and middle class fled to more welcoming countries in droves, creating what demographers describe as Venezuela\u2019s first diaspora.Now a second diaspora is underway \u2014 much less wealthy and not nearly as welcome.Well over 150,000 Venezuelans have fled the country in the last year alone, the highest in more than a decade, according to scholars studying the exodus.\u201cParents will say, \u2018I would rather say goodbye to my son in the airport than in the cemetery,\u2019 \u201d he said.Desperate Venezuelans are streaming across the Amazon Basin by the tens of thousands to reach Brazil. They are concocting elaborate scams to sneak through airports in Caribbean nations that once accepted them freely. When Venezuela opened its border with Colombia for just two days in July, 120,000 people poured across, simply to buy food, officials said. An untold number stayed.\u201cIt has all totally changed,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n de la Vega, a sociologist at Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University in Caracas. About 60 percent more Venezuelans fled the country this year than during the year before, he added.\u201cThe earnings of these people are low,\u201d Mr. de la Vega said of the recent migrants. \u201cThe only option left to them is the nearby countries, ones they can get to on foot, or by rafts, or go on boats with tiny motors.\u201d\u201cVenezuelans like myself are coming to Brazil for a simple reason: It\u2019s easier to survive here,\u201d said Reinier Salazar, 30, an industrial engineer who moved to Brazil last year. Now he cooks at a fast-food restaurant for about $400 a month \u2014 much more than he made back home in Venezuela, he said.The exodus is unfolding so quickly that since 2015 about 30,000 Venezuelans have moved to the border region that includes the Brazilian state of Roraima, officials say. Now the Brazilian Army is bolstering patrols along highways and rivers, bracing for even more arrivals.\u201cWe\u2019re at the start of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in this part of the Amazon,\u201d said Col. Edvaldo Amaral, the state\u2019s civil defense chief. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing Venezuelan lawyers working as supermarket cashiers, Venezuelan women resorting to prostitution, indigenous Venezuelans begging at traffic intersections.\u201dSome are paying smugglers more than $1,000 a person to reach cities like Manaus and S\u00e3o Paulo, officials say, while others just manage to cross the border into Brazil. In Pacaraima, a small Brazilian border town, hundreds of Venezuelan children are now enrolled in local schools and entire families are sleeping on the streets of town.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a solution to this problem because hunger is involved,\u201d said the mayor, Altemir Campos. \u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t have enough food for its people, so some are coming here.\u201dThe small Caribbean islands neighboring Venezuela are far less hospitable, saying they simply cannot absorb the onslaught. The closest to Venezuela\u2019s coast, Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, have effectively sealed their borders to poor Venezuelans since last year by making them show $1,000 in cash before entering \u2014 the equivalent of more than five years of earnings in a minimum-wage job.Both countries have increased patrols and deportations, and Aruba has even set aside a stadium to hold as many as 500 Venezuelan migrants after they are caught, according to the authorities.It\u2019s a dramatic reversal of fortune for Venezuelans, who once went to Cura\u00e7ao to spend money as tourists, not to plead for work.\u201cThey all say, \u2018You are from Venezuela. You are from a rich country that has everything,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Bello said of her encounters on the island. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018No longer.\u2019 \u201dEmpty homes now dot the streets of the fishing town of La Vela, Ms. Bello\u2019s hometown in Venezuela, their owners having set off by sea.They have mortgaged property, sold kitchen appliances and even borrowed money from the same smuggling rings that pack them on the floorboards alongside drugs and other contraband.The journey to Cura\u00e7ao takes them on a 60-mile crossing filled with backbreaking swells, gangs of armed boatmen and coast guard vessels looking to capture migrants and send them home.Then, after being tossed overboard and left to swim ashore, they hide in the bush to meet contacts who spirit them anew into the tourist economy of this Caribbean island. They clean the floors of restaurants, sell trinkets on the street, or even solicit Dutch tourists for sex, forced by the smugglers to pay for their passage by working in a brothel, the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao say.Countless families in Venezuela are like the Bellos now. Unable to scrounge together more than a meal a day, they are scattered across seas and borders.Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Rolando works construction in Cura\u00e7ao and his wife recently joined him, leaving their 7-year-old daughter with relatives back home. An uncle of Ms. Bello\u2019s was not so lucky: He sits in a Cura\u00e7ao prison, accused of smuggling migrants like his relatives.Then there is Wilfredo Hidalgo, Ms. Bello\u2019s 27-year-old cousin, who studied business administration in Venezuela but never found a job. Two years ago, he was deported from Cura\u00e7ao after coming by plane. Now he is trying to return by boat, having saved half of the $350 he needs to pay the smugglers.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he said.There is also Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Roger, whose 19-year-old girlfriend, Yaisbel, is six months pregnant. He, too, said he would go to Cura\u00e7ao to support his child. Yaisbel said she would stay behind but take a loan from smugglers to pay for her boyfriend\u2019s journey, using her mother\u2019s house as collateral. Hopefully, she said, her mother would never find out.\u201cI am just watching her stomach,\u201d Roger Bello said. \u201cBefore the child is here, I will be in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201dAnd finally there is Ms. Bello\u2019s mother, Maria Pi\u00f1ero, who gave her a life vest just before she left, knowing that she could not swim. But the smuggler ripped it off Ms. Bello just before she was thrown into the sea, saying that the swells were so high she was better off swimming under the waves.Now, despite Ms. Bello\u2019s ordeal, her mother vowed to make the journey by boat, too.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m leaving with nothing. But I have to do this. Otherwise, we will just die here hungry.\u201dOne evening at the end of September, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, 47, climbed aboard a boat in a small town on the country\u2019s northern coast. She dropped to her knees, praying to God that she would survive the journey and find a better life in Cura\u00e7ao.The other passengers, tears in their eyes, began to pray too, some joining hands in a circle on the beach. They muttered hopes that the coast guard would not catch them, that they were good people, that they were mothers and fathers.They waded chest-deep into the water, hoisting their few possessions overhead, and climbed into the boat. Its motor started and it steered toward the horizon.Even the smuggler seemed distraught at the misfortune bringing him profits.\u201cI would prefer that the crisis ended and my business was over,\u201d the smuggler said after they had left. \u201cI would prefer a thousand times that there was no crisis and we could live in the Venezuela from yesterday.\u201dJes\u00fas Ramos knew he would have to swim ashore from the smuggler\u2019s boat. So he spent his last weeks in Venezuela doing laps in the sea in front of his home in La Vela, his mother recalls.His friend William Cordero, 29, went too. He spent that month applying for a business license for the salon he planned to open with all the money he expected to make in Cura\u00e7ao. He had already bought a sign.\u201cMy Faith In God Barbershop\u201d it said.But the boat carrying the men never made it.The two friends, along with three other migrants and a captain, vanished somewhere off the coast of Venezuela last year. No wreckage was found. The only evidence that their journey even occurred is a few selfies sent from their smartphones just before they departed. The men posed on the side of the skiff with big smiles.\u201cI try not to cry; I tell myself, \u2018He\u2019s well, that\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201d said Florangel Amaya de Ramos, Mr. Ramos\u2019s mother.The plan had been a simple one: A seven-hour journey in a speedboat. If they were stopped by Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s coast guard, they would pose as tourists. And with their documents in plastic bags, they were ready to swim ashore, knowing that the smuggler wanted to make a quick getaway. Then they could find their contacts using cellphones tucked in empty rice porridge jars.Mr. Cordero already had a Cura\u00e7ao mobile-phone chip. Two years before, he had boarded a plane to Cura\u00e7ao and worked illegally as a barber there, earning several thousand dollars that he sent to his wife and two children in La Vela. But in 2015, Mr. Cordero was deported.He returned to a new, grimmer Venezuela. Long lines for food were becoming startlingly common in La Vela and inflation hit triple digits.Even in big cities like Caracas and Maracaibo, staples like corn flour, the cornerstone of the Venezuelan diet, have become increasingly hard to find, while a growing black market for other goods has driven prices beyond the reach of many. In rural towns like La Vela, residents are even more squeezed, with fewer goods than large cities and a poorer population with less money to pay for them.Mr. Cordero tried to make the best of things by opening a barbershop on his sister\u2019s patio, wearing a white uniform like the one he wore in Cura\u00e7ao. But he earned only about 40 cents per haircut, compared with $35 or more per day in Cura\u00e7ao.The lure of the island grew more intense than ever. But the country had put the new visa restrictions on Venezuelans, and the door was shut behind him. The only way back was with a smuggler by boat.Mr. Ramos, Mr. Cordero\u2019s friend, knew a man who was collecting 200,000 bolivars each, or about $200 at the time, to run a smuggling boat. Mr. Ramos, a lanky 20-year-old, had also been deported recently after working as a gardener in Cura\u00e7ao, but had not managed to find work back in Venezuela. Once the money ran out from his first trip, his wife and three children were spending many days hungry.The smuggler found two other men from the area, and a fifth migrant named Jessica M\u00e1rquez who had come from M\u00e9rida, a city nearly 400 miles away.The five waited anxiously in La Vela for several days as the smuggler got reports from other fishermen in Cura\u00e7ao about coast guard patrols, trying to decide which night would be safest to leave.Mr. Cordero\u2019s sister, Saribeth Cordero, recalled the group sitting in her brother\u2019s barber shop on her porch one afternoon as a movie played on the television about a shipwreck.\u201cWhat if there are sharks?\u201d asked Ms. M\u00e1rquez, Ms. Cordero recalled.\u201cYou can\u2019t be negative like that,\u201d Mr. Cordero said, his sister recalled. But she said her brother was scared too. \u201cHe was nervous about the ocean,\u201d Ms. Cordero said.The group finally headed off in good spirits. Mr. Ramos had sold his motorcycle to pay the smuggler, telling his mother he would not need it anymore. She packed him a waterproof bag with some meager belongings: soap, toothpaste, antibiotics and a few clothes. A van arrived and they left.That afternoon, they arrived at the rendezvous point with the smuggler, a town called Tucacas. They stayed the night in a hostel there. The motor of one of the boats had failed recently, something that worried Mr. Ramos when he wrote to a friend who had agreed to meet him in the jungle once he landed in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. man\u2026 just relax, you\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d the friend wrote in Facebook message that Mr. Cordero forwarded to his mother.\u201cYes bro, tomorrow, God willing,\u201d Mr. Ramos wrote back.Mr. Cordero climbed aboard the boat and sent a selfie to his sister. He wore yellow board shorts and no shirt, making a peace sign with his hands.It was the last anyone heard from anyone in the group.The first to know something had gone wrong was Ms. Ramos. The friend in Cura\u00e7ao wrote over Facebook that he had waited all night but her son never arrived.\u201cI cried all night,\u201d she said.Questions haunt the families of the lost migrants each time they look out toward the sea. Could the men still be alive somehow? Will Venezuela ever return to the country that it was, one where it was not necessary to swim to the shore in Cura\u00e7ao after being tossed from a fishing boat?Ms. Ramos is still waiting for her son and speaks of him in the present tense. Each Sunday, she goes to Mass to pray for his return.\u201cI always speak to God,\u201d said Ms. Ramos. \u201cI am always looking up at that picture of the Virgin. I am scared one day she will yell back at me, \u2018Enough, already. That\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201dRolando Bello sat on a pier in Cura\u00e7ao, worrying about his mother. It was September, a week before she stepped aboard a boat to join him in Cura\u00e7ao. He knew the dangers well, having made the journey twice himself.Last year, he says, Mr. Cordero and Mr. Ramos had approached him to join their doomed trip before they set off.\u201cI was this close to going,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see what would have happened to me.\u201dNow his family was being subjected to the dangerous whims of the passage once more.His mother\u2019s boat was getting ready to set off. His sister, who had been dragged ashore by her hair, had been caught by the Cura\u00e7ao authorities and deported back to Venezuela over the summer. Desperate to work, she had sneaked into Aruba instead, taking a loan from a smuggling ring to get there.But at least his wife was with him. She came to Cura\u00e7ao that month under a new scheme. Because she did not have the $1,000 needed to pose as a Venezuelan tourist at customs, smugglers rented her the money to satisfy the new cash requirement, which is imposed only on Venezuelans. The smuggler\u2019s agents in Cura\u00e7ao then quickly approached her at the airport to take back the money \u2014 and to collect the $100 rental fee.Mr. Bello\u2019s wife, Lennymar Ch\u00e1vez, sat next to her husband and the two ate a large lunch. A boat sailed past a row of colonial facades, and Venezuela felt a world away.\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten an arepa for three months,\u201d she said, referring to the Venezuelan staple of corn flour, which has become increasingly hard to find at home. \u201cI ate one here in Cura\u00e7ao for the first time.\u201dThey had left their 7-year-old daughter in La Vela with relatives. Mr. Bello had trained to be an engineer in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. Now he was a construction day laborer, happily earning about $65 a day. Ms. Ch\u00e1vez trained to be a nurse, but held few hopes of working in her profession in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201cI don\u2019t mind cleaning now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe important thing is that I\u2019m working here.\u201dBut the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao, like many tiny islands, fear the immigrants will undercut the local labor force or bring violent crime.\u201cMy preoccupation is what kind of people are entering Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d said Nelson Navarro, the island\u2019s justice minister who argued that the increase in Venezuelans coincided with a 15 percent rise in crime, particularly armed robberies. \u201cIn Venezuela, they don\u2019t hesitate to shoot a police officer, but here, this is news.\u201dAlex Rosaria, a legislator on the island, worries that the migrants will further strain Cura\u00e7ao, where unemployment is at 11 percent.\u201cWe have only a limited capacity to deal with refugees,\u201d Mr. Rosaria said.For now, the task has been left to the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Rob Jurriansen, a Dutch naval officer who heads operations in Cura\u00e7ao, says his small fleet intercepted only a tiny fraction of the migrants, perhaps just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants arriving in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao, the islands the fleet patrols.Now, he says, officials in the Netherlands, the former colonial power that is still formally tied to Cura\u00e7ao within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, fear they will also get stuck with the bill of caring for a migrant tide.\u201cThey want to prevent a situation like Libya,\u201d he said, referring to the much larger flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe.His station is close to Caracas Bay, now the landing point of many who flee Venezuela. Dense, thorny brush covers the island for miles in each direction, forming a maze through which the migrants wander as they enter Cura\u00e7ao.Far across the passage, the seas had calmed and Mr. Bello\u2019s mother was preparing for her second attempt. After nearly reaching the island in September, her boat turned back, fearing it was being pursued by the Coast Guard.It set out again on a clear October night at 9 p.m. Mr. Bello\u2019s mother, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, sent a message to relatives just before taking off. It had been a choppy ride on the first voyage, but this time the 13 passengers glided smoothly over the waves.But the flat ocean also meant they were visible when they arrived early the next morning, before dawn. Somewhere on shore, Coast Guard officials say they saw what they called a \u201cstrange blip\u201d on the water.Ms. Bello was the first in the family to learn what happened next, when a friend called at 6 a.m.\u201cGirl, they got your mother,\u201d the friend said. \u201cThey caught the boat with drugs.\u201dMs. Bello didn\u2019t want to believe the news, but opened her computer to see what she could find online. Already, images were circulating of the passengers being apprehended by the authorities. Ms. Bello recognized her mother.\u201cYes, it was her with the red hair, the one covering her face so she could not be seen,\u201d she said of her mother.Ms. Bello\u2019s mother landed with a dozen other passengers in detention, she said in a brief telephone interview, watched over by guards. She sounded desperate and tired, her voice cracking.\u201cI thought that trying would be worth it, but in the end it wasn\u2019t, because I\u2019m headed back,\u201d she said, before the line clicked and she was gone.Her son Rolando Bello remains in Cura\u00e7ao with his wife, but his mother\u2019s capture casts a heavy shadow in the small home they share with another Venezuelan migrant family. The couple was trying to gather the money for Ms. Pi\u00f1ero\u2019s plane ticket back to Venezuela, which deportees are required to pay. They would send it through a third party to avoid being discovered themselves.One evening last month, Mr. Bello was alone, wondering if the promise of Cura\u00e7ao had been worth the damage to his family.\u201cOnly God knows the sacrifice one makes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut fine. This is life.\u201dHer daughter, Ms. Bello, was angry.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad because we hope we will arrive in one piece,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then suddenly, after a journey so long, they catch you. And just send you back to Venezuela.\u201d\u201cJust imagine the despair my mother is in,\u201d she added. \u201cShe has no money. Now she may have to sell her house. What a crazy thing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Roger Bello and Yaisbel, the woman who is pregnant with his child. Mr. Bello is her boyfriend, not her husband.An article on Nov. 26 about a diaspora of poorer Venezuelans fleeing poverty and hunger omitted the names of two of the three Caribbean islands that a fleet of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard patrols for refugees. Besides Cura\u00e7ao, the fleet also patrols Aruba and Bonaire. In addition, the article paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Rob Jurriansen, a coast guard officer who heads the fleet. Mr. Jurriansen said his fleet had intercepted just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants \u2014 not boats \u2014 coming to those three islands from all countries, not only Venezuela.Ana Vanessa Herrero and Meridith Kohut contributed reporting from Willemstad and La Vela, Venezuela, and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "London Bridges Are Lighting Up", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosLONDON \u2014 London\u2019s bridges will slowly fill with light as the tide rises. Luminous colors will wash across their surfaces. Beams will shoot out from each bridge, pierce the sky and then drop, connecting with a beam on a neighboring bridge to trace the path of the Thames. The bridges\u2019s underbellies will glow gently; the banks will offer floating stages for performances; waterfalls will create a screen for projections; a weave of projected light planes will hover over the surface of the Thames, creating a ghostly river of light.The six finalists were chosen from 105 entries, including big-name architects, designers, engineers and artists of all stripes from all over the world. The winning team will be announced on Dec. 8, and the organizers hope that the project will be started by 2018.Here is a flavor of what they propose for the Thames.The city\u2019s bridges \u201chave always been conceived of purely as infrastructure between north and south, but they actually encapsulate history and ideas about trade, labor, gender and race,\u201d Mr. Adjaye said. \u201cWe really tried to match the narrative of each bridge with each artist\u2019s practice. I decided not to try for a unified vision; one of the great things about London is that it\u2019s a medieval mosaic city. These are different artistic and architectural languages that come together to create a whole.\u201d\u201cThe idea that you can have an impact on the perception of the city without constructing anything was fascinating to me,\u201d Ms. Levete said. \u201cFor us, the essence of the project is to tell a story about the river and how central it is to people\u2019s lives. In the end, it\u2019s a very simple narrative: the tides are a physical manifestation of the shape of the earth and the landmass of the U.K., and we want to reveal this through light.\u201cThe tidal range of the Thames is around 9 meters, the height of a three-story building, which is very unusual for a river in a city,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe want to illuminate the shoreline as the tide goes out, inviting the public to appropriate that space at low tide. At high tide, the lighting shifts to illuminate the elevation of the bridges and show their structure.\u201cIn the space of two hours, you see the tidal change; we want to remind people that their lives play out not in minutes and hours, but in the context of centuries, and the forces of nature,\u201d she said.\u201cWe came up with the idea of concentrating on the performance of the lighting,\u201d said Elizabeth Diller, a founding partner. \u201cIt starts when the sun goes down; as it sets, the bridges start to fill with light, from the embankments towards the center. The moment that a particular degree of darkness arrives, it triggers the \u2018night kiss,\u2019 a vertical light pointed at the sky. This happens in tiny increments because the rotation of the earth means the moment of darkness is about 20 seconds apart from bridge to bridge. There is a pause, then soft white light comes up on each bridge, like a blossom.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re imagining the moment of the beams going up a bit like the chiming of Big Ben; a moment of urban consciousness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to pay attention to the transition between day and night, and to evoke a collectivity that is missing in our urban lifestyle.\u201dThis Paris-based lighting firm, working with the artist Federico Pietrella, proposes subtle washes of light over the bridges and along their underbellies, with lights triggered by sunset and sunrise. Different styles of lampposts from around the world would be partly submerged in the water, symbolizing London as a place for international exchange.\u201cWhen you walk along the river, you can see that every borough has its own aesthetic, which is very different to a more homogeneously designed city like Paris,\u201d said Joseph Frey, one of the partners of the firm. \u201cOur first intention is to clean up the light pollution along the Thames path; buildings are lit very differently depending on where you are, and we would try to persuade the stakeholders that it\u2019s a question of contrast; there is no point spending a lot of energy and money to light the river if it\u2019s not visually readable.\u201cThere is approximately a minute of light difference, when the sun rises or sets, between the outermost bridges; we wanted to show the natural rhythms of the day, which of course are totally different in winter or summer,\u201d he said.Sam Jacob, a London-based architect, and Simon Heijdens, a Dutch artist, have a poetic proposal that embodies the title of \u201cIlluminated River\u201d: a shimmering river of light hovering just above the surface of the Thames, created from light planes that are generated by data readings of the river\u2019s depth, flow and surface tension.\u201cIt was hard to think what you could possibly do on that scale that would respect the variety and detail of the London riverscape and withstand the scale of the city,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cLondon is a strange city, it has never been planned and doesn\u2019t have an urban principle, but the river is the one unifying factor.\u201dMr. Heijdens added: \u201cIt\u2019s such a narrative surface: where you are, what time it is, what the weather is like. But most of that is lost at night when the Thames becomes a black hole. So we created a dimensional weave of light from flows of data from the river that are measured by a small unit on each bridge, and powered by the tides.\u201d\u201cWe wanted to create something cohesive to unify the bridges and create a ribbon of light,\u201d Mr. Villareal said. \u201cWe also wanted to create a better atmosphere around the Thames, where there is a lot of commercial lighting, so we have proposals for tuning that light. We would replace much of the current bridge lighting with LED light, which makes it more energy efficient and adds dynamism through light and color.\u201cI sometimes make monochromatic pieces, but here it felt appropriate to use color,\u201d he continued. \u201cAn important element of the project is that it references the light and atmosphere of paintings of the bridges by artists like Turner and Monet.\u201dHe added: \u201cLighting the undersides of the bridges is also important; working with structure and finding a way to augment what exists is at the heart of this. These kinds of public art gestures are a gift and can be transformative; they have the power to bring people together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Markets Are Really Telling Us About a Trump Presidency", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsOops.So what are the markets really telling us about global investors\u2019 perceptions of what the future holds during the Trump administration?The message that comes through after a careful reading of the data is this: Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises cut in the direction of higher economic growth and corporate profits. He envisions lower taxes on business, fewer regulations of all sorts and a burst of infrastructure spending. That may or may not help the overall economy, but it would definitely enhance the bottom lines of major companies, justifying the buoyant optimism evident in the stock market.And if Mr. Trump follows through on his promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, it would undermine the economic model of companies that rely on immigrants, including those in the agriculture and service industries.Essentially, markets are signaling that investors think the Trump administration will follow through more completely on the plans that are positives for growth profits and will be more cautious on those policies that are negatives. One way to interpret moves over the months and years ahead is as a continuing set of wagers over which set of policies the Trump administration will pursue with most vigor.In his election night victory speech, for example, Mr. Trump mentioned his intention to \u201crebuild highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d and to put millions to work doing it, but did not mention trade agreements or deportation. And the names that have floated around of potential Trump administration officials include many businesspeople and politicians who are historically more about cutting taxes and regulation than about resetting trade deals.Even if we knew exactly how all of the policies Mr. Trump campaigned on were going to be implemented, it\u2019s hard to know what the net result would be for corporate profits and interest rates.It would most likely vary widely among industries. Lighter environment regulations would be great for the energy sector. Major banks stand to become more profitable, given his transition team\u2019s promise to \u201cdismantle\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act. Trade-dependent companies, of course, have more to lose from a trade war.Markets are already pricing in exactly those dynamics. Since Tuesday, shares of the mega-bank JPMorgan Chase are up more than 8 percent. Shares of Apple are down about 2 percent.And it is even more clear when you look to international currencies. Most notably, the Mexican peso is down a whopping 12 percent against the dollar since Tuesday\u2019s close, which reflects fears that the looming renegotiation of trade relations between the two countries will damage Mexico\u2019s growth rate (though the drop in the currency will be a short-term boon to Mexican exporters).But when all the positive and negative effects of the Trump agenda are tallied up, the net result is that investors, today at least, are betting the positives will prove more substantial.That doesn\u2019t mean that the relatively sunny prediction implied by the first couple of days of trading activity will necessarily prove correct over time. Markets are particularly bad at pricing in seismic events that are hard to predict with confidence.For example, in 2007, a global credit crisis began in August, and there were signals everywhere that it could ultimately prove disruptive to the global financial system. Yet the stock market actually peaked two months later. The deepest recession in modern times began in December of that year, and stocks ultimately plummeted.In other words, if the Trump administration is going to be economically disastrous, the markets would not necessarily reflect that today.And after so much inaccurate prognostication about what the near-term market effects of a Trump victory would be, having some modesty about our ability to predict how his policies will play out in the years ahead is very much in order.Advertisement"}

We received more than 800 responses.

Many others discussed security issues. And some people of color and women raised questions about how Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory language might change discourse worldwide and possibly lead to more hate crimes.Here is a selection of the responses; they have been edited and condensed, and some have been translated into English.\u201cTrump\u2019s antiterror policies might give Pakistan a jolt and help us curb terror and save many hundreds of lives that are lost to these terrorists from across the border.\u201dKartikey, India\u201cThe impact shall be likely on the scaling down of humanitarian aid.\u201dSimon Ruwuke Hove, Zimbabwe\u201cI think the most tangible is that we as NATO allies should start to take our own security more serious.

In my opinion the attitude toward Russia has been way too negative here in Europe. Of course, there are a lot of problems with Russia not being a democracy and all, but that big country in the East has been in far worse condition and extremely more dangerous in the past than it is now.\u201dSven Jans, Sweden\u201cI hope he can apply his skill in bullying people this time for good \u2014 and his own place in history \u2014 by getting Netanyahu and the Palestinians to make peace for their people\u2019s future and the world\u2019s stability.

She is, unlike Mr. Obama, an interventionist, who would have inflamed international tensions, leaving Germany (and Europe) in an acid test between the West and East, facing armament.\u201dChristian Weidner, Germany\u201cI think it brings hard time and aggression from Washington as Mr. Trump is unpredictable.\u201dKhawar Mehmood, Pakistan\u201cIt will be good for Europe, once President Trump is clear about his policy in fighting ISIS alongside Russia, holding a strong position in the region just like Russia, by doing the right thing, killing terrorists.\u201dMaria da Gra\u00e7a, Portugal\u201cHis plan to send back migrants will have a very deep impact in the social and economic conditions of my home country, place of origin of thousands of migrant workers.\u201dOtton Solis, Costa Rica\u201cIt has already take down the value of our currency.\u201dJose Franco, Mexico\u201cHeads of state who succeed in generating wealth are rare.

China is easily Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, and a lot of our economic prosperity rests on stable relations with them.\u201dJames King, Australia\u201cTrump has called Nafta a disaster, the worst trade deal ever. Presumably, he will revoke it, or try to renegotiate its terms. Trade deals don\u2019t work as zero-sum equations. Nafta works because it has benefited all three of our North American economies. The Canadian market for consumer goods is relatively small and spread out along an east-west axis. If north-south trade is disrupted in both manufactured goods and agricultural products, the impact on the Canadian economy will be devastating.\u201dWally Seccombe, Canada\u201cOur economy might benefit if Trump and the Republicans manage to get the Keystone XL pipeline built.

{"Headline": "How Narendra Modi of India Plans to Wipe Out \u2018Black Money\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 In one of the most audacious experiments in India\u2019s modern history, Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the two largest bills \u2014 of 500 rupees, or about $7.50, and 1,000 rupees \u2014 which account for about 86 percent of the currency in a country where 78 percent of financial transactions are done in cash.Why did the government remove the bills from circulation?The idea was to expose and penalize people holding huge amounts of cash they could not account for, primarily money on which taxes have not been paid. Most of the so-called black money is held in 500- and 1,000-rupee notes. Someone who goes to a bank or post office with more than 250,000 rupees in cash, or about $3,700, has to explain the source of the money to the tax authorities.People who can explain how they earned the money and show that taxes were paid can keep it. But those without a good explanation will have to answer to the tax authorities.Isn\u2019t that disruptive?It is. Overnight, people found themselves lacking the currency for basic transactions, like buying food, fuel and other necessities. Retail businesses came to a standstill because people hoarded the little cash they had for food and other needed supplies.To avoid tipping off tax cheats, the government did not print the new bills until after the announcement, nor did it recalibrate automated teller machines to dispense the new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes. Long lines formed at the few A.T.M.s that were operating, and many ran out of bills, infuriating those who had stood in line for hours.We want to hear from those living in India on Mr. Modi\u2019s move, and the impact it has had on you and your family.Since then, the printing presses have churned out more than $40 billion in currency, but the government was initially forced to limit A.T.M. withdrawals to 2,000 rupees, or about $30, at a time. The limits are now 2,500 rupees per A.T.M. withdrawal and 24,000 a week from a bank. The government says it will take three weeks to recalibrate India\u2019s estimated 200,000 A.T.M.s.Is black money really that big a problem?Unaccounted-for cash, or black money, is a huge problem for the country, because it keeps money out of banks where it could be lent to others, helping businesses grow and driving economic growth. Black money also sharply reduces the taxes collected by the government, and hence services available to the public.About a third of business in India is done with black money. In a heavily regulated economy, businessmen frequently bribe government officials into giving them licenses and other approvals. Government officials invest much of this money in real estate, then understate the amount they actually paid. So not only is the property purchased with black money, but the sellers pay less tax than they should because the prices have been understated. Routine transactions, like paying a hairdresser, are largely carried out off the books to avoid paying taxes.Economists say that in order to work, the plan has to inflict enough pain on tax avoiders that they change their behavior. If people are motivated to keep their money in banks, more will be available for lending and people will become accustomed to paying taxes.But because many poor Indians do not have bank accounts or credit cards, the government could not dispense altogether with cash. If the public continues to hold most of its savings in the new notes, India may well find itself dealing with the same problem. Regardless, most economists believe that wiping out black money will also require an aggressive approach on the endemic bribery that propels the system.Will Mr. Modi pay a political price?Indians have exhibited remarkable patience with the currency ban, but only on the promise that it will actually accomplish what he says it will and the government can quickly get the new bills into circulation. The government is working feverishly to distribute them, but lines and public frustration are growing.As business has been strangled by a lack of bills for routine transactions, there has even been concern that the currency ban will slow the economy.If the inconvenience continues for more than a few days, public support for Mr. Modi could turn to fury toward him. And the ban could end up substantially damaging Mr. Modi\u2019s own promise of jobs and economic development.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Ruling Could Cause Britain to Drag Its Feet, Muddying E.U. Plans", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byThe ruling by Britain\u2019s High Court \u2014 that she must gain Parliament\u2019s approval to begin the process of withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit \u2014 raised the possibility that negotiations could drag on far past Mrs. May\u2019s deadline of the end of March.That poses problems not only for the British prime minister but also for the political establishment on the Continent, where, among other things, France and Germany are heading toward important elections, with populist parties gaining strength.The European Union was already struggling with a witches\u2019 brew of problems: low economic growth; high joblessness; uncertainty in the eurozone, with Greece again in economic difficulties and questions about the soundness of Italian banks; a crackdown in Turkey; and an aggressive Russia. Immigration from the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan, seemingly under control earlier this year, is on the rise once again.Looming over all of this are the growing populist, nationalist and far-right movements in core European Union countries like France, Germany and the Netherlands, not to speak of newer members like Hungary and Poland.Nor has faith in the European Union been helped by recent embarrassments, like the hangup on the trade deal with Canada. That led Peter Ziga, the Slovak economy minister, to wonder, \u201cIf we don\u2019t agree with Canada, with whom will we agree?\u201dCecilia Malmstrom, the bloc\u2019s trade commissioner, went further, saying with a smile, \u201cIf we can\u2019t make it with Canada, I\u2019m not sure we can make it with the U.K.\u201dThe European Union found a way to buy off the Walloons, a tactic it often relies on when under great pressure. But few think lurching from crisis to crisis without addressing fundamental problems is any way to manage an alliance of 28 nations that share important aspects of sovereignty including, for 19 of them, a single currency.And then there is the vexed, complicated problem of Britain and its exit after more than 40 years, which few European countries either expected or wanted. Like the guest at a party who overstays his welcome, Britain and its internal psychodrama are getting on the nerves of its European partners, who fear further economic and political uncertainty to add to the already unhappy mix.The British government and the ruling Conservative Party are deeply divided about what kind of relationship they want with the European Union, apparently having forgotten that the other 27 nations must unanimously agree to any new deal, and what Britain wants is not entirely the point.That remains Mrs. May\u2019s stated goal. But the High Court decision \u2014 which the government is appealing to the Supreme Court \u2014 has created the potential for months more delay, as well as the prospect that Parliament might lay down negotiating parameters that could make the talks even more difficult.That would mean compromising on immigration, which is anathema to hard-line supporters of Brexit in her party and right-wing nationalists. The haggling could go on for some time.On Friday, in telephone calls with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, Mrs. May said she was confident she would meet the March deadline and that the government would win in the Supreme Court, which will hear the case in early December.But not everyone is so sure, and the timing matters. The bloc\u2019s leaders want Britain out before elections for the European Parliament, scheduled for 2019, and to allow for planning a new European Union budget. Mrs. May\u2019s original timetable works for that, but it is no longer certain she can deliver on her promises. And no one really knows how to handle, or budget for, a Britain that is not yet out but does not want to be in.In Berlin on Friday, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, \u201cDragging things out won\u2019t serve anyone.\u201dHe warned Britain against expecting special treatment and urged for negotiations to start as soon as possible.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cTwo years sounds at first like a lot of time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you look at the complexity, two years is comparatively short.\u201dMr. Johnson, who backed Brexit, said that Britain would leave the bloc but remain a part of Europe. But the future balance of the relationship remains extremely unclear.As a measure of Britain\u2019s febrile political mood, the largely right-wing British press, which mostly supports Mrs. May, attacked the three High Court judges for being \u201cout of touch\u201d and seeking to undermine the popular referendum in favor of Brexit. One paper, the popular and often rabid Daily Mail, had a huge headline under photographs of the judges, reading, \u201cEnemies of the People.\u201dEven the more staid Daily Telegraph headlined its front page: \u201cThe judges versus the people.\u201d With that was a front-page column by Nigel Farage, the leader of the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, saying that the court ruling means that \u201ca great betrayal is underway.\u201dEven though Mr. Farage and the \u201cLeave\u201d camp won the referendum handily, 52 percent to 48 percent, many, like him, are obsessed with the idea that Mrs. May is feigning support for Brexit and that the government, Parliament, the judges and \u201cthe elite\u201d will betray the more than 17 million voters who wanted out of the European Union.It is an obvious irony that one prime reason they had for supporting Brexit was to restore the full sovereignty of Parliament, a stance taken by the judges, too, but inconveniently now, because it might slow down Britain\u2019s exit.Mrs. May also faced criticism from another front on Friday, when a Conservative member of Parliament, Stephen Phillips, who supported Brexit but has accused her government of trying to sideline Parliament, resigned his seat.With a small majority in Parliament, Mrs. May is being urged by some, including The Times of London, to call an early election to win her own mandate and increase her majority at a time when the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties are weak.She has vowed not to have an election before its scheduled date of 2020, but if Parliament creates too many difficulties and delays for her, she may have no choice.Reporting was contributed by Stephen Castle from London, Alison Smale and Katarina Johannsen from Berlin, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}

But she seemed oblivious, moving nimbly around the cabin in search of her outdoor seat cushions.\u201cOh, this is nothing,\u201d she said, popping her strawberry-blond head out of the hatch. \u201cSometimes I roll!\u201dMs. Clegg, who is 83, started living on a boat in 1987, at the age of 54. She had been residing in a large rent-regulated studio on 75th Street near Columbus Avenue since the late 1960s, paying just $300 a month. But after new owners bought the building and moved aggressively to vacate it \u2014 they even sent a private detective to Albany where she was stage-managing a theater company one winter, she said \u2014 she decided a buyout was preferable to being trailed every time she left town. She received $23,000 and a year to leave.She funneled the money into building her boat, the JFS Salignac, which cost about $90,000, designing a two-masted schooner that she could sail alone and lining it in mahogany \u2014 Honduran, as opposed to Brazilian. \u201cI wanted it more red so that it would be cheery,\u201d she said.Ms. Clegg, who was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and spent part of her childhood in England, learned to sail in the early \u201850s in Egypt, on the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal Zone, while serving as a wireless operator in the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service.But it wasn\u2019t until she began working as a facility manager for ABC production services during the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo that she seriously contemplated living on a boat. On the last night of the games she met a fellow sailer and master shipwright. Making the rounds with a bottle of Champagne, she opened the door to the broadcast center\u2019s engineering room and saw a man seated before a picture of his schooner. They started talking, polished off the Champagne and began a friendship that led, several years later, to their sailing their two schooners in company on the waters around New York (his had white sails, hers tanbark).\u201cI decided it would be nice to have something permanent,\u201d Ms. Clegg said, insisting that it had never occurred to her that she wouldn\u2019t like living aboard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t living on board that I was worried about. It was where the boat was going to be.\u201dShe first found a slip at a Tarrytown marina, but had to leave in 1987 when the marina was dredged. Luckily, the dockmaster at the 79th Street Boat Basin agreed to give her a spot for the winter at $250 a month. It was poorly sheltered, though \u2014 on the outside of the northernmost dock, right next to the icebreakers.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I went to an English boarding school,\u201d Ms. Clegg said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get the heater working.\u201d A neighbor\u2019s nightly dinner invitations to a boat with a functional heater spared her from hypothermia. She remembers trying to get the neighbor\u2019s guinea pig off its heated pad so that she could sit on it herself.These days she has her own electric blanket and pays dockage fees of $4,680 for the summer season, May through October, or $780 a month. Dockage fees run $120 per linear foot in the summer, $105 in the winter, and Ms. Clegg\u2019s schooner is 39 feet length over all. It is 10 feet 8 inches wide, with a nearly 24-foot-long cabin that has ceilings 6 feet 2 inches high.Despite being offshore from the Upper West Side, Ms. Clegg said she feels like part of the neighborhood. \u201cI do all my shopping between Zabar\u2019s in the north and Fairway in the south,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be any more Upper West Side than that.\u201dThree winters ago, for economy\u2019s sake, she started spending the winter at Lincoln Harbor Yacht Club in Weehawken, N.J., where dockage runs only $45 a foot, bringing the cost down to $293 a month \u2014 exclusive of what she spends on boat upkeep.She keeps dock boxes for storage on both sides of the river, which prevent her small space from becoming too cluttered. \u201cI always find it hard to get rid of clothes,\u201d she said, pointing to the V-berth in the bow, where she sleeps, half of which has been given over to storage for her \u201cold, old, treasured clothing.\u201dWhen it comes to dining, Ms. Clegg boasts that she is \u201cthe foremost practitioner of cooking on the Foreman Grill,\u201d but occasionally uses a kerosene stove.What the boat lacks in creature comforts is more than made up for in the freedom it affords. \u201cTheoretically, at least, it\u2019s very easy to go sailing,\u201d she said.Email: renters@nytimes.comName: Jane CleggAge: 83Occupation: Retired.

{"Headline": "Global Markets Plummet on Rising Odds of Trump Victory", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byGlobal ShockDonald J. Trump\u2019s surprisingly strong showing in the presidential race is throwing global financial markets into disarray.In effect, markets had priced in a Hillary Clinton victory in Monday and Tuesday\u2019s sessions, reflecting a firming of her position in polling. But as incoming results made a victory by Mr. Trump look increasingly probable, a furious reversal took place.The steep drop across global markets as a Trump victory became more likely suggested that investors believe that the global risk premium \u2014 the compensation investors demand for all the varied risks around future economic and financial conditions \u2014 had risen. It suggests that if Mr. Trump prevails there could be global financial ripple effects.Asian stock markets plummeted, as did futures on major stock indexes covering the United States and Europe, including a 4.8 percent drop in Japan\u2019s Nikkei index as of 11 p.m. Eastern. United States Treasury bonds, typically a safe haven, rallied, pushing long-term interest rates sharply lower. The dollar was down 1.4 percent against other major currencies as of late evening, by which point Mr. Trump\u2019s victory appeared probable in The Upshot\u2019s election model.There was a particularly steep sell-off in the Mexican peso, which had the steepest drop against the dollar since the country\u2019s 1994-1995 currency crisis. The Mexican currency has consistently dropped when Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects improved in recent weeks, suggesting global investors believe that a Trump administration \u2014 with its threats of renegotiating trade agreements \u2014 would spell bad news for the country\u2019s economic outlook.The price of gold shot upward. Gold is often a defensive play by investors whose fears about the economy are building. Surging higher than $1,330 an ounce, gold had the biggest upward movement since the unexpected Brexit vote in Britain in June.The swings across global markets suggest that investors believe a Trump presidency will be a deeply uncertain time for the global economy, and even that some of the fundamental underpinnings of global commerce could come into question.Analysts have suggested that there are companies that could win in a Trump administration, benefiting from promises of lower corporate taxes and lighter regulation. But on the flip side, trade wars, a hard-line stance against international outsourcing and restrictions on immigration could prove bad for the bottom line for many United States companies.Markets hate uncertainty, and few people are certain of what a Trump administration would do.That said, market reactions can be volatile and overreact to the fundamentals of a situation. In June, when British voters elected to leave the European Union, global stock markets immediately sold off before stabilizing, and are now higher than before the vote.But in the case of Brexit, there is still evidence that the economic consequences will be long-lasting, with Britain\u2019s currency sharply below its levels before the vote, to around $1.25 compared with more than $1.50 on the eve of the vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Shocking Success", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byJust days ago I was in Ohio. I was talking to Republicans, and this was the refrain I kept hearing: Donald Trump is throwing this election away. He has no real campaign here. No get-out-the-vote operation. No ground game. Nothing that signifies or befits a truly serious presidential candidate.These Republicans thought that he\u2019d win the state \u2014 barely. But they didn\u2019t think that he could snatch victories in some of the other places that he did on Tuesday, or draw so close to Hillary Clinton elsewhere, or compete so tightly in the election over all. It was done, over, finished.She had the best experts that money could buy, the most sophisticated data operation that the smartest wonks could put together, and the dutiful troops who went door to door, handing out \u201cStronger Together\u201d literature and pleading her case.He had his hair and his ego.And yet Donald Trump was just elected the 45th president of the United States, soon to take a seat at the most important desk in the most august office in the most consequential residence of the world. Yes, Donald Trump. That gale-force sigh of relief you heard was Chris Christie\u2019s. That demonic cackle of glee was Rudy Giuliani\u2019s.That shriek of horror was mine.Trump defied the predictions of pundits and pollsters, more than a few of whom foresaw an Electoral College landslide for Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s what their numbers told them.But that\u2019s not what America had to say.On Election Day, Trump did what he had throughout his surreal campaign: exploded the traditional assumptions, upended the usual expectations and forced us to look afresh at the accepted truisms and hoary clich\u00e9s of our political life. There are important lessons to learn and crucial questions to ask.Democrats are in the same position that Republicans were when Trump romped to their party\u2019s nomination, which they were convinced for so long he could never get. They need to look seriously at the way they do business and how they arrived at this surprising, humbling destination.Are the unglamorous, tedious approaches to rounding up votes as powerful as the booming voice of a celebrity with hours of free television time and millions of rapt Twitter followers? Does the imprimatur of the establishment and a towering stack of endorsements and a bulging retinue of pop stars and Hollywood actors make any difference when there\u2019s a fury out there that you haven\u2019t fully and earnestly tried to understand? Does accurate polling lag behind the nature of contemporary American life?And is a party being remotely realistic \u2014 or entirely reckless \u2014 to try to sell a candidate who personifies the status quo to an electorate that\u2019s clearly hungry for some kind of shock to the system?There was an arrogance and foolishness to lining up behind Hillary Clinton as soon as so many Democratic leaders did, and to putting all their chips on her.She fit the circumstances of 2016 awkwardly, in the same way that Jeb Bush did.She was a profoundly flawed candidate unable to make an easy connection with voters. She was forever surrounded by messes: some of her own making, some blown out of proportion by the news media, all of them exhausting to voters who had lived through a quarter century of political melodrama with her.She never found a pithy, pointed message. One Ohio resident noted to me that while Clinton\u2019s campaign workers showed up at his doorstep several times a week, they dropped off pamphlets dense with the rationale for her candidacy, the policies she\u2019d espouse, the promises she was making.To read it was a commitment, and you couldn\u2019t reduce to one sentence, or even two, what the meaning of her candidacy was.It\u2019s insane that a pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d works better, because the vow is so starry-eyed and pat. But it\u2019s concise. Digestible. It takes emotion into account. Democrats in general and Clinton in particular aren\u2019t always good at that.The party had a night so miserable that its leaders cannot chalk it up to the Russians or to James Comey, though there will be plenty of talk about that, much of it warranted. They had a gorgeous chance to retake their Senate majority, and not only did they fail to do so, but Democratic candidates who were thought to be in tight races lost by significant margins.Clinton struggled more than had been predicted in the so-called Rust Belt \u2014 states like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 in yet another illustration of how disaffected working-class white men had become and how estranged from a new economy and a new age they felt.Their anger was the story of the primaries, the fuel not just for Trump\u2019s campaign but for Bernie Sanders\u2019s as well. And it manifested itself in the general election. Both parties are going to have to reckon with it.And they should. If this were all that Trump had shown us, we\u2019d owe him our thanks.But there are darker implications here, too. After all the lies he told, all the fantasy he indulged in, all the hate he spewed and all the divisions he sharpened, he was rewarded with the highest office in the land. What does that portend for the politics of the next few years, for the kinds of congressional candidates we\u2019ll see in 2018, for the presidential race of 2020?I can\u2019t bear to think about the conflagrations to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bottom Line: How State Budget Cuts Affect Your Education", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byPlight of the Public UHigher education has been an easy target for budget cuts since the 2008 recession, forcing many public universities to lay off faculty and staff members, postpone investment in new facilities and raise tuition and fees (up an average 31 percent for in-state students). State support for public two- and four-year colleges \u2014 funding is nearly $10 billion below what it was just before the recession \u2014 has begun to recover, though officials at the nation\u2019s flagship universities say that doing more with less is the new norm. Some are even finding fresh ways to ease the financial burden on students.Percentages indicate changes since 2008: in per-student state spending on higher education, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and in tuition/fees, adjusted for inflation._____Purdue isn\u2019t counting on state investment to help reduce student debt. This fall, it\u2019s hedging its bets with an income-share program in which students are treated like, well, investments. About 150 juniors and seniors received an average of $14,000 in financial aid up front from Purdue\u2019s research foundation; after graduation, they\u2019ll pay back a share of their earnings for a set period, agreed upon in advance. Once that repayment period has passed, any remaining debt is forgiven. One catch: For investors to be willing to front tuition money, there has to be a payoff for them. Graduates with higher incomes will pay back more than they were given. Still, that might be less than those pesky interest payments on loans.____________________Falling oil prices and fewer students mean trouble for the University of New Mexico, which this year faces another round of state cuts that could top $30 million. But officials are cutting a deal for students who tone down the partying and hit the books. If you take a full load of courses each semester and stay on track to graduate in four years, you get a tuition discount and your last semester of classes is free. It\u2019s led to a revenue loss of $3 million to $4 million since 2013 (when students earn their diplomas more quickly, they pay for fewer semesters). \u201cThat\u2019s a catch-22 for us,\u201d the president, Robert G. Frank, said. But \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to be doing for our state.\u201d While still grim, the university\u2019s four-year grad rate is up, from 15 percent in 2012 to just under 20 percent.____________________What could you do with an extra $2,094 in your pocket? With the economy healthy, lawmakers reduced in-state tuition at the University of Washington both last year and this year \u2014 by 15 percent total \u2014 and increased state funding substantially. Tuition cuts look good when politicians are running for re-election, said Randy Hodgins, U.W.\u2019s vice president for external affairs. \u201cAfter 30 years in this business, it\u2019s really nice to see higher education at the top of the agenda.\u201d_____After lawmakers voted last year to water down faculty tenure protections and cut the Madison campus\u2019s budget, creating an $86 million deficit, some foresaw a faculty exodus that would force officials to fill the void with an army of underpaid adjuncts and grad students. Did that happen? During the 2016 fiscal year, 144 professors told university officials they were considering other positions and requested counteroffers, about 40 percent more than the previous year, according to Sarah C. Mangelsdorf, the provost. The university managed to keep most of them, but officials had to give out $23.6 million in raises and research support. At least 34 faculty members have left in the past year._____Sarah Brown is a reporter for The Chronicle of Higher Education.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oil Industry\u2019s New Threat? The Global Growth of Electric Cars", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byOSLO \u2014 \u201cThe Scream\u201d was screaming, as usual, from the wall of the Edvard Munch museum one recent day. Out in the parking lot, Pal Valsgard wore a milder expression\u2014 a trace of impatience \u2014 as he gazed at his electric car.He brushed away raindrops. Minutes ticked by as he waited by a green kiosk for the car to take a big gulp of power.Mr. Valsgard was no technophile, just an English teacher trying to get his family to the airport for a jaunt to London, and he was running a little late. Nowadays, in this chic capital city, plugging an electric car into a shiny charging station is a routine experience, if a bit time-consuming.Norway, one of the world\u2019s leading oil producers, has become an unlikely proving ground for the proposition that electric cars are ready for prime time. Because of big tax breaks, they have come out of nowhere to seize a third of the new-car market in just five years. Politicians and business leaders from all over the world are trekking to this city to see if the trend is real.Over the summer, leaders of Volkswagen, the German carmaker caught up in an emissions-cheating scandal, visited this very parking lot without fanfare to watch the action at the charging kiosk, announcing weeks later that electrification would be their recovery strategy. The company is promising 20 new models of electric cars by 2020.Norway is a tiny country, just five million people, but the success of electric cars here is bringing a big question into focus. Could the world\u2019s transportation system be on the verge of a disruption, one that could slow the growth of oil demand and eventually reverse it?That question is not just profound, it is urgent. Nations have pledged to fight global warming, which means sharply paring emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by midcentury, just over three decades away.If that is to be achieved, some studies suggest, there will be no place for cars burning gasoline or diesel. They will have to run on electricity, or possibly another alternative fuel, and the electric system itself will have to become much cleaner.The studies suggest that electric cars must begin to take the majority of the world\u2019s new-car market in the 2030s, becoming the default choice for most families. Leading oil companies and oil-producing states \u2014 Norway excepted \u2014 have been vocal in arguing that it will not happen.As a business strategy, in other words, the big oil companies are counting on political leaders failing to meet their stated goals for limiting climate change. The stock market seems to be betting with the oil companies.But out on the roads of several countries, things are getting interesting.They are getting so interesting, in fact, that several countries \u2014 including Norway, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 are talking, however tentatively, about the possibility of banning the sale of new fuel-burning cars. If enacted, such bans would likely not take effect until 2030.That fast growth is occurring from a tiny base, though, and the cars still represent far less than 1 percent of all cars on the road. Still, if such rapid growth were to continue, it is not hard to see how the cars could become a disruptive force within a few years. \u201cThese technology disruptions seem like they are not going to happen at all, and then they happen so fast you can\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Rami Syvari, head of international sales for Fortum Charge & Drive, which is racing to install car chargers in Norway.Owners of electric cars, even as they acknowledge some problems and a bit of a learning curve, tend to gush with enthusiasm, saying the cars are inherently cleaner, mechanically simpler, easier to maintain and more fun to drive than fuel-burning cars.The vehicles have one huge problem, though: the battery that makes them possible. The limitations of available battery technology mean that the range of the cars has been limited, typically to less than 100 miles, or 160 kilometers.But as the market grows, innovation in batteries seems to be taking off. Economies of scale are kicking in. A wave of new cars is coming over the next couple of years, with the manufacturers promising big improvements.For instance, General Motors is on the verge of shipping the Bolt, a sporty-looking hatchback with a promised range of 238 miles. That is four solid hours of highway driving.The new cars are expected to cost below $40,000, or 36,000 euros, and in the United States, federal and state tax credits for electric cars will in many places push that below $30,000. Leases are expected to be available at $200 a month, and electricity in most places is far cheaper than an equivalent amount of gasoline.But things are moving fast enough that the possibility of a real disruption can no longer be dismissed out of hand.\u201cIn an extreme scenario where electric cars gained a 50 percent market share over 10 years, about a quarter of European gasoline demand could disappear,\u201d Fitch analysts said in the report.In the United States and abroad, there are signs that a significant fraction of the public wants to give the cars a try.Still, the hurdles for electric cars are enormous. Even if the cars improve as rapidly as the manufacturers are promising, large countries like the United States still have work to do to make them a practical option.At the top of this trouble list is the chicken-or-egg problem of chargers. Because not enough people own electric cars, not enough public charging stations have been installed, which discourages people from buying the cars.But Norway is battling its way out of this problem, with public money as well as heavy private investment going to put up fast charging stations the length and breadth of the country. California is making headway, too. New York is about to make a serious push on electric cars and chargers, and Massachusetts is already doing so.In Norway, as elsewhere, the people already buying electric cars tend to have garages where they can charge at night. That usually gives them enough range for daily commuting. The problem is long trips, and the answer is fast chargers that can inject 50 or 100 miles\u2019 worth of electricity in under 30 minutes.It definitely takes longer than gassing up a regular car would. The drivers say you get used to that. The time required is about what you would need to stop for a leisurely coffee, or perhaps a fast-food meal. In Norway, this has not been lost on McDonald\u2019s.The company is offering its parking lots for the installation of charging kiosks, drawing a high-end clientele into the restaurants. \u201cIt\u2019s fast food and a fast charge,\u201d said Jan Haugen Ihle, the Norway manager for Fortum Charge & Drive, the company installing the big green kiosks.It was at one of those kiosks the other day, outside the Munch Museum in a district called Toyengata, that the English teacher, Mr. Valsgard, was topping up his battery. Earlier, he had stopped by a McDonald\u2019s to charge up, only to find the charger broken.This sort of thing has been a problem, Mr. Ihle acknowledged. As electric car sales zoom in Norway, the chargers are in such heavy use that some of them do not stand up to the wear and tear. His firm has been pressing its suppliers to upgrade to heavy-duty components.The charging delay accounted for Mr. Valsgard\u2019s anxiety, as he was rushing to pick up his family and catch a flight. But afterward, by email, he reported good news. \u201cI made it to the airport, and everything went fine,\u201d he wrote.For drivers like him, the interest in electric cars in Norway has been driven by big tax breaks, along with lots of small perquisites, like free tolls and the ability to use reserved freeway lanes. In countries with the fastest increase of electric cars, the tax breaks are about $15,000 per car.The United States is not so generous, offering a $7,500 federal credit, but states like California are adding to that, so that the total incentives in some places are around $10,000 per car.The need for the breaks would likely be temporary, given the rapid drop in battery costs. And as word starts to spread, people get enthusiastic about the cars. That has certainly been the experience of Ms. Skauge, the owner of the driving school here.\u201cI have to tell you that four of my pupils, they have bought the same car after driving our Nissan Leaf,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working as a driving teacher for 20 years, and I\u2019ve never seen this kind of interest in a car.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of the Postracial Myth", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Of course, that post-racial dream did not last long, and nothing epitomizes the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that belief more than the election last week of Donald J. Trump. As I watched my home state of Iowa join the red flood that overtook the electoral map last Tuesday, I asked myself the same questions that so many others did: What happened? Why had states that reliably backed Obama \u2014 states like Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 flipped Republican?I was struck by how quickly white pundits sought to tamp down assertions that race had anything to do with it. It was, it seemed to me, almost a relief to many white Americans that Trump\u2019s victory encompassed so many of the heavily white places that voted for a black man just years before. It was an absolution that let them reassure themselves that Donald Trump\u2019s raucous campaign hadn\u2019t revealed an ugly racist rift after all, that in the end, the discontent that propelled the reality-TV star into the White House was one of class and economic anxiety, not racism.But this analysis reveals less about the electorate than it does about the consistent inability of many white Americans to think about and understand the complex and often contradictory workings of race in this country, and to discuss and elucidate race in a sophisticated, nuanced way.While we tend to talk about racism in absolute terms \u2014 you\u2019re either racist or you\u2019re not \u2014 racism and racial anxiety have always existed on a spectrum. For historians who have studied race in the United States, the change from blue to red in heavily white areas is not surprising. In fact, it was entirely predictable. \u201cThere are times when working-class whites, whether rural or urban, will join an interracial alliance to get the short-term gains they want,\u201d Robin Kelley, a history professor at U.C.L.A., told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t ever do it without kicking and screaming.\u201dThe Rev. Jesse Jackson, the first black man to run for president (and second black American, behind Shirley Chisholm), made similar inroads with rural white farmers during his 1984 and 1988 campaigns. This was simply because he reached out to them promising to push policies that would specifically help them, like ending foreclosures on family farms and forgiving their debt. He did not get a majority of this vote, but he got a surprisingly significant portion.Decades later, large numbers of rural and suburban white voters were willing to cast their lot with Obama and his multiracial coalition \u2014 not necessarily out of some sense of racial enlightenment or egalitarianism but because at the time, they saw it as being in their own best interest. Class and economic anxieties did not erase racial ones; they just in that moment transcended them.Even as the recession caused Iowa to shed hundreds of state jobs, Douglas managed to hold onto hers. But in 2012, for the first time in her life, she registered as a Republican, and last week she voted for Trump. Douglas told me she had switched parties because she felt Obama had been irresponsible with spending, causing the national debt to soar. She said Democrats were spending too much on social programs for people who did not need them.\u201cI don\u2019t want to throw Granny out in the snow, and I think the least of our brothers should be taken care of,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think that those who can work should.\u201d Douglas said there was a time in her life where she was struggling, and so she applied for welfare for herself and her young children but was denied. She didn\u2019t think that was fair, but she worked hard and turned her life around. But these days, she said, \u201cI kind of think for some social programs there is no stigma.\u201dDouglas never mentioned race, but polls including a recent one of Trump supporters have shown that white Americans\u2019 support for entitlement programs declines if they think black people are benefiting. And the longer Douglas talked, the more she revealed other reasons she had voted for Trump.When Obama was elected, she hoped he would \u201cbridge race relations, to help people in the middle of Iowa\u201d see that black people \u201care decent hardworking people who want the same things that we want.\u201d She said people in rural Iowa often don\u2019t know many black people and unfairly stereotype them. But Obama really turned her off when after a vigilante killed a black teenager named Trayvon Martin, he said the boy could have been his son. She felt as if Obama was choosing a side in the racial divide, stirring up tensions. And then came the death of Michael Brown, shot by a policeman in Ferguson, Mo.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that the struggles of black Americans aren\u2019t real,\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cbut I feel like the Michael Brown incident was violence against the police officer.\u201dThe Black Lives Matter movement bothered her. Even as an Ivy League-educated, glamorous black couple lived in the White House, masses of black people were blocking highways and staging die-ins in malls, claiming that black people had it so hard. When she voiced her discomfort with that movement, she said, or pointed out that she disagreed with Obama\u2019s policies, some of her more liberal friends on Facebook would call her racist. So, she shut her mouth \u2014 and simmered.\u201cTrump was crass, and he was abrupt,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cBut I felt like he was going to take care of the things that mattered for me, and honestly I was very worried about our country.\u201dThere has never been a moment in America in which black people\u2019s gains have not been perceived by some white Americans as their loss. And history is littered with examples of how economic and racial anxieties can create a wedge with which to destroy interracial political and economic alliances. White supremacists overthrew the biracial fusion party in North Carolina in the late 1800s and, with the support of the white population in the state that had once supported the sharing of power, worked to disenfranchise black North Carolinians and usher in seven decades of Jim Crow. In more modern times, George Wallace was roundly trounced when he ran for governor of Alabama against a racist opponent. Wallace, who had promised \u201cto treat a man fair, regardless of his color,\u201d vowed to never be \u201cout-niggered\u201d again. The next election he rode a segregationist platform right into the governor\u2019s mansion. Similarly, Richard Nixon ran for president the first time as a moderate and lost, but he later found his opening courting white opposition to civil rights with his Southern strategy. It is not incidental that John McCain and Mitt Romney mostly declined to stir up racial tensions in their campaigns against Obama and lost.When Trump inveighed against Mexican rapists and talked of barring Muslims from the country, the baldness of his rhetoric spoke to something deeply seated in the Iowans I talked to. Erin Wright, who worked for the state before quitting to finish a nursing degree, voted for Obama in 2008, and doesn\u2019t remember if she voted at all in 2012; she cast her ballot for Trump last week. Like Douglas, she wasn\u2019t struggling financially but was attracted to Trump\u2019s promise to seal our southern borders and to bar Muslims from entering the country.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of illegal people here, who do take work,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they want to become a citizen, that is super, they should become a citizen. But all the influx of people who come in, they get benefits, they get jobs, and they take them from people who can\u2019t find anything else who have lived here their whole lives.\u201dWhat\u2019s missing from the American conversation on race is the fact that people don\u2019t have to hate black people or Muslims or Latinos to be uncomfortable with them, to be suspicious of them, to fear their ascension as an upheaval of the natural order of things. A smart demagogue plays to those fears under the guise of economic anxieties. Things not as good as you hoped? These folks are the reason. Kelley, the historian, said white Americans have ignored race when it serves them and defaulted to it when it suits them. \u201cWe think of interest as an objective thing that floats above, but it is subjective,\u201d he said. \u201cRace always plays a role. It never disappears.\u201dThe miracle Obama worked in 2008 and 2012 was to stitch together, at least in part, the racial lines that have always fractured this country. What we saw last week was those lines being torn apart again.Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.

Investors followed their lead, loading up on long-term government bonds while growth was stagnant and political risk abounded. These investors now seem to be on board with Donald J. Trump\u2019s promise to stimulate the economy.They are also betting on the price of commodities important to the building business like copper, in anticipation of a pickup in government spending.

{"Headline": "Why This Election Was Not About the Issues", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceI compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics: candidate traits or characteristics, and the economy or jobs. Both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates\u2019 fitness for office (or lack of it) than they did the nation\u2019s economy. And the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached.I specifically searched for news about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and her email server or her campaign and WikiLeaks, and several controversies connected to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign (including things like Trump University, the Khan family and the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video).I also looked for news about the candidates\u2019 campaign appeals on the economy and jobs. This list isn\u2019t exhaustive, but it gives a sense of the trade-off between coverage of these controversies and the economy.The candidates\u2019 controversies received more coverage, on average, than their views on the economy. From June until Election Day, 38 percent of the stories mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s various missteps, and 35 percent mentioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email.Only 17 percent mentioned Mr. Trump and jobs or the economy, and only 10 percent cited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the economy.The imbalance in coverage of the candidates\u2019 character is striking, as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies. Moving one week past the video release, between Oct. 15 and Election Day, roughly half (56 percent) of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, and only a quarter (26 percent) discussed Mr. Trump and his imbroglios. A mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned Mrs. Clinton and the economy (11 percent mentioned Mr. Trump and the economy).But before anyone blames the news media, it\u2019s important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign. If media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately, then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals. It might be at least as much the candidates\u2019 choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics.To figure out if this was the case, I used data from Kantar Media/CMAG on all the candidates\u2019 campaign ads aired between June and Election Day. I coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television. Mrs. Clinton made more ads than Mr. Trump, and she vastly out-advertised him, running nearly three times as many ads as he did. All told, over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period.The content of the ads is revealing. Both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other person\u2019s character. In fact, the losing candidate\u2019s ads did little else. More than three-quarters of the appeals in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advertisements (and nearly half of Mr. Trump\u2019s) were about traits, characteristics or dispositions. Only 9 percent of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy. By contrast, 34 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeals focused on the economy, jobs, taxes and trade.Since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in 1952, no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic. On average, traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals. The economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals. There\u2019s usually much more balance.Of course, this was an unusual election year, with two very unpopular candidates, so the candidates\u2019 flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up. Whatever the reason, the criterion of fitness for office dominated the Clinton campaign\u2019s messaging and made up a good share of the Trump messaging as well, and the news media covered it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 28, 2016Emerson CsorbaNoa Gafni SlaneyAs social creatures, we seek out opportunities to connect with others. The internet is particularly effective in helping us do that.  As a child growing up in the United States with foreign parents, every summer we would visit my mother's family in Israel. There I would  marvel at the artists on MTV Europe. And every four years, my Chilean father would hole up in our New Jersey basement to watch the Mundial on Univision \u2014 a cultural phenomena in other parts of the world, but unknown to our American neighbors. But the internet, like all platforms, can be used for positive and negative interactions. We cringe with horror at hateful speech and people who leverage 140 character sound bites to further their anti-openness agenda. In the wake of the U.S. presidential election, many observers claim that social media has created \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d that reinforce our views as opposed to opening us up to new ones.As our world becomes more closely intertwined, we want to hold on to the elements of our identity that define where we come from. It can be sharing our home or showing pride in our local government. That is what makes today\u2019s globalized success stories so wonderful \u2014 they are undeniably influenced by their local context.\nAbout a year ago, I attended a meeting in Geneva focused on gathering 450 \"changemakers\" to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges. I thought the participants would emerge with new relationships and perspectives on complex issues such as poverty and climate change. But very little meaningful conversation took place. Instead, participants spent the summit glued to their phones, taking selfies and sharing on Facebook \u2014 their posts usually accompanied by inspirational quotes and messages on how grateful they were to be included in this group of leaders.In our digital world, it comes as no surprise that these posts play such a central role in our lives, and that carefully curated social media images and comments gain such traction. But I cannot help but wonder what it is that we lose in the process of sharing so much of ourselves publicly. Social media \"likes\" and new followers provide us with public approval, but this need for constant sharing of ourselves \u2014 and the immediate gratification that comes with it  \u2014 diminishes the meaning and significance in the things we share. When it is possible to share widely, the approval we gain from followers leads us to forget that something even could be private, and moreover, that some parts of our lives are worth keeping private. Indeed, our digital connections might increase the ease in sharing certain parts of ourselves, but we must ask whether these are things better worth protecting. \n\u201cClicktivism\u201d and \u201cslacktivism\u201d are derogatory terms for online activism. It suggests that digital campaigns do nothing more than generate likes on Instagram. Many argue that these campaigns do more harm than good by providing participants with a sense of satisfaction that they\u2019ve taken an action without actually contributing to the cause through tangible, \u201creal-world\u201d means. Nothing could be further from the truth.The United Nations Foundation is leveraging online interest to create a continued focus on the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to creating compelling messages that are easy to share on social media, the foundation uses its +SocialGood community, a platform for changemakers to share resources around global issues, to spread the word and make the goals locally relevant. Our online interactions influence our offline behavior. The myth of clicktivism dismisses the powerful movements that are taking place \u2014 on and offline.\nThe relationships we form are superficial at best, and the social comparison that these connections fosters can be psychologically damaging.Over the past three years, I have conducted hundreds of one-on-one interviews with early and mid-career professionals on how they see their lives and careers developing in an uncertain world. Through these discussions, a theme of \"ruthless comparison\" emerges, where we become acutely aware of how our friends and colleagues portray themselves online. Noa highlights campaigns such as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and Lean In, where the collective action of celebrities and average citizens creates a social pressure for others to engage in a particular socially conscious activity. While useful in generating real-life action, this pressure to engage is in large part based on social comparison: a need to portray oneself in a particular light to appear to be a person committed to doing good. These online actions are increasingly required to \"keep up with the Joneses\" in a connected world.Although many interviewees were aware that these self-representations are illusory, they nevertheless felt pressured to engage in this competition, sharing their achievements and experiences over social media to show others how they are keeping up. This fuels a perpetual competition, focused on the sharing of successes and other updates, regardless of how accurately these portrayals represent real life \u2014 and they rarely do.This vicious cycle is difficult to escape; it requires a significant amount of confidence in oneself to both remain connected and see past the charade we collectively engage in. For every +SocialGood campaign that legitimately builds in-person dialogue, there are countless online campaigns fuelled by individual or corporate need to \"curate\" images that compare favorably with those of society's influencers. Based on my interviews with early and mid-career professionals, many individuals are at a crossroads in how to act in their online worlds. Skeptical of the authenticity of online activity, they nevertheless feel trapped in a society where sharing is celebrated. Indeed, we must be weary of the comparisons that our connectedness encourages, knowing that these comparisons are often psychologically exhausting and, in some cases, harmful. \nWhen I first began to research social media in 2004, the reigning narrative was that people who chose to interact online were \"socially awkward\" and looking for opportunities to connect in the digital realm because real-world opportunities were closed off to them. When I studied teenagers who used chat rooms, I saw that a generation of digital natives were as socially adjusted as their peers and looked to connect online in addition to real life. In writing about online connections, Noa highlights its \"key difference\" as being the ability to \"tap into a global community, not just a local one.\" Critically, this global community allows participants to share their opinions, and in some cases, develop relationships that would not otherwise exist. Personally, I have benefited from this interactivity; several of my closest friendships, as well as professional opportunities, began with communication over online tools such as skype \u2014 with in-person meetings not taking place until sometimes more than one year into our conversations. These experiences are compelling, as are the examples that Noa shares of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and others helping change the world. But as Phillips writes, a belief in potential to create change can bring disappointment and frustration, as we realize that the stories of social change we consume in our connected worlds are not always as readily achievable as we have been led to believe. People of all ages are spending more and more time online. Does this digital trend improve lives or hurt them?  \n"}

On Monday, election officials said the first couple obtained 72 percent of the vote, well ahead of their closest rival, who got just over 14 percent. The landslide victory was a widely anticipated outcome of a contest whose outcome was preordained.The arc of the Ortegas\u2019 rise to power disturbingly echoes the country\u2019s violent past. Mr. Ortega led an armed uprising that overthrew the country\u2019s last strongman, Anastasio Somoza, bringing down a dynasty that ran the country for more than four decades. Mr. Ortega won his first election in 1985, and was voted out of office in 1990.Since his comeback in 2006, he and Ms. Murillo have become popular among many Nicaraguans for investing in social programs and subsidies for the poor. The economy has grown at a steady pace, and Nicaragua has remained far safer than Central America\u2019s other impoverished nations, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.The Ortegas have also bestowed lavish favors and political power on their relatives and friends, while stifling public debate about controversial initiatives, including an interoceanic canal that could have negative environmental consequences.As formal avenues for dissent have closed, a small armed opposition has taken root in the countryside.

Some Upshot readers, responding to the article, suggested it was about intelligence \u2014 that college-educated people can see through Mr. Trump because they\u2019re smart.The I.Q. connection is purely speculative; no rigorous studies have been published to support it. Other readers warned against the temptation to stereotype, pointing to various explanations and showing how difficult it is to come to definitive conclusions about the education correlation.Another reader highlighted the advantages of encountering different points of view on campus.Why do the college-educated tend to vote Democrat? Simple. A young person entering any American college will take humanities courses in philosophy, literature, history, the social sciences, all taught by strongly left-leaning Democrats. It is impossible that they should emerge from this experience ideologically untouched.Jane of Santa Rosa said, \u201cThis is why Donald Trump \u2014 and the G.O.P. by extension \u2014 \u2018love the poorly educated.\u2019 \u201dA reader, John of Los Angeles, said of conservative complaints of one-sidedness: \u201cAlternatively: Facts have a liberal bias.\u201dCollege graduates from rural towns who move to a metropolitan area for work may have their views influenced by their new environment and social circles.

The result is social polarization by place.A reader, William Hayes of Houston, said, \u201cTrump promises jobs by rolling back globalization, which appeals to the undereducated, not because they\u2019re stupid, but because they believe decreasing globalization will help them get good jobs.\u201dTwo readers had advice for Democrats:Have we missed any reasons that white Americans with college degrees are less likely to support Mr. Trump?

{"Headline": "William Ackman\u2019s 2016 Fortune: Down, but Far From Out", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byWilliam A. Ackman is a big-moneyed, swaggering hedge fund manager with a long list of accomplishments.Now the silver-haired billionaire is on the verge of notching another accomplishment, but it is a dubious one. He is on pace to record a hefty double-digit loss for investors in his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, for the second year in a row.It is a rare accomplishment in hedge funds, as investors like public pension funds have grown impatient with disappointing returns and more than a handful of well-known firms have been forced to shut down as a result.Yet Mr. Ackman is not like most of his peers. He has brushed off questions about whether his investors were worried and frustrated with his steep losses, countering that over time his firm had \u201ca good batting average.\u201d Together with his analysts, he told clients last week that the companies in which he has made big bold bets remain \u201cunique,\u201d \u201csuccessful,\u201d \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cterrific.\u201d\u201cWe all know someone like him,\u201d said Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management, a small hedge fund firm. \u201cAckman is the smartest guy in the room who tells you he is the smartest guy in the room.\u201dIt has helped that Mr. Ackman has structured Pershing Square so that investors have to wait as long as two years to take their money out. While some big investors have withdrawn their money recently, others believe that his firm will turn the corner.The question is how much latitude investors will give to a man who fancies himself the next Warren E. Buffett. Over the last two years, investors have either withdrawn or announced plans to redeem more than $1 billion from his hedge fund, including New Jersey\u2019s state pension fund, the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico and the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado.His investors have regretted it, too. Shares of the troubled pharmaceutical company have plunged to about $18 a share from the average $190 a share he said his firm paid in 2015 to acquire a big stake. As shareholders began to question the company and the stock plummeted, he bought a bigger stake in a show of confidence. Mr. Ackman has secured two board seats to try to position a turnaround.\u201cI have an enormous stomach for volatility,\u201d he told an audience last week at the DealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times.Privately, Mr. Ackman has told some investors that in six months or so, Valeant\u2019s situation should start to look better as it sells off divisions to pay down debt obligations.But now Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly traded version of his private hedge fund, is on course for a second year of double-digit annual loss and is currently down 20.7 percent, after dropping 20.5 percent last year. The losses are somewhat smaller at the private portfolios in his hedge fund in part because differences in leverage can magnify losses.\u201cHe\u2019s 50 years old. He has no boundaries to his ambitions,\u201d said Ruud Smets of Theta Capital Management, an investment firm in the Netherlands. \u201cSo he is someone who will make his way back and is realistic about the mistakes he\u2019s made and what they should do better,\u201d he said, referring to Pershing.Making its way back to positive territory will be challenging for Pershing, however. Its position in Valeant has helped wipe out a nearly 40 percent gain that the firm had in 2014.Pershing started 2015 with more money than it had ever managed \u2014 $18.5 billion \u2014 including money raised from the public listing in Amsterdam of Pershing Square Holdings. Today the firm\u2019s assets are down to $11.6 billion, and two years of losing performances threatens to chip away at Mr. Ackman\u2019s reputation as one of the more successful investors in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry.And he can change. While he has long been known for favoring liberal causes and contributing mainly to Democrats, Mr. Ackman spoke glowingly of Donald J. Trump last week at the DealBook conference after his election.\u201cI woke up bullish on Trump,\u201d Mr. Ackman said, surprising some in the audience. He clarified later in an interview that he was referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to the economy, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his views on immigration, on deportation and certain other social issues.\u201dHis flexibility when it comes to national politics is at odds with the reputation he has earned at times of being a stubborn investor and a firm believer in his own views \u2014 qualities his Wall Street critics contend have informed his firm\u2019s money-losing investment in Valeant.Some on Wall Street have quietly compared him to another hedge fund hotshot, John Paulson, who made nearly $15 billion for his investors by betting on the collapse of the housing market during the financial crisis, but has struggled at times since then. Mr. Paulson\u2019s firm now manages about $12 billion in assets, down from $36 billion five years ago.Mr. Paulson, who is also bullish on Mr. Trump and was an economic adviser to him during the campaign, is the second-biggest shareholder in Valeant after Mr. Ackman.But while predicting Mr. Ackman\u2019s downfall has become something of a sport for some of his enemies on Wall Street, the prediction has yet to come true.Over all, Mr. Ackman\u2019s hedge fund firm has had more success than failure. Since 2004, the firm has registered nine winning years and four losing years, including the partial results for 2016. In four of those years, one of the firm\u2019s main funds showed an annual gain more than 30 percent.Four years ago, Mr. Ackman announced at a conference that he had wagered $1 billion that Herbalife would either collapse on its own or be forced to close by regulators. But so far neither has happened, and Herbalife shares trade above the price they were at when he first disclosed his bearish trade.\u201cYou can either view it as he has the courage of his convictions or he is being foolish,\u201d said Damien Park, managing partner at Hedge Fund Solutions, who specializes in analyzing activist investors.Still, some investors have put new money into Pershing Square recently. In August, Privium Fund Management, in a note to clients, said it had reinvested in Mr. Ackman\u2019s publicly traded fund.\u201cHe didn\u2019t become stupid overnight,\u201d said Mark Baak, a director at Privium, an Amsterdam-based investment firm that manages about $1.4 billion. \u201cHis prevailing track record wasn\u2019t luck. Even if he was overrated prior to Valeant, he is still a very good investor.\u201dIf nothing else, he will be on the move. His firm plans to relocate from its perch in Midtown Manhattan overlooking Central Park to a new office on the Far West Side near the Hudson River. Mr. Ackman\u2019s new hedge fund home will be in Manhattan\u2019s so-called auto dealership row.One of the selling points of the new office is a rooftop tennis court that Mr. Ackman asked for.Advertisement"}

You and idiots like you, full of straight white male privilege, who never understood the life-or-death stakes of sexism, racism and homophobia in our recent election. I heard you on the radio last week, sounding like a fool, telling people who had fought over the presidential election (and cut ties with family and friends) to look for the best in each other and talk it out. Why is it always on the victims to explain ourselves to straight men and white people? I\u2019ve had it! After this election, I want nothing to do with any jerk who voted for Trump or limousine liberals like you. Why should I?JANELLEDesperate times call for desperate measures. So I will engage with you, Janelle, even though you insulted me three times in one brief paragraph. (This is not the way the world usually works.) Angry, contemptuous speech \u2014 even when it\u2019s understandable \u2014 diminishes both of us, and would typically result in my dismissing you. (Or writing an even nastier reply.) But your letter goes to the crux of Social Q\u2019s. So let\u2019s talk. And let me begin by saying I\u2019m sorry for upsetting you.What better investment can we make than engaging \u2014 calmly and with personal examples \u2014 with our (slightly sexist) father, for instance, about the brute inequity of our sister\u2019s earning less money than a guy who does the same job? Or our (homophobic) aunt about how being gay is not a choice? Or our (clueless) white co-worker about the baked-in racism that shuttles so many black men to prison?I get the mean irony of forcing victims to educate people who advocate further harm to them (with their votes). But that has always been the nature of social-change movements. And for a country that as recently as the last few years actually pretended that most of our important institutions are race and gender blind, this day of reckoning had to come. And our stunning election has laid it bare.By engaging with others, I do not mean posting hectoring rants on social media or sending rude emails. They accomplish nothing. I am talking about the slower, labor-intensive process of face-to-face conversation. Is that a drag? You bet. But I don\u2019t know another way. And I suspect you don\u2019t either.A more global reason for this approach: It is not my experience that 47 percent of the people I meet (i.e., the number who voted for the other party\u2019s candidate, whomever you voted for) are idiots or bigots. Taking a few extra steps with some of them, starting with the ones we really care about, to explain how their political positions wound us seems like an obvious place to begin.Now, add in the pragmatic value of consensus-building. None of the things that you and I want deeply for our country: equality for every woman and man; a better education system; a compassionate immigration program; a fairer economy; kindness \u2014 can be achieved in our current polarized climate. We have to do something.Yes, it will be slow-going and, as you point out, asks even more of people who have already been harmed. But when we take the time to explain the \u201ccode\u201d of coded language (e.g., \u201cthe inner cities are a disaster\u201d) to people who have had the good luck not to grapple with it, they get it. And often, they care.Isn\u2019t that better than retreating to our separate corners (and our 47-47 split) and fuming? And when we civilians start talking and working together, our elected officials will take note and follow suit, if they want to keep their jobs. It\u2019s our only hope.P.S.: Everyone (including my second-grade teacher, way back when) knows that I am gay.I am getting married. The wedding will be in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s hometown, across the country from my family. My sister-in-law (my only sibling\u2019s wife) is refusing to come, claiming flight anxiety. She has flown only sparingly in her life. I have called her and my brother separately to let them know how much it would mean if she came and how hurtful it would be if she didn\u2019t.

Rather, it was simply allegiance to the ideals of the country, even when we fall short of those ideals. In contrast, the worst moments in our history have occurred when we have focused and acted on our ethnic differences: slavery, Japanese internment, extirpation of Native Americans, hostility to the latest immigrant group. Many of world history\u2019s most tragic circumstances developed where ethnic identity superseded tolerance and unity.Pursuing collective goals of liberty and security and prosperity \u2014 and happiness \u2014 should unite us both as a people and at the voting booth. PETER COFFEYMadison, Conn.To the Editor: Mark Lilla disparaged an important element of the Democratic Party\u2019s platform, to unproductive effect. Considering the low voter turnout on the left and the fact that there have always been vocal sexists and racists in the American electorate (emboldened, not created, by the alt-right), the work of the Democratic Party in the next two years will not involve minimizing the importance of what Mr. Lilla dismissively calls \u201cidentity politics,\u201d but in fact embracing this agenda.Democrats should double down on the battles for equal rights in America, and work to clarify to the swing voters precisely what these battles consist of \u2014 for in their ideal application, equal rights do not step on the toes of any special interest group. In a November marked by the normalizing of hate speech, it would be catastrophic for liberals to shy away from the progressive agenda that has defined the party\u2019s social platform.BRITTANY K. ALLENBrooklynTo the Editor: The \u201cfixation on diversity\u201d Mark Lilla refers to is an affirmation process for those of us who are not white. That \u201claziest story in American journalism\u201d about \u201cthe first X to do Y\u201d demonstrates to women, immigrants and minority groups that we can overcome significant barriers to educational, economic and political advancement.Mr. Lilla suggests that liberals focus on commonality rather than difference. But Donald Trump succeeded by playing the identity card, too. Immigrants, Muslims and women equal bad. White men equal good. To suggest that curriculum, extracurricular activities and a national narrative that uplifts diverse identities are to blame for the failure of our presidential candidates in 2016 is a deeply flawed argument.And the Kumbaya image at the end of Mr. Lilla\u2019s article happens every day in America, most notably at naturalization ceremonies, in which new Americans from hundreds of countries pledge their allegiance to America. It is a moment that unifies, but it is preceded and followed by a constant journey for belonging in America. SAYU BHOJWANINew YorkThe writer, a former commissioner of immigrant affairs for New York City, is the president and founder of the New American Leaders Project.To the Editor: Mark Lilla\u2019s article is essential reading. Liberals should weep over the thousands of industrial-state voters who went for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but voted for Donald Trump this time. Those who think that all Trump voters are bigots have their eyes wide shut. Republican wedge and Democrat single-issue politics are flip sides of the same coin. They worked together to encourage maximum demands by both sides, lack of compromise and divisiveness in America.More important, the inane culture wars of the last 40 years gave liberal and conservative politicians cover for not addressing structural changes in the economy beginning with wholesale closing of steel and auto plants in the early 1980s and the dominance of Big Finance later in the decade.CARLYN MEYEREnglewood, Colo.To the Editor: Mark Lilla\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cpost-identity liberalism\u201d is really a plea to the disenfranchised and discriminated against to subordinate their fight for equality to the pursuit of some common electoral denominator that won\u2019t discomfort white America. This is neither fair nor realistic.My fellow progressive Democrats surely must do a better job of weaving the aspirations of all Americans into a common narrative, but not at the expense of those whose primary political goals are merely equal treatment under the law.RORY I. LANCMANNew YorkThe writer is a member of the New York City Council.To the Editor: Thanks to Mark Lilla for his thoughtful essay. I agree that the hyphenation rhetoric is divisive and had a shock of recognition in noting that Hillary Clinton rarely included white Americans in her lists of those to be included. So this strategy of outreach will be helpful for going forward.But the hateful actions against otherness are alive, emboldened and harming people now. A friend who goes around to public schools presenting the stories of the Freedom Riders, Jackie Robinson, Emmett Till and others who have had to struggle for their civil rights reports that he has seen the white racist rhetoric spewing out of the mouths of elementary school students against their minority classmates.We thought that we had moved beyond the times of ingrained bias. Trump politics has taken us back decades. We need to demand the safety and constitutional rights for our fellow minority citizens now, without pandering. DEB BALDWINChapel Hill, N.C.To the Editor: In grammar school, I was taught that America is a melting pot. We were to mix our individual identities for the common good.

{"Headline": "After Trump\u2019s Win, an Anxious Mexico Asks: What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Ever since the election of Donald J. Trump to the American presidency, Juan Pardinas, a Mexican academic, has been thinking back to his childhood.Specifically, the Cold War era, when his days as a young boy were filled with a medium-grade anxiety that the Russians might incite a nuclear war that could devastate North America.\u201cIt\u2019s the same feeling of uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Pardinas, a graduate of the London School of Economics whose work on anti-corruption legislation has been roundly praised in Mexico. \u201cThe feeling that politics has become a source of bitterness, anguish and uncertainty is really sad.\u201d\u201cThis may not affect people on the top of our country, but it can only mean bad news for us merchants and lower, working-class people in Mexico,\u201d said Claudia Rivera, a street vendor who owns a food cart in Mexico City.Outside of concerns about the election, violence has been soaring to levels not seen since the start of the drug war a decade ago. And corruption and a loss of faith in the political leadership had already plunged the nation into a state of gloom. Now, the loss for many is external, too.\u201cA lot of people see the U.S. as a beacon of freedom, as something to aspire to,\u201d said Mr. Pardinas, who works on legislation and economic competitiveness. \u201cBut what happens when you lose a role model, the role model of a nation? Now all of us who admired the U.S. are having second thoughts.\u201d\u201cWe are really in need of some reassurance,\u201d said Mr. Pardinas, echoing the sentiment of dozens interviewed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. \u201cBut you need political leadership for that, and we are short on those attributes.\u201dPresident Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his administration have adopted a diplomatic and hopeful posture toward Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.In a statement after the election, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said the results \u201copen a new chapter in the relationship between Mexico and the United States, which will imply a change, a challenge, but also, it\u2019s necessary to say, a big opportunity.\u201dHe was sure, he said, that the relationship would be one of \u201ctrust and mutual respect\u201d that would \u201cbuild prosperity\u201d for both countries. He also recounted that he had congratulated Mr. Trump by phone earlier and that the men had discussed the possibility of meeting again in the coming months \u201cto define, with total clarity, the course that the relationship between the two countries will have to take.\u201dHowever, behind the scenes, there was a deep worry regarding the transition, most immediately the possibility of mass deportations of Mexicans living in the United States.Armando R\u00edos Piter, an opposition senator representing the state of Guerrero, said that after enduring Mr. Trump\u2019s hostile discourse for a year and a half, Mexicans deserved a more robust response from their president.\u201cIt was a very light response to a very dangerous threat,\u201d he said.As Mr. Trump prepared to take office, he continued, Mexico needs to establish its position regarding the United States wall with \u201cfirmness, clarity and dignity.\u201dInstead, \u201cwe are left with a politically light position that doesn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t settle for a statement that says, \u2018I spoke with Trump.\u2019\u201dIn September, in anticipation of a possible Trump victory, Mr. R\u00edos submitted bills that would strengthen Mexico\u2019s hand. The bills, which have languished in the Senate, would allow the government to penalize American investments in Mexico should Mr. Trump follow through on his promises to tax or block remittances by Mexicans in the United States to finance his proposed border wall.The legislation would also make it explicitly illegal for the Mexican federal government to finance anything that could be interpreted as a border wall, and it stipulated that if the United States decided to pull out of Nafta, as Mr. Trump has threatened, the Mexican legislature would review the dozens of agreements and treaties that govern the bilateral relationship.In truth, the Mexican government is in a difficult place. Some Mexicans say their leaders must be careful not to antagonize the new president of the United States with their own incendiary comments, given the economic importance America holds in Mexico.\u201cIt is worrying and frightening to know that the loud guy holding a stick in his hand, saying he is coming to get you, to beat you up, is actually in power to do so now,\u201d said Leticia Vega, a Mexican lawyer.Business leaders, meanwhile, have begun the process of normalizing Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Though most executives have adopted a wait-and-see approach, they are continuing with business as usual.\u201cSometimes the rhetoric is very different from the actual business of governing,\u201d said Alejandro Ramirez, the head of the largest business consortium in Mexico and the chief executive of Cin\u00e9polis, which runs movie theaters across the Americas. \u201cWhen you have to face the reality of governing you have to look much deeper into the facts, to see whether what you are proposing makes sense.\u201dMr. Ramirez buys $40 million worth of goods from the United States every year to run his cinemas, from popcorn and nacho cheese to audio equipment. If free trade were upended, those purchases might be made from other countries, he said.Few thought a Trump presidency was possible. Now most are banking on a stark difference between Candidate Trump and President Trump, meaning that he will not be as harsh on Mexico as promised. Business consortiums and trade interest groups have taken a proactive stance on engaging the president-elect.\u201cIf the Mexican government is smart about this, if they anticipate correctly the concerns of the incoming administration, they can build an agenda to which the Trump administration can respond,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, which promotes relations between the United States and Mexico through research. \u201cThe immediate reaction I got from board members is that this is the moment for us to actually engage.\u201dFor some, though, Mexico\u2019s own problems loomed larger than a Trump presidency.\u201cThe problems that we have generated here, in Mexico, ourselves are far more worrisome and immediate,\u201d said Juan de la Vega, 42, a lawyer who has a brother living illegally in San Francisco. \u201cThose are the ones I worry about the most because they affect my life directly, like the stagnant economy, corruption and insecurity.\u201d\u201cIn the grand scale of things, we as Mexicans know how to accept, assume and transcend this Trump thing,\u201d he added.Paulina Villegas and Kirk Semple contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Has Made Great Progress, but We Need Our Allies", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 In the two years since the Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine has made more progress as a country than it had since declaring independence in 1991. We are finally tackling corruption in a meaningful way, and we have introduced a raft of reforms that will help the state to function better. After our economy contracted for two consecutive years, we now expect to see it grow again. And we have achieved all of this under the most challenging of circumstances: while fighting a Russian-led war that has cost thousands of lives, and with a Russian occupation of the Crimean peninsula and the Donbas region crippling our economy.Yet Ukraine continues its journey to becoming a democratic, fair and prosperous country at the gates of Europe, a vision that so many of my fellow citizens died for during the Maidan Revolution in the beginning of 2014 and continue to die for defending our country against Russia.What we have achieved in the last two years we could not have done without the hard work and sacrifice of our people at home and, critically, the staunch support of our partners abroad. The partnership and support of the European Union has been very important. But nowhere has Ukraine found a better friend and more committed ally than the United States. Without the huge support America continues to give us, we would not be making the progress that we are today. That continued support is more important now than ever.On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump made a number of references to Ukraine and said many things relevant to my country. He also suggested, memorably, that he would like the United States to \u201cget on better with Russia,\u201d which he suggested would be a \u201cgood thing.\u201dI agree with Mr. Trump. For the future of our world and our children, a better relationship between the United States and Russia is something we should all wish for. But that relationship must not come at the expense of Ukraine, the rest of Europe or the interests of the United States.I grew up in a Soviet Union dominated by Russia. I still understand the Russian mind-set and the thinking of the leaders in the Kremlin. There is an oft-quoted line by politicians and diplomats who understand these things: \u201cRussia only respects power.\u201dSimilarly, the 2016 Republican Party platform promises \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d This is critically important in today\u2019s dangerous world. When dealing with the Kremlin there can be a peaceful outcome only if we negotiate from a position of strength.The Minsk agreements, negotiated in 2014 and 2015 with international partners, were supposed to put an end to the fighting in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine where Russia continues to carry out a hybrid war with thousands of Russian troops and proxies, tanks and other military equipment. Yet Russia and its proxies have continually disregarded the Minsk Agreements. Since they were signed, almost 10,000 Ukrainians, soldiers and civilians alike, have lost their lives. The war in the Donbas would end tomorrow if Russia were to comply with Minsk and allow free local elections, monitored by international observers, to re-establish democratic procedures in the region. Certainly, Mr. Trump understands the importance of a free electoral system.While fomenting war against Ukraine, Russia has illegally annexed Crimea on the unfounded pretext that it was part of Russia in the first place. It is not. It is the sovereign territory of a country that voted by over 90 percent for independence 25 years ago. The sham elections that Moscow subsequently held in Crimea to justify its actions are seen as having been rigged and have never been accepted by the international community.Until Russia ends this rogue behavior in my country, the international community must not lift sanctions. They hurt Russia more than the Kremlin cares to admit; they are probably the only action that is currently keeping Russia at least partly in check. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration and the American Congress must recognize this and even support tightening of sanctions until Russia leaves Crimea and the Donbas.Mr. Trump is assuming the position of the leader of the free world at a critical time. Following on from the Brexit referendum in Britain, Mr. Trump\u2019s election is a watershed moment, not just for the United States but also for the world. An old order in which \u201celites\u201d can expect to govern as a sort of birthright is breaking down. Citizens are increasingly calling, and voting, for change. How to respond in the best interests of our people is a challenge to all of us who wish to hold positions of leadership today.Mr. Trump has said that the United States cannot do all the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting countries like Ukraine. I agree, and our government is working with our European partners to ensure they remain steadfast. But Ukraine does not ask for charity. My compatriots are dying every day. They die defending not only Ukraine but the universal democratic values and freedoms that are as precious to Ukrainians as they are to Americans.I hope that under President Trump, not only the United States but the world will get strong leadership. I also hope that Ukraine will keep the steadfast friend and ally that we have been so grateful for during the difficult adolescence of our democracy.Pavlo Klimkin is the foreign minister of Ukraine.Advertisement"}

He may face some legal and procedural hurdles, but most of his Day 1 pledges involve issuing presidential directives, executive orders or memorandums that do not need legislative approval.Here is what Mr. Trump has said he will do:\u201cWe will begin moving them out, Day 1,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first hour in office, those people are gone.\u201dMuch of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was built on a promise to help struggling American workers who are frustrated by the loss of jobs, especially in the heartland.He has promised to pick up the phone and order his Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to tell his commerce secretary to begin identifying foreign trade abuses.He has also said he will call chief executives of major companies who have announced plans to move jobs overseas to warn them that he will impose 35 percent tariffs if they proceed. That promise may be difficult to keep: Tariffs require congressional approval, and the Constitution bans the imposition of taxes or tariffs specifically aimed at a single company.The president-elect has taken direct aim at Mr. Obama\u2019s actions on the environment and climate.But that may be a tough promise to keep. Gun-free zones are a result of a 1990 law proposed by Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, and ending them would require legislation that Congress is unlikely to pass on Mr. Trump\u2019s first day in office.It will be easier to make good on his promises to attack corruption in Washington. He has said he will propose term limits for members of Congress, impose restrictions on the creation of new regulations, and limit the lobbying activities of White House and congressional officials after they leave office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We Don\u2019t Owe Anyone\u2019: Egypt Jousts With Its Chief Benefactor, Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 In the tumultuous two years since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt came to power, one ally has kept the Arab world\u2019s most populous country from economic ruin: Saudi Arabia pumped more than $25 billion into the faltering Egyptian economy, dwarfing aid from the United States.The Saudis may have thought they were buying loyalty. But Egypt\u2019s vote last month for a Russian United Nations resolution on Syria threatens to unravel Mr. Sisi\u2019s relationship with Egypt\u2019s most crucial benefactor.Shortly after the vote, the Saudi ambassador to Egypt left Cairo for an unscheduled three-day visit to Riyadh. The state-owned Saudi oil company, Aramco, postponed a promised shipment of 700,000 tons of discounted oil in October, and the spokesman for Egypt\u2019s oil ministry said the fate of November\u2019s shipment remains unknown.Then last week, the Saudi head of a major Islamic organization, who has since resigned, publicly mocked Mr. Sisi, exposing the rift in a new way.Ahmed Moussa, a prominent Egyptian talk show host and staunch supporter of Mr. Sisi, was one of many Egyptian commentators who reacted angrily.The fraying of the alliance between the two most influential Sunni nations is unfolding amid increasing sectarianism across the region. And the potential loss of Saudi support could hardly come at a worse moment for Egypt, whose economy is crashing amid a devaluing of its local currency, reduction in imports, and tourism tailspin.Inflation in Egypt is at 14.6 percent, almost double the figure a year ago, and the government is awaiting approval of a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, which is likely to be conditioned on rolling back energy subsidies that could create political instability.Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia is going through a period of muscular nationalism and is trying to assert its weight as a Sunni regional power, particularly in trying to counterbalance Shiite Iran.That has created a sense of wounded pride among Egyptians, who have long thought of their nation as the leader of the Arab world. They tend to be uncomfortable with their economic dependence on Saudi Arabia and sometimes dismiss the Saudis as oil-rich upstarts.Still, the dependence is significant: Compare the $25 billion over two years from Saudi Arabia to the $1.3 billion annual military aid from Washington that Cairo has collected for years, part of the assistance Egypt has received since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.Both the Russian draft and a rival French resolution offering various formulations aimed at halting hostilities in Syria failed to garner enough votes in the United Nations Security Council. Egypt\u2019s support for the Russians, however, managed to provoke a backlash by the Saudis.And then there was that remark suggesting the extent of the kingdom\u2019s exasperation, made by Iyad Ameen Madani, a Saudi who until Monday was chief of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which works to foster unity among 57 Muslim nations.After mistakenly garbling the name of the Tunisian president, B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi, by calling him \u201cB\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd el-Sisi,\u201d Mr. Madani took a swipe at the Egyptian president that was instantly recognizable by all who follow politics here.\u201cI am sure your fridge has more than water,\u201d Mr. Madani said to Mr. Essebsi.It was a sly, dismissive reference to a widely derided comment Mr. Sisi had made at a recent youth conference. Urging young Egyptians to be patient as the country endures economic difficulties, Mr. Sisi said that he had lived for a decade with only water in his refrigerator and had not complained.This prompted howls of derision on Egyptian social media, because Mr. Sisi had served for years in a military known for generous salaries, rising to be head of intelligence and eventually the entire system.So when Mr. Madani revived the controversy with his offhand rebuke, Egypt\u2019s Foreign Ministry blasted back, calling the statement \u201cregrettable\u201d and a \u201cgrave transgression,\u201d and vowing to review its relationship with Mr. Madani\u2019s organization.Mr. Madani resigned Monday \u201cfor health reasons,\u201d the organization said in a statement after it issued an apology, saying he had been joking.The broader rift between the two countries, on the other hand, is real, analysts say.But Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political science professor at Cairo University, said he did not expect the latest round of skirmishing to have major consequences.\u201cThey will continue to cooperate because they have to,\u201d Mr. Sayyid said.\u201cAll of this is unlikely to cause a breakup,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just adds tension to the relationship.\u201dNour Youssef reported from Cairo, and Diaa Hadid from Alexandria, Egypt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mortgage Rates\u2019 Rise Catches Home Buyers \u2014 and Lenders \u2014 Off Guard", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byWhen Jared Rutledge called his mortgage broker one morning last week after putting in an offer on a home in Glendale, Ariz., just west of Phoenix, he discovered that the 3.8 percent rate he had been quoted a couple of months ago had already gone up to 4.125 percent. That afternoon, it had inched up to 4.25, and by evening, when he finally called back to finalize the deal, it was 4.375 percent.\u201cI was kind of frustrated,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said. But with a third child on the way, and a buyer for their current home, he and his wife felt they had little choice. \u201cInstead of holding out and waiting, we locked it in,\u201d he said.Since the election, mortgage rates have climbed roughly half a percentage point to a 16-month high, adding hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars to a home buyer\u2019s yearly payments. (The annual cost of a $400,000 mortgage, for example, rose almost $700.)The speed and size of the increase took many lenders and borrowers by surprise \u2014 and the increase is expected to reverberate across the housing industry, particularly if rates continue to rise next year.\u201cDoes it give people pause? Does it raise the cost of buying a home?\u201d Mr. Cecala asked. \u201cYes and yes.\u201dFor most of this year, American home buyers have benefited from weakness in the global economy. China has been struggling to sustain the rapid growth it needs to avoid political unrest, a deep recession followed political turmoil in Brazil, and a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Europe after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.Those factors, on top of efforts by central banks around the world to stimulate economic activity by keeping short-term interest rates low, have increased demand for safe American assets like government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The result: The cost for American businesses and consumers to borrow had, until recently, remained exceptionally low.The turnaround, which was driven by postelection market expectations that a President Trump would lift corporate profits, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure and roads, caught most experts by surprise. The online real estate brokerage Redfin, for example, had initially forecast that rates for 30-year fixed mortgages would remain below 4 percent through next year, said Glenn Kelman, the company\u2019s chief executive.Redfin has now updated its forecast and is predicting the 30-year mortgage rate will pass the 4 percent threshold. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see higher rates than we otherwise would have,\u201d Mr. Kelman said, \u201cbut more economic stimulus.\u201d\u201cMost consumers don\u2019t make decisions based on a change in mortgage rates,\u201d Ms. Gudell said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with such a tight inventory, I think they\u2019re more focused on finding a home that they can afford. If mortgage rates go up by half a percent, that\u2019s not going to make them change their minds.\u201dBack then, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage topped 6 percent, a reminder that even with the recent rate jump, mortgages remain a bargain by historical standards. Thirty years ago, the average rate was about 10 percent.Still, for buyers who had been counting on paying less than 3.5 percent, the postelection bump represents an unwelcome added cost.In the last couple of weeks, requests for refinancing have dropped, according to Gregory Gwizdz, national sales manager of Wells Fargo Home Lending, one of the nation\u2019s largest home loan originators. He expects that trend to continue through next year as rates stay at this level or inch higher.Although he hasn\u2019t seen any impact on home buying in the last two weeks, Mr. Gwizdz said that rate increases \u201ccreate some sense of urgency.\u201d\u201cIf people believe rates are on the rise,\u201d he said, \u201cthey may try to find that home sooner rather than later.\u201dHigher rates are often followed by a burst of activity from consumers worried about further increases. But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he had not seen evidence of pent-up demand. He thinks housing activity is heading for a fall.Even before this latest bump in rates, he was concerned about a drop in mortgage applications. Mortgage standards have tightened this year, he said, making it more difficult for buyers to qualify despite the steady uptick in wages.\u201cEven if applications don\u2019t go down further,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said, \u201cwe are looking at a significant drop in home sales in the first quarter of next year.\u201dFor those looking to purchase a home, different types of loans may become more appealing.Buyers of new construction, who have to wait months for their homes to be completed, may be willing to pay a little more to lock in a lower rate for an extended period of time, Mr. Gwizdz said. Those who plan to move again in the next few years might be more likely to consider an adjustable-rate mortgage than before.In Westchester County, north of New York City, J. Philip Faranda, a real estate broker, said that buyers often had differing motivations, with some focused on the investment prospects and others guided by nonmonetary factors. \u201cIf you\u2019re expecting twins, you\u2019re buying now no matter what the interest rates are,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re setting a date for your wedding, you may be putting that on hold.\u201dBic N. DeCaro, a real estate agent in Northern Virginia, said that before the election most clients had been dragging their feet, uncertain about what to do. But since rates started to move up, \u201cthere was a flurry of activity,\u201d she said, leading to more showings and two signed contracts.In Phoenix, Luis Solis, a real estate broker, said some of his clients have also ramped up their searches in the past week.\u201cPeople are afraid they are going to go up really fast,\u201d he said.As it turns out, Mr. Solis is in the midst of buying a larger house for his own family in Phoenix\u2019s central corridor. \u201cWe were lucky that we locked in our rate on November 1,\u201d he said. \u201cRates have really jumped.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Thursday about rising interest rates in recent weeks referred incorrectly to a real estate agent in Northern Virginia. The agent, Bic N. DeCaro, is a woman.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Plans Big Increase in Military Spending", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials announced plans for a big increase in military spending on Wednesday, pledging to take greater responsibility for their security at a time when the United States appears to be taking a step back in its role in the world.The bloc\u2019s top officials proposed spending 5.5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion, a year to help governments acquire hardware, including helicopters and drones, and to develop military technology.Wary of concerns about consolidation of power in Brussels as member governments are under pressure from populist forces, officials stressed that the plan was in no way a step toward creating a European Union army. Member countries would own the hardware that was purchased, and much of the money would go to European companies.\u201cIf Europe does not take care of its own security, nobody else will do it for us,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. \u201cA strong, competitive and innovative defense industrial base is what will give us strategic autonomy.\u201dTotal military spending by European Union governments was about \u20ac200 billion last year, but the union does not currently have a budget for military research or procurement. The plan foresees a pilot phase of \u20ac90 million, or $95 million, up to 2020 \u2014 and \u20ac500 million, or $528 million, a year after that \u2014 for research into technologies like drones and for cybersecurity tools.A second plank of the plan foresees spending 10 times that amount to help governments develop and buy hardware. But rather than drawing on the shared European Union budget, member states would make individual contributions, and some of the money might come from project-related bonds.Obama administration officials welcomed the increased spending. \u201cIt is no secret that we\u2019ve been asking them to do this for years,\u201d said one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss alliance relations. But the official also said it was imperative that Mr. Trump reassured allies that his administration\u2019s commitment to collective defense of NATO allies would be solid.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States would automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked, and said American support would depend on the willingness of those countries to pay their fair share for military protection. But since then, a number of Republican lawmakers and foreign policy experts \u2014 including those in close contact with Mr. Trump since he won the election \u2014 have insisted that the American commitment to NATO will remain strong.European Union leaders will discuss the proposal at a summit meeting in December. The member governments still must approve it, and that could be a lengthy process given concerns about sovereignty.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.Politicians in countries like Lithuania and Poland, for example, might question whether the additional spending might be better devoted to bolstering NATO as a resurgent Russia is raising alarms in much of Central and Eastern Europe.Britain could be an obstacle, too. It has long stood in the way of deeper European military cooperation, which London fears could undermine NATO. British voters decided in a June referendum to leave the European Union, but the lengthy process of exiting the bloc has not yet legally begun.Agreeing to the spending could help European countries get over a \u201cTrump hump\u201d created by the president-elect\u2019s demands, said Nick Witney, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cThis spending is very NATO-compatible, and even money from the European budget is a fair basis for a country to claim it\u2019s chipping more into defense,\u201d said Mr. Witney, a former chief executive of the European Defense Agency, a forum for European Union member states to cooperate on defense initiatives.\u201cOn the other hand, the commitment to spending 2 percent on defense is meant to be about the long haul, and about genuinely readjusting national budget priorities, and I don\u2019t see this plan as moving European NATO members much closer to that goal,\u201d he said, adding that much of the plan was based on debt financing.A longstanding goal was to avoid duplication of effort in military procurement, which is mostly done on a national basis, and to improve the compatibility of the various military hardware that European countries acquire, he said.One example of inefficiency in European defense was the development of the Airbus A400M military aircraft, European officials said. If the proposed plan is adopted, problems that include defining where to place doors for paratroopers \u2014 which had contributed to the development of the aircraft taking about a decade longer than necessary \u2014 could be more easily resolved, they said.The officials said more military spending could have a positive effect on the sluggish European economy.Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Election Means for the Markets", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceWhat will happen to financial markets after the election? More so than usual, we have a decent idea.Market swings over the course of the election suggest that people and institutions with money on the line view a world with Mrs. Clinton as president offering a less volatile economic and financial environment than one with Donald J. Trump in charge.It\u2019s a risky game to try to tie swings in financial markets to political news. Markets often rise and fall for reasons that have nothing to do with the day\u2019s biggest headlines. And if Monday\u2019s rally were a one-time occurrence, it would be safer to attribute it to random chance than to the market\u2019s collective judgment of the future under the two potential presidents.But in this election cycle, there has been a clear pattern in which the odds shifted in the race and different financial indicators moved in a consistent direction. Good news for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has coincided with higher stock prices, a rally in the Mexican peso and a decline in expected stock market volatility. Good news for Mr. Trump has coincided with the reverse swings. (The impact on the value of the dollar and Treasury bonds has been more ambiguous.)That movement was evident when audio emerged of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women and Mrs. Clinton had strong debate performances. It went in the opposite direction when Mr. Comey indicated on Oct. 28 that investigators were examining newly obtained emails tied to Mrs. Clinton.Stock market analysts agree on the direction of the likely movements in the event of a Trump win, if not their magnitude. In a research note Monday, Evercore I.S.I. interpreted the evidence as signaling that a Trump win would create a drop of 5 to 6 percent in stocks, with a 2 percent gain if Mrs. Clinton wins. Citigroup analysts see a drop of 3 to 5 percent.\u201cA Democratic sweep could cause investors and corporate leaders to worry about higher taxes and regulation,\u201d wrote Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cA Trump win could have an even greater impact due to uncertainty about how campaign promises translate into policies,\u201d particularly around the risk of trade wars.Even if estimates like those correctly predict the near-term market reaction to the election, their ability to correctly judge the long-term consequences of a political shift for the economy and the business environment isn\u2019t particularly good. Complex feedback loops among political decisions, public policy and the economy aren\u2019t always evident in the immediate aftermath of elections or referendums.The June 23 vote by British voters to leave the European Union is a prime example. In the days just after the vote, the British stock market fell sharply, as did the country\u2019s currency. In the weeks that followed, the stock market largely rebounded, as there was no evident damage to British companies\u2019 profitability and the cheaper pound made shares of those companies a bargain. British stocks are now higher than they were the day of the vote, as measured by the FTSE 100 index. The pound has fallen further.Similarly, a Trump win would set in motion shifts that market analysts can only guess at. Even if the stock market dropped as analysts are forecasting, that might make the Federal Reserve less likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting, and low rates tend to strengthen asset prices.And investors would surely start to game out which companies stood to gain the most from Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of a lower corporate income tax rate and lighter regulation \u2014 and which could suffer from less availability of immigrant labor.Fundamentally, the tone from economic and market analysts is that they don\u2019t know exactly how Mr. Trump would govern. Nor do they know the composition of the new Congress and how it would deal with a Clinton or Trump administration.\u201cThe impact of an initial Trump shock to financial conditions would depend on whether the shock was persistent or not, which in turn is likely to depend importantly on which Trump shows up,\u201d wrote Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI, casting a President Trump as either \u201cthe angry populist of the campaign trail or the hard-nosed but ultimately pragmatic New York deal-maker.\u201d (Mr. Guha views a pragmatic Trump as the more probable outcome.)A victory by Mrs. Clinton would most likely signal continuity with President Obama\u2019s policies and fewer radical shifts. But there, too, the details would ultimately shape the fate of markets, and some of those are unknowable, like whether she would find willing partners to enact pieces of her agenda or would face steadfast resistance from Congress.In other words, think of the market reaction on Wednesday as a response to one mystery being solved (who won) while another one is created (how that person will lead).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Inconvenient Racial Truth", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byNotebookWith the race for the presidency entering its last days, Donald J. Trump last Wednesday once again made his pitch to black America: a new deal aimed just at them. \u201cI will be your greatest champion,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina. \u201cI will never ever take the African-American community for granted. Never, ever.\u201dThe hyperbolic remarks elicited the same collective eye roll among black Americans and white progressives that they have since Trump began regularly including black Americans in his platform in August. It was then, following days of unrest in Milwaukee after the police killed a black man there, that Trump flew to Wisconsin to give a speech on race. He headed not to the heavily black city where the embers of outrage still smoldered but instead, as his critics noted with glee, took the stage at the county fairgrounds of a bleached-out, deeply conservative Milwaukee suburb in order to address the problems of the \u201cinner city.\u201dThere was, of course, the usual and expected \u201claw and order\u201d and pro-police rhetoric that elicited hoots and cheers from the crowd. But then Trump, as he is known to do, added an unexpected twist.He pointed out the high unemployment rate among black men in Milwaukee, the number of households run by single mothers who were living in poverty and the low high-school-graduation rates. \u201cI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different and much better future,\u201d Trump told the crowd, which at times stood eerily silent. \u201cIt is time for our society to address some honest and very, very difficult truths. The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.\u201d Trump went on to say that Hillary Clinton \u201cpanders and talks down to communities of color,\u201d \u201cseeing them only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\u201d It was time, Trump proclaimed, that Democrats compete for black votes.But in his speeches, Trump was speaking more directly about the particular struggles of working-class black Americans and describing how the government should help them more than any presidential candidate in years. Let that uncomfortable truth sink in.Whatever his motives, Trump was talking about the black working class in a way that few national politicians do. By now it\u2019s no surprise that when they talk about black Americans as at all, Republican politicians typically conflate blackness with poverty, and then quickly blame black people for their struggles. In March 2014, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that the problems in the \u201cinner cities\u201d Trump was talking about were rooted not in the loss of manufacturing jobs and the flight of businesses and the tax base to government-subsidized suburbs, but on an absence of a \u201cculture of work.\u201dLiberals quickly lambasted Ryan for those remarks. But far too often, the way Democrats talk to, and about, black Americans is indistinguishable from the way their Republican counterparts do. And President Obama has been as guilty as anyone. A year before Ryan made his remarks, Obama delivered a commencement address at the historically black Morehouse College, where he warned the graduates at the prestigious all-male school that they shouldn\u2019t use racism as an excuse, and to be good fathers.Politicians regularly deploy this type of shaming when referring to, or even when addressing, black Americans. But it\u2019s hard to fathom a politician, Democrat or Republican, standing before a predominately white crowd in a sagging old coal town, and blaming the community\u2019s economic woes on poor parenting or lack of work ethic or a victim mentality. Those Americans, white Americans, are worthy of government help. Their problems are not of their own making, but systemic, institutional, out of their control. They are never blamed for their lot in life. They have had jobs snatched away by bad federal policy, their opportunities stolen by inept politicians.What I am saying is that when Trump claims Democratic governance has failed black people, when he asks \u201cthe blacks\u201d what they have to lose, he is asking a poorly stated version of a question that many black Americans have long asked themselves. What dividends, exactly, has their decades-long loyalty to the Democratic ticket paid them? By brushing Trump\u2019s criticism off as merely cynical or clueless rantings, we are missing an opportunity to have a real discussion of the failures of progressivism and Democratic leadership when it comes to black Americans.Instead of seeking aggressive racial-equality initiatives, Democrats too often have opted for a sort of trickle-down liberalism. If we work to strengthen unions, that will trickle down to you. If we work to strengthen health care, that will trickle down to you. If we work to make all schools better, that will trickle down to you. After decades of Democratic loyalty, too many black Americans are still awaiting that trickle.Most black Americans live neither in poverty nor in the inner city. And even those of us who do live in inner cities aren\u2019t living in hell. But the inequality that black Americans experience is stark. Black children are more segregated from white children now than at any point since the early \u201970s. United States census data shows that a black middle-class family is more likely to live in a poor neighborhood than a poor white family. The wealth gap between white and black families is the widest it has been in nearly three decades. This is true in cities and states run by Republicans. This is true in cities and states run by Democrats.But it is also true that black Americans have not always been single-party voters, and they don\u2019t have to remain so. If Democrats want to keep black voters, they need to work for those votes, because one day Republicans might wise up. Until then, when Trump asks what the hell do black Americans have to lose? Well, a hell of a lot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisia Seeks Foreign Investment to Cement Democratic Gains", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byTUNIS \u2014 The emir of Qatar came in person with a pledge of $1.25 billion. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, France and other European partners promised substantial amounts, too.The show of support, as the Tunisian government threw open its doors this week at a two-day investment conference, was a measure of the stake the entire region feels in keeping Tunisia\u2019s democratic transition on track.After a year of political drift and growing social tensions, the conference was a prominent attempt by the government to secure support. It was opened in Tunis on Tuesday by President B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi, who told international partners that Tunisia faced an exceptional situation, a sentiment that other officials expressed.\u201cWe want to show what we have done in the last five years in changing society, in changing mentalities, going through democracy, which is a huge, enormous change,\u201d Tunisia\u2019s prime minister, Youssef Chahed, said in an interview before the conference. \u201cIt is a call to the world to come and be part of the story.\u201dThe country has been buffeted by civil unrest, terrorism and full-fledged war with its neighbor Libya, once a major trading partner and source of employment, in the five years since the popular uprising that overthrew President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring.The Tunisian economy has been in decline since 2011, and the government is struggling with a growing budget deficit. Investors fled the post-revolution disarray and have been further scared off by terrorism since 2013.Successive governments have been absorbed with the democratic transition \u2014 and their own political divisions \u2014 and economic reforms have largely been delayed or neglected. Annual economic growth has averaged only 1.5 percent since the revolution.Government spending, meanwhile, soared as the government sought to ease social tensions \u2014 poverty, inequality and joblessness were the main grievances that incited the revolution \u2014 by creating 200,000 public-sector jobs and raising wages.A growing terrorism threat forced the government to triple its security budget, to buy new equipment and upgrade army and police forces, according to the prime minister.At 41, Mr. Chahed is Tunisia\u2019s youngest-ever prime minister. Only three months into the job, he faces the urgent task of rescuing the economy.\u201cWe succeeded in the political transition,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Tunisians agree on the model we are following, there is a national consensus about that, which is very important. Now we are moving to the economic and social side.\u201dMr. Chahed was plucked from relative obscurity to be prime minister by President Essebsi in the summer, after the predecessor, Habib Essid, lost a vote of confidence. Mr. Chahed represents a new generation of Tunisian politicians that had no part in government before the revolution.He holds a doctorate in agribusiness \u2014 for which he studied partly at Iowa State University \u2014 and worked for several years as a consultant for the United States Department of Agriculture at the American Embassy in Tunis.He says his focus will be on creating jobs, especially for the youths in the disadvantaged regions in the interior of the country. This week, he will embark on a tour of the country to start a $250 million microcredit program for young entrepreneurs.\u201cOne of the biggest problems in Tunisia is that one in three unemployed is educated, around 33 percent of unemployed people has a higher degree,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one of the biggest challenges. We need to create growth, inclusive growth, equally distributed between the coast and inner area of the country.\u201dThe United States was not among those announcing new funds. But it has been Tunisia\u2019s most important partner in combating terrorism, providing training and technical assistance, including basing drones in Tunisia to help survey the border with Libya, Mr. Chahed said.Many conference participants praised Tunisia for completing a difficult political transition from dictatorship \u2014 drafting a constitution, holding free elections and even winning the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving political differences through a process of national dialogue.Yet concern for Tunisia\u2019s economic situation was evident. Sheikh Tamim said the conference was \u201can example of how to support a promising experience and to avoid the worst.\u201dWestern representatives, led by Christine Lagarde, president of the International Monetary Fund, warned Tunisia\u2019s government that it was crucial to overhaul the economy and improve performance or risk failing its population.\u201cThe government needs to act, too,\u201d she said in a video message to the conference. \u201cKeeping public finances healthy, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, and maintaining a steady pace of reforms will be crucial tasks in the months and years ahead.\u201dTunisia\u2019s leaders, who have spent much of the time since 2011 engrossed in political turf battles, have delayed economic measures that the I.M.F. and other financial institutions have called for. Tunisia\u2019s powerful unions and business leaders have also resisted change.It has taken three years for successive governments to pass a new investment code and a law covering public-private partnerships. In a signal of the lack of progress, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tunisia\u2019s credit rating just before the conference.The country of 11 million is still constrained by a closed system of patronage that benefited a small circle of rich coastal families and left much of the inner regions of the country impoverished and undeveloped. Cronyism and corruption, hallmarks of Mr. Ben Ali\u2019s dictatorship, remain problematic, I.M.F. and World Bank analysts have warned.\u201cWe are really aware of the need for reforms, and now we are really engaged on this,\u201d Mr. Chahed said.His government is holding tough negotiations with unions and business leaders to tighten public expenditure, and he plans further legislation to combat corruption and speed up reforms in 2017.Tunisia remains a good investment prospect, he insists, with its proximity to Europe, a gateway to Africa, and highly skilled manpower.\u201cWhat is very important today is to succeed on the economic side to consolidate the political transition,\u201d he said, \u201cand to make this democracy definitely in the club of developed, democratic countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tyler Anbinder\u2019s sweeping \u201cCity of Dreams: The 400-Year Epic History of Immigrant New York\u201d scores big on both counts. A richly textured guide to the history of our immigrant nation\u2019s pinnacle immigrant city has managed to enter the stage during an election season that has resurrected this historically fraught topic in all its fierceness.With the exception of a thinly argued final chapter, the writer, a professor of history at George Washington University and the author of two previous books on early American history, rightly avoids drawing explicit lessons for today\u2019s controversies from the past, though readers can find plenty. Support for the ideals of diversity and tolerance on the one hand and fears of tribalism and social fragmentation on the other collide on almost every page, beginning in the chaotic, polyglot trading outpost that was New Amsterdam. At the southern tip of Manhattan, Dutch fur traders, English merchants\u2019 sons, random fortune seekers from Spain or Norway, Welsh tavern keepers, Gaelic blacksmiths, religious dissidents and a smattering of Jews and freed slaves somehow managed to conduct business even while speaking 18 different languages.Over the next two centuries the arrival of starving, war-ravaged, oppressed or just plain restless huddled masses, almost all of them from Europe, pushed the settlement north, turning New York into the largest and most diverse city in the United States. By 1860, an extraordinary 69 percent of voting-age New Yorkers were foreign-born. Only Vienna and Berlin had more German inhabitants, and they were still considerably outnumbered by the Irish. Fifty years later the flood of foreigners, who began disembarking at the iconic Ellis Island in 1892, showed no signs of receding. As many as a million migrants, an increasing number of them Italians and Russian Jews, arrived annually in the years leading up to World War\u202fI. After Congress passed restrictive laws in the 1920s, the city experienced its first and only sustained immigration drought. But in 1965, with the passage of the Hart-Celler Act, Gotham began to return to its original immigrant-rich identity. Today more than a third of the population is foreign-born. \u201cTo me this city appeared as a tremendous overstuffed roar, where people just burst with a desire to live,\u201d a Russian immigrant, Morris Shapiro, recalled about his arrival in the 1920s. His description might well strike today\u2019s migrants, now largely from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia, as apt.Anbinder devotes at least one chapter to each of the major immigrant groups \u2014 Irish, Germans, Russian Jews and Italians \u2014 vividly detailing the political turmoil, famines and pogroms that led them to leave their homes and families, the horrific steerage voyages across a turbulent Atlantic Ocean and their lives in New York. Despite the Babel of cultures, newcomers adapted to New York in similar ways, by first creating their own isolated ethnic islands. Early Irish arrivals moved into the wooden tenements in the notorious, gang-infested Five Points. The area we now know as the Lower East Side was Kleindeutschland, a German enclave further subdivided as South Germans, Hessians, Prussians and Bavarians laid claim to separate neighborhoods. Likewise in Little Italy, Sicilians clustered near Elizabeth Street while Neapolitans and Calabrians kept company along Mulberry Street.The social benefits of the immigrant enclave were immense, especially at a time when governments didn\u2019t provide much in the way of garbage collection \u2014 roving pigs were about the best slum dwellers could expect until later in the 19th century \u2014 much less social services. In their transplanted villages, newly arrived Irish found jobs on the docks or as servants with the help of a cousin\u2019s brother-in-law on the next block. Lower East Side Jews could track down tailoring jobs on a tip from a neighbor. Ethnic groups sorted themselves into distinct occupations, as they still do: Italians became barbers, shoemakers, longshoremen and newsboys; Germans ruled the brewery, peddling and saloon businesses.Some of the enclaves became reeking, overcrowded slums that would catalyze progressive reformers like Jacob Riis, the author of the classic \u201cHow the Other Half Lives.\u201d But they also hummed with Tocquevillian energy. Immigrant civic groups sprang up to meet every sort of need from the medical to the recreational to the spiritual. Neighborhood churches, some of them built and sustained by successful fellow immigrants with a stake in edifying their greenhorn countrymen, were crucial, especially to the poorest migrants. As early as 1756, Scottish immigrants founded the still extant St. Andrews Society under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. Churches also started schools and hospitals; by the early 20th century, New York had eight Catholic hospitals alongside an assortment of Lutheran, Methodist, Jewish and Baptist institutions. The Germans were avid participants in gymnastic societies. Every ethnic group had its own home-language newspaper.Hostility from the native-born majority undoubtedly intensified ethnic separatism. \u201cHordes of wild Irishmen\u201d were especially reviled: \u201cAny country or color .\u2008.\u2008. except Irish,\u201d read one 1853 Herald help wanted ad. But Jews and Italians were hardly spared: Rental ads might warn, \u201cNo Jews and no dogs.\u201d In the eyes of many New Yorkers, the immigrants\u2019 \u201clow moral tendency\u201d \u2014 the words are Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u2014 made them seem hopeless as future citizens. As the numbers of foreigners grew, officials passed harsh restrictions, starting with Peter Stuyvesant\u2019s limits on the rights of Lutherans, Quakers and Jews, continuing with the Alien and Sedition Act of the late 18th century and the Naturalization Act (which expanded from five to 14 the years before an immigrant could become a citizen) and then in the 19th century a variety of statutes barring convicts, \u201cidiots,\u201d paupers, polygamists, epileptics, anarchists, prostitutes and other outcasts. Finally, in 1924 the National Origins Act, \u201cone of the most momentous laws enacted in all of American history,\u201d imposed strict quotas and turned Ellis Island into a historical curiosity.It\u2019s tempting to chalk up this anti-immigrant record to simple bigotry, but \u201cCity of Dreams\u201d casts doubt on that conclusion. The Know Nothing party accused German states of programmatically shipping their poorest and least desirable citizens to the United States; according to Anbinder, they turned out to be right. Decades later, New Yorkers worried that newcomers would become a \u201cpublic charge\u201d for a reason. Their city was ill-equipped to help the many desperately poor and ill; housing was scarce and shoddy, creating disease-ridden slums more crowded than modern Mumbai. And accusations of divided loyalties and subversion were not necessarily paranoid fantasies. As World War I broke out, German immigrants were discovered preparing to return to fight for their home country. It was most likely Italian immigrant anarchists who killed 38 in a Wall Street bombing in 1920. And during World War\u202fII, Anbinder writes, \u201cNew York was crawling with immigrant spies.\u201dThese stories raise the question: How did New York turn so many of its immigrants into able American citizens? The enclaves were a life preserver for recent arrivals, but also isolated them in their Old World customs and their poverty. Women and children in particular didn\u2019t venture beyond their immediate blocks. \u201cI did not see any reason for learning English,\u201d one immigrant woman recalled. \u201cEverywhere I lived, or worked, or fooled around there were only Italians.\u201d The text of \u201cCity of Dreams\u201d clocks in at nearly 600 pages, yet it gives little insight into how newcomers like these assimilated, and how their children and grandchildren were educated into the growing middle class, as they so often were.To delve into that question, an especially crucial one today as immigrants struggle to make their way in an \u201chourglass\u201d postindustrial economy, readers of this admirable history will have to look elsewhere.Kay Hymowitz is the William E. Simon fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of \u201cThe New Brooklyn,\u201d due out in January.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Identity Politics of Whiteness", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThree years ago, I read \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d to my daughter. She smiled as she heard about Huck\u2019s mischief, his jokes, his dress-up games, but it was his relationship with the runaway slave Jim that intrigued her most. Huck and Jim travel together as Jim seeks his freedom; at times, Huck wrestles with his decision to help. In the end, Tom Sawyer concocts an elaborate scheme for Jim\u2019s release.When we finished the book, my daughter had a question: Why didn\u2019t Tom just tell Jim the truth \u2014 that Miss Watson had already freed him in her will? She is not alone in asking; scholars have long debated this issue. One answer lies in white identity, which needs black identity in order to define itself, and therefore cannot exist without it.\u201cIdentity\u201d is a vexing word. It is racial or sexual or national or religious or all those things at once. Sometimes it is proudly claimed, other times hidden or denied. But the word is almost never applied to whiteness. Racial identity is taken to be exclusive to people of color: When we speak about race, it is in connection with African-Americans or Latinos or Asians or Native People or some other group that has been designated a minority. \u201cWhite\u201d is seen as the default, the absence of race. In school curriculums, one month is reserved for the study of black history, while the rest of the year is just plain history; people will tell you they are fans of black or Latin music, but few will claim they love white music.This year\u2019s election has disturbed that silence. The president-elect earned the votes of a majority of white people while running a campaign that explicitly and consistently appealed to white identity and anxiety. At the heart of this anxiety is white people\u2019s increasing awareness that they will become a statistical minority in this country within a generation. The paradox is that they have no language to speak about their own identity. \u201cWhite\u201d is a category that has afforded them an evasion from race, rather than an opportunity to confront it.In his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump regularly tied America\u2019s problems to others. Immigration must be reformed, he told us, to stop the rapists and drug dealers coming here from Mexico. Terrorism could be stopped by banning Muslims from entering the country. The big banks would not be held in check by his opponent, whose picture he tweeted alongside a Star of David. The only people that the president-elect never faulted for anything were whites. These people he spoke of not as an indistinguishable mass but as a multitude of individuals, victims of a system that was increasingly rigged against them.A common refrain in the days after the election was \u201cNot all his voters are racist.\u201d But this will not do, because those voters chose a candidate who promised them relief from their problems at the expense of other races. They may claim innocence now, but it seems to me that when a leading chapter of the Ku Klux Klan announces plans to hold a victory parade for the president-elect, the time for innocence is long past.Hillary Clinton said she was concerned about every community, including white communities \u201cwhere we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.\u201d She said she planned to revitalize what she called \u201ccoal country\u201d and explore spending more in communities with persistent generational poverty. Senator Bernie Sanders took a different view: \u201cWe can talk about it as a racial issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is a general economic issue.\u201d Workers of all races, he said, have been hurt by trade deals like Nafta. \u201cWe need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country.\u201dThis resonated with me: I, too, come from the working class, and from the significant portion of it that is not white. Neither of my parents went to college. Still, they managed to put their children through school and buy a home \u2014 a life that, for many in the working class, is impossible now. Nine months after that debate, we have found out exactly how much attention we should have been paying such families. The same white working-class voters who re-elected Obama four years ago did not cast their ballots for Clinton this year. These voters suffer from economic disadvantages even as they enjoy racial advantages. But it is impossible for them to notice these racial advantages if they live in rural areas where everyone around them is white. What they perceive instead is the cruel sense of being forgotten by the political class and condescended to by the cultural one.While poor white voters are being scrutinized now, less attention has been paid to voters who are white and rich. White voters flocked to Trump by a wide margin, and he won a majority of voters who earn more than $50,000 a year, despite their relative economic safety. A majority of white women chose him, too, even though more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual assault. No, the top issue that drove Trump\u2019s voters to the polls was not the economy \u2014 more voters concerned about that went to Clinton. It was immigration, an issue on which we\u2019ve abandoned serious debate and become engulfed in sensational stories about rapists crossing the southern border or the pending imposition of Shariah law in the Midwest.Much has been made about privilege in this election. I will readily admit to many privileges. I have employer-provided health care. I live in a nice suburb. I am not dependent on government benefits. But I am also an immigrant and a person of color and a Muslim. On the night of the election, I was away from my family. Speaking to them on the phone, I could hear the terror in my daughter\u2019s voice as the returns came in. The next morning, her friends at school, most of them Asian or Jewish or Hispanic, were in tears. My daughter called on the phone. \u201cHe can\u2019t make us leave, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019re citizens.\u201dMy husband and I did our best to quiet her fears. No, we said. He cannot make us leave. But every time I have thought about this conversation \u2014 and I have thought about it dozens of times, in my sleepless nights since the election \u2014 I have felt less certain. For all the privileges I can pass on to my daughter, there is one I cannot: whiteness.Laila Lalami is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Account,\u201d a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bleak Outlook for Trump\u2019s Promises to Coal Miners", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump made coal a centerpiece of his campaign, holding rousing rallies with miners in hard hats, who he said had been neglected under eight years of the Obama administration. The strategy paid off, helping him score crucial wins in Pennsylvania and Ohio.Now, though, coal may prove a different sort of symbol \u2014 that is, of the challenges that the president-elect will face delivering on his many promises to restore struggling sectors of the American economy.The United States coal industry and the jobs that support it have been in decline for decades as a result of environmental concerns, automation in mining and slowdowns in manufacturing industries that burned coal for power.And these days, no matter who is president, coal is at the mercy of market economics. Coal\u2019s No. 1 rival is cheap, cleaner-burning natural gas \u2014 which could become an even more potent competitor under the incoming administration. The probable easing of restrictions on pipeline building and loosening of rules on gas exploration and production would mean more natural gas reaching the market.Despite recent increases, coal\u2019s price has been drifting downward for years. But the price of natural gas has fallen even more sharply.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Trump presidency will have a material impact on bringing coal miners back to work,\u201d said Ted O\u2019Brien, a coal analyst at Doyle Trading Consultants, a leading energy industry research firm.\u201cHe may eliminate the regulatory overhang,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, referring to the environmental rules that have cast a shadow over coal, \u201cbut I have a hard time seeing a surge in coal demand.\u201dCoal\u2019s long decline predates President Obama\u2019s arrival in the White House in 2009. The collapse of the American steel industry in late 20th century reduced demand for the metallurgical coal that is mined most prominently in Appalachia.In addition, utilities have been slow to build new coal-fired power plants in recent decades because of air-quality concerns over the burning of the other type of coal \u2014 thermal coal \u2014 that is used for power plants and is mined across the country.Mr. Trump campaigned to help both kinds of coal recover.But natural gas may prove unbeatable. The hydraulic fracturing boom in shale fields that began a decade ago flooded the market with cheap natural gas that continues to erode coal\u2019s market share. As recently as early 2008, coal was the source of roughly half of the electricity generated in the United States. Now it is down to about 30 percent.\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of gas in this country, and that is going to hold gas prices down,\u201d said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major oil and natural gas producer, who said he voted for Mr. Trump.The bleak outlook for coal may explain why some of the industry\u2019s executives have been reluctant to comment on how the Trump presidency may help their business: They may be wary of raising false hopes among their workers. And many may be reluctant to repeat past industry arguments that climate change was a hoax. Instead, coal producers would rather have tax incentives to support environmental improvements for coal-fired plants, as a way to ensure coal\u2019s long-term viability even beyond a Trump administration.\u201cAny exuberance has to be tempered,\u201d said Richard Reavey, vice president for government and public affairs at Cloud Peak Energy, a major Western coal producer. \u201cThe view should be cautious optimism.\u201dBeyond the declining demand for coal, there has been an even more fundamental factor behind the shift in coal mining employment, which peaked decades ago. As with those in many industries, jobs in mining have fallen victim to automation. High-tech shears can now shave coal from underground seams \u2014 work that formerly required hundreds of miners. Surface mining, which has been increasing in recent years, has also replaced many workers with heavy machinery.As a result, there are now just over 50,000 jobs in the American coal mining industry, down from a peak of more than 250,000 in 1980.Most of the losses have come in Appalachian mines \u2014 which produce coal for making steel and electricity \u2014 because they are older, deeper and more expensive to operate. But automation is hitting employment in mines across the country.\u201cThe industry is simply not going to produce the number of jobs that were historically available in the coal fields,\u201d said Patrick C. McGinley, a law professor at West Virginia University, who focuses on coal issues.A few years ago coal executives hoped exports \u2014 which represent about 8 percent of national production \u2014 would boom along with the economies of China and the developing world. But exports peaked in 2012.Since then, slower economic growth in the developing world, along with climate and pollution concerns, have depressed demand for coal.The same considerations have prompted international development banks and large investment companies like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to pull back on financing new coal-fired plants \u2014 a trend that is unlikely to change under Mr. Trump.The Trump administration could help the coal industry somewhat by unwinding President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which was designed to replace coal-fired utility plants with those using natural gas and renewable energy sources. But the effects of the plan so far may be hard to reverse.The tighter air pollution regulations, which are still under challenge in court, forced utilities to choose between revamping aging coal-fired power plants to make them cleaner, or switching to natural gas or green sources like wind and solar. Utilities across the country typically decided to switch.Last year, as a result, 94 coal-fired power plants were closed across the country, and this year 40 more are expected to close by the end of December. It is most unlikely that Mr. Trump could do anything to bring those plants back online.\u201cAll the older power plants that burned Eastern coal have been basically torn down, dismantled, put in mothballs, some of them permanently,\u201d said Robert J. Zik, the now-retired former vice president for operations at TECO Coal, a subsidiary of TECO Energy that was sold to another operator last year.Other marginal measures the Trump administration might be able to take on coal\u2019s behalf, industry executives say, include rolling back the rules that protect streams from surface mining and easing those for leases and royalties on coal mined on federal lands.Industry executives say that to extend the life of at least some of the 400 or so coal-burning power plants still in use in the United States, the Trump administration and lawmakers in Congress could work with them on \u201cclean coal\u201d initiatives.Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, prices of some types of American coal \u2014 particularly the metallurgical variety that is mostly mined in Appalachia and is used to make steel \u2014 had been rallying.That, in turn, had sent the stock prices of some coal mining operations soaring in recent months \u2014 a huge win for hedge funds that bought up the debt and equity of the companies when they were cheap.But the big driver for coal\u2019s price run-up was the dwindling supply, as American producers cut back even as Chinese mines were curbing their own production in recent months. Those price benefits are expected to be short-lived, as demand is depressed both by China\u2019s pivot toward cleaner fuels to address the country\u2019s endemic air pollution and by its new focus on a less energy-intensive consumer economy.\u201cThere is optimism that with government support, coal is more viable,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, the industry analyst. \u201cBut the same headwinds still exist that have existed over the past five years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Research Center to Explore Ethics of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byCarnegie Mellon University plans to announce on Wednesday that it will create a research center that focuses on the ethics of artificial intelligence.The ethics center, called the K&L Gates Endowment for Ethics and Computational Technologies, is being established at a time of growing international concern about the impact of A.I. technologies. That has already led to an array of academic, governmental and private efforts to explore a technology that until recently was largely the stuff of science fiction.In the last decade, faster computer chips, cheap sensors and large collections of data have helped researchers improve on computerized tasks like machine vision and speech recognition, as well as robotics.\u201cWe are at a unique point in time where the technology is far ahead of society\u2019s ability to restrain it,\u201d Mr. Suresh noted.But at the same time, he said some people are a bit too optimistic about their claims of A.I. advances, particularly when it comes to autonomous vehicles.Mr. Suresh said he personally did not think self-driving cars would be in widespread use in the next three years.The Uber laboratory has been a sensitive spot for Carnegie Mellon. The field of artificial intelligence emerged in part at Carnegie Mellon in the 1950s in the work of faculty who developed software that showed how computer algorithms could intelligently solve problems.University officials said the departing faculty have been replaced and 13 additional professors have been hired since the defections. They also said that between 2011 and 2015, Carnegie Mellon faculty and staff created 164 start-up companies.University officials pointed to a partnership the school entered into last year with Boeing to use machine-learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data generated by modern aircraft such as the Boeing Dreamliner.The new center is being created with a $10 million gift from K&L Gates, an international law firm headquartered in Pittsburgh. It will draw from several academic disciplines and will initially add two faculty and three positions for graduate students. It will also establish a biennial conference on ethical issues facing the field.K&L Gates is one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates\u2019s father, William H. Gates Sr., was involved in the firm until his retirement in 1998. Peter J. Kalis, chairman of the law firm, said the potential impact of A.I. technology on the economy and culture made it essential that as a society we make thoughtful, ethical choices about how the software and machines are used.\u201cCarnegie Mellon resides at the intersection of many disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a synthesis of the best thinking of all of these disciplines for society to define the ethical constraints on the emerging A.I. technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Triple-Plus, Britain Nonplused", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When the British voted to leave the European Union on June 23, I assumed that the meaning and ramifications of this historic decision would be a topic unchallenged in the chatterings of the Westminster village for months, probably years. I was wrong.Since the early hours of Nov. 9, the political class in this country has been mesmerized by Donald J. Trump\u2019s election, and what it signifies. Brexit remains the inescapable backdrop, an often dreary legal and administrative process that is now the subject of a rancorous court case. But the main event is elsewhere: In the corridors of Westminster, the president-elect\u2019s victory and his plans are virtually all that ministers and members of Parliament want to talk about.There are structural and historical reasons for this. It is often said that when America sneezes, Britain catches a cold. The two nations have long been intimately connected by language, culture, commercial ties and a strong security alliance. When an American president is elected, the British prime minister of the day is naturally reminded of the bonds between Roosevelt and Churchill, Reagan and Thatcher, and \u2014 less auspiciously, some would say \u2014 George W. Bush and Tony Blair.Even Barack Obama and David Cameron, despite disagreements, still celebrated the \u201cessential relationship.\u201d So it is a political reflex for Theresa May to extend the hand of friendship to Mr. Trump and encourage vigorous diplomacy with the incoming administration.The foundation of Britain\u2019s defense policy remains its commitment to NATO. Does the president-elect share this position and all it entails? Likewise, his curious bromance with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, dismays those in Britain who fervently believe Russia must be contained.No less alarming to British politicians are Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist instincts and his radical lurch away from free-trade orthodoxy. The British economy is already imperiled by the uncertainty of Brexit. A global trade war is the last thing Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, needs.Drill down into the tectonic plates of British political opinion and you will find more fundamental trepidation. Some have persuaded themselves that being in office brings \u201cnormalization,\u201d and that Mr. Trump\u2019s vile campaign language was mere shtick. But the appointments made to date, especially the choice of Stephen K. Bannon as the president-elect\u2019s chief strategist, have scarcely supported this complacent thesis.What ministers truly fear is that Mr. Trump was right when he predicted that his election would be \u201cBrexit plus plus plus.\u201d They fret that his victory and Britain\u2019s referendum are linked symptoms of a deep fracture in the global democratic order, signaling a malfunction in the free world\u2019s traditional political machinery. In both votes, immigration and race clearly played a central part, as did the conviction of many white voters that they were being left behind by globalization and the supposedly preferential treatment of minorities.Britain does not yet have a developed alt-right, as America\u2019s white nationalist movement calls itself. But the germ of that political current can be detected in the digital nexus between the U.K. Independence Party, which has long campaigned against \u201cmass immigration\u201d and for Britain to leave the European Union, and sites like Breitbart and nationalists on social media.While Mr. Trump seems to prefer the demagogue\u2019s methods (putting up walls, tearing down trade deals), Mrs. May presents herself as a reformer. Her approach \u2014 free trade, labor migration and global interdependence \u2014 is the right one, but it is a hard path.Promoting education, science and technology may, in the long term, yield a British work force better suited to the buffeting winds of globalization. But there is a dawning realization in Britain, sharpened by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, that there will still be many who are left behind by automation, the international movement of labor and the pace of change. What will these people do all day, and what can government do to help them?The scale of such questions is breathtaking. There have long been rumblings against the inequities of global trade, not least in the form of the Occupy movement. Despite this growing groundswell, from the end of the Cold War in 1989 to just now, in 2016, it remained orthodox for mainstream politicians to embrace the emerging global market without reservation as the engine of growth that it was and still is.No longer. The defects of the liberal global order have finally come back to bite its political tribunes. Which is why so many British ministers seem so fretful as they pace the halls of Westminster. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has forced them to confront a horrible truth: Whatever they thought they knew before, from now on, anything is possible.Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a political columnist for The Guardian and The Evening Standard and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexican Peso Sinks as Donald Trump Secures Victory", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe Mexican peso, which for investors has been a proxy for Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential prospects, took a beating early Wednesday in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.The currency slid more than 12 percent against the dollar as investors began to wonder what would happen to Mexico\u2019s autos, oil and other exports, most of which it sends north to the United States.In early trading on Wednesday, the peso had trimmed its loss to less than 8 percent.The peso is used as a broad proxy for Latin American and other emerging-market investments that are less liquid and easy to hedge. That means that it bears the brunt of market sentiment and that it is a frequent choice of anyone looking to bet against emerging markets, which in turn contributes to its hyperactive response to risky events.The market may have been unprepared for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, but it was not unaware of the risk. Going into Monday, it became very expensive to buy options on the Mexican peso \u2014 a reflection of the market\u2019s pricing of uncertainty over the election outcome.Traders and investors, however, were not fully prepared for the result, and that lack of preparation contributed to the peso\u2019s rout.Deutsche Bank currency strategists, in a note to investors on Monday, compared options to buy and options to sell on the peso-dollar combination and concluded that the market appeared to be covered if Hillary Clinton won the election but exposed if Mr. Trump prevailed.The Mexican currency is the most traded in emerging markets, and it was sensitive to polls throughout the campaign, waxing when Mrs. Clinton was in the lead and waning when Mr. Trump took the edge.Still, even in less-sensitive market conditions, the peso has been struggling against the dollar. The value of Mexico\u2019s currency is tied to the country\u2019s oil exports, and it has been on a losing streak since the price of oil started to tumble in 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Surging Stocks May Not Mean the Economy Trusts Trump", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThe early stock market reaction to Donald J. Trump\u2019s election victory was overwhelmingly positive. But that doesn\u2019t mean a Trump presidency will be good for the economy.Stock markets often serve as an economic scoreboard: Increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory. But these inferences are too facile, because some increases connote good news, while others do not.Reading market movements \u2014 such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early postelection days, as well as the subsequent ups and downs \u2014 requires a Rosetta stone. Constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy.Buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits. The share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be.That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and stock markets, when they work, excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the market\u2019s overall prediction. If traders feel stock prices are low relative to future profits, they will bid up prices; if they feel prices are high, they will sell and drive down prices. In this way, the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market.An increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits. The movement in stock prices has a direct effect: Shareholders are immediately wealthier. Anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the all-too-familiar feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire. This does not benefit all people in the economy \u2014 some shares are held by citizens of other countries, and the shares held in this country are not equitably held \u2014 but at the least, a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry.But rising stock prices can spell good news for other reasons: Even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future. This is because when companies prosper, consumers frequently also do well. This notion can be somewhat counterintuitive. After all, we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more money, they do so at our expense, that is, by overcharging us.In a well-functioning market, though, the interests of companies and consumers are aligned. Businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their products: Higher profits mean happier customers. The economy as a whole is doing well.By way of example, suppose Apple unveils a new iPhone that buoys its stock price. Traders are bullish about the iPhone\u2019s robust sales. They are focused on the fact that these sales add to Apple\u2019s coffers. But each sale, assuming consumers are choosing wisely, is also presumably producing joy for consumers.This example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy. Sometimes companies can profit without improving consumers\u2019 lives, or possibly even by worsening them.For example, part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a Trump administration would slash regulations. That may be good for some companies\u2019 bottom lines, but is that good for everyone else? It depends. Do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for consumers? Or do they also hinder products that are bad for consumers?Take the case of Wells Fargo, which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in customers\u2019 names without their knowledge. These accounts were profitable for Wells Fargo, but surely not good for consumers.The extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory watchdog: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Trump\u2019s election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed. But if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like Wells Fargo\u2019s can flourish, that\u2019s hardly cause for celebration. And it\u2019s not good news for the economy.In short, whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for nonshareholders depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at consumers\u2019 expense.There is a final factor to consider: The capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited.In 1997, Michael Rashes, then a doctoral student in economics at Harvard and now a principal at Bracebridge Capital, noticed something funny about stock prices. On Oct. 1, WorldCom made a bid for MCI Communications. Shares listed under the symbol MCI went up that day. In itself, that wasn\u2019t surprising: Good news raises prices.The problem, as Mr. Rashes noted, was that the ticker symbol MCI belonged to Massmutual Corporate Investors. This fund had nothing to do with MCI Communications, which traded under the ticker symbol MCIC. His paper was published in The Journal of Finance in 2001, under the title \u201cMassively Confused Investors Making Conspicuously Ignorant Choices (MCI-MCIC)\u201d.This was not a freak event: Traders are highly fallible. On Oct. 4, 2013, for example, after Twitter announced its initial public offering, the stock price of the Boston-based consumer electronics chain Tweeter, which had filed for bankruptcy in 2007, rose to 15 cents a share from the previous day\u2019s close of less than 1 cent. Trading was eventually halted.A large body of research now emphasizes a basic fact: Despite the rise of computers and artificial intelligence, markets are, at their root, made up of human traders. Yes, the crowd is often smarter than the individual. But smarter does not mean perfect. Many of the biases of individual traders become broader market biases. In fact, some new biases are introduced when traders feed off one another and compound their mistakes.On election night, the votes at the ballot box mattered. In the financial markets, another kind of vote counting took place. Just as the presidential election tells us only who voters believe is good for the country, the market can tell us only what traders believe is good for a company\u2019s bottom line.It is an all-too-familiar adage that democracy is the weakest form of government, except for all the others. Similarly, stock markets are the weakest way to predict the future, except for all the others.An earlier version of this article misstated the rise in shares listed under the symbol MCI related to investor confusion over a similar stock symbol (MCIC). The shares in MCI rose 2.35 percent on Oct. 1, 1997, not 18.56 percent.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While the agency discovered the extent of the fraudulent accounts at Wells Fargo, it was not the first to uncover the activity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Killing of Saudi Student Shakes Wisconsin College Town", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byFor nearly a week, the police in Menomonie, Wis., have been at a loss to identify a suspect or a motive in the fatal beating of a Saudi Arabian college student outside a pizza restaurant. Now, the city is trying to change that by raising money for a reward. The tally so far? $20,000.He was taken to the hospital in Eau Claire, where he died on Monday, the police said.After his death, the Police Department said it did not believe there was an \u201congoing threat\u201d to the community, though it said it had no information about a possible motive. By Thursday, that apparently had not changed.However, a department commander, Todd W. Swartz, said in an email that witnesses had described a possible suspect: a six-foot-tall white man.In the absence of information about whether there had been a racial motive, the death of Mr. Alnahdi has shaken the small city in the western part of the state and has shocked the university campus, where the 9,600 students include a tight-knit group of 142 from Saudi Arabia.\u201cThere is more fear, especially because we don\u2019t know who the assailant is,\u201d Michael Lee, an international student adviser, said in a telephone interview on Thursday from the campus. \u201cIt was an extremely rare, almost-unheard-of event.\u201dMr. Lee said that the number of Saudi students had grown in the past four years, attracted to the university\u2019s engineering and business curriculum. The Saudi kingdom sponsors about 80,000 to 100,000 students in the United States as a way to diversify its economy and future work force, he said.\u201cMany people are looking for ways to help the police find the assailant, and we hope this fund will generate the information needed to lead to an arrest and conviction,\u201d Mr. Meyer said.The Council of American-Islamic Relations, a national civil rights organization, said it would add $5,000 to the fund, and sent its Minnesota chapter executive director, Jaylani Hussein, to meet with students and staff members at the university on Wednesday.\u201cThey are all afraid,\u201d Mr. Alkohmos said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cA lot of international students are asking for more police officers to be more in downtown every weekend, and just to increase security for a while for us to feel safe.\u201d\u201cThis is NOT who we are!\u201d another note read.And a third from his teachers: \u201cRest in peace. We will always remember you.\u201d\u201cGood luck,\u201d a Facebook reader, Bill Miller, wrote after the reward was announced. \u201cThere are also certainly people still in town who knew enough to convict the man/men who murdered Sani Tela in 1985,\u201d the reader wrote, referring to a Nigerian student who was beaten and run over. \u201cThat was a disgraceful moment for this city, and I fear there may be a similar outcome this time.\u201dMargee Stienecker, Mr. Alnahdi\u2019s English-language tutor for more than a year, said she remembered the city\u2019s reaction after the events in the 1980s. \u201cThere was quite an outcry,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat didn\u2019t represent the community, either.\u201dThe university said it was offering counseling to anyone who wanted it. A memorial service for Mr. Alnahdi was planned for late Thursday afternoon.\u201cIt is a normal reaction in a time like this to look for reasons for this tragedy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI certainly have many questions and concerns that I wish we had answers to about what led to Hussain\u2019s assault. But I, along with everyone else who grieves for Hussain, have to wait for the outcome of the Menomonie Police Department investigation into this horrific incident.\u201cIt is vitally important that no one jumps to any conclusions about what may have precipitated this attack before the facts are known.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption gave an incorrect spelling from the police for the given name of the Saudi Arabian college student who was killed. It is Hussain, not Hussein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: \u2018This Is All About Income\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byTBILISI, Georgia \u2014 Jobless and with graduation looming, a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia decided early this year that money could be made from America\u2019s voracious appetite for passionately partisan political news. He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it did not work,\u201d said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real \u2014 and completely fake \u2014 news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.\u201cIt\u2019s all Trump,\u201d Mr. Egan said by telephone. \u201cPeople go nuts for it.\u201dWith Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?Some analysts worry that foreign intelligence agencies are meddling in American politics and using fake news to influence elections. But one window into how the meat in fake sausages gets ground can be found in the buccaneering internet economy, where satire produced in Canada can be taken by a recent college graduate in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and presented as real news to attract clicks from credulous readers in the United States. Mr. Latsabidze said his only incentive was to make money from Google ads by luring people off Facebook pages and onto his websites.To gin up material, Mr. Latsabidze often simply cut and pasted, sometimes massaging headlines but mostly just copying material from elsewhere, including Mr. Egan\u2019s prank story on Mr. Obama. Mr. Egan was not amused to see his satirical work on Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s website and filed a copyright infringement notice to defend his intellectual property.Yet Mr. Egan conceded a certain professional glee that Mr. Trump is here to stay. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got him for four years,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dIn Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America\u2019s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)\u201cMy audience likes Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.\u201dSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that \u201cthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.\u201d Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: \u201cStop it Liberals\u2026Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here\u2019s Why.\u201d That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people\u2019s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)Then the notice arrived from Mr. Egan in Canada, which prompted the company that hosts Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites, including departed.co, to shut them down for two days until he removed the offending story.\u201cIt was really bad for me,\u201d Mr. Latsabidze recalled. \u201cTraffic dropped and I had to start everything all over again.\u201dMr. Egan, for his part, said he did not like others making money unfairly off his labor. And he estimated that \u201cprobably half\u201d the readers of his stories believe they are true because of the widespread theft by other websites.\u201cA lot of that was conservative readers who see it picked up on other sites and believe it,\u201d Mr. Egan said. \u201cIn many cases, they haven\u2019t actually read it, they\u2019re just reacting to a headline.\u201dMr. Latsabidze said he was amazed that anyone could mistake many of the articles he posts for real news, insisting they are simply a form of infotainment that should not be taken too seriously.\u201cI don\u2019t call it fake news; I call it satire,\u201d he said. He avoids sex and violence because they violate Facebook rules, he said, but he sees nothing wrong otherwise with providing readers with what they want.\u201cNobody really believes that Mexico is going to close its border,\u201d he said, sipping coffee this week in a McDonald\u2019s in downtown Tbilisi. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201dAll the same, the Mexico-closing-its-border story proved so popular after it appeared on his site that he hunted around on the web for other articles on the same theme. He found a tall tale about Mexico planning to call back its citizens from the United States if Mr. Trump won. This, too, generated huge traffic, though not quite as much as the first one, which Mr. Latsabidze described as \u201ca really great story.\u201dHe insisted he has nothing against Mexicans or Muslims, whose exclusion from the United States is requested by an online petition that often appears on his websites and who are invariably presented in a negative light in the stories he posts.\u201cI am not against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw that there was interest. They are in the news.\u201d Nor, he added, is he particularly against Mrs. Clinton, though he personally prefers Mr. Trump.If his pro-Clinton site had taken off, he said, he would have pressed on with that, but \u201cpeople did not engage,\u201d so he focused on serving pro-Trump supporters instead. They, he quickly realized, were a far more receptive audience \u201cbecause they are angry\u201d and eager to read outrageous tales.\u201cFor me, this is all about income, nothing more,\u201d he added.The income comes mostly from Google, which pays a few cents each time a reader sees or clicks on advertisements embedded in one of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites. His best month, which coincided with the hit bogus story about Mexico closing the border, brought in around $6,000, though monthly revenue is usually much lower.While Facebook does not directly provide Mr. Latsabidze any revenue, it plays a central role in driving traffic to his websites. He initially established several fake Facebook pages intended to steer traffic to his websites, including one supposedly set up by a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka. This woman, he acknowledged, does not really exist. \u201cShe is me,\u201d he said.He discovered, however, that such pages were ineffective compared with legitimate Facebook pages from real people, particularly Trump supporters, because they have so much energy and love promoting stories they like.Departed.co \u2014 named after Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s favorite movie, \u201cThe Departed,\u201d and recently redirected to usatodaycom.com \u2014 published dozens of stories daily, many of them similar to one posted on Nov. 17 with the headline, \u201cThis Is Huuge! International Arrest Warrant Issued By Putin For George Soros!\u201d The story was not true and had already been published on scores of other fake news sites around the web.In the prelude to the election, bogus reports about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health and highly favorable ones about Mr. Trump were promoted with gusto by Russian state-controlled news media outlets and legions of pro-Russian internet agitators. This has stirred suspicions that the Kremlin has had a hand in the fake news industry, prompting American researchers to assert in recent studies that the online blurring of the boundary between truth and falsehood is in part the result of Russian manipulation.But Mr. Latsabidze and others here say they serve only their bank balances, not Russia or anything else.He insisted that his team operated entirely on its own and that it did not want or need outside help. He said that it took him just two hours to set up a basic website and that anyone with a modicum of computer savvy could quickly start hawking news \u2014 real or fake \u2014 online.\u201cI did not invent anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has all been done before.\u201dMr. Latsabidze, who apparently has broken no laws, said that any crackdown on fake news might work in the short term but that \u201csomething else will come along to replace it.\u201d\u201cIf they want to, they can control everything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this will stop freedom of speech.\u201dFor now, the postelection period has been bad for business, with a sharp fall in the appetite for incendiary political news favoring Mr. Trump. Traffic to departed.co and affiliated websites has plunged in recent weeks by at least 50 percent, Mr. Latsabidze said.\u201cIf Hillary had won, it would be better for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI could write about the bad things she was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not write to make Trump win. I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.\u201dIn the months since he got into the fake news business, Mr. Latsabidze has landed a day job as a programmer with a software company, which he sees as a better future. \u201cThis is more stable work,\u201d he said.But he seemed reluctant to quit altogether.\u201cAre there any elections coming up in the U.K.?\u201d Mr. Latsabidze asked.He was disappointed to hear that none were scheduled soon. But, advised that France will hold a hotly contested presidential election next April featuring a Trump-like candidate in the form of Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist, he perked up.\u201cMaybe I should learn some French,\u201d he said.Andrew Higgins reported from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Mike McIntire and Gabriel J.X.

{"Headline": "An Unlikely Contender Rises in France as the Antithesis of Trump", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 In the age of Donald J. Trump, \u201cBrexit\u201d and the resurgent French far right, a thin, aging career politician with an ironic smile is being called \u2014 by him and his supporters \u2014 France\u2019s best defense against raging global populism.A first test for Alain Jupp\u00e9, 71, comes Sunday as France\u2019s mainstream center-right Republican party holds a primary ahead of next spring\u2019s presidential election. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is favored to come out on top, for now.His ascendance is all the more improbable because, in a previous post, he was considered one of France\u2019s most unpopular prime ministers ever. And he was once convicted in a Paris City Hall corruption scheme.The candidacy of the battle-scarred Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is seen by his supporters as a bulwark at a time when the postelection United States is now routinely depicted as one leg of a global tripartite menace, along with China and Russia, bearing down on fragile Western democracies.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.But while other contenders for the presidency are adopting Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of Muslims as an inherent threat, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s soothing message of French unity has, so far, helped him to lead opinion polls.Still, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s tenure as prime minister during the 1990s was one of the most divisive in modern French history, marked by proposed cutbacks to generous civil-servant pensions that brought thousands into the streets in protest. Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s plan ultimately failed.This time around, he has promised more market-oriented reforms and has vowed not to back down in the face of inevitable protests. In that regard, the technocratic Mr. Jupp\u00e9, of all the contenders, may present the biggest challenge to France\u2019s social protections and labor rules.The race is considered the right\u2019s to lose. Just behind Mr. Sarkozy in the polls, nipping at his heels, is another former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon.The winner of Sunday\u2019s Republican primary \u2014 there will be a runoff on Nov. 27 \u2014 is considered likely to face Ms. Le Pen in April\u2019s presidential election.If previous patterns hold, Ms. Le Pen will be defeated, which would make Mr. Jupp\u00e9 the likeliest of all those now running to become the next French president.At 38, Mr. Macron has the image of a youthful reformer, but analysts have noted his thin record, lack of a party base, and absence of heft \u2014 he has never held elected office \u2014 in a universe of surging populism.Mr. Jupp\u00e9, on the other hand, has won and lost numerous elections and has served for many years as the mayor of Bordeaux, where he has been credited with transforming the city.But, with near-permanent high unemployment, an injection of energy from Mr. Trump\u2019s victory into Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign \u2014 xenophobic nationalism is her core theme \u2014 and the same social and economic fractures as in the United States, there are no guarantees.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.The warning signs from across the Atlantic were evident in a campaign swing through Lower Burgundy on Wednesday, as Mr. Jupp\u00e9 met with disgruntled farmers and rural officials.The French news media has noted that the American election results have colored the former prime minister\u2019s message with concern about the existence of two Frances: one benefiting from globalization, and the other left behind.There are the large, vibrant cities \u2014 Paris, Lyon, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s Bordeaux \u2014 and then there are the shuttered main streets of sleepy provincial capitals and rural towns like those he visited on Wednesday.Wearing the coat and tie he appears never to shed, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 got his shoes muddy at a grain and dairy farm whose owner complained of crushing debt.\u201cPeople have talked about suffering,\u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9 told a roomful in the tiny village of St.-Loup-d\u2019Ordon, \u201cand it is true,\u201d he said, speaking in a knowing, weary tone, careful never to exaggerate.With his eyebrows slightly arched, he listened patiently to the complaints. Rural France feels \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cdisdained\u201d by Paris, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t accept this gulf between the big cities and rural France.\u201dPromising a \u201cstrong state,\u201d he had a warning for his audience deep in the Burgundian countryside at St.-Julien-du-Sault: \u201cThe world is becoming more and more dangerous. Nationalism is on the rise.\u201dSimilarly, at a rally this week in northern Paris, the perceived menace of rising populism was a common theme in the speeches and comments of Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s supporters.From Mr. Jupp\u00e9 himself and the other center-right speakers who preceded him, Mr. Trump\u2019s name came up often. Each time, it was met with loud boos from the crowd of around 6,000. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 \u2014 \u201ca man of culture,\u201d one speaker called him \u2014 was depicted as the antithesis of Mr. Trump.\u201cAfter the election of Donald Trump, after Brexit, will populism triumph in our country? No!\u201d shouted Patrick Devedjian, a former minister, who introduced Mr. Jupp\u00e9 at the rally.The crowd \u2014 mostly middle-aged or older, buttoned-up and carefully dressed, like Mr. Jupp\u00e9 \u2014 roared approval. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it up to here with populist baseness!\u201d Mr. Devedjian said.Another supporter, Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a prominent centrist politician, told the crowd, \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t need a mini-Trump in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e!\u201d \u2014 referring to the presidential palace in Paris.Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, president of the Paris region\u2019s council, was equally scathing. \u201cPopulism is about not telling the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cAlain,\u201d she added, turning to Mr. Jupp\u00e9, seated in the front row, \u201cyou are the antidote to populism.\u201dMr. Jupp\u00e9, who spoke in pithy bullet points, promised to stand up to enemies and rivals \u2014 both internal and external. In a brisk speech that reflected his classical education at France\u2019s top schools, he brought up Mr. Trump in the context of threats to France.\u201cI don\u2019t know what Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cHe has said contradictory things. What I know is, there will be an aggressive commercial policy. So we must be aggressive, too.\u201dSetting himself up as a defender of European unity \u2014 Ms. Le Pen is fiercely opposed to the European Union \u2014 Mr. Jupp\u00e9 said: \u201cFrance can be a world power, in thrall to nobody. But separated, we will be vassals of the big empires all around us: Russia, China and the U.S.\u201dAfterward, encountered on the boulevard outside the rally, he wondered whether his comments about Mr. Trump had been too \u201coffensive.\u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9 has served twice as France\u2019s foreign minister and chooses his words carefully.But then he shrugged his shoulders, saying about Mr. Trump, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Stable Are Democracies? \u2018Warning Signs Are Flashing Red\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 Yascha Mounk is used to being the most pessimistic person in the room. Mr. Mounk, a lecturer in government at Harvard, has spent the past few years challenging one of the bedrock assumptions of Western politics: that once a country becomes a liberal democracy, it will stay that way.His research suggests something quite different: that liberal democracies around the world may be at serious risk of decline.He concluded that the effort was not going very well. A populist backlash was rising. But was that just a new kind of politics, or a symptom of something deeper?To answer that question, Mr. Mounk teamed up with Roberto Stefan Foa, a political scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. They have since gathered and crunched data on the strength of liberal democracies.Their conclusion, to be published in the January issue of the Journal of Democracy, is that democracies are not as secure as people may think. Right now, Mr. Mounk said in an interview, \u201cthe warning signs are flashing red.\u201dPolitical scientists have a theory called \u201cdemocratic consolidation,\u201d which holds that once countries develop democratic institutions, a robust civil society and a certain level of wealth, their democracy is secure.For decades, global events seemed to support that idea. Data from Freedom House, a watchdog organization that measures democracy and freedom around the world, shows that the number of countries classified as \u201cfree\u201d rose steadily from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s. Many Latin American countries transitioned from military rule to democracy; after the end of the Cold War, much of Eastern Europe followed suit. And longstanding liberal democracies in North America, Western Europe and Australia seemed more secure than ever.But since 2005, Freedom House\u2019s index has shown a decline in global freedom each year. Is that a statistical anomaly, a result of a few random events in a relatively short period of time? Or does it indicate a meaningful pattern?Mr. Mounk and Mr. Foa developed a three-factor formula to answer that question. Mr. Mounk thinks of it as an early-warning system, and it works something like a medical test: a way to detect that a democracy is ill before it develops full-blown symptoms.The first factor was public support: How important do citizens think it is for their country to remain democratic? The second was public openness to nondemocratic forms of government, such as military rule. And the third factor was whether \u201cantisystem parties and movements\u201d \u2014 political parties and other major players whose core message is that the current system is illegitimate \u2014 were gaining support.If support for democracy was falling while the other two measures were rising, the researchers marked that country \u201cdeconsolidating.\u201d And they found that deconsolidation was the political equivalent of a low-grade fever that arrives the day before a full-blown case of the flu.Venezuela, for instance, enjoyed the highest possible scores on Freedom House\u2019s measures of political rights and democracy in the 1980s. But those democratic practices were not deeply rooted. During that apparent period of stability, Venezuela already scored as deconsolidating on the Mounk-Foa test.Today, that fever is starting to look a lot like the flu. Law and Justice, which won the presidency and a parliamentary majority in 2015, has systematically weakened democratic institutions.The government\u2019s attempts to undermine the country\u2019s constitutional tribunal, for instance, set off an investigation by the European Union. The resulting report warned that the government\u2019s actions \u201cendanger not only the rule of law, but also the functioning of the democratic system.\u201dAccording to the Mounk-Foa early-warning system, signs of democratic deconsolidation in the United States and many other liberal democracies are now similar to those in Venezuela before its crisis.Across numerous countries, including Australia, Britain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United States, the percentage of people who say it is \u201cessential\u201d to live in a democracy has plummeted, and it is especially low among younger generations.Support for autocratic alternatives is rising, too. Drawing on data from the European and World Values Surveys, the researchers found that the share of Americans who say that army rule would be a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d thing had risen to 1 in 6 in 2014, compared with 1 in 16 in 1995.In the United States, Donald J. Trump won the presidential election by running as an antisystem outsider. And support for antisystem populist parties in Europe, such as the National Front in France, Syriza in Greece and the Five-Star Movement in Italy, is rising.Also, of course, correlation is not the same as causation. Although the researchers found a relationship between deconsolidation and democratic instability, that is not the same thing as proving the root causes of either factor.\u201cThat\u2019s only one measure,\u201d Mr. Mounk acknowledged of his own research. \u201cBut,\u201d he added after a pause, \u201cit should have us worried.\u201dHe fears that the minutiae of politics can easily distract from these more fundamental dangers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about what Trump will do to the E.P.A.,\u201d he said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cIt really is that Trump may try to undermine liberal democracy in the United States.\u201d\u201cLook, this stuff is already going on in other places,\u201d Mr. Mounk added. \u201cIf there\u2019s one task that we have as journalists, as academics, as thinkers, it\u2019s to drive the stakes of this home for people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remembering Nohemi Gonzalez, a Year Later", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byNotebookNov. 13 is the one-year anniversary of the death of Nohemi Gonzalez, the only American among 130 killed in the terrorist attacks in Paris.Nohemi was on a semester abroad, trading in 15 weeks at California State University, Long Beach, for an experience at Strate School of Design in S\u00e8vres, outside of Paris. She was the first in her family to attend college \u2014 a Mexican-American industrial design student on her way to becoming one of just over 15 percent of young Hispanics who hold a bachelor\u2019s degree.On the night she was killed, she was enjoying the City of Light like a Parisienne, in a lively bistro on Rue de Charonne, perhaps toasting her Cal State design team, which, she had just learned, placed second in a competition for efficient packaging of snack food. The packaging would decompose, leaving no trace behind.It is hard to truly know this student from public comments. The language of grief exalts and reduces the dead with larger-than-life words. She is described by friends as \u201calways happy,\u201d \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201ca bright spirit.\u201d Her own Facebook posts give a sense of a more particular Nohemi: \u201cLearning a 3D modeling computer program in a language I don\u2019t know is up there in the top three hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do.\u201d (The reader can\u2019t help but wonder what the other two hard things were.)In interviews soon after the attack, Nohemi\u2019s mother sometimes used the present tense to describe her daughter: \u201cShe loves school,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cNohemi wanted a different life from most of our people who just go to work and come home. She wanted a career.\u201dReading about Nohemi\u2019s short life reminded me of many of my students at Johnson State College in Vermont, where I recently retired as president. Vermont is as different from California in its demographic makeup, size and economy as two states can be, and yet her story could have been theirs. Some of my students had never held a passport or even left our state; like Nohemi, they took their first plane rides while in college, exiting wide-eyed onto foreign lands.\u201cI can go anywhere now,\u201d one student told me after returning from Greece, as stunned as she was newly confident. Finding your way home on the metro in another country is one thing; doing so on your first metro ride ever is a triumph.Like Johnson State, Cal State Long Beach is one of 400 regional colleges and universities educating 40 percent of the nation\u2019s undergraduates. These \u201cmiddle children\u201d of public higher education \u2014 not a community college, not a state flagship \u2014 are oft-forgotten (and seldom celebrated) microcosms of their states. Nohemi might have thrived anywhere, but Cal State Long Beach, whose enrollment is 95 percent Californian and more than one-third Hispanic, seems to have fostered a keen awareness and responsibility of place (her place) and given her not only a context in which to flourish, but also the confidence to venture beyond its borders.Nohemi had only begun her journey, but her sense of adventure might serve as a beacon for young people with limited family resources as they set out to discover worlds apart from their own.In other ways she was atypical: Nearly 75 percent of Americans who study overseas are non-Hispanic white, and disproportionately from private schools. Despite the opening up of federal financial aid to support study abroad, international study is still more available to students with greater family resources.Nohemi would have beaten many odds, and we root for people who defy statistics and set new paths. Will Cal State students follow hers? I asked Dean Jeet Joshee, who oversees international study at the university, if he was seeing any drop in interest in study abroad since her death. He said that students tell him they will not be deterred from their plans.Of course, study abroad is not without its risks. Foreign students in Rome are frequent targets of robberies, including one last summer that ended in the death of an American student in an exchange program at John Cabot University. But such highly publicized deaths may skew our perceptions.The president of the Institute for International Education, Allan E. Goodman, has often said that getting to the airport in the United States may be the most dangerous part of studying abroad. Paradoxically, he says, he is asked by parents from other countries if they should keep their children from coming here to avoid the risks inherent in a country in which guns are rampant.As unlikely as Nohemi\u2019s death was, it was not random. Her assassins did not set out to kill a Mexican-American design student in particular, but they did set out to murder what she represents: the freedom of pleasure, choice and agency.Colleges are brave institutions. They must be part of the forces that shape the lives of young adults during their most alert and seeking years. As parents and educators, it\u2019s our job to ensure that we protect these freedoms for our young people \u2014 here, at home \u2014 and instill in them the values and responsibilities that such liberties require. Then we can set them free, and hope it\u2019s enough.Most students who return from a semester or more of international study report greater maturity and a clearer understanding of their own values.Living and learning in another culture is more important than ever \u2014 for the individual students, of course, but also because the empathy such experiences foster is crucial in maintaining a safer, more loving world. No other single experience comes as close to building a new perspective on citizenship and place as study in another country. Nothing.Nohemi\u2019s brief immersion in that experience made her life, I am convinced, a larger one. This was a woman who refused to be constrained by tradition or circumstance. She chose knowledge instead of ignorance. She chose to imagine a future for herself.That she did not get to inhabit that future breaks our hearts but not our resolve to leave our homes and expand our notion of citizenship and belonging.Barbara E. Murphy is a former president of Johnson State College and of the Community College of Vermont and is the author of the poetry collection \u201cAlmost Too Much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Furniture Makers Are Catering to Millennials", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Burrow is on an enviable trajectory right now. The company is a graduate of the prestigious Bay Area tech accelerator Y Combinator; it also has a healthy list of pre-orders for its product\u2019s planned debut in January. But given that pedigree, the product is an unusual one: couches. Not cloud-connected couches or remote-controlled couches \u2014 just couches. Technically, the company makes a couch, singular, available in a few different colors and configurations. The one I was sitting on belonged to Jess Goodman, a friend of the founders and an early supporter. Its design was midcentury modern unexceptional, and it was perfectly nice. But the couch is not Burrow\u2019s main attraction. Burrow is selling a couch experience.When customers order a Burrow couch online, the standard model will ship to their apartments in three or four boxes. A human of average size should be able to take those boxes up the stairs (if they have stairs) and build the couch alone, without tools and within minutes.Chopra and Kuhl tell me that for urban professionals between 25 and 35, the physical process of buying a sofa and moving it into an apartment is a series of \u201cpain points.\u201d Some of these points are literally painful, like carrying a large sofa up a flight of stairs. But the term is business speak for any kind of friction, however abstract, between a customer and a new couch. Burrow doesn\u2019t claim to have improved upon the couch itself: It\u2019s a pain-management company.It helps that furniture sales in the United States are unusually fragmented. It\u2019s a $100 billion annual market, but giants like Ashley HomeStore and Ikea take less than 5 percent each, while regional chains like Rooms to Go and Havertys still account for significant sales. Unlike with, say, office supplies, the industry hasn\u2019t become concentrated in a few huge companies \u2014 the field remains competitive.All of which is to say millennial entrepreneurs could pick a worse thing to sell than a deconstructable couch. As they disrupt our living rooms, these businessmen move us one step closer to a different world. But are we sure we want to live there?As they say, however, nothing in this life is free \u2014 certainly not shipping couches. Burrow manufactures its boxed-up sofas-to-be in Mexico City, then freight-forwards them to warehouses in Cincinnati and New York. Because they\u2019re boxes, rather than constructed furniture, they can stack all the way to the ceiling. The boxes are FedEx and UPS compliant, and they ship from the warehouses like normal packages. The process is advertised as free, but the founders estimate that it will cost them $75 per sofa, or about 10 percent of the $745 purchase price for the two-seat base model. Chopra and Kuhl also figure that if they can ease all the \u201cpain\u201d around obtaining and installing a couch, customers will be happy enough with what they get to refrain from sending it back, which Burrow says it will allow them to do for 100 days. It occurs to me that the kind of person who would order a couch online to reduce logistical hassles is also the kind of person least likely to then pack up that couch and send it back. When I ask the founders about this, they offer angelic smiles. \u201cWe think our model works for almost everyone,\u201d Kuhl says, \u201cbut there are some people who like Ikea.\u201dIkea hardly dominates the market from a numbers perspective, but it\u2019s been a cultural phenomenon for as long as Burrow\u2019s target demographic has been alive, to the point that it\u2019s essentially a default furniture-acquisition source. In a case study well known to those with M.B.A.s, Youngme Moon of Harvard Business School described how the company made a home in America. From the 1985 opening of its first American store, Ikea emphasized everything except the attribute that had been the industry\u2019s sole sales strategy until that point: durability. At Ikea\u2019s prices, furniture didn\u2019t need to be seen as a future heirloom; young adults could furnish their homes with new objects, rather than trawling through thrift stores or taking hand-me-downs from upgrading relatives. Attractive Swedish particle board gave Americans an excuse to jettison their parents\u2019 commitment to lifelong furniture and go shopping more often.\u201cIkea is an amazing company,\u201d says Maxwell Ryan, the chief executive and co-founder of the influential interior-design site Apartment Therapy. \u201cThey have great designers, infrastructure, product variety. They\u2019re very hard to compete with.\u201d Ikea furniture also packs into boxes \u2014 the industry term is \u201cK.D.,\u201d or \u201cknock down\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s based on a very different value proposition from Burrow\u2019s. By turning its stores into theme parks and fitting the warehouse right inside, Ikea bet that it could get customers to tote purchases all the way home by themselves. The pain points of couch shopping are still there, but so are the pleasures of dining out and free child care. Burrow\u2019s experience, on the other hand, is online and low-friction.Burrow isn\u2019t the only company that sees an opening here. \u201cTwenty-four-to-33-year-old career-driven, upwardly mobile people\u201d is how John Humphrey \u2014 a founder and chief executive of the furniture company Greycork \u2014 describes his customers. \u201cThey tend to be in the tech and design fields.\u201d With a Greycork living-room set, you can take a space from zero to furnished in five to 10 days, with free shipping. If a consumer\u2019s main complaint with Ikea furniture is the Allen wrenches, the trip to the store or just the fact that it\u2019s identifiably Ikea, Greycork could be a good alternative.\u201cThe way Ikea is based around the shipping container, we\u2019re based around FedEx,\u201d says Brad Sewell, the founder of the furniture maker Campaign. The ex-Apple engineer\u2019s company sells a chair, a love seat and a sofa \u2014 all the same design in varying widths. Based on the online view, they are not especially distinguishable from the Ikea Norsborg line and are a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. This next generation of couches uses web copy that\u2019s heavy in compound adjectives (\u201claser-cut, powder-coated steel frames\u201d) to project a premium feel onto goods that most buyers can\u2019t touch for themselves. The fact that the furniture folds is more than a logistical accommodation; it\u2019s a key feature.Kyle Hoff is a founder of Floyd, a furniture start-up that ships metal legs \u2014 they adjust to turn any flat surface into a desk or a table \u2014 alongside adjustable shelf brackets and frameworks for platform beds. The initial concept was \u201cjust add boards\u201d; Floyd products bind them into functional furniture. \u201cI wanted to make furniture for people like me,\u201d Hoff says. \u201cI was in my early 20s, moving from city to city, and I needed things that could move with me.\u201d Though Floyd is based in Detroit, Hoff says most of his customers are young professionals in New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. And maybe in is the wrong way to think of it; Floyd customers exist between these (and a few other) metropolitan areas. All the furniture is designed to move as part of a roving lifestyle.If a company can get to market first and establish itself as the singular way to buy a particular necessity online, it can clean up \u2014 even if it\u2019s appealing to a relatively small millennial luxury market. Most of the founders I spoke with mentioned Casper as an inspiration, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The venture-funded company was an overnight success in 2014 selling foam mattresses online and delivering them compressed into manageable boxes. Last year the company was valued at over half a billion dollars. It stands out even among Silicon Valley fairy tales, which makes \u201cCasper for couches\u201d a self-explanatory business pitch.The best thing about this whole product category is that it might represent a step away from Ikea\u2019s disposability without going all the way back to Grandma\u2019s antique sofa. If consumers are already thinking about moving, portability is at least as big an obstacle to maintaining furniture as mediocre craftsmanship and cheap materials. These companies want to make a couch that will last for 10 or 20 years, even if the buyers have no idea where they\u2019ll be or what they\u2019ll be doing that far down the line. Buying a piece of furniture that you will realistically hold onto longer is a kind of forward-thinking thrift.But this new approach also hints at something more sinister, more bad-future. Different furniture suggests different ways of being in the world: A heavy table says one thing, and a mattress on the floor beside a folding chair says another. Campaign takes its name from the furnishings that British colonial functionaries would take on assignments, ready to pack up if recalled by the Crown. It\u2019s an apt fit with one version of upwardly mobile millennial living, which involves reducing all \u201cpersonal\u201d needs to an efficient minimum. It\u2019s a style beloved by Silicon Valley \u2014 which finances accessories like the liquid food replacement Soylent \u2014 and exemplified by the Google engineer who blogged about the time he spent living in a small truck near the office.This Silicon Valley lifestyle and the Silicon Valley business model are caught in a chicken-and-egg dialectic. Each holds that whatever work can be automated, eliminated or subcontracted to others should be, thus leaving all our valuable code ninjas and management rock stars free to do more work, pursue expensive enriching experiences and watch Netflix. This is the luxury that some of the valley\u2019s most successful products are offering; there are now niche online services for doing your laundry, chopping your food, driving you around and delivering your toilet paper. The entire app-services economy can serve as a dispersed and techno-mystified mother, a caretaker who dotes on the implied bachelor user.The various furniture founders \u2014 Burrow\u2019s, Greycork\u2019s, Campaign\u2019s, Floyd\u2019s \u2014 experienced the same series of pain points when it came to couch ownership. All are city-dwelling men with at least some postgraduate education; four of them are 29, the fifth is 28. It\u2019s not surprising that they should encounter similar hassles or, because most attended business school, think of comparable entrepreneurial solutions. But given that investors and customers have encouraged them, it\u2019s worth asking exactly what kind of pain they plan to remove from our world.Maxwell Ryan, of Apartment Therapy, is not optimistic about the prospects of companies like Burrow. \u201cThere\u2019s this Silicon Valley mind-set where they solve a problem and so they think they\u2019re going to make a million dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cBut just because it\u2019s a problem for them doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem for everyone. I haven\u2019t seen that kind of thinking translate over well to the design space.\u201d Nor is he particularly impressed with the plain, one-size-fits-all style they tend to adopt (\u201cit\u2019s ugly\u201d). Ryan says customers want a good narrative to go with their furniture, like Crate and Barrel\u2019s origin story of a young couple\u2019s return from their honeymoon abroad with boxes of cheap imported fineries.But not everyone cares that much about expressing individual style, and Ryan could be underestimating how popular it is these days to stay inside and not talk to anyone. In our emerging economic order, the exertion of emotional energy is a kind of pain \u2014 a red entry in the accounting book of our lives \u2014 and there are new services every day to help us avoid it. Soon it will be possible to build and maintain a complete household full of goods without having to look anyone else in the eye.When my roommate and I moved to Philadelphia this year, we left our giant vintage couch in our fourth-floor Brooklyn walk-up. It was a nice piece of furniture \u2014 solid and soft, in light green floral \u2014 and we were sad to lose it. After we moved into our new place, my brother, who lives nearby, showed us to a neighborhood secondhand store called Jinxed. Inside we found a couch that looked shockingly like our old one. A little smaller, in better condition and orange instead of green, but remarkably similar. It\u2019s not what I would have picked online, but the coincidence was too striking to ignore.From a certain perspective, this was all suffering, insofar as it would have been easier not to do it. I\u2019m not unsympathetic; I\u2019m in the target demographic for a product like Burrow. I am a person who has bought flour on Amazon. But risk and hassle and pain are big parts of interacting with other people on terms that aren\u2019t yours alone. There\u2019s value in having to sustain a mind-set that accounts for other humans and their interests and needs, a value to always remembering that there are people between the apps and our fulfilled desires. If there exists a market incentive to smooth every friction a young businessman can think of \u2014 even something as mundane, low-tech and intrinsically social as a couch \u2014 we risk a very slippery world. \u2666Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer in Philadelphia.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fidel Castro, Cuban Revolutionary Who Defied U.S., Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Mr. Castro brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere, bedeviled 11 American presidents and briefly pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war.Supported byFidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the United States for nearly half a century as Cuba\u2019s maximum leader, bedeviling 11 American presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90.Cuban state television announced the death but gave no other details.Fidel Castro had held on to power longer than any other living national leader except Queen Elizabeth II. He became a towering international figure whose importance in the 20th century far exceeded what might have been expected from the head of state of a Caribbean island nation of 11 million people.A spotlight shone on him as he swaggered and spoke with passion until dawn. Finally, white doves were released to signal Cuba\u2019s new peace. When one landed on Mr. Castro, perching on a shoulder, the crowd erupted, chanting: \u201cFidel! Fidel!\u201d To the war-weary Cubans gathered there and those watching on television, it was an electrifying sign that their young, bearded guerrilla leader was destined to be their savior.Most people in the crowd had no idea what Mr. Castro planned for Cuba. A master of image and myth, Mr. Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people.But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his totalitarian government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms; many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages.By handing power to his brother, Mr. Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington. United States officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the long-suffering Cuban people a chance to control their own lives.His legacy in Cuba and elsewhere has been a mixed record of social progress and abject poverty, of racial equality and political persecution, of medical advances and a degree of misery comparable to the conditions that existed in Cuba when he entered Havana as a victorious guerrilla commander in 1959.Mr. Castro\u2019s defiance of American power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion.Mr. Castro\u2019s understanding of the power of images, especially on television, helped him retain the loyalty of many Cubans even during the harshest periods of deprivation and isolation when he routinely blamed America and its embargo for many of Cuba\u2019s ills. And his mastery of words in thousands of speeches, often lasting hours, imbued many Cubans with his own hatred of the United States by keeping them on constant watch for an invasion \u2014 military, economic or ideological \u2014 from the north.Thousands of posters were commissioned by the government to promote his vision of a socialist society.He turned the question back on Reagan: \u201cIf his power includes something as monstrously undemocratic as the ability to order a thermonuclear war, I ask you, who then is more of a dictator, the president of the United States or I?\u201dAfter leading his guerrillas against a repressive Cuban dictator, Mr. Castro, in his early 30s, aligned Cuba with the Soviet Union and used Cuban troops to support revolution in Africa and throughout Latin America.Mr. Castro continued to taunt American presidents for a half-century, frustrating all of Washington\u2019s attempts to contain him. After nearly five decades as a pariah of the West, even when his once booming voice had withered to an old man\u2019s whisper and his beard had turned gray, he remained defiant.21 PhotosOther versions suggest that \u00c1ngel Castro went penniless to Cuba but eventually established a plantation and did business with the despised, American-owned United Fruit Company. By the time Fidel was a youngster, his father was a major landholder.Fidel was a boisterous young student who was sent away to study with the Jesuits at the Colegio de Dolores in Santiago de Cuba and later to the Colegio de Bel\u00e9n, an exclusive Jesuit high school in Havana. Cuban lore has it that he was headstrong and fanatical even as a boy. In one account, Fidel was said to have bicycled head-on into a wall to make a point to his friends about the strength of his will.In another often-repeated tale, young Fidel and his class were led on a mountain hike by a priest. The priest slipped in a fast-moving stream and was in danger of drowning until Fidel pulled him to shore, then both knelt in prayers of thanks for their good fortune.\u201cI had entered into contact with Marxist literature,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cAt that time, there were some Communist students at the University of Havana, and I had friendly relations with them, but I was not in the Socialist Youth, I was not a militant in the Communist Party.\u201dHe acknowledged that radical philosophy had influenced his character: \u201cI was then acquiring a revolutionary conscience; I was active; I struggled, but let us say I was an independent fighter.\u201dMr. Castro\u2019s initial response to the Batista government was to challenge it with a legal appeal, claiming that Mr. Batista\u2019s actions had violated the Constitution. Even as a symbolic act, the attempt was futile.Mr. Castro was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mr. Batista then made what turned out to be a huge strategic error. Believing that the rebels\u2019 energy had been spent, and under pressure from civic leaders to show that he was not a dictator, he released Mr. Castro and his followers in an amnesty after the 1954 presidential election.Mr. Castro went into exile in Mexico, where he plotted his return to Cuba. He tried to buy a used American PT boat to carry his band to Cuba, but the deal fell through. Then he caught sight of a beat-up 61-foot wooden yacht named Granma, once owned by an American who lived in Mexico City.The Granma remains on display in Havana, encased in glass.Although his soldiers and weapons vastly outnumbered Mr. Castro\u2019s, Mr. Batista grew fearful of the young guerrilla\u2019s mesmerizing oratory. He ordered government troops not to rest until they had killed Mr. Castro, and the army frequently reported that it had done so. Newspapers around the world reported his death in the December 1956 landing. But three months later, Mr. Castro was interviewed for a series of articles that would revive his movement and thus change history.The escapade began when Castro loyalists contacted a correspondent and editorial writer for The New York Times, Herbert L. Matthews, and arranged for him to interview Mr. Castro. A few Castro supporters took Mr. Matthews into the mountains disguised as a wealthy American planter.\u201cThis was quite a man \u2014 a powerful six-footer, olive-skinned, full-faced, with a straggly beard,\u201d Mr. Matthews wrote.The three articles, which began in The Times on Sunday, Feb. 24, 1957, presented a Castro that Americans could root for. \u201cThe personality of the man is overpowering,\u201d Mr. Matthews wrote. \u201cHere was an educated, dedicated fanatic, a man of ideals, of courage and of remarkable qualities of leadership.\u201dArticles include an exclusive Times interview with the young guerrilla leader in 1957 and coverage of the revolution, the Bay of Pigs invasion and the 1962 missile crisis.The Cuban government denounced Mr. Matthews and called the articles fabrications. But the news that he had survived the landing breathed life into Mr. Castro\u2019s movement. His small band of irregulars skirmished with government troops, and each encounter increased their support in Cuba and around the world, even though other insurgent forces in the cities were also fighting to overthrow the Batista government.Events over the next few months became the catalyst for another transformation in Mr. Castro\u2019s public image. More than 500 Batista-era officials were brought before courts-martial and special tribunals, summarily convicted and shot to death. The grainy black-and-white images of the executions broadcast on American television horrified viewers.Mr. Castro defended the executions as necessary to solidify the revolution. He complained that the United States had raised not a whimper when Mr. Batista had tortured and executed thousands of opponents.During his two years in the mountains, Mr. Castro had sketched a social revolution whose aim, at least on the surface, seemed to be to restore the democracy that Mr. Batista\u2019s coup had stifled. Mr. Castro promised free elections and vowed to end American domination of the economy and the working-class oppression that he said it had caused.Despite having a law degree, Mr. Castro had no real experience in economics or government. Beyond improving education and reducing Cuba\u2019s dependence on sugar and the United States, his revolution began without a clear sense of the new society he planned, except that it would be different from what had existed under Mr. Batista.At the time, Cuba was a playground for rich American tourists and gangsters where glaring disparities of wealth persisted, although the country was one of the most economically advanced in the Caribbean.As the first waves of Cuban exiles arrived in Miami and northern New Jersey after the revolution, many were intent on overthrowing the man they had once supported. Their number would eventually total a million, many from what had been, proportionately, the largest middle class in Latin America.The Central Intelligence Agency helped train an exile army to retake Cuba by force. The army was to make a beachhead at the Bay of Pigs, a remote spot on Cuba\u2019s southern coast, and instigate a popular insurrection.It was not until just before the Bay of Pigs invasion that Mr. Castro declared publicly that his revolution was socialist. A few months later, on Dec. 2, 1961, he removed any lingering doubt about his loyalties when he affirmed in a long speech, \u201cI am a Marxist-Leninist.\u201dMany Cubans who had willingly accepted great sacrifice for what they believed would be a democratic revolution were dismayed. They broke ranks with Mr. Castro, putting themselves and their families at risk. Others, from the safety of the United States, publicly accused Mr. Castro of betraying the revolution and called him a tyrant. Even his family began to raise doubts about his intentions.\u201cAs I listened, I thought that surely he must be a superb actor,\u201d Mr. Castro\u2019s sister Juanita wrote in an account in Life magazine in 1964, referring to the December 1961 speech. \u201cHe had fooled not only so many of his friends, but his family as well.\u201d She recalled his upbringing as the son of a well-to-do landowner in eastern Cuba who had sent him to exclusive Jesuit schools. In 1948, after Mr. Castro married Mirta D\u00edaz-Balart, whose family had ties to the Batista government, his father gave them a three-month honeymoon in the United States.\u201cHow could Fidel, who had been given the best of everything, be a Communist?\u201d Juanita Castro wrote. \u201cThis was the riddle which paralyzed me and so many other Cubans who refused to believe that he was leading our country into the Communist camp.\u201dA master of image and myth, Mr. Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people.Although the young Fidel was deeply involved in a radical student movement at the University of Havana, his early allegiance to Communist doctrine was uncertain at best. Some analysts believed that the obstructionist attitudes of American officials had pushed Mr. Castro toward the Soviet Union.Indeed, although Mr. Castro pursued ideologically communist policies, he never established a purely Communist state in Cuba, nor did he adopt orthodox Communist Party ideology. Rather, what developed in Cuba was less doctrinaire, a tropical form of communism that suited his needs. He centralized the economy and flattened out much of the traditional hierarchy of Cuban society, improving education and health care for many Cubans, while depriving them of free speech and economic opportunity.But unlike other Communist countries, Cuba was never governed by a functioning politburo; Mr. Castro himself, and later his brother R\u00e1ul, filled all the important positions in the party, the government and the army, ruling Cuba as its maximum leader.In Cuba, through good times and bad, Mr. Castro\u2019s supporters referred to themselves not as Communists but as Fidelistas. He remained personally popular among segments of Cuban society even after his economic policies created severe hardship. As Mr. Castro consolidated power, eliminated his enemies and grew increasingly autocratic, the Cuban people referred to him simply as Fidel. To say \u201cCastro\u201d was considered disloyal, although in later decades Cubans would commonly say just that and mean it. Or they would invoke his overwhelming presence by simply bringing a hand to their chins, as if to stroke a beard.Finally, after receiving assurances that the United States would remove American missiles from Turkey and not invade Cuba, the Soviets withdrew the missiles and dismantled the bases.But the Soviet presence in Cuba continued to grow. Soviet troops, technicians and engineers streamed in, eventually producing a generation of blond Cubans with names like Yuri, Alexi and Vladimiro. The Soviets were willing to buy all the sugar Cuba could produce. Even as other Caribbean nations diversified, Cuba decided to stick with one major crop, sugar, and one major buyer.Decades later, the Zebus could still be found grazing in pastures across the island, symbols of Mr. Castro\u2019s micromanagement. A few of the hybrids did give more milk, and one that set a milk production record was stuffed and placed in a museum. But most were no better producers than their parents.As the Soviets settled in Cuba in the 1960s, hundreds of Cuban students were sent to Moscow, Prague and other cities of the Soviet bloc to study science and medicine. Admirers from around the world, including some Americans, were impressed with the way that health care and literacy in Cuba had improved. A reshaping of Cuban society was underway.Cuba\u2019s tradition of racial segregation was turned upside down as peasants from the countryside, many of them dark-skinned descendants of Africans enslaved by the Spaniards centuries before, were invited into Havana and other cities that had been overwhelmingly white. They were given the keys to the elegant homes and spacious apartments of the middle-class Cubans who had fled to the United States. Rents came to be little more than symbolic, and basic foods like milk and eggs were sold in government stores at below production cost.Mr. Castro regularly fanned the flames of revolution with his oratory. In marathon speeches, he incited the Cuban people by laying out what he considered the evils of capitalism in general and of the United States in particular. For decades, the regime controlled all publications and broadcasting outlets and restricted access to goods and information in ways that would not have been possible if Cuba were not an island.But with Kennedy\u2019s assassination, and suspicions that Mr. Castro and the Cubans were somehow involved, the 90 miles separating Cuba from the United States became a gulf of antagonism and mistrust. The C.I.A. tried several times to eliminate Mr. Castro or undermine his authority. One plot involved exposing him to a chemical that would cause his beard to fall out, and another using a poison pen to kill him. Mr. Castro often boasted of how many times he had escaped C.I.A. plots to kill him, and he ordered information about the foiled attempts to be put on display at a Havana museum.The United States economic embargo, imposed by Eisenhower and widened by Kennedy, has continued for more than five decades. But its effectiveness was undermined by the Soviet Union, which gave Cuba $5 billion a year in subsidies, and later by Venezuela, which sent Cuba badly needed oil and long-term economic support. Most other countries, including close United States allies like Canada, maintained relations with Cuba throughout the decades and continued trading with the island. In recent years, successive American presidents have punched big holes in the embargo, allowing a broad range of economic activity, though maintaining the ban on tourism.Abandoned, isolated, facing increasing dissent at home, Mr. Castro seemed to have come to the end of his line. Cuba\u2019s collapse appeared imminent, and Mr. Castro\u2019s final hours in power were widely anticipated. Miami exiles began making elaborate preparations for a triumphant return.Mr. Castro, the self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist, was also willing to experiment with capitalism and free enterprise, at least for a time. Encouraged by his brother Ra\u00fal, he allowed farmers to sell excess produce at market rates, and he ordered officials to turn a blind eye to small, family-run kitchens and restaurants, called paladares, that charged market prices. Under R\u00e1ul Castro, those reforms were broadened considerably, though they were sometimes met with public grumbling from his older brother.But despite his apparent distaste for capitalism, and lingering memories of the 1950s Cuba that preceded his rule, Fidel Castro continued to foster Cuba\u2019s tourism industry. He allowed Spanish, Italian and Canadian companies to develop resort hotels and vacation properties, usually in association with an arm of the Cuban military.For many years, the resorts were off limits to most Cubans. They generated hard cash, but a new generation of struggling young Cuban women were lured into prostitution by the tourists\u2019 money.For a time, Mexican and Canadian investors poured money into the decrepit telephone company (owned by ITT until it was nationalized by Mr. Castro in 1960), mining operations and other enterprises, which helped keep Cuba\u2019s economy from collapsing. He declared an emergency during which he expected the Cuban people to tighten their belts. He called the United States embargo genocide.All his efforts were not enough to keep dissent from sprouting in Havana, Santiago de Cuba and other urban areas during this period of hardship. Despite worldwide condemnation of his actions, Mr. Castro clamped down on a fledgling democracy movement, jailing anyone who dared to call for free elections. He also cracked down on the nucleus of an independent press, imprisoning or harassing Cuban reporters and editors.But in Cuba, the American actions reinforced Mr. Castro\u2019s complaints about American arrogance and helped channel domestic dissent toward Washington. One of his strengths as a communicator \u2014 he considered Reagan his only worthy competitor in that regard \u2014 had always been to transform his anger toward the United States into a rallying cry for the Cuban people.\u201cWe are left with the honor of being one of the few adversaries of the United States,\u201d Mr. Castro told Maria Shriver of NBC in a 1998 interview. When Ms. Shriver asked him if that truly was an honor, he answered, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cFor such a small country as Cuba to have such a gigantic country as the United States live so obsessed with this island,\u201d he said, \u201cit is an honor for us.\u201dAs he grew older and grayer, Mr. Castro could no longer be easily linked to the intense guerrilla fighter who had come out of the Sierra Maestra. He rambled incoherently in his long speeches. He was rumored to be suffering from various diseases. After 40 years, the revolution he started no longer held promise, and Cubans by the thousands, including many who had never known any other life but under Mr. Castro, risked their lives trying to reach the United States on rafts, inner tubes and even old trucks outfitted with floats.Although the revolution lost its luster, what never diminished was Mr. Castro\u2019s ability to confound American officials and to create situations to seize the advantage of a particular moment.Mr. Castro made the boy another symbol of American oppression, which diverted attention from the deteriorating conditions in Cuba. After several months, American agents seized the boy from his Miami relatives and returned him to his father in Cuba, where he was greeted by Mr. Castro.Mr. Castro and his wife, Mirta D\u00edaz-Balart, divorced in 1955, six years after the birth of their son, Fidelito.In 1956, when Mr. Castro and Ms. D\u00edaz-Balart were both in Mexico, Mr. Castro arranged to have the boy visit him before embarking on what he said would be a dangerous voyage, which turned out to be his invasion of Cuba. He promised to bring the boy back in two weeks, but it was a trick. At the end of that period, Mr. Castro placed Fidelito in the custody of a friend in Mexico City. He then sailed for Cuba with his fellow rebels on the yacht Granma.Details of Mr. Castro\u2019s personal life were always murky. He had no formal home but lived in many different houses and estates in and around Havana. He had relationships with several women, and only in his later years was he willing to acknowledge that he had a relationship of more than 40 years with Dalia Soto del Valle, who had rarely been seen in public. (Whether they were legally married was not clear.)Mr. Castro had stormy relations with many of his relatives both in Cuba and the United States. He remained close to Celia S\u00e1nchez, a woman who was with him in the Sierra Maestra and who looked after his schedule and his archives devotedly, until she died in 1980. A sister, \u00c1ngela Castro, died at 88 in Havana in February 2012, according to The Associated Press, quoting her sister Juanita. And his elder brother Ram\u00f3n died in February 2016 at 91.Photographs from a land of endless waiting and palpable erosion \u2014 but also, an uncanny openness among everyday people.After being made his brother\u2019s successor, Ra\u00fal Castro tried to control the fragments of the revolution that remained after Fidel Castro fell ill, including a close association with President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, who modeled himself after Fidel. (Mr. Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013.)Never as popular as his brother, Ra\u00fal Castro was considered a better manager, and in some ways was seen as more conscious of the everyday needs of the Cuban people, despite his reputation as the revolution\u2019s executioner. One of his first moves as leader was to replace the grossly overcrowded city buses, known as \u201ccamels,\u201d with new ones, many imported from China. He opened up the economy somewhat, allowing entrepreneurs to start businesses, and he eased restrictions on traveling, access to cellphones, computers and other personal items, and the buying and selling of property.Still, Ra\u00fal Castro came under mounting pressure from Cubans demanding even more economic and political opportunity. He took more steps to open the economy and, in so doing, dismantled parts of the socialist state that his brother had defended for so long.\u201cI do not trust the politics of the United States, nor have I exchanged a word with them, but this is not, in any way, a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts,\u201d Mr. Castro wrote near the end of a rambling letter to students on the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of his own time at the University of Havana.Sounding more like his brother than his old self, he backed any peaceful attempts to resolve the problems between the two countries. He then took one final swipe at his old nemesis.\u201cThe grave dangers that threaten humanity today have to give way to norms that are compatible with human dignity,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNo country is excluded from such rights. With this spirit I have fought, and will continue fighting, until my last breath.\u201d\u201cSoon I will be like everybody else,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cOur turn comes to us all, but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure.\u201dNo one is sure if the force of the revolution will dissipate without Mr. Castro and, eventually, his brother. But Fidel Castro\u2019s impact on Latin America and the Western Hemisphere has the earmarks of lasting indefinitely. The power of his personality remains inescapable, for better or worse, not only in Cuba but also throughout Latin America.\u201cWe are going to live with Fidel Castro and all he stands for while he is alive,\u201d wrote Mr. Matthews of The Times, whose own fortunes were dimmed considerably by his connection to Mr. Castro, \u201cand with his ghost when he is dead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want America First? Try Free Trade", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsIF you bought yourself or someone you love medicine, a smartphone, new clothes or a child\u2019s toy today, your purchase was most likely made from a mix of components from many countries. The same was true for the meal you bought, the car you drove, the plane on which you recently flew and the carpet where your feet rest as you read these words.Our everyday life is made possible by trade. Critics of trade agreements, led by President-elect Donald J. Trump, want to change direction, renegotiating pacts like Nafta \u2014 which Mr. Trump called \u201cthe worst trade deal in history\u201d \u2014 and the agreement that brought China into the World Trade Organization. He wants to tear up the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership among the United States, Japan and 10 other Asia-Pacific countries. Mr. Trump, as well as many liberal critics of trade pacts, claims that the best way to raise incomes for Americans and strengthen the power of citizens over corporations is to restrict international collaboration and reassert our national autonomy.This is an illusion. The only way to advance the interests of American workers and consumers is to negotiate better and stronger international arrangements. The TPP represents an important step forward, and whether or not that deal survives in some form or other, trade agreements still remain among the best ways to give governments greater power to protect their citizens and improve the living standards of workers.We live in a world where fewer of the things we use come from any one place. More than half the goods and nearly three-quarters of the services traded globally are components from different countries \u2014 known as \u201cintermediates\u201d \u2014 that are later combined for final use. Multinational corporations are responsible for a majority of world trade and, by definition, transcend national boundaries. Nations compete vigorously for the investments of these companies, often by cutting corporate taxes and shelling out subsidies. One result is that no government on its own \u2014 even a powerful one like the United States \u2014 can advance the interests of its citizens without the cooperation of other governments.Consider the safety of the food we eat and the drugs we take. Opponents argue that trade agreements weaken the ability of the United States to set and enforce its own high standards. But the United States Food and Drug Administration demonstrates the futility of a \u201cfortress America\u201d approach. F.D.A.-regulated imports over the past 12 years have grown nearly sixfold, from six million to 35 million shipments involving more than 300,000 facilities in more than 150 different countries. It is simply impossible for the F.D.A. to enforce its high health and safety standards without local regulators and industry in other countries doing the same.Competition for investment is another example. Trade opponents hope that killing trade deals will stop corporations from outsourcing investments and bring jobs back to the United States. Mr. Trump favors corporate tax reform to lure companies home. But cutting corporate taxes won\u2019t work if other countries keep using beggar-thy-neighbor tax schemes to attract investment. The near-zero tax rate that Ireland offered to lure Apple is just the most egregious example. International cooperation is the only way to reduce such destructive competition, which dries up the revenues available for governments to spend on other priorities like infrastructure, a top Trump promise.Mr. Trump believes the United States can reduce its dependency on other governments by imposing high trade barriers and ensuring that the goods that Americans consume are made at home. But that would require reconfiguring the auto, computer, pharmaceutical and many other industries that employ millions of Americans and are now deeply integrated in global supply chains. There would also be a staggering cost to American consumers, and other nations like China have warned they would retaliate in kind against American exports.Trade agreements are not the only way for nations to collaborate, but they provide the economic incentives and high-level political commitment to help move cooperation forward and make it stick. Trade agreements can enable governments to reach consensus on investment rules, promote regulatory cooperation and transparency, and set more developing countries on the path of raising workplace and environmental standards.The opposition to the current generation of trade deals is wrongheaded because these deals do more than any other arrangements to date to address these issues. The TPP includes fairly strong provisions to help national regulators do their jobs better.

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Addiction to Coal", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 A world determined to limit climate change needs fewer coal mines. Burning coal is the largest single source of greenhouse-gas emissions, and the particles from its combustion are a major cause of air pollution, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year.Despite agreeing to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions at a global climate-change conference in Paris last year, the Australian government has recently given the go-ahead to a private company to open Australia\u2019s biggest coal mine. The state government has declared that the new mine, owned by the Indian Adani conglomerate, is a piece of \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201dA year ago, the Australian coal industry was struggling with low prices, following the end of a five-year boom. But this year the price of coal has more than doubled as the market has caught up to the big reductions in supply from countries like China, Indonesia and the United States, all of which have announced temporary stops on building new coal mines. The owners of existing mines have seen their profits soar over the last year.Most people would be skeptical of a tobacco company that simultaneously claimed it supported efforts to curb smoking while building a new cigarette factory. Yet Australia\u2019s politicians say they want to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions while planning to build new coal mines \u2014 and they go largely unchallenged. This hypocrisy is possible because emissions from exported coal are not counted in the country\u2019s targets.And like gun ownership in the United States, support for the construction of new coal mines in Australia is a powerful political issue. Conservatives like Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, use coal mining to unite a coalition of climate skeptics, free marketers and workers in mining regions by talking up the country\u2019s \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to build new mines that create jobs for Australians and coal for the world\u2019s poor. They depict opponents of new mines as unconcerned with exports, workers and the right of people in developing countries to access electricity.There are no meaningful treaties or laws to prevent Australia from pursuing its huge expansion of coal exports. Indeed, the structure of the world\u2019s climate change negotiations is such that at the Paris talks last year, attended by nearly 150 world leaders, and previous similar world meetings, the word \u201ccoal\u201d rarely, if ever, appears in official communiqu\u00e9s. Such an omission is no accident. Energy-exporting countries like Australia work hard to ensure that the language of official proclamations does nothing to reduce the legitimacy of a major export.All mines eventually run out of coal. And because the world has thousands of mines, each year hundreds of them inevitably shut down. It follows that the easiest and fairest way to begin the transition away from coal is to simply stop new mines from being built while the old ones gradually run down. This relatively simple solution \u2014 a moratorium on building new coal mines \u2014 is gaining support around the world among economists, environmentalists and elements of the coal industry itself.While the thought of the world\u2019s largest coal exporter voluntarily agreeing to stop building new mines might seem far-fetched, the fact that China, the United States and Indonesia have all announced such policies shows it is possible.Further, while a great many of Australian politicians are enthusiastic supporters of building new coal mines, Australian voters are far less so. Polls show that most Australians want governments to stop approving new mines, and economic modeling shows that stopping the building of new mines would have a negligible impact on Australia\u2019s economy. That\u2019s because, contrary to popular belief, coal is not a large employer here and accounts for a small share of Australia\u2019s gross domestic product.If Australia follows through in its plans to build enormous new coal mines, the world will fail to rapidly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Australia\u2019s politicians need to catch up to other big coal-producing nations that have supported a moratorium on the construction of new mines.Richard Denniss is the chief economist for The Australia Institute.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018White Nationalism,\u2019 Explained", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterA question has been posed in a puzzled whisper in many of the nation\u2019s living rooms and newsrooms ever since Donald J. Trump\u2019s triumph in this month\u2019s presidential election: What, exactly, is white nationalism?Self-proclaimed white nationalists have happily embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and, particularly, his choice of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist, as a win for their agenda. A barrage of groups that fight discrimination and hate speech have, in turn, criticized Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment, warning that his embrace of the \u201calt-right\u201d movement was little more than an attempt to rebrand racism and white nationalism into something palatable enough for mass consumption.And much of the rest of the country has been left to wonder what this unfamiliar term actually means.While white nationalism certainly overlaps with white supremacy and racism, many political scientists say it is a distinct phenomenon \u2014 one that was a powerful but often-unseen force during the presidential election and will most likely remain a potent factor in American and European politics in coming years.Eric Kaufmann, a professor of politics at Birkbeck University in London, has spent years studying the ways that ethnicity intersects with politics. While most researchers in that field focus on ethnic minorities, Professor Kaufmann does the opposite: He studies the behavior of ethnic majorities, particularly whites in the United States and Britain.White nationalism, he said, is the belief that national identity should be built around white ethnicity, and that white people should therefore maintain both a demographic majority and dominance of the nation\u2019s culture and public life.So, like white supremacy, white nationalism places the interests of white people over those of other racial groups. White supremacists and white nationalists both believe that racial discrimination should be incorporated into law and policy.Some will see the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy as a semantic sleight of hand. But although many white supremacists are also white nationalists, and vice versa, Professor Kaufmann says the terms are not synonyms: White supremacy is based on a racist belief that white people are innately superior to people of other races; white nationalism is about maintaining political and economic dominance, not just a numerical majority or cultural hegemony.For a long time, he said, white nationalism was less an ideology than the default presumption of American life. Until quite recently, white Americans could easily see the nation as essentially an extension of their own ethnic group.But the country\u2019s changing demographics, the civil rights movement and a push for multiculturalism in many quarters mean that white Americans are now confronting the prospect of a nation that is no longer built solely around their own identity.For many white people, of course, the growing diversity is something to celebrate. But for others it is a source of stress. The white nationalist movement has drawn support from that latter group. Its supporters argue that the United States should protect its white majority by sharply limiting immigration, and perhaps even by compelling nonwhite citizens to leave.For instance, Richard B. Spencer, who runs the website AlternativeRight.com, is also the director of the National Policy Institute, an organization that says it is devoted to protecting the \u201cheritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.\u201d\u201cWhen two-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think \u2026,\u201d he said, trailing off midsentence before continuing a moment later, \u201ca country is more than an economy. We\u2019re a civic society.\u201dWhite nationalists, including Mr. Spencer, have rejoiced at Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment to such a senior position in the Trump White House. But focusing on high-profile figures like Mr. Bannon may obscure the more significant way that white nationalist ideas are affecting politics \u2014 and fueling the rise of politicians like Mr. Trump in the United States as well as anti-immigrant populist movements in Britain and continental Europe.Several studies of other countries have found that a desire to protect traditional values and culture is the strongest predictor of support for the sort of populism that propelled Mr. Trump to power in the United States.Many of those voters would not think of themselves as white nationalists, and the cultural values and traditions they seek to protect are not necessarily explicitly racial. However, those traditions formed when national identity and culture were essentially synonymous with whiteness. So the impulse to protect them from social and demographic change is essentially an attempt to turn back the clock to a less-diverse time.Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, a professor of politics at the University of Bergen in Norway, came to a similar conclusion after studying anti-immigrant policies in Europe. Their supporters, she found, were motivated by a desire to protect their national culture \u2014 suggesting they believed that immigrants posed a threat to it.Professor Kaufmann argues that anxiety over white identity and anti-immigrant populist politicians can have a symbiotic relationship, each strengthening the other. When populist politicians gain mainstream success, that can make white nationalist ideas more socially acceptable.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of ethnic change and people being alarmed over it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a question of what people see as the boundaries of acceptable opposition. It\u2019s about what counts as racism, and whether it\u2019s racist to vote for a far-right party.\u201d\u201cThis is all about the anti-racist norm,\u201d Professor Kaufmann continued. \u201cIf it\u2019s weakening or eroding because people think the boundaries have shifted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Money Question to Rule Them All: How Much Is Enough?", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyAs we enter this season of contemplation and reflection, we all have more than the usual number of everyday financial questions weighing on us.How much more might we pay for health care under President-elect Donald Trump? How will any new trade policies affect our household budgets and job prospects? How much less will some of us pay in taxes after his promised reforms, and what might we do with what could be many thousands of dollars of extra money?Step back a bit, however, and you will see that every money question eventually boils down to a single line of inquiry: How much is enough?It is a quantitative question for sure. How much insurance is enough, how much federal revenue and how much personal income and spending. But the question\u2019s qualitative nature is what makes it special and singular. It is about how money makes us feel and, ultimately, it is an inquiry into the nature of our values \u2014 about what our spending, saving and giving say about us and what we and our families ultimately stand for.But addressing the question is an appropriate task right now, given an unpredictable president-elect and a Congress nominally behind him poised to make good on at least some promises to change our financial lives. Absent any certainty about what will happen in Washington, we can at least try to get ourselves square in our heads about what feels like enough for us.She, too, is reluctant to order anyone to start new spreadsheets. She does note, however, that you probably won\u2019t achieve Zen mastery with just two breaths or forgiveness and enlightenment by taking communion once in a while. \u201cRigor is the tiller on your boat,\u201d she said.Not everyone will be able to meet those targets, especially if they live in a high-cost area, if their income is irregular or if temporary job loss or illness interrupts their earning. But at least those percentages give people something to shoot for or revise from when attempting to define enough savings and discretionary spending in their own lives.Giving children an allowance to budget and practice with can help get them started. How much is enough pocket money? Just enough so that they have the things they need and some of what they want, but not so much that they do not have to make hard choices. Tradeoffs are what we adults do each day, after all, and all parents are ultimately in the adult-making business.Hers is an ecological sensibility. She indulges, she said, in thrift-store clothing and investments in local businesses on the island she lives on outside Seattle.Her notion of excess happens to be an essential concept at a time when many people of above-average means may end 2017 or 2018 with extra money, if the tax laws change. Giving that money away to people who need it more than you do is a worthy reflex, but Ms. Thakor isn\u2019t sure that is the right answer for everyone.Whatever it is, talk about it with your spouse, friends or family. How much is enough is as good a Thanksgiving conversation starter as any and probably better than most at a time when politics may be a touchy subject.You will be richer for having had the conversation, but just don\u2019t expect an easy answer or one that won\u2019t change over time as your goals do. Ms. Thakor has an M.B.A. and is a certified financial planner, so she is surprised by the lack of a clear solution to the challenge that the question poses. \u201cBut as I travel around the country, it\u2019s clear to me that there is not a numerical answer.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: McLaren 570GT Is a Rare Blend of Speed and Comfort", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byDrivenYears later, I joyfully slid behind the wheel of my first exotic \u2014 a Lamborghini Countach in the 1990s \u2014 and emerged from a long drive thinking: Who on earth could live with a car this cramped, loud and stiffly sprung?McLaren takes a softer approach with the 570GT. Compared with its companion, the performance 570S version, the GT\u2019s front suspension firmness is relaxed by 15 percent in front and 10 percent in the rear. Acoustical insulation is added to the cabin. Special Pirelli tires include a foam liner of sorts to cut road noise. The GT gets a tamer exhaust note, too.The result is high performance, high style and high livability. Oh, and high price.Chances are slim that the car, starting at just over $200,000 ($215,000 as tested), will grab market share from the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. But in the four days I had the GT, my wife was astonished at my eagerness to run errands of any kind.Kept in its most docile drive mode, the 570GT is relaxed motoring about town. Modern technology has given supercars better manners. The McLaren, along with the Porsche 911 Turbo S, get my votes for most livable day-to-day performance cars.Remarkably decaffeinated while cruising from drugstore to pizza place, the GT is never jittery. And yet, employ launch control and the car will sprint from 0 to 60 in 3.3 seconds.Surely, few people buy cars this expensive, but such vehicles are important because they pioneer technology that trickles down to everyday cars. Recall that anti-lock brakes showed up first on supercars in the late 1970s. (The 570GT\u2019s brakes are very good, by the way.)Perhaps McLaren\u2019s carbon-fiber tub chassis structure will be common in the future. Shaving weight has improved efficiency. With an E.P.A. fuel economy rating of 16 city and 23 highway on specified premium gas, the car matches many crossovers. Fun fact: No McLaren gets saddled with a gas-guzzler tax.Those special, foam-lined rear tires are driven by a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 pumping out 562 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic is smarter than most drivers, but there is also a manual mode. Gearbox and throttle mapping can be altered. Suspension stiffness can be set, too. So really, the GT gives up little to the firmer-sprung S model.The 570GT is quiet for a car of this ilk. (If it\u2019s an isolation chamber you want, buy a Lexus or Buick.) When the road bends hard, the rear-drive McLaren is an automotive Veg-O-Matic, slicing and dicing curves with ease and efficiency. The rear-drive dynamic allows for oversteer with a blip of the throttle. Entertaining? Oh, yes.Choose from an array of leather and stitching colors to personalize the cabin. Built in Britain, the 570 feels more handcrafted and small-volume than cars from other high-end automakers. Features like the transmission operation (which requires deliberate button pushing) and the touch-screen interface take awhile to get used to.The power seat controls, hidden on the lower front of the chairs, are vexing and perhaps the worst I\u2019ve used. Visibility out the front is quite good, but thankfully a backup camera is standard.The car has a small front trunk, and the rear glass yawns open to accept a second suitcase (passers-by can see through the glass, so make it the better-looking bag).Some practical 570 buying advice? Go with the GT rather than the S. McLaren claims most buyers load up the lighter, less expensive S (beginning at around $186,000) to the same price and weight as the GT, so you might as well enjoy the livability.The swept aluminum skin is especially impressive in person. Children who skip homework to ogle cars on the internet know what a McLaren is, but most eyeballs that lock on to the exotic shape confuse it with a Lamborghini. The striking 570GT could be the most outrageous way to travel comfortably and rapidly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Austria\u2019s Far Right Sees a Prize Within Reach: The Presidency", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byVIENNA \u2014 In his office in Austria\u2019s grand old Parliament, Norbert Hofer, the man who would be Austria\u2019s next president, presents himself as anything but a threat.He enters with a pronounced limp as a result of a 2003 paragliding accident. He air-kisses a visitor\u2019s hand. He then spends much of the next hour professing that he is not nationalist and certainly not anti-Semitic, insists that he is too young to have anything to do with Nazism and says that he is no part of any populist wave.Yet Mr. Hofer, 45, also flashes a boyish grin and can hardly help but betray an extra air of confidence these days. In a year of political shocks, this may be the shape of the next.Mr. Hofer, a leading light in the right-wing Freedom Party, is counting on Austrians to make him the first far-right head of state in post-World War II Europe when they vote on Sunday, the final act in a yearlong tussle that has turned into a contest to mold the fate of the Continent\u2019s heart.As the vote nears, he is running neck and neck with Alexander Van der Bellen, a 72-year-old former economics professor and ex-leader of the Greens party in an election that is a rerun of a contested vote earlier this year.Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Mr. Hofer said, has eroded any lingering inhibitions that Austrians may have had about openly supporting his candidacy, though that remained to be seen.\u201cWith Trump\u2019s victory, that barrier has loosened a bit,\u201d Mr. Hofer said with evident satisfaction.The existence of such barriers hints at a lasting stigma around the Freedom Party, which was created by a group of former Nazis in the 1950s and gained political traction under the charismatic leadership of the populist J\u00f6rg Haider in the 1990s.But if Mr. Hofer has foes, he says, they are the misguided politicians who allow jihadists disguised as migrants into Austria and elsewhere in Europe, where his party\u2019s leader sees \u201cIslamification\u201d underway.In Austria, the Freedom Party regularly leads opinion polls, with about one-third of the vote, easily surpassing the mainstream center-left and center-right parties and raising the once unthinkable possibility that the party will not only win the presidency, but soon head the government as well.The lengthy campaign has not blunted interest or emotions: Each side sees the outcome as having a larger bearing on Europe and even the United States.\u201cIf the FP\u00d6 takes power, Austria will not be recognizable,\u201d wrote Hans Rauscher, a prominent columnist, in the liberal daily Der Standard last week.The party seeks a rejection of liberal democracy and is \u201cpopulist, nationalist, intolerant, anti-European,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has the tailwind of successful extreme populist movements in Europe, and now also in the U.S.A.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Rauscher said the main theme in the election was fear of foreigners \u2014 long a Freedom Party staple, and now focused on Muslims \u2014 and fear for the future.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.That year, 10 times as many migrants, or nearly one million people, passed through Austria, a country of 8.4 million.As a percentage of the population, \u201cit is as if 30 million people would have crossed through the U.S.A.,\u201d Mr. Hofer said, as he smiled and took a puff on his electronic cigarette.Mr. Hofer, who has picked up on a previously little-noticed provision that could allow the president to dismiss a government or individual ministers, clearly aims to mold policy. He has visited neighboring Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and speaks of forging an alliance of Central and Eastern European nations under Austrian guidance.In the interview, he repeatedly expressed hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory will lead to relations\u2019 being mended between the United States and Russia.Sanctions against Moscow over its seizure of Crimea and meddling in Ukraine should be lifted, he said, \u201cbecause they have not moved anything politically,\u201d yet \u201chave affected the economy and destroyed jobs.\u201dVienna, a neutral meeting place for the Cold War superpowers, should once again host peace-seeking summits and foster economic cooperation with Russia, he said.\u201cIf people and businesses work together economically, there is a greater understanding for the Russian and American and Austrian souls,\u201d Mr. Hofer said.Opinion polls have seesawed around the 50-50 mark, suggesting that the race is again extremely close.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Identified only as Gertrude, she recalled seeing her first dead body during the 1934 left-right street battles here and Viennese residents\u2019 mocking the Jews forced to scrub streets with toothbrushes after the Nazis took power.Mr. Van der Bellen\u2019s campaign said her identity would be kept secret for fear of hate attacks on social media that have already been a feature of the months of campaign vitriol. The video garnered over 2.5 million views in three days.A TV talk show host, Corinna Milborn, grilled Mr. Hofer last week for an hour over his alleged nationalist views and his calls for undoing the \u201cunjust border\u201d that keeps South Tyrol, a region of northern Italy, apart from Austria\u2019s Tyrol. Mr. Hofer\u2019s grin evaporated and he almost blew his cool.The next day he lamented in the interview with The Times that \u201cit happens again and again before an election, unpacking the Fascism cudgel\u201d against his party. \u201cIt is a pity, because, you know, I was born in 1971 and I hate the National Socialists who are responsible for millions of deaths.\u201d\u201cThere are no extreme-right parties in Austria,\u201d he added. The Freedom Party \u2014 whose slogan is \u201cAustria First!\u201d \u2014 is center-right, he said, but in any event \u201cto make right-wing politics is quite in order so long as it is not anti-Semitic.\u201dDaniel Kapp, a Vienna-based consultant who holds American and German passports and knows Austrian and Israeli politics, noted that Mr. Hofer and other Freedom Party leaders had made it part of their strategy to draw closer to Israel.A shared apprehension about Muslims is one impetus, Mr. Kapp suggested. Another is that it blunts eventual criticism of the Freedom Party if it takes power.In any case, ties with Mr. Trump are likely to be close. At a Nov. 18 gathering in Vienna, Heinz-Christian Strache, the trained dental technician who leads the Freedom Party, was quite clear about the inspiration provided by Mr. Trump.\u201cOn Dec. 4, the impossible is possible,\u201d Mr. Strache told hundreds of supporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it in the U.S., we can do it in Austria. We\u2019re a little cautious here, it\u2019s our style. But if the Americans can do it, we can do it.\u201dKimberly Bradley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Trump promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d that he sees in the nation\u2019s capital, his millions of supporters are expecting vast changes in the sprawling federal bureaucracy, and conservative activists are drooling at the chance to remake, resize or reduce the reach of government.Mr. Trump repeatedly told voters during the campaign that he would shut down the Environmental Protection Agency and repeal the Affordable Care Act. He said the Education Department is \u201cmassive, and it can be largely eliminated.\u201d He has made the federal work force of 2.8 million employees a target, declaring that \u201cyou have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201dBut the one-time real estate mogul has largely avoided specifics about cuts he might make, and much of his agenda imagines changes that would require huge increases in federal spending: tripling the number of border patrol agents; supplying the military with more warships and fighter jets; increasing spending on infrastructure; undertaking new efforts to confront cyberterrorism; and aggressively working to remake trade policies.Whatever change he envisions will likely be vastly more difficult to enact than his army of supporters believe. Veterans of Washington\u2019s many fights over policy warn that the city is full of ingrained bureaucracies, each of which has entrenched support on Capitol Hill. And while Mr. Trump will have some executive authority, legal, practical and political limitations will constrain his efforts.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t possess the executive power to reorganize the government at whim,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a law professor at Harvard University who served in the first Obama administration. \u201cThere are some minor things presidents can do, in terms of creating new offices in cabinet agencies. But the notion that he can single-handedly abolish agencies is fanciful.\u201d\u201cI imagine they\u2019ll focus on getting rid of the individual and employer mandates, insurance marketplace requirements and Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Lanhee J.

But he said he is largely mystified about the president-elect\u2019s plans. \u201cTrump is a huge question mark,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we honestly don\u2019t know which way he is going go.\u201dThe president-elect has vowed to double the nation\u2019s rate of economic growth through a combination of broad tax cuts, new trade policies and smart deregulation.\u201cI think Dodd-Frank is the major reason the economy has not grown at the usual pace of recovery following a recession,\u201d said Peter Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.Some conservatives may also be disappointed when it comes to Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to the nation\u2019s military and intelligence establishment. Mr. Trump lashed out during the campaign at Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy, his handling of wars in the Middle East and the government\u2019s effort on immigration. But the president-elect\u2019s prescription for change is likely to result in more spending, not less.\u201cForging change will be much, much harder than he expects,\u201d she said.A spokeswoman for the president-elect declined on Thursday to provide any information about Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking about the size and shape of government.

{"Headline": "No Saints for President", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byThe ConversationJust for a change of pace, let\u2019s pretend for a minute we\u2019re in a normal presidential contest. Give me the sanest arguments for a pro-Trump vote. Right now. Clock is ticking.The first is the negative argument: He\u2019s not her. Many voters are just sickened by the sleaziness of the Clinton machine \u2014 the dubious explanations about the emails; the secretiveness; the inside relationships that enrich the family and the Clinton Foundation; the apparent tendency to always, always, always take the money. I\u2019ve heard so many centrist people say something like, \u201cI don\u2019t like Trump, but I just can\u2019t stomach the Clinton corruption and scandals.\u201d They knows he\u2019s trouble, but for them, he\u2019s the lesser of two evils.A nationalism that focuses on physical borders and legal citizenship offers a tidy answer to this question. Hence the present appeal of Trump\u2019s emphasis on immigration. Scratch a bit, though, and you can also find some people who answer in terms of excluding certain languages, races or religions.The third argument comes from a kind of nihilism. Think of this as the \u201cPort Authority Theory of Government.\u201d If somebody asked you, me or most of our readers how to fix the Port Authority, we\u2019d instinctively argue that we should bust up the whole thing and start from scratch. Otherwise it\u2019s just pouring more and more money down a well. Nobody really thinks that more money for the current system will make Kennedy Airport less gross and embarrassing.Anyway, for years, many conservatives have been saying that the whole federal government is effectively one big, wasteful, corrupt Port Authority. Everything bureaucrats touch turns to garbage. To go all out on the metaphors, you gotta drain the swamp, and the only person who can do this is a destructive outsider with an itch to break stuff. You say Trump is nuts? All the better!You do not clean up the water, or instill high standards in the schools, or provide a reasonable safety net for the disadvantaged without a certain level of messiness. The same people who hate massive government regulation are the ones who complain about simple programs that don\u2019t screen out all the less-than-deserving applicants for aid.Sorry, I was ranting. So, the three Ns. Is that it?But let\u2019s go back to your rant, which I think is important.I know there\u2019s some irony in the way people complain about the government. We\u2019ve all heard about the infamous protest sign that liberals used to mock the Tea Party protests: \u201cKeep your government hands off my Medicare!\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that lots of people distrust government per se but are reliant on government benefits.The key thing to remember is that a government that solves market failures isn\u2019t necessarily one that suffocates everything with social engineering. There\u2019s a misconception today that we have to choose between anarcho-capitalism and state control of everything. Our goal should be clean water with the lightest touch possible to allow free enterprise to flourish maximally. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, though \u2014 this requires some taxes and some regulation.So when it comes to taxes and spending, what do you predict we\u2019ll see depending on who is elected?If Donald Trump is elected, he\u2019ll do what Republican presidents almost always do: propose big tax reductions that Congress will happily pass, along with budget cuts that won\u2019t make it through. The nation will plunge into higher deficits and a larger gap between rich and poor. However, we probably won\u2019t even notice, since we\u2019ll be way too worried about the collapse of our economy after the trade wars start, not to mention the possibility of nuclear apocalypse.Just saying.The Trump scenario is a lot more of a wild card because, well, we just have no clue. The policy ideas are ever-changing and not exactly central to the campaign. But it does seem very likely that no matter who is elected, given the commitment of both candidates not to address our biggest fiscal problems like runaway entitlements, these problems will worsen in the coming years.Happy voting, Arthur.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Killers on a Shoestring: Inside the Gangs of El Salvador", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported bySAN SALVADOR \u2014 On a sultry evening in late July, the Salvadoran authorities executed their very first assault on what they called the financial cupola of Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, the largest of the ruthless gangs that have made El Salvador the murder capital of the world.Until that point, the National Civil Police had followed an almost choreographed routine, again and again, as they sought to cripple the gangs economically. In the dead of night, often accompanied by television cameras, officers would batter down the doors of ramshackle houses in marginalized communities and then arrest and put on display a cluster of tattooed and half-naked men.Between 2012 and 2015, the total amount confiscated in these showy anti-extortion raids was $34,664.75 \u2014 an absurdly tiny sum considering that the United States has designated MS-13 as a global criminal organization on a par with the Zetas of Mexico, or the Yakuza of Japan.On July 27, however, in a mission baptized Operation Check, the authorities shifted gears. They deployed 1,127 police officers to raid scores of supposed gang fronts, including car dealerships and bars, motels and brothels.With great fanfare, they presented to the news media rows and rows of impounded buses and cars, along with 77 suspects identified as the financial operatives of MS-13 and their collaborators. Among them were the supposed C.E.O. of the street gang, Marvin Ramos Quintanilla, and two other leaders portrayed as controlling millions and possessing luxuries unimaginable to the destitute gang members beneath them.But the presentation was something of an exaggeration, as are many official characterizations of the gangs whose criminal sophistication and global reach tend to be overstated by authorities frustrated that they cannot vanquish them. For instance, that supposed chief executive officer hardly lived like a kingpin; he leased a squat concrete house with a corrugated roof in a neighborhood where rents rarely reach $400. He owned an old Honda Civic and a Nissan van.And yet, the reporting determined, MS-13 and its rival street gangs in El Salvador are not sophisticated transnational criminal enterprises. They do not begin to belong in the same financial league with the billion-dollar Mexican, Japanese and Russian syndicates with which they are grouped. If they are mafias, they are mafias of the poor. El Salvador has been brought to its knees by an army of flies.MS-13\u2019s annual revenue appears to be about $31.2 million. That estimate is based on information in the 1,355-page file of Operation Check, to which El Faro got exclusive access. Wiretapped conversations reveal that the gang\u2019s national leadership ordered its 49 \u201cprograms,\u201d or chapters, to turn over all the money earned in a single, typical week, which happened to be in April. It collected $600,852.It sounds like a lot of money. But if divided equitably among the estimated 40,000 members of MS-13, each gang member would earn $15 a week and about $65 a month. That is half the minimum wage of an agricultural day laborer.But the gangs \u2014 MS-13 and its main rival, the 18th Street gang \u2014 do not distribute their proceeds equitably. They use them to pay for lawyers and funeral services, for weapons and munitions, and for the support of those serving long prison terms and their families. Theirs is a criminal subsistence economy; even many of their leaders are barely solvent.\u201cThat the authorities call them \u2018businessmen\u2019 \u2014 either their intelligence is invalid or it\u2019s pretty crude,\u201d said Rolando Monroy, a former Salvadoran prosecutor who oversaw money-laundering investigations until 2013. \u201cThe gangs are like an anthill. They are all after the same thing: something to eat.\u201dUnlike other groups considered global organized crime syndicates, the Salvadoran gangs do not survive on the international trafficking of cocaine, arms and humans. While they dabble in small-time drug dealing, gun sales and prostitution, they engage primarily in a single crime committed over and over within Salvadoran territory: extortion.Inside El Salvador, they hold the reins of power largely because of a chilling demand repeated \u2014 or implied \u2014 daily across the country: Pay or die.\u201cLook, the thing is we\u2019re not joking around,\u201d said one threat in childlike handwriting delivered to a bus owner recently. \u201cGet something together. If not, we are going to burn one of your new minibuses.\u201d It was signed by the 18th Street gang: \u201c18 sends its best.\u201dAt 4 p.m. on a summer day in 2015, two young gang members intercepted a businessman as he was returning home from work. \u201cI have kids. Calm down, please,\u201d he managed to say before the youths grabbed him, threw him to the ground and shot him: in a shoulder, in the stomach, and twice in the face.They were delivering a message written in lead.\u201cIt was because of the extortion, not for any other reason,\u201d the man\u2019s son said.The man owned a bus. His son, who also owned a bus, said his father, tired of being extorted, had finally stopped making his $1 daily payment to the gang three weeks before his death. It murdered him because of $21.Among Salvadoran businesses, transportation companies, whose vehicles crisscross gang territory, have proved especially vulnerable to extortion. Over the last five years, it has been more dangerous to drive a bus than to fight gang crime: The gangs have killed 692 transportation workers \u2014 and 93 police officers. (This is according to an analysis of internal government data that, like most data in this article, is not considered public information but was obtained by El Faro.)Genaro Ram\u00edrez, the owner of a large bus company and a former member of Congress, calculates that he has handed over $500,000 in gang extortion payments over the last 19 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWhen they tell you they are going to kill you, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dBetween 2013 and 2015, the National Police received 7,506 reports of extortion, which the authorities see as just a small fraction of the total. In the same period, some 424 gang members were convicted of this crime, most of them low-level people who made the pickups and were caught with the cash.The payment of extortion by bus companies is so commonplace that some have employees whose principal role is to negotiate with the gangs, which are continually raising their rates and demanding extras like Christmas bonuses or buses to take them to the beach or to the funerals of associates.The only transportation company chief who has refused to be extorted \u2014 and has made his refusal public \u2014 is Catalino Miranda. Mr. Miranda owns a fleet of several hundred buses.Since 2004, the gangs have killed 26 of his employees. But he refuses to reconsider his position.\u201cAs I told one of them,\u201d he said, referring to a gang representative, \u201cgo ahead and kill them. This cannot continue for a lifetime.\u201dMr. Miranda spoke in his office, with a 9-millimeter pistol lying atop a mess of papers on his desk, and rifles and flak jackets piled in a corner. He spends $30,000 a month on security, he said. He has cameras posted in all his buses and stations, and eight security guards, armed with assault weapons, who patrol the gang zones his buses move through.When his employees are killed, he hires private detectives to investigate, because \u201cthe state does not have the capacity to protect witnesses.\u201d\u201cThey use you,\u201d Mr. Miranda continued, \u201cand they abandon you.\u201dResisting the gangs is not an option for small-business owners, however. Many of them live in gang-controlled neighborhoods themselves and cannot escape the pressure to pay. That was the situation for the bus owner killed in the summer of 2015.The bus owner\u2019s son, who is 38, spoke of his father\u2019s death in an open-air restaurant beside the Pan-American Highway. The son carried a pistol \u2014 he always has one by his side, even when he sleeps, he said \u2014 and sat facing the entrance, with his back to a ravine, so he could track comings and goings.Like most businessmen who recounted their experiences with shakedowns, the man spoke on the condition of anonymity. His father was one of 154 transportation workers who lost their lives to gang-run extortion rings in 2015. To talk is to risk becoming another statistic.It all started one afternoon in 2004, he recounted, when a couple of teenage gangsters boarded a bus on their route. The youths demanded the driver\u2019s license and registration, reviewed the documents and then handed the driver a disposable phone before jumping off.After the shaken driver returned to the terminal, the phone rang. The voice on the other end laid out the terms of their new relationship: $10 a week not just for the one bus but for each of the 10 buses on the route.The man, his father and the other bus owners held an emergency meeting to discuss whether to report the demand to the police.Many victims do not bother. Extortion investigations require them to make payments to the gangs while the police watch and collect evidence. But the gangs almost always find out, and the victim is threatened or killed before the investigation is completed.Even so, the men decided to call the police. Soon, two detectives stationed themselves inside their terminal and, posing as bus owners, negotiated a rate with the gang: $1 a day per bus.Over the next three years, the police arrested three gang leaders, including one who lived next door to the man\u2019s father. The investigation expanded to other crimes and dragged on. The bus owners kept paying extortion.The situation deteriorated. Between 2004 and 2012, MS-13 killed five bus drivers on their routes and one of the police investigators assigned to their case. In 2012, the gang tried to kill the man himself, surrounding his house, he said at the restaurant.After his father\u2019s murder, the gang increased its extortion on the route \u2014 to $1.50 a day.The man sold his bus.When the Salvadoran authorities draw a flow chart of MS-13\u2019s organizational structure, they always put a mug shot of El Diablito de Hollywood, the Little Devil of Hollywood, at the very top.Hierarchically, El Diablito \u2014 Borromeo Henr\u00edquez Sol\u00f3rzano, 38 \u2014 is as far above \u201chomeboy\u201d as one can get. If gang leaders are enriching themselves at the expense of the rank and file, Mr. Henr\u00edquez should be the wealthiest capo di tutti. And yet.In the late 1970s or early 1980s, Mr. Henr\u00edquez and his family fled the Salvadoran civil war along with thousands of their compatriots who resettled in Los Angeles neighborhoods dominated by Mexican gangs. Mara Salvatrucha was born there and then.At the end of the 1990s, as part of an anti-gang offensive and a crackdown on \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d the United States shipped planeloads of gang members made in the United States back to El Salvador and other Central American countries. El Diablito returned to his homeland in one of those waves of deportation.He was just a teenager, but in that era coming from Los Angeles conferred status in the branch of Mara Salvatrucha that had sprouted in El Salvador. (Loosely affiliated but largely autonomous branches now exist in other Central American countries and in pockets of the United States outside California.) It was like arriving with a seal of \u201coriginal product,\u201d and El Diablito, clever and garrulous, quickly parlayed that into a position of power.Prison, where he was sent in 1998 after getting a 30-year sentence for homicide, only solidified his stature.Soon after he was first locked up, Mr. Henr\u00edquez summoned the leader of one of Mara Salvatrucha\u2019s most powerful cells to visit him in prison, the leader related in an interview. At that time, the gang had no reliable revenue stream, though members sold drugs on street corners, committed petty robberies and demanded small handouts from bus drivers. But Mr. Henr\u00edquez had a moneymaking plan, he told the leader.El Diablito said he wanted to institutionalize extortion nationwide, the leader related. He was insistent that the leader accede to the plan, or quit: MS-13 would tolerate no dissidents. The leader communicated the new directive to his troops. A few years later, the leader quit and emigrated to Washington, D.C., where he now owns a small business in a Salvadoran neighborhood.Like El Diablito, most of the national gang leaders operate from behind bars. Through ready access to cellphones and private visits with lawyers, they retain tight control of their organizations \u2014 the money the gangs earn and the havoc they wreak.This became chillingly apparent in 2012 when the government was negotiating a truce with the gangs and Mr. Henr\u00edquez was emerging into the public eye as a spokesman for MS-13. The leaders sent out an order from behind bars: Stop killing. And from one day to the next, homicides dropped 60 percent to a level that, with small variations, was maintained until the government\u2019s negotiations with the gangs, which were highly unpopular, ended two years later.During the truce, a team from El Faro was allowed to interview gang leaders in the Ciudad Barrios jail, which was dominated by MS-13. For over a decade, the gangs have been separated by institution to reduce internecine warfare; this has had the unintended effect of strengthening them by uniting rather than dispersing their leadership.Dressed gang-fashionably in baggy, black athletic attire, Mr. Henr\u00edquez insisted that he survived on money sent by relatives in the United States and by a brother who sold used cars in El Salvador.\u201cDo you realize it is difficult to believe that one of the most visible leaders of MS-13 does not derive a penny of his income from illicit activities?\u201d a reporter from El Faro said.Mr. Henr\u00edquez paused, then responded: \u201cMy money does not come from extortion.\u201d But he was pressed: What about illicit activities more generally? El Diablito answered with a derisive smile: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come from extortion.\u201d And all the other gang leaders laughed, cryptically.That year \u2014 2012 \u2014 the United States Treasury Department designated MS-13 as a transnational criminal organization, alongside four criminal syndicates: the Zetas, the Yakuza, the Russian Brothers\u2019 Circle and the Italian Camorra. It was the first street gang that had ever received that designation.The next year, the Treasury put personal sanctions on Mr. Henr\u00edquez, which had the effect of forbidding Americans to do business with him and authorizing federal investigators to freeze his financial assets.No evidence has surfaced that any of Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s properties or assets in the United States were frozen.Sanctions were also placed on El Diablito\u2019s wife, Jenny Judith Corado. The Salvadoran government arrested her in 2013 and accused her of belonging to a Mara Salvatrucha extortion ring. It could not prove her connection to the ring, however; she was freed and ordered to turn over the money that a judge considered the provenance of extortion: $50.Now, Ms. Corado does not appear to be enjoying a life of luxury or even comfort. With her children beside her, she spends her days hawking used clothing and lingerie from a stall constructed of tin cans in the busy public marketplace of San Salvador.In the news conference announcing Operation Check (as in the chess move), the authorities spoke of gang leaders\u2019 \u201cluxuries,\u201d their \u201cinvestments\u201d and their \u201cvarious millions of dollars.\u201d\u201cThese leaders are living a different life than the gang members beneath them,\u201d Douglas Mel\u00e9ndez, the attorney general, said. \u201cThe gang members beneath them should know.\u201dIt was a communiqu\u00e9 directed at the street, at those rank-and-file gangsters who put their lives on the line for little tangible reward: While their leaders may have been preaching a doctrine of brotherhood, they were secretly enriching themselves at the expense of their brothers, their soldiers, their homeboys.The luxuries, however, consisted of 22 imported but used cars, each valued at about $8,000. The confiscated cash amounted to $34,500. And the investments numbered three: a taqueria and bar in Soyapango, a working-class community in the San Salvador metropolitan area; a vegetable stand in a rural marketplace; and a highway restaurant that is decorated with a deer\u2019s head, offers karaoke and has three waiters who primarily serve buckets of beer bottles.The gangs\u2019 credo of fraternity and equality does not allow for any personal gain at the expense of the brotherhood, and they at least theoretically enforce it brutally. \u201cHe who makes himself rich at the expense of the street is going to die,\u201d a leader of the 18th Street gang said in an interview.So even a vegetable stand is a risky venture, and the wiretapped conversations in the Operation Check file reveal that some gang leaders went so far as to pay extortion fees to their own gangs on their private businesses in order to hide their involvement with them.Howard Cotto, the general director of the National Police, estimated in an interview that 50 to 70 gang leaders, including Mr. Henr\u00edquez, have accumulated some money or business interests. But only enough, he said, to permit their families to escape \u201cconditions of poverty, overcrowding, unhealthy conditions and sheet metal\u201d and have a chance at a future.\u201cI cannot say the leaders are living in places of luxury,\u201d he acknowledged.Most of the leaders, in fact, are expected to spend the rest of their lives in prison, either in solitary confinement or in malodorous cells shared with dozens of others.One day in 2014, an imprisoned leader of the 18th Street gang who goes by the alias Chiki was issuing instructions to a low-level gang member identified as Shaggy.Speaking by phone from the Izalco penitentiary, Chiki, who was serving time for extortion, ordered Shaggy to make a pickup of an extortion payment. It was $100 from an operation in Colonia Rubio in the department of La Uni\u00f3n. And, though Shaggy risked up to 20 years in prison if caught, there was something special in it for him, Chiki said.\u201cKeep two bucks so you can get yourself something to eat,\u201d Chiki said, in what turned out to be a wiretapped conversation. He added: \u201cAnd tell El Demente,\u201d the Demented One, \u201cto give you some custards for your kid.\u201dChiki, whose real name is Jos\u00e9 Luis Guzm\u00e1n, was the third in command of the 18th Street gang\u2019s Southerners faction in eastern El Salvador. Another prison wiretap recording showed an even higher-level 18th Street leader, Carlos Ernesto Mojica, getting involved in negotiations with a chicken vendor who sought to lower her monthly extortion payment to $200 from $400.That these leaders were overseeing such small-bore operations typifies the pettiness of gang business. While officials publicly portray the gangs as international criminal syndicates and narco-gangs, law enforcement records and data tell a different story \u2014 as do some authorities when speaking privately or in one-on-one interviews.In the four years before Operation Check, the biggest sum collected in a police anti-extortion raid was $6,377; some raids netted only $5.\u201cI have never had a case involving the quantity of money necessary to maintain organized crime,\u201d said Nora Montoya, a judge who has handled gang extortion cases for decades.Similarly, Mr. Cotto, the police director, said the term \u201cnarco-gang\u201d was \u201csensationalism\u201d and could be misinterpreted as suggesting that Salvadoran street gangs were working directly with the Gulf Cartel or the Zetas in the transshipment of drugs from South America to the United States.\u201cThis is not the case. It is definitely not the case,\u201d he said.Although Salvadoran gangs sell drugs, they do it like street-corner dealers, not international operatives. From 2011 to 2015, the National Police seized 13.9 kilograms of cocaine from gangs; that was less than 1 percent of the total seized. Three-quarters of the gang members prosecuted on drug charges over the last few years were charged with possessing less than an ounce.A veteran cocaine dealer in San Salvador said serious drug-trafficking organizations wanted nothing to do with the street gangs, which are considered unreliable and volatile.\u201cThe wholesalers I work with would not sell to the gang guys,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust them.\u201dOver a decade ago, the police confiscated an account ledger from Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendoza Figueroa, a founder of MS-13, that contained no evidence of any drug business. Instead it showed weekly receipts that averaged $14 from the 19 \u201ccliques\u201d \u2014 the smallest gang units \u2014 he controlled, and trivial outlays for bullets ($8), taxis ($25), Christmas dinners, liquor and \u201c$50 for the homeboys in prison.\u201dA couple of years ago, federal agents seized a similar ledger from the treasurer of the Park View Locos clique of the MS-13 in Usulut\u00e1n in southeast El Salvador. A log of one day\u2019s expenses showed $30 for a cellphone chip, $10 for \u201cmujer chief\u201d (the chief\u2019s wife or woman), $35 for \u201canother woman\u201d and $10 for food, with $29 listed as the balance.The notebook also contained the gang member\u2019s grandiose musings: \u201cThe day I die I want to be remembered as a strong street-level soldier, a committed delinquent, and at the hour that the shots ring out, I want to be marked \u2018present.\u2019\u201dAccording to an internal code, only leaders can speak on behalf of the 18th Street gang. But in the rural department of La Paz, one of the most violent in El Salvador, a 15-year-old gang member clambered to his feet from an old mattress on the dirt floor of a mud-walled house to defy that rule. He had agreed to grant an interview on two conditions: that his identity be protected, and that breakfast be provided.The boy, gangly and pimply, is a fledgling member of the 18th Street Revolutionaries, a faction of the 18th Street gang, and he works as an extremely small-time roadside extortionist. He collects $15 monthly from each of three food trucks that rumble through his district carrying chewing gum, Pepsi sodas and Bimbo bread. He then turns over the proceeds to the leader of his clique.\u201cAll the loot goes to weapons,\u201d the youth said; he himself was awarded a 9-millimeter pistol and many nights takes it out on \u201cpatrol.\u201dLike so many young recruits, the teenager is an obedient soldier who risks his life to protect his territory without earning a penny from his organization. It is a bargain for the gang leaders who manage the gang economy: tens of thousands of grunts who are not seeking personal profit, only respect and a sense of belonging.One of 14 children, the boy never went to school and does not know how to read or write. He probably could have found work in the nearby sugar-cane fields, where, even if conditions were miserable, he would have earned $100 a month. But, feeling bullied and vulnerable at 13, he believed that gang membership would give him something less tangible but more valuable at that age.\u201cI was a kid: I was stupid,\u201d he said about joining. \u201cA bunch of crazy guys were messing with me because I was a kid, smacking me in the head, knocking me around. It made me think: I have had enough. Since I joined up, nobody screws with me.\u201dThe department of La Paz, with all its sugar-cane production, is fairly lucrative for the gangs. The Federation of Associations of Sugar Cane Producers said in June that its members had paid $1.5 million in extortion fees over a recent five-month period.But none of that trickles down to the rank and file. So in order to survive, the boy runs his own little racket on the side: \u201cprivate extortion,\u201d gang members call it. His particular clique forbids members to extort their neighbors. Instead, he collects and pockets \u201crent\u201d from a few poor businesses on the periphery of his clique\u2019s zone.He said he netted $40 a month \u2014 \u201conly enough for what I\u2019m going to eat.\u201d Despite his age, he is mostly left to fend for himself by a hapless mother with too many mouths to feed.While the teenage gang member talked, three of his little siblings circled the breakfast \u2014 scrambled eggs, beans and plantains \u2014 that waited in cartons on the floor. He gave his younger brother permission to open a carton. The little boy, who had matted hair and a dirty face, let out a squeal of delight, and proceeded to attack the meal with his hands.In two years of gang life, the teenager has already witnessed and participated in significant bloodshed. He said he had been involved in two \u201ccollective homicides.\u201d In both cases, members of a rival gang had dared to breach the invisible border that separates MS-13 from 18th Street territory. One man was looking to buy some marijuana; the other to meet girls at a village festival. They were killed for their defiance.In the spring, the 26-year-old leader of the teenager\u2019s clique \u2014 whom he knew as Shadow \u2014 died in what the police described as a clash between the authorities and gang members. The boy was not present, but he had witnessed the deaths of three other clique members in February in another encounter described as a clash, he said.The boy said none of his homeboys had been carrying weapons that winter day. Hiding in a trash pile, he watched as the police killed his friends, teenagers like him, and then, he said, placed guns around their bodies to make it look as if they had fallen in crossfire.Two neighbors who are not gang members supported his version of events in interviews, and it is not far-fetched: El Salvador\u2019s attorney general for human rights has 31 open cases against the police for alleged summary executions of 100 gang members over the last year and a half.The day of that interview and in follow-up conversations throughout the summer, the boy made it clear he was scared of the police. Since February, officers had been stopping by his house from time to time, and he had spent much of his time hiding from them in the mountains.\u201cI need to save money to get out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they catch me, they\u2019re not going to let me live.\u201dThey did catch him, in October, and arrested him for extorting $40 \u2014 his private extortion \u2014 from a local merchant. He was jailed, and faces up to 15 years in prison.As violence peaked in 2015, reaching levels unseen since the aftermath of El Salvador\u2019s long and brutal civil war, entire communities abandoned their homes because of gang threats. It became such a recurring phenomenon that television channels interrupted their programming to broadcast live the precise moment in which dozens of families fled, on foot or in pickup trucks tightly packed with suitcases, mattresses, chickens and pigs.Having failed to guarantee them daily security, the police nonetheless supervised their moves. Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez, the chief of the anti-gang unit, showed up at one mass exodus, from a condominium building in suburban San Salvador. After imploring residents in vain to stay put, he led them in an alternate response.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who here is Catholic or evangelical, let us raise a prayer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the most important, let us turn to God.\u201dOver the years, the Salvadoran authorities have tried to quash the gangs with military might, to prosecute them into oblivion, to banish them with lengthy prison terms and, briefly, to negotiate with them. (The dialogue was corrupted by, among other things, the secret efforts of the two major political parties to court the gang leaders\u2019 electoral support at the same time.)When the government ratcheted up its \u201ciron fist\u201d approach last year, three gangs, working in coordination, responded with a show of force. On a Sunday night, they distributed written and oral messages to bus owners and employees: \u201cHe who takes out a vehicle tomorrow is going to end up glued to his steering wheel.\u201d To underscore their seriousness, they killed a driver and burned three microbuses as a warning.The next day, six drivers who had disobeyed their order were killed. The authorities sent soldiers and tanks into the streets, and deployed government vehicles to substitute for the buses, but the gangs succeeded in almost completely paralyzing San Salvador\u2019s transportation system for four days. Some 1.3 million Salvadorans were affected; many high schools and universities suspended classes and the economy suffered an $80 million loss, according to the Chamber of Commerce. It was a ruthless show of force.This year, with Operation Check, the government conducted one of its most professional law enforcement efforts to date, and comments by senior officials suggested a new willingness to approach the gangs as a complex phenomenon with deep roots in the profound inequalities of a country where a third of the population lives in poverty.Yet by hyping its findings, the government continued to misrepresent the gangs as sophisticated criminal organizations, ruthlessly driven by a thirst for financial gain. And though in Operation Check it acknowledged a distinction between the culpability of leaders and rank-and-file members, that distinction was lost on the street.The authorities have continued to treat all gangsters as mortal enemies and have doubled down on their use of force. Some 424 gang members had died in confrontations with the police this year as of September.\u201cIf the use of force is not the correct path in this moment, at this stage, at this juncture, then what is?\u2019\u2019 \u00d3scar Ortiz, the country\u2019s vice president, asked in late October.The government cites as evidence a recent drop in murders: 4,431 by mid-October, compared with 5,363 by that point in 2015. But that is still the second highest toll since 1995.In Operation Check, the government sought to sow dissent in gang ranks by portraying the leaders of MS-13 as self-interested profiteers. Afterward, a written message sent out from a Mara Salvatrucha-dominated prison demanded that \u201cjustice\u201d be meted out to those revealed by Operation Check to have betrayed the gang, according to an American official in El Salvador who monitors the gangs.As of yet, though, there do not seem to have been any revenge killings, internal purges or mass defections.For a gang member tired of the gang life, at any rate, there is nowhere to go. Those who are not incarcerated are marked, quite literally with tattoos, for life. There are no rehabilitation centers where they can seek refuge, no programs to reintegrate them into society and no gang-prevention initiatives aimed at high-risk youths.The only alternatives appear to be those that gang members themselves spray-paint on walls throughout the country: \u201cJail or the Cemetery.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Similarities, Candidate for New Jersey Governor Says He\u2019s No Corzine", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byEDISON, N.J. \u2014 A year before the election to succeed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the race for the Democratic nomination has become more of a coronation than a contest, with one name emerging as the likely candidate: Philip D. Murphy.Mr. Murphy is not the boyish mayor of Jersey City with the potent urban base and compelling Marine biography. That would be Steven M. Fulop. Nor is he the wily South Jersey legislator and moderate union official with the backing of the state\u2019s most feared power broker. That would be Stephen M. Sweeney.On the surface, the parallels are inescapable. Both rocketed to the top of Wall Street, enabling them to spend millions of dollars of their own fortunes to run as novices for statewide office. And both played checkbook politics, showering thousands of dollars upon crucial Democratic organizations and candidates.But they are hardly carbon copies. While Mr. Corzine ran for United States Senate as part of a quest for redemption after being ousted at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Murphy retired on his own accord 13 years ago, and has since been involved in local charities, public policy and national politics. And while Mr. Corzine was a socially awkward mumbler who agonized over decisions, Mr. Murphy, who considered pursuing a career in musical theater, oozes affability, remembers the tiniest details about people he has met and quickly owns up to his missteps.\u201cI was very disappointed with what happened with Jon,\u201d said Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee when Mr. Murphy helped to raise $300 million as finance chairman from 2006 to 2009. \u201cPhil\u2019s very different. He is relentless and pleasant at the same time, and he doesn\u2019t have a vengeful bone in his body.\u201dThough New Jersey voters are still focused on Tuesday\u2019s election, Mr. Murphy declared his bid in May \u2014 more than a year before the primary. But the timing was no accident; for the previous three years, Mr. Murphy had immersed himself in state issues at countless barbecues, diners and meetings.After hiring some of the state\u2019s top Democratic consultants, he inundated residents with mailers, pop-up ads and automated calls focused on issues like \u201ctackling the state\u2019s lead crisis.\u201d And as part of what he called a \u201chyper-retail campaign\u201d that has already spent $1.6 million, he convened more than a dozen town-hall-style events, and hired canvassers to knock on more than 225,000 doors.\u201cThe more at-bats I get, the better,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in an interview last week after speaking to more than 200 Democratic loyalists here. \u201cThe more rooms I can be in like tonight, where people have an up-close, personal sense of who I am, the better.\u201dPolitical analysts viewed Mr. Murphy as the underdog in the race. After all, powerful county leaders and public sector unions were expected to support either Mr. Fulop or Mr. Sweeney. State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak and Assemblyman John Wisniewski loomed as well.Some people do not think that is a good thing. Brigid C. Harrison, a political-science professor at Montclair State University, said that Mr. Murphy\u2019s money spooked the other candidates. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bode well for voters or political parties,\u201d she said, because \u201cNew Jerseyans are denied a choice.\u201dA native of Newton, Mass., Mr. Murphy grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic household that revered the Kennedys. His father, who did not graduate from high school, managed a liquor store; his mother worked as an office secretary.At Harvard, Mr. Murphy was an announcer at football games. He also served as the president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals club, part of a group that included the current and former Massachusetts governors Charlie Baker and Deval Patrick, the conservative political advocate Grover Norquist and the comedian and New Yorker contributor Andy Borowitz, among others.Peter Rose, a senior adviser at Blackstone who worked with Mr. Murphy in Hong Kong, said Mr. Murphy was known for being \u201cpathologically punctual.\u201d But he often invited junior analysts and other staff members on outings to build morale, and embraced contrarian views by saying, \u201cTell me if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\u201cHe was always a builder and a guy who got things done,\u201d Mr. Rose said.\u201cTo his credit, and I\u2019ve never voted for a Democrat in my life, he handled it very well, and he was professional in terms of managing things and dealing with people,\u201d Richard D. Quinn, a retired compensation and benefits executive, said. \u201cThere was no hint during the meetings of any politics.\u201d\u201cI believe that in crisis you come together,\u201d he said in an interview after the event in Edison.He is not shy about praising Republicans. At the event in Edison, he called former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey a mentor on national security issues. He described Mr. Baker, who was his classmate at Needham High School and at Harvard, \u201ca really good guy.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a classic Bill Weld, Tom Kean Republican,\u201d Mr. Murphy continued.Still, Peter G. Sheridan Jr., executive director of the state\u2019s Republican Party, is already caricaturing Mr. Murphy as \u201ca bad sequel to the story of Jon Corzine,\u201d adding that \u201cthe last thing we need is out-of-touch Wall Street values leading our state back into fiscal oblivion.\u201dMr. Murphy says the comparison is understandable, but invalid. It is, he said, like saying \u201cA-Rod and Jeter were both Yankees.\u201dPatrick McGeehan contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pretend Populism of Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byFor a politician who won the White House by railing against the elites and demonizing the establishment, Donald Trump presented an odd argument for why Americans should believe, as he does, that his adviser Steve Bannon is no racist, anti-Semitic ally of the alt-right.Well, that certainly settles it. If Bannon has been cleansed in the rose-scented bathwater of the Ivy League and then spritzed with the perfume of Wall Street, he can be no ideological outlier, no cultural ruffian, no threat. He knows to use the smaller, outside fork first and to put his linen napkin on his lap, not to cut eyeholes in it and wear it over his face.Trump styled himself as a populist during his flamboyantly provocative campaign, claiming to hear, understand and channel the working-class Americans so wrongly ignored by other leaders. Sure, he flew in a private jet at an economic altitude far above theirs and lived in ostentatious splendor. He was nonetheless the \u201cblue-collar billionaire,\u201d to quote the oxymoron that some of his surrogates took to using.Where\u2019s that blue collar now? I\u2019m seeing a spotless, perfectly pressed white one, along with a plush silk necktie and, metaphorically speaking, a pocket kerchief to boot.Trump is also considering high-level roles for the \u201coil mogul Harold Hamm ($15.3 billion), investor Wilbur Ross ($2.9 billion), private equity investor Mitt Romney ($250 million at last count), hedge fund magnate Steve Mnuchin (at least $46 million) and superlawyer Rudy Giuliani (estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars),\u201d according to the Politico article. \u201cAnd Trump\u2019s likely choice for deputy commerce secretary, Todd Ricketts, comes from the billionaire family that owns the Chicago Cubs.\u201dThat\u2019s hardly the oddest or most unsettling part of the Trump transition, which has been a mesmerizing confirmation of so much about him, including his tendency to turn every aspect of his life into a self-aggrandizing pageant. It\u2019s not enough for him to interview potential cabinet members: There must be photographs and footage of them coming to grovel for his favor, as if each is a courtier and he the king. Where\u2019s the populism there?And for all his thunderous talk before Election Day about \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d of Washington, the water level looks fine, the mosquitoes seem unworried and the gators remain plentiful and well-fed.Any suggestion that he would put an end to the self-dealing and personal enrichment of political insiders is contradicted by Trump himself, who hasn\u2019t provided any concrete assurances that he won\u2019t use the presidency to elevate his and his children\u2019s fortunes.He also volunteered that history provided no real guide for what he should do, because other presidents hadn\u2019t possessed his kind of wealth. The remark came across as less philosophical than self-congratulatory.This supposed populist has never been much for humility, and has spent at least as much time emulating the elites as defying and insulting them. He sent his children to fancy boarding schools. Three of them later attended the same Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania, that he graduated from.The signature ingredient in Melania Trump\u2019s short-lived skincare line was caviar, because, I suppose, nothing says hydration to the everyday American woman like ingestible fish eggs. Had her business taken off, a white-truffle facial masque and Dom Perignon toner would surely have followed: populist ablutions for the parched skin of the little people.I\u2019m not sure how Trump\u2019s populism figured into his determination as a young man to expand his family\u2019s real estate business from Brooklyn and Queens into Manhattan, where the ruling class romped. Or into the location of his gaudiest palace, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach.Or into the staffing decisions he\u2019s making now. As the Politico article said, \u201cPut together, Trump\u2019s cabinet and administration could be worth as much as $35 billion, a staggering agglomeration of wealth unprecedented in American history.\u201dTrump\u2019s campaign cast Goldman Sachs as an emblem of all that was sinister and rigged in an economy that shortchanged the working class. But now it\u2019s proof that Bannon\u2019s a respectable guy, and Mnuchin, another of its alums, is reportedly on Trump\u2019s shortlist for Treasury secretary.And though in some situations Trump plays the skunk at the garden party, in others he\u2019s the garden party itself. He can pantomime populism all he likes. The reality is still pomp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tower, a Site That Drew Tourists, Now Draws Heavy Security", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byNew York City has gained a native son in the presidency and lost one of its busiest crossroads in the bargain.Fifth Avenue and 56th Street in Manhattan, the intersection in front of Trump Tower, where President-elect Donald J. Trump lives, is now restricted by portable roadblocks, concrete barriers, metal barricades and a lot of police officers, some in formidable tactical gear.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the next few months and then Donald Trump is going to be living in the White House,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. \u201cIn the meantime, the N.Y.P.D., working with the Secret Service, have created a very strong security plan.\u201cYeah, there will be some disruption,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut look at the bright side: The holidays are coming anyway. Midtown is going to be all messed up anyway.\u201dThe mayor added: \u201cWhen they come to City Hall to protest \u2014 even though I don\u2019t like what they say all the time \u2014 we don\u2019t say: \u2018Nope, sorry, you\u2019ve got to be over by the river.\u2019 It\u2019s an American tradition. It\u2019s a good one.\u201dOn Thursday morning, vehicles flowed down Fifth Avenue (as much as they can ever be said to flow down Fifth Avenue). But the east sidewalk was closed between 56th and 57th Streets. That isolated the main entrance of Tiffany & Company, under the nine-foot Atlas clock.Tiffany\u2019s is open for business and keeping regular hours, a spokesman for the store said. Customers can use the 57th Street entrance. On Thursday, at least, they were also able to exit through the Fifth Avenue doors, though some looked disoriented to find almost no one else on the normally bustling sidewalk outside.The Atrium at Trump Tower \u2014 home of the Trump Bar, the Trump Grill, Trump Cafe, Trump\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor, the Trump Store and Trump Events \u2014 is also open to the public. But on Thursday, it took some determination even to get there. Obliging police officers let a few pedestrians past the 57th Street checkpoint.Though the sidewalk on the west side of Fifth Avenue was open, it felt like a cattle chute. An impromptu press pen squeezed passers-by. Construction hoardings worsened the choke point. Even on a beautiful day in late autumn, tempers seemed to be set at mid-August levels, as impatient New Yorkers tried to squeeze past selfie-snapping tourists.\u201cHe\u2019s going to make more jobs,\u201d one woman exclaimed to a man whose political path she had apparently crossed. \u201cThe economy\u2019s going to be flying. You should open up your mind.\u201dTall black screens \u2014 the better to obscure Mr. Trump\u2019s comings and goings from public view \u2014 flanked the residential entrance to Trump Tower on East 56th Street. The entire street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, was closed to pedestrians and vehicles.That has left Oxxford Clothes landlocked. But Tashae Lodi, a salesman, said the police had been cooperative in allowing Oxxford customers, typically well-dressed men in their 40s and 50s, to pass through the checkpoint.West 56th Street was blocked to traffic at Fifth Avenue. A mobile police command post blocked some of the windows at Harry Winston.Ripples from the Trump Tower security measure could be felt on East 55th Street, where concrete barriers now guard the south entrance to the former Sony Plaza arcade, presumably to prevent an explosive-laden vehicle from careering through the arcade toward Trump Tower.What would happen if President Trump decided to forsake the White House and remain ensconced in his much more ornate New York home?\u201cI think it would be untenable, given modern security realities and the need to govern,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how I feel. I just don\u2019t think it would be workable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Trolled Us All. We Should Learn From It.", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFor more than a year, Americans were glued to their smartphones as Donald J. Trump tweeted and retweeted misogynistic, racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic speech. It was not a strategy that any digital campaign expert would ever advise. Often, it felt more like a reality-show stunt than a real campaign.But it worked. And the result is very real. Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox social media campaign helped him beat more than a dozen other candidates, enjoy free media coverage that would have cost billions, become a major-party nominee and win the presidency.While we Democrats reject his message, we must learn from his tactics if our party is to evolve and protect our priorities from a Trump presidency and Republican Congress. Democratic campaigns must stop looking at social media as a one-way communication device for amplifying overproduced campaign messages. The true power of social media for politicians is unleashed only if they use it to make emotional connections.No amount of digital savvy will take you across the finish line if you don\u2019t have a message that resonates. This year, many voters were angry and felt left behind by a political system and an economy that favor the wealthy and well connected. Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign my company worked on, heard this anger, and offered a message of political revolution to overhaul a rigged system that found wide online support. Unfortunately, in the end, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign message didn\u2019t offer these voters what they were looking for.Mr. Trump did hear them, though \u2014 giving them something dark and divisive in response. Mr. Trump\u2019s unlikely rise to the top of the Republican ticket was fueled by voters who felt they weren\u2019t being heard by party elites. As I watched the Republican primary unfold, I saw a party that had created an opening by failing to listen and engage with its base. Mr. Trump filled that space.For those who struggle to find their authentic voice online, newer technology has made it easier than ever to get real. Imagine if Mrs. Clinton had ditched the script, the teleprompter and the overproduced videos and posted a cellphone video telling America that she was fired up on an issue. That she was mad and going to stand and fight. And that this fight was personal. If you use it right, social media can give people insight into not only how you think, but how you feel.Instead, the Clinton campaign too often chose gimmicks over real heartfelt messages. Contests to have dinner with celebrities, talking to us in emoji, and hashtag campaigns like #ImWithHer may have spoken to some of her supporters. But these campaigns failed to address the real pain and suffering in places like the industrial Midwest. These voters are on social media, too.There is no downtime for public figures on social media. Our president-elect is continuing to tweet and so should Democrats. Twitter keeps voters involved in the conversation, so politicians need to continue the conversation with them even when it\u2019s not election season. Don\u2019t build up a social media presence to tell voters your innermost thoughts and then stop talking to them the day after the election is over. That\u2019s a bad breakup.But engagement alone is not enough. Democrats need to use social media to disrupt the news cycle as well. Mr. Trump showed us that tweeting at 3 a.m. can change what everyone is talking about during the morning commute, for good or for bad.In future campaigns, Democrats will need to devote even more resources to social networks than they did in 2016. Misinformation spreads quickly on social media, and it\u2019s only going to get worse. More and more Americans are watching events unfold in their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat feeds rather than turning to news sites and candidate websites. Campaigns must correct the record with their own social media posts as well as have promoted posts and internet ads ready to go or suffer the tangled mess of thousands of falsehoods retweeted as uncontested facts.This is not the first election where we have seen hate speech emerge online. In 2007, I was the Obama campaign\u2019s external online director. I monitored more than a dozen social networks, setting rules for what was, or wasn\u2019t, appropriate for posts and comments. We were not going to allow anonymous internet bullies to dominate the conversation or spread lies about any of the candidates, even our opponents, on our social platforms. Our mission was to run these social networks like a modern version of the way a congressman\u2019s office communicates with constituents, using them to provide factual answers to every possible question about the campaign. The goal was to show voters we could have a conversation about the campaign without sexism, racism or other forms of bigotry.As the minority party in Congress and with a President Trump in the White House, Democrats will need to bring people together around issues with new ferocity. We need to make our case better, faster and more authentically than ever before. As evidenced by his loss in the popular vote, many Americans have had enough of Mr. Trump\u2019s antics. Our base is active and engaged, turning Mr. Trump\u2019s words against him with empowering hashtag campaigns, from #MuslimsReportStuff and #BadHombre to #NastyWoman.It\u2019s the job of Democratic leaders to now keep these voters engaged. Democrats can\u2019t wait until next election season to really talk to their constituents online. Do not cede ground to those who would build a campaign based on hate or entertainment value. So, Democrats, let\u2019s mourn our losses for another minute, then get online and tweet our hearts out, propose solutions and listen to what voters say.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Channel Masters of New York Harbor", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byNew York 101ABOARD THE PILOT BOAT NEW JERSEY \u2014 A speed of 7 knots at sea is equal to about 8 miles per hour on land, which doesn\u2019t sound very fast.Capt. Thomas J. Keating Jr. emerges from a door in the belly of the vessel, an ocean liner that is about the length of the Empire State Building if it were turned on its side.The wind is whipping on this Tuesday in August, but Captain Keating\u2019s purple tie is securely fastened under his vest as he climbs down onto the bow of a 53-foot aluminum boat riding beside the larger ship, like a minnow next to a whale.And still, for what they do, \u201cthe safest way to get on and off the ship is by a rope ladder,\u201d Captain Keating joked. (Pilots in other ports sometimes use helicopters.)Just as boarding a ship in open water by ladder seems like something from another era, having a person guide a ship in the GPS age might also feel anachronistic. But the Sandy Hook pilots are more than valets.Such a calamity would shut down a key link in the global supply chain and halt the movement of basic commodities like salt, food and fuel, he said. And it would take decades to rehabilitate marine life as well as beaches as far south as Norfolk, Va., which are critical to local economies.When people look at the harbor, they may think there is a \u201clot of deep water\u201d for these container ships to swim in, Mr. Kelly said. But its natural depth runs just 17 to 26 feet.But unlike roads, the harbor has no stop signs or painted lanes.In the summer, zigzagging sailboats, motorboats and kayaks must heed the path of the megaships. Some recreational boaters, Captain Keating said, would \u201crather catch that fish than keep their life.\u201dA harbor pilot\u2019s skill is in knowing where ferries are going to turn, where sandbars may have shifted and where tidal currents are strongest, as well as the names of emergency services workers and dock personnel if something goes awry.Radar, Captain Keating said, \u201cdoes give us some comfort, like on a foggy day where you literally can\u2019t see the bow of the ship.\u201dLast year, the Sandy Hook pilots made over 10,000 trips aboard tankers with oil, orange juice and other goods; long, flat bulk ships carrying salt or sand; yachts; cargo and cruise ships. The pilots\u2019 job was to guide these vessels between the harbor and the Ambrose Channel, which runs between Sandy Hook, N.J., and the Rockaway Peninsula. (Docking pilots take over to maneuver larger ships into their berths.)Ships longer than 100 feet that are flying a foreign flag or carrying foreign cargo must hire a harbor pilot. Smaller vessels that fly the American flag are not required to, though many do. Fees are set by New York and New Jersey based on a formula connected to a vessel\u2019s size.The Cunard Line, which operates the Queen Mary 2, declined to comment on how much it paid for a harbor pilot, but Mr. Kelly said it could run into the thousands of dollars for a similar sized vessel.Some call the Sandy Hook pilots the Lords of the Harbor for their natty suits and the exclusivity of their organization.Until a few decades ago, \u201cyou had to know somebody,\u201d to become a pilot, said Jack Olthuis, the association\u2019s executive director. But he said that had changed.Still, only a small number of applicants, most of them maritime college graduates, are selected for the association\u2019s five-year apprenticeship, which culminates in a four-day state exam that requires trainees to draw from memory every rock, reef, shoal, pipeline and cable in certain parts of the harbor.The association\u2019s 75 active pilots, including four women, pool their fees to cover the costs of the operation: fuel, dispatchers, repair and maintenance of the fleet\u2019s seven vessels as well as training for rising pilots.Captain Keating, who has been an association member since 1988, is a \u201cfull-branch pilot,\u201d which means that he is licensed to handle ships of all sizes. Though it takes an additional seven years beyond the apprenticeship to attain that status, the reward is a healthy six-figure salary.After climbing down from the Queen Mary 2 in the aluminum boat, Captain Keating was driven to the pilot station New Jersey, a 145-foot ship marked \u201cPilot No. 2\u201d in large yellow letters, which functions as a kind of floating hotel. (In winter, the 182-foot Pilot Boat New York takes its place.)Inside, men between jobs reclined on couches, watching television in a faux wood-paneled living room.In the galley, Captain Keating set down his briefcase and sat at a table across from Dan Foley. The two have worked together for almost two decades. One of the ship\u2019s dozen crew members took his order: cream of broccoli soup and chicken with sweet chili sauce and rice.Cruise ships are usually punctual, the captain said. Cargo ships, on the other hand, are often delayed because of weather, or logistical or planning errors, like loading a container in the wrong place.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make dentist appointments,\u201d he said of his schedule. And he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy on a marriage.\u201d\u201cLousy weather can happen anytime,\u201d he added.Captain Keating said he had been on a boat when 40-foot swells dumped water into the smokestack. \u201cIt was that crazy winter storm of 1992,\u201d he said. (He remembers getting seasick only once, in 1988.)On this particular August evening, the wind was \u201ca gentle summer southerly,\u201d said Captain Keating, which, he predicted, \u201cwill start to die with the sun.\u201dAs he tucked into his dinner, he stared out at a pink sky that stretched for miles. \u201cWe wish it was like this all the time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Obama Exits World Stage, Angela Merkel May Be the Liberal West\u2019s Last Defender", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 And then there was one.An increasingly divided Europe is looking to Germany, its richest power, to cope with its many problems, some of them longstanding: low growth, a continuing stream of refugees, and increasingly angry and nationalistic electorates.Italy and Spain are politically fragile, Austria might elect a hard-right president next month, and Ms. Merkel faces difficult negotiations with Britain over its so-called Brexit.For the last eight years, Ms. Merkel could count on the steadfast backing of President Obama and France\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But with the ascent of Mr. Trump and the deep unpopularity of President Fran\u03c2ois Hollande, she has lost that vital backing.\u201cShe\u2019s the last one standing, and that makes her both strong and weak at the same time,\u201d said Stefan Kornelius, one of her biographers and a political analyst for the daily newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cShe\u2019s a pillar of stability, the last wall, and people want to lean against it.\u201dAt the same time, he said, \u201cshe\u2019s the lightning rod for all those European populists who blame Germany for being powerful and hegemonic and setting the rules\u201d \u2014 including Alternative for Germany, the country\u2019s own rising populist party.But experience and patience count. Much like her initial response to the Brexit vote \u2014 urging calm and expressing the intent to work for a close relationship with Britain no matter what \u2014 Ms. Merkel\u2019s reaction to the election of Mr. Trump was deft.On a fateful date when Germans are usually preoccupied with remembering Kristallnacht \u2014 the Nazis\u2019 pogroms against Jews on Nov. 9, 1938 \u2014 and the joyous fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, Ms. Merkel offered Mr. Trump her close cooperation but named a price: respect for human dignity and for minorities from a man who has mocked both.Ms. Merkel had a brisk, assertive tone that was a measure of how far Germany has come since American generosity and protection enabled it to rise from Nazi defeat, first to prosper and eventually to overcome Cold War division.\u201cGermany and America are bound by common values: democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views,\u201d she said. Cooperation with the United States, she said, must be \u201cbased on these values.\u201d\u201cIt was stunning how she publicly laid out the rules for Trump, congratulating him but laying down conditions,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said.\u201cIt would have been nice had she proposed it to other European leaders and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this together,\u2019\u201d Ms. Balfour said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201dFor Ms. Merkel, the Trump victory was also a personal blow, because she has had a mutually admiring friendship with Hillary Clinton and because it will damage the legacy of Mr. Obama.This coming week, Mr. Obama will visit Germany after a stop in Greece on what is likely to be his last visit to Europe as president. It will be a bittersweet moment for two leaders who have come to rely on each other, even after Mr. Obama\u2019s strong criticism of Germany\u2019s unyielding stance on the euro, austerity and the Greek debt crisis.But Germany\u2019s strength also has fissures. Some 27 years after the Berlin Wall fell, Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy shirks any real fundamental changes. It remains dependent on American military and intelligence for its security, although it is ramping up intelligence spending. Its exporters benefit hugely from the euro single currency, but the government keeps postponing the politically costly task of strengthening the eurozone.In the past two years, Ms. Merkel has been firm in dealing with Russia, keeping Europe united on sanctions of the Kremlin for its seizure of Crimea and fighting in east Ukraine. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s admission of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim refugees last year weakened her at home and soured relations with Central and Eastern European countries that felt ignored.Mr. Trump\u2019s election may remove some of those difficulties. His pay-as-you-go approach to NATO, for instance, could prompt the Central and Eastern Europeans to turn toward the European Union, and Germany, as a more reliable source of protection.Eugeniusz Smolar of the Center for International Relations in Warsaw said that \u201cEuropeans need a shock,\u201d and that Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u201cis one which might be very helpful to concentrate their beautiful minds.\u201d After decades of lip service, Mr. Smolar said, Europeans may for instance finally pool arms production or indeed strengthen and expand the eurozone.But the vivid weakness of France and Mr. Hollande, and the rise of right-wing populism from Poland and Hungary to France and Germany itself, have put another burden on Ms. Merkel, Mr. Tilford said. \u201cIf Trump can win in the United States, then Le Pen can win in France,\u201d he said.If Ms. Merkel \u201cwants to prevent the worsening of the political situation in France,\u201d he said, that would mean loosening up on the eurozone \u2014 a banking union, pan-eurozone public investment, an end to austerity. \u201cAnd that would mean Merkel facing down\u201d the right in her own party, Alternative for Germany and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.\u201cTo help France and prevent Le Pen is to risk increased populism in Germany,\u201d Mr. Tilford said.It is equally possible that Europe\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s election might accentuate the Continent\u2019s divisions. Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank based in London, said it could \u201ccreate a kind of race to Washington, where everybody tries to do their own deals\u201d with the deal-making Mr. Trump.The British will be at the head of the queue, he said \u2014 something apparently confirmed by the president-elect\u2019s immediate invitation to Prime Minister Theresa May to visit Washington.Ms. Merkel\u2019s style of leadership \u2014 undramatic, which is how many voters here like it \u2014 may not cut much ice with Mr. Trump, the building magnate and reality TV star, who loves the glamour that Ms. Merkel shuns. During the campaign, he fiercely attacked her admission of migrants.And she may be able to use Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to her own electoral advantage.\u201cI was really impressed by her statement, especially her appeal below the surface\u201d to Mr. Trump to behave properly, said Daniel Mock, 23, an engineering student at Technical University of Berlin. \u201cIt could stand her in a better light.\u201dBy contrast, Vincent Szlang, 21, and Vincent Frebel, 23, both economics students, went against the generally critical German view of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe election was a repudiation of two different lifestyles: first the old liberalism and second the attempt to preserve order through pragmatism,\u201d Mr. Szlang said.Mr. Frebel saw the chance of better relations with Russia and said Mrs. Clinton would have been harsher on Germany than Mr. Trump.Such remarks underpin concerns among older generations that the lessons of Nazism and Communism are not necessarily learned, and that Germans old and young share Mr. Trump\u2019s admiration for the leader of near-neighbor Russia.Berlin\u2019s B.Z. tabloid reflected the shift since the fall of the wall. Back then, in an iconic headline, it proclaimed: \u201cBerlin is again Berlin!\u201dTwenty-seven years later, it pronounced the election of Mr. Trump \u201cthe night the West died.\u201dKatarina Johannsen contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sure, It\u2019s Castro and Cigars, but Cuba Is Coral and Crocodiles, Too", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byExhibition ReviewIn the American imagination, Cuba evokes a scant handful of trademark sights and sounds: sugar cane, rum, 1950s Fords and Chevys, the Buena Vista Social Club. Cigars, of course. And for the last half-century and more, Fidel Castro.But the island \u2014 or islands, more than 4,000 of them \u2014 is also a great natural theater. Extending nearly 800 miles, greater than the distance between New York and Atlanta, it embraces mangrove swamps, scrubland, savannas, forests and spectacular coral reefs, habitats for the world\u2019s smallest bird (the bee hummingbird), an alarming leaping crocodile and the ultra-elusive ivory-billed woodpecker.In \u201c\u00a1Cuba!,\u201d a boutique-size exhibition that opened on Nov. 21, the American Museum of Natural History tries to do honor to all of the above, from the cars and cigars to Santeria rites, rice and beans, the Cienfuegos Elephants baseball team and \u2014 live and in changing color \u2014 the chameleonlike Allison\u2019s anole lizard.If that sounds like a lot, it is. The show\u2019s curators, Ana Luz Porzecanski of the museum\u2019s Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, and Chris Raxworthy, the curator in charge of its department of herpetology, have worked with a team at the Cuban National Museum of Natural History to deliver Cuba whole \u2014 its history, culture, politics and natural environment in the museum\u2019s first fully bilingual exhibition. This is an overly ambitious assignment that delivers less by trying to do more and takes away from the museum\u2019s strong suit, its unparalleled expertise in presenting, and explaining, in a visually arresting way, the wonders of the natural world.\u201c\u00a1Cuba!\u201d starts off with a bang. Just inside the entrance, as improbable and nearly as imposing as a brontosaurus, squats a four-door, two-tone 1955 Chevy Bel Air, headlights and taillights shining, Cuban music wafting from the radio. It opens up pertinent topics: the American embargo, the rickety Cuban economy, the sense of a nation frozen in time. But first and foremost, it is a marvelous piece of sculpture, so dazzling that it would be churlish to point out that no one goes to a natural-history museum to see a car.The exhibition is laid out like a Cuban street, with colonnaded shops on one side. It\u2019s an invitation to saunter, with random sights arranged along the central walkway. There\u2019s a market stall heaped with fruit; a towering, Gumby-like carnival figure in a sparkly, sequined outfit; and a bicitaxi, Cuba\u2019s pedicab, ubiquitous after the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a shortage of fuel. The bicitaxi is a solid-looking piece of work \u2014 a 1955 Chevy in its own way \u2014 with streamers on the handlebars; a tiny, very painful-looking saddle; and an upholstered seat for two passengers. Any driver who can move it from a position of rest deserves a large tip.Off to the right, beneath a colonnade, a window opens into a cigar-rolling factory, with bundled leaves hanging from the rafters. By flipping aside a metal lid atop a silver canister, you can inhale the heady aroma of a fine Cuban cigar. Next door, a facsimile of a shop celebrates the Cuban national drink, guarapo, made with juice pressed from freshly cut sugar cane stalks.There\u2019s a little of this, a little of that. An old-fashioned Zenith radio, of the kind Ernest Hemingway listened to when he lived outside Havana in the 1940s and 1950s, sits on a stand, broadcasting different types of music as you twist the dial. In one room, the organizers have lovingly recreated shrines to two orishas, or spirits, central to the Afro-Cuban Santeria religion: Ogun, ruler of iron and war, and the ocean goddess Yemaya.Near a cafe table arrayed with domino tiles, another national religion, baseball, gets its own display. A series of flippable plastic display cards shows Cuba\u2019s baseball teams \u2014 the Tobacco Farmers of Pinar del R\u00edo, the Oranges of Villa Clara, the Crocodiles of Matanzas \u2014 with a few entertaining facts about each. The Cienfuegos Elephants once intimidated opposing fans with the slogan \u201cThe pace of the elephant is slow but crushing.\u201d Something might have been lost in translation.)The natural world, parked off to one side, offers unexpected thrills. The sheer variety of the Cuban landscape comes as a surprise, erasing the image of the hinterland as an endless vista of sugar cane and tobacco fields. Large dioramas dramatize three of the country\u2019s principal ecosystems: the forests of Alejandro de Humboldt National Park in the extreme southeast; the wetlands of the Zapata Peninsula on the southern coast of northwestern Cuba; and the coral reefs of the Gardens of the Queen, an archipelago off the south-central coast.This is what we have been waiting for. Although the Cuban giant owl, an awesome predator nearly four feet tall, no longer terrorizes rodents, having died out some 12,000 years ago, and sloths the size of St. Bernards no longer creep through the forest, the park harbors Demarest\u2019s hutia, a brown-furred rodent weighing up to 20 pounds, and the solenodon, an insectivore with a pointy snout and weak, beady eyes that secretes venom through a groove in its front teeth. All are represented and posed, taxidermically, with the flair that you expect from the museum.The coral reef, flickering with simulated sunlight, plunges the viewer into an undersea fantasia. An enormous black eagle ray, patterned in circles and dashes like a 1950s Formica dinette table, appears to be cruising the sea floor, as striped red lionfish and benign-looking hawksbill turtles wend their way through coral stalagmites. A flat-screen display off to the side brings the reef action to life in an endless film that bears endless watching.Horror lurks. In the Zapata wetlands, Cuban parakeets and spoonbills luxuriate in the tropical humidity, at peace with the world, as an explosion of violence takes place a few steps away. Frozen in midair, a Cuban crocodile, has just pushed off from the sand-bottomed shallows with its powerful tail, whipping the turbid water into a froth, ready to snatch a spoonbill in flight.In a display case nearby is a curiosity: the skull of a Cuban crocodile that died in 2005 after spending most of its life at the Bronx Zoo. After Castro visited the zoo in 1959, visitors began calling the crocodile Fidel. He was a feisty individual. For the annual weighing and measuring of the reptiles in 1967, it took five zookeepers nearly an hour to tape Fidel\u2019s jaws shut and bind him with 100 feet of rope.Across from the dioramas, several display cases contain anole lizards, experts at disguise and masters of the mannequin challenge. A demure Cuban tree frog, intensely green, clings to a branch. All blink mildly when observed, clinging with sensitive fingers to their chosen twigs.There\u2019s another reptile with a temper, the Cuban boa, tightly coiled in the shade of a small tree trunk. \u201cI\u2019ve handled these in the field and thought that they were rather sweet and gentle,\u201d said Mr. Raxworthy, the herpetologist, in a walk-through of the exhibition before it opened. \u201cBut this one is vicious. It\u2019s actually bitten people and drawn blood.\u201d (He was referring to staff members, not visitors.)Like the Hemingway radio and the \u201955 Chevy, the boa carries the banner of Cuba aloft. Do not, however, tap the glass. Better yet, do not make eye contact.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Wish We All Could Be Californian", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Francisco \u2014 THIS is going to sound very California, but here goes: I drowned my election sorrows by surfing. It didn\u2019t help, but I was struck by something afterward. All my life, I\u2019ve seen strangers on California beaches \u2014 bearded bodysurfers drinking local Bourbon, Republican volleyball players eating vegan energy bars \u2014 trade warm glances that say, \u201cI salute your lifestyle choices and respect your privacy.\u201d After the election, those furtive nods implied nausea, terror and a compassion born of confidence that others felt much the same. Within that compassion, I sensed the emergence of something new in California public life: an awareness that we Californians are bound together as one people by the shared values of our increasingly tolerant and pluralistic society.Everybody knows by now that California tacked left on Election Day: 61.5 percent of our voters choose Hillary Clinton for president; we made Kamala Harris the first Indian-American (and second African-American woman) to be elected a United States senator; we reaffirmed overwhelming Democratic majorities in state politics; and we voted to legalize marijuana, ease parole for nonviolent criminals, raise taxes on cigarettes, extend income-tax increases on the wealthiest few, boost school spending, restore bilingual education, encourage the reversal of the Supreme Court\u2019s noxious Citizens United ruling and ban single-use plastic bags.The national outcome made our progressivism feel so threatened and precious that a pre-election video of Gov. Jerry Brown saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to build a wall around California to defend ourselves from the rest of this country\u201d went viral. He was joking, but the mental image helped us all see in physical terms \u2014 Pacific on one side, Sierra Nevada on the other \u2014 what has become obvious in cultural terms. Namely, that California is now both a place and a body politic apart.Secession goes by different names \u2014 Calexit, Califrexit \u2014 and there is a group called Yes California that aims to put an exit referendum on the 2019 ballot for all the obvious reasons. California, for example, pays many billions of dollars more in taxes annually than it gets back in federal spending and has every year since 1987, despite our own crumbling infrastructure and underfunded public schools. Then there\u2019s our relative impotence in shaping the federal government, given an Electoral College that makes one vote for president in Wyoming worth more than three in California, and the fact that Wyoming gets one United States senator for every 291,000 people, roughly speaking, while California gets one for every 19.2 million. Each of California\u2019s 53 congressmen have to represent over a hundred thousand people more than Cynthia Lummis, a Republican who is Wyoming\u2019s lone representative.On Election Day, Shervin Pishevar, the multimillionaire Uber investor and Hyperloop One co-founder, promised to bankroll a campaign \u201cfor California to become its own nation\u201d if Mr. Trump won. He moderated that position a week later with a tweet that advocated \u201ca new Federalism where state and local governments are empowered to determine their destinies while bonded together in a United States of America.\u201d Still, nearly everyone I know would vote yes tomorrow if we could secede peacefully and get security guarantees while we annex Oregon and Washington, join the Canadian health care system and claim Brooklyn in the same way that West Germany once claimed West Berlin.Then there is the joint statement released on Nov. 9 by the State Senate leader, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, and Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon: \u201cToday, we woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land, because yesterday Americans expressed their views on a pluralistic and democratic society that are clearly inconsistent with the values of the people of California. We have never been more proud to be Californians. By a margin in the millions, Californians overwhelmingly rejected politics fueled by resentment, bigotry and misogyny.\u201d They went on to call California a refuge of justice and opportunity \u201cfor people of all walks, talks, ages and aspirations \u2014 regardless of how you look, where you live, what language you speak, or who you love,\u201d and promised that, as they put it, \u201cWe will not be dragged back into the past.\u201dThis last bit matters because California\u2019s past is not pretty. The genocide of indigenous Californians was remarkable among North American Indian wars for its sheer scale and evil. California resentment of Chinese laborers in the Gold Rush mines and on the railroads helped produce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first federal law to restrict immigration by people of a specific ethnicity. During World War II, Californians incarcerated thousands of law-abiding American citizens of Japanese descent while leaving those of German and Italian descent unmolested.After that war ended, African-American migrants to California were surprised to find racist real-estate redlining and a virulent West Coast version of Jim Crow. Tim Watkins, president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Los Angeles, told me that his father was sent out here alone from Mississippi at age 13 because a lynch mob was after him. \u201cWhen my father got off a train in L.A., the first thing he saw was a \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign on a restaurant,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. \u201cWhen he married my mother, a white woman, he could not marry her here, so their marriage certificate is in espa\u00f1ol because they went down to old Mexico.\u201dThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped, but not enough to stop the violent Watts uprising of 1965 or the Rodney King riots of 1992, both of which expressed collective fury over systemic racism. As recently as 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, revived a flagging re-election bid by backing Proposition 187, which barred the state from providing public services to undocumented immigrants. Proposition 187 passed, but was never really implemented. According to Senator de Le\u00f3n, Wilson\u2019s re-election did for California what Mr. Trump\u2019s election and promised deportations might yet do for America: It woke up the Latino vote and ushered in the deep-blue politics that have since helped to legalize same-sex marriage, make Obamacare work, turn virtually the entire state into one big sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants and enact far-reaching climate-change regulations.Anyone who doubts that progressivism is good business has to reckon with the fact that California is now the sixth largest economy in the world, ahead of France, Russia and India, with $2.46 trillion in gross domestic product.It\u2019s not all sunshine, of course. California\u2019s $54 billion agriculture industry thrives on the exploitation of migrant workers, and our poverty rates and income inequality are among the nation\u2019s worst, thanks partly to a technology economy that makes millionaires in coastal cities but does little for the hinterlands except raise the cost of living. That helps explain why 3.7 million Californians \u2014 33 percent of the vote \u2014 chose Donald Trump and why California\u2019s electoral map resembles the national one, with red counties in the rural white interior and blue mostly on the coast.Many Californians are also casting a gimlet eye at the two big industries whose leaders talk a liberal game but sell products that arguably undermine civil society: entertainment and technology. In Los Angeles, that conversation includes movies and TV shows that, in the words of the actor and author Robinne Lee, \u201coften extend the perception that it\u2019s a white man\u2019s world and everyone else is just a guest star.\u201d In Silicon Valley the obvious culprits are Twitter, which has become a hate-speech superhighway, and Facebook and Google, both of which capture eyeballs by tailoring news feeds and search results to make us feel good. In so doing, and especially by supporting the mass dissemination of fake news and outright lies, they radically reinforce the biases that drive Americans into dangerously oppositional camps of red and blue.But the overwhelming \u2014 and novel \u2014 sentiment coming out of Nov. 8 remains one of common identity, which is remarkable in a place that is 38.8 percent Hispanic, 38 percent non-Hispanic white, 14.7 percent Asian and 6.5 percent African-American, and where just about everybody knows both steady churchgoers and at least one loving and stable family with two moms or two dads. Paola Martinez-Montes, director of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment in San Diego, says that California\u2019s African-American and Latino communities no longer see themselves as oppositional and that she has also been in touch with the A.C.L.U. and Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to understand that we are going to walk in this together, and that\u2019s really positive,\u201d she told me.Senator de Le\u00f3n, by the time I caught up with him, was on an airplane bound for a climate-change conference in Morocco.\u201cI\u2019m going to be mobbed \u2014 everybody is going to be asking me what the hell happened,\u201d he said by telephone, just before the plane took off. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t want to go our direction, we\u2019re going it alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Apple Empowers, and Employs, the American Working Class", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported by9 PhotosApple\u2019s overall contribution to the American economy is significant. Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the United States, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads.Apple\u2019s rapid growth here in central Texas, where it now employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world\u2019s largest technology company and their economic impact.At Apple\u2019s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company\u2019s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them.Employees here help run Apple\u2019s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company\u2019s American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple\u2019s products.The Austin campus \u2014 the company\u2019s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. \u2014 offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy.Although contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.Apple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States.\u201cApple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\u201dLast week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple\u2019s public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised.Genny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a crazy technical background to do this job,\u201d Ms. Lopez said. \u201cA lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\u201dApple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages \u2014 12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone \u2014 and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer.Employees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M.B.A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple.The region\u2019s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple\u2019s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone.\u201cThere is a high road, and Apple followed that path,\u201d said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. \u201cIt sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.\u201dA mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple\u2019s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware.Flex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.Apple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand.Larger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to ship a phone, and it\u2019s harder to ship a computer,\u201d said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. \u201cAnd it\u2019s harder still for cars and refrigerators.\u201dOver time, the value of Apple\u2019s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. \u201cThere are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is probably more gender equity. And it\u2019s probably better for customers, too.\u201dAlan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer\u2019s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple\u2019s suppliers into the company\u2019s production systems. \u201cHere, there\u2019s a lot more openness and creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cIn manufacturing, it\u2019s a lot more widgets dropping off the line.\u201dMayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough \u2014 at least $20 an hour \u2014 to support the city\u2019s middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices.Some of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple\u2019s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. \u201cThe best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,\u201d Mr. Adler said.Asked about Apple\u2019s lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: \u201cThe product that Apple builds here is us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the education attained by Genny Lopez. She attended college for two years; she did not receive an associate\u2019s degree.Advertisement"}

But the damage won\u2019t be immediate: He can\u2019t just load two million people onto buses and planes and ship them out.

{"Headline": "Protests at Elite University Show How Egyptian Cash Crisis Tests All", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 The student leader spoke in English to the chanting crowd at the elite American University of Cairo. The leader, Amr El-Alfy, 20, told his peers that he was frustrated over the university administration\u2019s lack of clarity about whether tuition would rise as much as 40 percent in response to Egypt\u2019s flailing economy and floating currency.Mr. El-Alfy said that he was so frustrated that he thought about blocking the campus gate with his car, a Volkswagen Golf.\u201cThis should be an economic sanctuary,\u201d he declared.For days, hundreds of students have been marching through the palm-dotted campus, demanding a cap on their tuition. The demonstrations are the largest and longest-running at the institution in years, reflecting how Egypt\u2019s economic woes have touched nearly everybody in this stratified society of 91 million people.While the poor have scrambled to find food staples and to absorb price increases of even a penny, middle-class and wealthy Egyptians are car-pooling more and shopping less, putting their savings into stable assets like real estate, bank bonds and gold, and even waiting to have children.\u201cWhen the economic crisis hits the elite, it means the suffering is all over the place,\u201d said Malak Rostom, the vice president of the student union. \u201cIf we can\u2019t afford it, we can tell how much other people are suffering.\u201dSome Egyptians may sneer at the problems of the children of middle- and upper-class families, worried about tuition increases that dwarf the salaries of the country\u2019s vast legions of impoverished. But generations of graduates of the American University have helped lead Egypt\u2019s government, business and nonprofit sectors, so any problem on the campus can spiral outward with magnified effect.The American University\u2019s 6,559 students are the apex of an elite group of 111,600 students enrolled at private universities, where the curriculum is often taught in English and fees reach thousands of dollars each semester. The vast majority of the country\u2019s 1.8 million university students attend overcrowded, ramshackle public institutions, often looking at the elite campuses with envy and disdain.Though the American University\u2019s fees have long been out of reach for most Egyptians, two-thirds of its students receive scholarships based on financial need, according to the administration, and some families sell off assets to pay for the education. Salam Hefzi, who is 20 and studying marketing, said that her mother, a widow, sold two apartments that Salam was meant to inherit to cover her tuition.\u201cThe money is good for another two years, if the tuition stays the same,\u201d Ms. Hefzi said. \u201cMy tuition might reach a quarter of a million pounds. I\u2019m dead scared.\u201dThe effects of the foundering economy on the middle class may pale compared with the suffering of poor people now unable to afford basic foodstuffs, but that does not mean they are not felt.At a Cairo mall that was all but abandoned one recent afternoon, clothing prices at H&M were going up so fast that the tags were obsolete and a cashier was informing customers of the new prices instead. Outside another nearly empty mall, one shopper, Roaya Iskander, 22, said that she and her husband were putting off having children because of the unstable economy.Many workers said they had been car-pooling since gas prices rose to the equivalent of 21 cents a liter this month, up from 16 cents. Many others have lost jobs because their employers can no longer afford to import raw materials, or because sales have contracted.Amr Alaa, 28, and his pregnant wife, Ala Mashour, 27, worked at AbbVie, an American pharmaceutical research and development company. They said they were out for sushi one night last month when they saw emails on their smartphones announcing a meeting the next day to discuss their future. Instead, they said, they turned up at the office to find themselves and 20 colleagues locked out \u2014 fired.\u201cWe are just sitting at home depressed now,\u201d Mr. Alaa said. \u201cJust looking for jobs online.\u201dOther well-off Egyptians have tried to stave off losing their savings by purchasing apartments, bonds and gold bars: Sales of gold are up 30 to 40 percent this year, according to Ehab Wassef, who represents gold sellers in the Union of Chambers of Commerce. But many more, it seems, woke up the day after the currency was floated and found their savings had been halved.\u201cYou live at a certain level, and it\u2019s hard to go down,\u201d said Sana Saleh, 45, a widow who had cut back on food and dialed down her electricity use, trying to keep her daughter in a private school whose tuition is 1,700 Egyptian pounds ($113) a month.Timothy Kaldas, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that wealthy Egyptians spent a significant amount on education, and that most private schools based tuition on the value of the dollar, because they had many foreigners as faculty members.American University\u2019s tuition \u2014 which already went up 6 percent for this academic year \u2014 is particularly vulnerable to currency fluctuations. One half of the tuition is set in Egyptian pounds, the other half in United States dollars, but students generally pay the total in pounds, according to the official rate set at the central bank on the day they are paying.After the student protests began, the university administration agreed to keep this semester\u2019s fees based on the 8.8 pound per dollar rate, regardless of when they are paid. Now students are worried about next semester.\u201cThere will not be a quick fix or an instant solution,\u201d the university president, Francis J. Ricciardone, said in a statement. \u201cWe are looking at ways now to ensure that no student is forced to leave A.U.C. due to inability to pay tuition.\u201dIt\u2019s too late for Mohamed, a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student, who spoke on the condition that his family name not be used because he was ashamed of his situation.Mohamed said that he relied on a scholarship to cover 30 percent of his tuition, which he expected to jump to 230,000 Egyptian pounds a year from about 170,000. His father, the principal of an upscale private school, would not be able to afford it.\u201cNow I am looking for another university,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cMy dreams have been thrown away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Republicans Take Power", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byOpinionWashington \u2014 On the morning of Nov. 8, Republicans in the nation\u2019s capital were grim-faced and resigned to Hillary Clinton\u2019s impending triumph, hoping only that Donald J. Trump wouldn\u2019t lose so badly as to cost the party the Senate. By midnight they were in ecstasy, as it became apparent that Mr. Trump would take the presidency and Republicans would maintain majorities in both houses of Congress. A few months from now, it\u2019s all but certain that Mr. Trump will nominate, and the Senate will confirm, a new conservative Supreme Court justice. At that point, Republicans will control all three branches of government.The Republican Party has rarely won this trifecta of power. In fact, over the past seven decades, Republicans have controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress for a grand total of six years: two during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower and four under George W. Bush.Republicans now have an unusual opportunity to achieve their goals. But they aren\u2019t accustomed to exercising control of government, and the conservative ideology that pervades much of the party is based on the belief that government is the enemy. What will Republicans do with their newfound power? And how will the exercise of that power change the party?It doesn\u2019t require a huge stretch of the imagination to envision Mr. Trump\u2019s trying to use the power of the presidency to punish his enemies, withdraw from military and diplomatic alliances, start trade wars, and engage in a wide-scale roundup of illegal immigrants that would call to mind Operation Wetback in the 1950s crossed with the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. However, such a divisive policy inevitably would split the country and the Republican Party as well, leading to a crushing loss in the 2018 midterm elections.If Mr. Trump wants to be popular (and we know that he does), and if he wants a shot at winning re-election in 2020, he will follow a more prudent course.That doesn\u2019t mean that he is likely to govern as a moderate, particularly in the months following his inauguration. One thing that has united Republicans over the past eight years is opposition to President Obama. President Trump is likely to spend his first days in office undoing his predecessor\u2019s executive orders on climate change, gun control, financial regulation and anti-deportation protections for the children of undocumented immigrants. (Mr. Trump may not pursue those children, but he won\u2019t protect them.) The Iran nuclear deal and trade agreements are also top candidates for repudiation.While Republicans can\u2019t issue a Roman-style damnatio memoriae effacing Mr. Obama\u2019s name and image from the historical record, they will do all they can to erase his legacy. This won\u2019t do much to encourage bipartisanship and healing.But Republicans may be forced against their will to embrace Mr. Obama\u2019s overarching emphasis on national unity and even some of his policy emphases. Party strategists are well aware that the G.O.P. has now lost the popular vote in six of the last seven elections. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to maximize the white vote, and his more surprising ability to bring some minority voters along, it\u2019s still not in the party\u2019s long-term interest to write off the minorities, particularly Hispanics, who are a growing part of the country\u2019s population.And a party that\u2019s seen to move in the direction of white nationalism will also turn off college-educated white voters, who still form a critical part of the Republican coalition. The demands of the G.O.P.\u2019s constituents may force a revision on issues such as trade and climate change, particularly if the waters continue to rise in coastal red states like South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.Republicans will run into additional difficulties when they try to eliminate Mr. Obama\u2019s signature accomplishment, Obamacare. Republicans in Congress have voted more than 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they\u2019ve spent far less time thinking about how to replace it. Would the 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance lose it? Would a Republican version of the law retain its prohibitions against insurance companies\u2019 denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions?Throughout the Obama administration, the G.O.P. has had the mind-set of an opposition party, condemning policies without thinking deeply about how to reform them. When Republicans have total control of the government, they will bear the responsibility for its failures. Perhaps this will encourage a new Republican seriousness about policy and an honest attempt to educate their base about the trade-offs inherent in governing.Over the past several decades, the Republican Party has become a coalition of conservative ideologies rather than a coalition of interests. A shared opposition to Democrats has helped paper over the contradictions between libertarians, social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and neoconservatives. Now that the common enemy has been vanquished (at least temporarily), the rival conservatives will be tempted to go to war with one another. Rogue Republican factions in Congress like the House Freedom Caucus could even use the threat of a government shutdown or debt default against their own administration. The need to keep order in his ranks may encourage Mr. Trump to become a Richard Nixon-style leader, pursuing an agenda that gives enough to each faction that it remains sullen but not mutinous.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is wary of repeating the overreach that occurred the last time the Republicans controlled all three branches. The attempt to reshape the Middle East was the most obvious example, but so, too, was George W. Bush\u2019s push to partially privatize Social Security. Yet Mr. McConnell and others have been promising for years that if the party were given complete control of government, the conservative utopia would follow. The establishment may now be forced, at long last, to stand up to those on the right who are calling for Republicans to repeal the institutions of the New Deal and the Progressive era.Much of Mr. Trump\u2019s support, particularly in the swing states of the Midwest, came from white working-class voters who missed out on the economic recovery of the past several years and felt victimized by globalization and elites. Mr. Trump\u2019s populism presents a stark contradiction to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s positions on free trade, immigration and cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare. If the Republican Party wants to keep its new working-class constituency, it will have to make the economy work for them. The G.O.P. is unlikely to retain these voters if most of the benefits from its tax cuts and other economic policies are seen to go to the party\u2019s most affluent supporters.One split that\u2019s likely to develop will be over how long the party is expected to maintain its control over the government. Those who anticipate only a two- or four-year window will press for the rapid enactment of a maximalist conservative program, even at the risk of an intense backlash. Others, however, will focus on the long game. They\u2019ll try to build an enduring Republican coalition by doing everything possible to increase productivity and stimulate broad-based economic prosperity, and they\u2019ll enact legislation that can command at least some degree of bipartisan support.Such an agenda would begin with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious goal of leveraging as much as a trillion dollars to rebuild our deteriorating infrastructure. Mr. Trump will not be able to bring back the manufacturing jobs he promised, but he could put his supporters to work building roads and bridges instead.Republicans could also take a page from Mr. Ryan\u2019s playbook to encourage private sector investment in distressed communities and retrain unemployed workers in the skills needed for advanced manufacturing. Other policies aimed at improving life for working-class Americans could include efforts to combat the epidemic of opioid addiction and improve our mental health system.Mr. Trump said in his acceptance speech that he wanted to \u201cbind the wounds\u201d opened, in part, by his campaign; he could do so by following the counsel of the National Greatness Conservatives who flourished briefly in the late 1990s. Long before Mr. Trump conceived of his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan, these conservatives called for bringing the country together around grand projects. They were inspired by past national missions such as the settlement of the West, the construction of the national highway system and the March of Dimes fund-raising campaign, which led to the polio vaccine. They longed for comparable national undertakings that would bring out the best in both citizens and their government.Mr. Trump could invoke the tradition of national greatness by asking Americans to join him in pursuing a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which may present the single greatest threat to our physical and fiscal health in the 21st century. Or he could rally our national energies around the construction of the world\u2019s first driverless highway, or technology to restore full mobility to paralyzed veterans, or a pilgrimage to revive the economically depressed and spiritually despondent regions of Appalachia.Mr. Trump and the Republican Party should keep in mind that Ronald Reagan was able to achieve his greatest victories through cooperation and compromise with Democrats as well as a concerted campaign to convince the public of the virtues of supply-side economics and small government. The success of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration ultimately will be determined more by its ability to persuade than compel.Geoffrey Kabaservice, the research director for the Republican Main Street Partnership, is the author of \u201cRule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wealthy Ask Themselves: What Do We Have to Lose?", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionEven before Donald J. Trump defied the odds and was elected the 45th president of the United States, wealthy investors were feeling uneasy about the level of uncertainty in the global economy.While some people are optimistic that a Trump administration could mean tax breaks, less business regulation and other benefits to the wealthy \u2014 and even the stock market eventually rose on the news \u2014 the truth is, no one knows for sure what the next months or years will bring.Michael W. Sonnenfeldt, a New Yorker who made a fortune in real estate and banking, captured the level of uncertainty lately among the world\u2019s wealthiest investors:\u201cI can\u2019t compare this time to World War II,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, ISIS, and the difficult political situation in the U.S. with the most challenging, strangest presidential election we\u2019ve had in our lifetime \u2014 it all adds up to many generic concerns.\u201dHis list of woes has been common among wealthy investors in the United States. Tony Roth, the chief investment officer at the Wilmington Trust Corporation, has begun to include models for how much a client can lose in the firm\u2019s new investment pitches.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is put a new emphasis on risk, which is what we call \u2018drawdown exposure,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not volatility. It\u2019s, if we have an event, how much could you lose?\u201dHe said many clients had been cautious for several years, when markets performed well and they missed out. Now they want to take on more risk to increase their returns, yet they fear having another loss as in 2008.\u201cClients are saying, \u2018We have goals and we may need to take more risk \u2014 what does that mean to me?\u2019\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIf you tell me I could lose 25 percent to 50 percent of my portfolio, that means something to me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there,\u201d she added. \u201cBut there are also a lot of things going well \u2014 technology, biopharmaceuticals, people\u2019s quality of life. Even with all these good things happening, that\u2019s not where the conversation is going.\u201dOf course, it is easy to be pessimistic after a year of noisy election campaigns, Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote to leave the European Union, a slowdown in China, saber-rattling and suspected digital snooping by Russia, and the slowing of Brazil\u2019s economic engine by political problems and the Zika virus.\u201cThe hard part is getting past that emotion,\u201d said Judith B. Ward, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price. \u201cClients, when they call us, they just want reassurance to stay the course. One of the things we focus on a lot is to have that long-term perspective to weather some of the storms that we might see.\u201dToday, Mr. Sonnenfeldt is the chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club he founded 18 years ago that has 447 members with an average wealth of $100 million. In that role, he likes to poll his fellow millionaires and billionaires on what concerns them and what actions they take to address those worries.Right now, he said, members are taking money out of the public markets and investing more in private equity deals, which are far less liquid but offer higher returns for people who can afford to be patient. They have minimized their personal debt, gotten out of hedge funds and invested in hard assets, like real estate.\u201cIt\u2019s back to basics on the whole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s less overseas adventures and more back to basics with American businesses that sell real products and services. Real estate is our No. 1 overall allocation.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a general wariness about markets because there are different measures by which you can determine if the market is overpriced,\u201d he added. His group think \u201cthe equity markets are being propped up by people who have few options and who can\u2019t invest in private deals.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeldt\u2019s group is not alone in taking an approach that weighs the downside as much as, if not more than, the upside.Mr. Roth sees that a lot. But it has left him torn on using \u201cdrawdown exposure\u201d as a rating.On the one hand, it is a useful tool for clients, he said. But on the other he worries that he is playing into an echo chamber of woe.\u201cI want to make sure it\u2019s valuable and not just pandering to the fears of our clients,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure that the metrics that we\u2019re using back-test really well.\u201dAnd he is clear in saying that he is not discarding modern portfolio theory and all of the analytical tools the investment profession has to estimate potential rewardds. He is simply trying to add something that might make sense in the current age of anxiety.\u201cWe\u2019re running a parallel risk framework to add to the traditional risk framework,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a better understanding for clients.\u201dMs. Patterson said one of her aims was to put what is happening today into a context of the last several years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that suddenly occurred in 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sense that one is losing control has been an undercurrent for some time.\u201dIt is the long view, of course, that advisers advocate. Whatever may happen between now and Inauguration Day or even later in 2017 is a blip \u2014 however painful \u2014 on people\u2019s long-term investment plans.The risk is that so much negative news from so many places in the world has a self-sustaining effect. The doom, real or perceived, resonates more loudly than rational calls for making a plan and sticking to it.Individual investors \u201care \u00fcbercareful,\u201d said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, an asset management firm. \u201cThat\u2019s risky. You have to take some risk, or you don\u2019t meet your goals.\u201dThat much fear can be paralyzing. To break that, Mr. Perkin said, he suggested that people do something simple: dollar-cost averaging, which means buying a certain amount of an investment in pieces in case its value goes down.Of course, that investment\u2019s value can also go up and an investor would have been better off putting all the money in at once. But when fear is such a large force, this simple strategy is a way to \u201cremove the regret factor,\u201d he said.Taken a different way, Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm, applies a hyperrational view to the present: Even if it is bad now, it will not be bad forever.\u201cPeople have completely lost sight of what is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re 30 years old, you\u2019re not retiring for another 35 years or more. Time is on your side. People rarely understand the value of time.\u201d\u201cPeople are always scared that there is going to be a bear market, but they don\u2019t think of what causes one,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the central bank removing liquidity? Are earnings going into bearish territory? Is everyone bullish? We don\u2019t have any of those things.\u201dFor Mr. Sonnenfeldt, doing nothing is the worst response. People have to make investment decisions, as he has been doing with clean energy.\u201cThe biggest shift is that in a low-interest-rate environment, investing in passive assets is fraught with peril,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do a 60-40 split and produce much income. And there is no safety in safety, because people have bid up the prices in the so-called safe assets.\u201dThe solution from Tiger members? Invest in businesses that make things people will buy no matter what happens. It\u2019s simple \u2014 if you can get past your fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Love N.Y.\u2019 Signs Have a Lot to Say. The Government Says They\u2019re Illegal.", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe big blue signs \u2014 hundreds of them \u2014 crop up like crab grass along the highways and byways of New York State, enticing travelers to stop and take in the sights. The bright placards were dreamed up and placed there by the state to promote tourism, each brandishing New York\u2019s cheerful and familiar credo: \u201cI Love N.Y.\u201dBut there is one problem: The federal government says the signs are illegal.So the campaign, intended to generate love and money for New York, has instead set off an escalating feud with the government threatening fines and the potential withholding of federal financing if the state does not get rid of the signs. The signs, federal officials say, are out of compliance with signage rules because they are so big and crammed with words and information that they are dangerous distractions to drivers.The federal Department of Transportation, in fact, told the state that signs were not allowed even before the first one went up, more than five years ago. But, like a recalcitrant teenager, the state went ahead anyway, and now 514 have sprouted along the shoulders of roads across New York.The situation may soon come to a head \u2014 leaders of the state and federal transportation departments plan to meet in December to discuss a solution, or perhaps hash out potential penalties if nothing is done. The state does not seem inclined to bow to Washington\u2019s demand, believing it has done nothing wrong.\u201cThis issue has been discussed for years and involve issues like the interpretation of rules,\u201d Gary Holmes, a spokesman for the state Transportation Department, said in an email, such as what direction signs can face and whether they can include certain pieces of information, like email addresses. \u201cThis isn\u2019t high crime, but minor disagreements that we look forward to meeting with the feds in order to resolve. The \u2018I Love N.Y.\u2019 tourism program is highly successful and a big economic driver.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo himself has championed the signs, promoting them in his State of the State address in 2014, three years after federal officials first raised concerns. \u201cThe goal is to get people who are on the roads off the roads and into communities and fostering and promoting the economy of the State of New York,\u201d he said in his speech.Federal officials warn that the state\u2019s continued flouting of the rules could have dire consequences.\u201cWe have been clear with the New York State Department of Transportation that its tourism-related signs are out of compliance\u201d and need to be removed, Neil Gaffney, a spokesman for the federal transportation department, said in an email. \u201cIf it becomes clear that is not going to happen, we will make a determination about the penalty. It could be a range of things, from withholding federal approval for projects to withholding highway funding.\u201d\u201cWe hope it does not come to that,\u201d Mr. Gaffney added.Of all the things for the state and federal governments to come to loggerheads over, road signs seem a strange battleground. But the issue of distracted driving has emerged as a major problem on the country\u2019s roadways. Over 35,000 people died in car crashes in 2015, about 2,500 more than the year before, according to data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Data from the first half of 2016 shows that traffic-related fatalities are on pace to eclipse the total in 2015.The signs vary and some offer more details than others. Some advertise the \u201cI Love N.Y.\u201d app. They also feature the logos of various state tourism initiatives by Empire State Development, the state economic development agency, like Path Through History, which alerts people to historical sites, and Taste NY, which indicates purveyors of local foods.State officials have argued that the signs have been important to their efforts to increase tourism, especially to areas in upstate New York that are in economic distress. Last year, tourism generated $102 billion for the state, officials said.Beyond the federal government\u2019s objections, the signs have had a mixed reception. In North Hudson, N.Y., a buffalo farmer named Dorreen Ossenkop told a local news site that the large signs, some of which denote local attractions like her Adirondack Buffalo Company, have helped her business. Yet the sign that would mention her farm is not allowed on Interstate 87, according to federal officials, citing the bible for such rules, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.In Montauk, on the easternmost end of Long Island, where eight of the blue signs went up in July, many locals loathed the \u201cI Love New York\u201d signs.\u201cThey were really so out of character with the small communities and two-lane highways that they actually worked against the reason why people come to the East End to begin with,\u201d said Fred W. Thiele Jr., a New York assemblyman who represents the area and who fought to have the signs removed. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent literally a billion dollars protecting small villages and scenic vistas and all of that, and putting up eight giant billboards wasn\u2019t really promoting those very scenic features.\u201dSo not long after the signs were erected, cherry pickers showed up and took down seven of them. Mr. Thiele, a member of the Independence Party, hopes the remaining blue sign, at the intersection of West Lake Drive and Flamingo Avenue, is next.\u201cQuite frankly, we kind of felt that not only were they inappropriate,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was really kind of a boondoggle.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a town where the signs have had a mixed reception. It is North Hudson, not Hudson.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rare Moment of Unity on Capitol Hill, Thanks to Trump\u2019s Taxes", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byCommon Sense\u201cI think the opportunities for significant tax reform are much better than anything I\u2019ve seen in years and years,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon told me last week. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Wyden will become chairman if Democrats gain control of the Senate next week. Whatever the outcome, he will be a crucial participant in any bipartisan tax legislation.\u201cTrump\u2019s scheming on his taxes has put a spotlight on a tale of two systems,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThe first is compulsory. You work a shift in a factory, or you\u2019re a cop on a beat, the taxes come out of your paycheck. That\u2019s just how it works.\u201d\u201cFor the most fortunate,\u201d he added, \u201cyou hire a battery of experts, and you pay what you want when you want to, or even nothing at all. I think we can all agree the tax code is a dysfunctional mess.\u201dKevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax laws, told me much the same thing. While he didn\u2019t want to comment on Mr. Trump and his taxes, he said: \u201cAmericans are sick of this broken tax code. It\u2019s so complex. Most people view it as unfair. They\u2019re ready for someone to lead on tax reform and make it fairer and simpler.\u201dDemocrats haven\u2019t issued a similarly sweeping proposal, but in some surprising ways the Republican plan isn\u2019t all that different from earlier reform plans championed by Mr. Wyden and other centrist Democrats.House Republicans would reduce the number of tax brackets to three: 33 percent on the highest incomes, 25 percent for the middle range and 12 percent on more modest incomes. The top rate today is just over 39 percent.The plan wipes out most itemized deductions, including those for state and local taxes and interest expenses, while preserving some yet-to-be-determined form of deductions for charitable contributions and home mortgages. It taxes capital gains, interest and dividends at half the rate of ordinary income. It eliminates the reviled alternative minimum tax, which falls primarily on the upper middle class.In essence, the proposal would move the United States away from a traditional income tax and more toward a consumption tax, which is intended to encourage savings and investment.Such an approach inevitably favors the rich, since they own most financial assets and do most of the investing. The centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that three-quarters of the tax cuts would benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and that the highest 0.1 percent would get an average tax cut of $1.3 million.Moreover, House Republicans would abolish the estate tax, which falls almost exclusively on the wealthy.So how would that square with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call to require the rich to pay a greater share of the tax burden?For one thing, both Democrats and Republicans want to do something to fix the much criticized corporate tax code and would like to produce an immediate revenue windfall by luring back profits now held abroad by American corporations.The House Republicans\u2019 plan cuts the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. It taxes so-called pass-through income from small businesses, partnerships and limited liability companies at a flat 25 percent, as opposed to the current top ordinary income rate of 39.6 percent.It allows immediate deductions for most business expenses and investments, eliminating the need for complicated depreciation schedules, and does away with the interest deduction.What impact all this would have on the federal deficit is a matter of continuing debate, since it depends on how much these changes would spur additional economic growth.The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that, assuming no additional growth, the plan would cost $2.4 trillion over its first decade. But it also projects the plan would stimulate the economy, generating more tax revenue and cutting the cost to a relatively modest $191 billion over 10 years.The Tax Policy Center estimated a higher cost of $3.1 trillion over the first decade. Adjusting for expected growth reduces the cost only slightly, to $3 trillion, largely because of higher interest payments on the debt needed to cover the larger deficit.\u201cIn my view, the pre-eminent problem facing the United States is low economic growth, now pegged at about 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cTo grow more rapidly over the long term, people need to save and invest those savings. This approach supports saving and investment.\u201dLeonard E. Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Syracuse University Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, agreed that the plan \u201cis clearly designed to encourage investment,\u201d especially the provision allowing businesses to immediately deduct expenses.\u201cEven Hillary Clinton has proposed that for small businesses,\u201d Mr. Burman told me. \u201cThe primary drawback, as we\u2019ve modeled it, is that it would add trillions to the national debt over 10 years.\u201dStill, \u201cthis is genuine reform,\u201d he added, which is \u201cexactly the kind of thing we should be debating in a national election and something the public should be deciding.\u201dIf Mrs. Clinton is elected president, the Republican plan, as written, would be dead on arrival because it runs squarely into one of her main campaign themes: The rich aren\u2019t paying their fair share. But some tax experts say the Republican plan could be adjusted to include higher rates for the Americans who earn the most.\u201cIn theory it would make it easier to raise the top rates,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fear of some conservatives.\u201dRaising some of the rates could achieve many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s goals, including increasing taxes on the highest earners and creating an overall increase in revenue, while still embracing the underlying simplicity and pro-growth philosophy of the House Republicans\u2019 plan.A compromise plan might raise rates for taxpayers earning more than $5 million, as Mrs. Clinton has proposed; limit the exclusion on capital gains, interest and dividends; cut the corporate rate to 25 percent rather than 20 percent; and keep the estate tax for the wealthiest taxpayers.Mr. Wyden\u2019s last stab at bipartisan tax reform, the Wyden-Coats plan of 2011, which he and Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, sponsored, had many of those elements. Like the Republican House plan, it called for just three brackets and lower rates (a top rate of 35 percent, only modestly higher than the House Republicans\u2019 33 percent). It allowed taxpayers to exclude 35 percent of their capital gains, as opposed to the Republicans\u2019 50 percent. It lowered the corporate tax rate to 24 percent and eliminated the alternative minimum tax.Today\u2019s bitterly polarized political environment, of course, makes any compromise extremely difficult. Tea Party Republicans are unlikely to support any legislation that raises rates or revenue. The Democratic left is likely to balk at cuts to capital gains and corporate taxes and more breaks for business investment.But both Mr. Wyden and Mr. Brady told me they were open to deal-making, no matter how Tuesday\u2019s election turns out.\u201cPeople recognize that the tax code has been hijacked by powerful interests, and both sides see this is so wildly inefficient,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cIf I have the opportunity to chair the Senate Finance Committee, I\u2019d like to come out of the gate on Day 1 with something that would be well received as bipartisan. It would be malpractice not to do this.\u201dMr. Brady said the Republican proposals weren\u2019t etched in stone. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very aggressive listening and outreach mode, looking for feedback from families and job creators,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work with the next president to fix this broken tax code,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we know from the Reagan-era tax reform that if we\u2019re going to simplify the tax code and grow the economy, it will require bipartisan support regardless of who is in the White House.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about prospects for an overhaul of the tax code in the next administration, misstated the year that Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Dan Coats of Indiana sponsored a bipartisan tax reform proposal. It was 2011, not 2010.Because of an editing error, the Common Sense column on Friday, about prospects for a tax code overhaul in the next administration, misidentified the political office held by Dan Coats. He is a senator from Indiana, not a representative. The error was repeated in a correction on Saturday, which also referred to Ron Wyden of Oregon as a representative, rather than a senator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Protection Advocates Fear a Rollback of Emissions Standards", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOf all the climate policies the Trump administration has promised to undo, auto emissions standards could be the most consequential.Those targets are now likely to be scaled back or even scrapped.Aides to Mr. Trump, who campaigned on promises to revive the fossil fuel industry, roll back environmental regulations and \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate deal, signaled over the weekend that he would look for a quick exit from America\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.Automakers are seizing on the change in administration to argue for re-evaluating fuel economy and emissions rules, which are set to become progressively more stringent starting with 2017 model cars.In a letter dated Nov. 10 to the Trump transition team, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, urged a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d for the auto industry.Those rules are designed to deliver a new-car fleet averaging 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025, compared with about 36 miles per gallon now. The Obama administration already has a review of that target underway.\u201cAs car prices rise, it becomes vital to look at the full cost of regulatory initiatives,\u201d the industry group\u2019s chief executive, Mitch Bainwol, said in the letter.Climate protection advocates are nervous.And in the United States, automakers enjoy generous incentives for selling hybrid or electric vehicles. For each \u201cgreen\u201d car sold, automakers earn credits that then allow them to meet less-stringent fuel efficiency targets for their entire fleet. As currently practiced, those credits can have unintended consequences.The E.P.A. has said it thinks this trade-off is worthwhile, because green car sales could lay the foundation for a bigger switch to electric vehicles. But a relaxing of fuel emissions standards could derail that assumption.Jeremy Michalek, a professor in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon, said that putting a price on carbon in the form of a carbon tax would be a simpler and more effective way to pursue fuel efficiency in the nation\u2019s vehicles.But Mr. Michalek remains a proponent of carbon taxes. \u201cCarbon pricing is giving people freedom,\u201d he said, adding that might be a virtue Mr. Trump would appreciate.\u201cI could buy a fuel-efficient car, or a smaller car; I could still get the car I want, and drive it less,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I could continue to drive it as much as I want, but pay for the damage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Poroshenko in May 2015, said he was leaving because of the central government\u2019s unrelenting obstruction of his efforts to root out graft.In a terse statement, Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office said it would accept Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s resignation once it had been submitted by the cabinet.In Odessa, Mr. Saakashvili and a team of young reformists tried to tackle the acceptance of bribes in the corruption-plagued customs service and to make government services more responsive and transparent.Yet, government officials in Kiev thwarted those efforts, Mr. Saakashvili said, because they interfered with the various enrichment schemes that allowed many of them to amass fortunes.Mr. Saakashvili said his plan to open a new customs service center in Odessa was undone when the money allocated for its refurbishment was stolen.Mr. Saakashvili, a bitter opponent of Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, was one of several foreign politicians and specialists who were brought to Ukraine after the 2014 pro-Western revolution to start a broad modernization of the country.Taming corruption was widely seen as crucial for proving the legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leadership, especially in contrast with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia.In October, Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s political party in Georgia suffered a painful defeat in parliamentary elections, ending the prospect of his return to that country, where he faces multiple charges that he says are politically motivated.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the country whose president Mikheil Saakashvili accused of supporting corruption.

{"Headline": "Remembering My Mother\u2019s Alexandria", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byAlexandria JournalALEXANDRIA, Egypt \u2014 My mother spoke French with her Greek neighbors in Alexandria, at the time Egypt\u2019s most cosmopolitan city. She skipped Catholic school to ride in a red convertible with a German girlfriend down broad boulevards. She water-skied in a swimsuit, enjoying the freedom of this city in the 1960s, when it was still a beacon of Mediterranean culture.I returned this fall to a very different Alexandria, one as insular as my mother\u2019s was open, as full of despair as my mother\u2019s was full of hope and anticipation.A congested coastal highway divided the city from its sea, and the smog burned my eyes. Young men hissed and catcalled at women as they passed. Rubbish piled up on crumbling streets that were once proudly scrubbed. Neoclassical buildings, once grand, looked dilapidated, and thick nests of high-rises had replaced villas with French doors and Arab arches.But shabby Alexandria, like the rest of Egypt, has seen little benefit from the revolution. The country is reeling under its latest repressive president and a tanking economy. The currency has lost half its value, and Alexandria has never felt so grim.\u201cI miss the old Alexandria,\u201d Mahmoud Ghamrawi, 68 and a retiree, said as he sat at the coast and watched the sea with his 2-year-old granddaughter. \u201cPeople feel like strangers in the city.\u201dMy Alexandrian family is Muslim with Moroccan roots. My great-grandfather Abdul-Razak Mustafa was a senior customs official in a city built on port trading. My family says he had three chauffeur-driven vehicles when most people in the city had never set foot in a car. He studied in France and owned land in the old commercial district, a hunting lodge and a seaside villa.This photograph shows my extended Alexandrian family in 1984 on the rooftop of our seaside villa at Agami beach, a once-upscale area just outside the city. My aunt Lola is at top left. She has her hand on my shoulder as I look down. Next to Lola is my grandmother Fayza.Western literature romanticizes Alexandria\u2019s belle epoque, which began in the late 19th century, when a m\u00e9lange of Europeans, particularly Italians and Greeks, gave the city its cosmopolitan flair.Lawrence Durrell, a British novelist and poet who wrote the \u201cAlexandria Quartet\u201d novels, captured how World War II began to bring the era to a close. By then, the time of foreigners in Alexandria was ending. Egyptian nationalism was growing, and Jews were viewed with suspicion as loyal to the country\u2019s enemy, Israel. Europeans were seen as part of a foreign presence that had kept Egyptians down, and most Alexandrians with European roots and Alexandrian Jews left the city by the early \u201960s.Our fortunes faded with the city. My mother and all of her siblings, except for one sister, Lola, left for Cairo or abroad. I was born in Alexandria because my mother wanted to have a child in her hometown, years after she migrated to Australia. Weeks after I was born, we left. We returned for visits a couple of times during my childhood, and beginning in 1998, I visited nearly every year.After always feeling welcome in the city, I felt like an outsider this trip. At one point a bus driver sneered at me and my colleagues when he heard us speaking Arabic without the local accent. \u201cYou aren\u2019t from here,\u201d he said. \u201cGo back to Cairo.\u201dDuring this visit, I watched as couples strolled the pedestrian walkway by the seaside, known as the Corniche.Bassam Abdu, 38, a fisherman, sat with his 4-year-old son. The sewage, garbage and overfishing were slowly choking his livelihood, he said, pointing at bags bobbing in the water.Farther down the coast, a dead donkey had floated onto Stanley Beach, a small private city shore.Two generations earlier, my mother and her siblings had sunbathed and water-skied here.My relatives sold their last seaside villa in the 1990s; it was in the Agami, once the summer playground for the city\u2019s rich. It is now a sprawling quarter of Alexandria with unpaved narrow alleys that reek of sewage.The city\u2019s residents, including my aunt Lola and my extended family, are now overwhelmingly conservative Muslims.Lamenting the lost Alexandria is a favorite local pastime, and my aunt Lola, now 67, is as wistful as anyone. Her apartment is decked with gilded wallpaper and faded tapestries of picnicking European ladies, and when she steps outside she sighs that she no longer recognizes the city. (My aunt requested that only her nickname be used because she wants to protect her children\u2019s privacy.)Yet the city still has its pleasures, like sipping tea into the night in a high-ceilinged seaside cafe, or walking around the medieval citadel. On a recent evening, women in face veils clip-clopped past on horses, raising posies of balloons as they posed for photographs.The seafood in Alexandria remains a delight, a medley of the cultures that once converged here. In a nameless alley cafe, a woman grilled barley-coated fish over an iron drum-turned-barbecue. A wealthy couple snacked on gandofli, clams, in the Greek Yacht Club of Alexandria, where the moneyed jostle for a table overlooking the glistening harbor.There, old Alexandria still lingers. While having lunch, I noticed a table of French speakers in their 70s or 80s and asked where they were from.\u201cYou are so ignorant,\u201d a woman snapped. \u201cWe are from Alexandria.\u201dA sympathetic woman stood, identifying herself as Madam Zayat. She was of Greek and Syrian descent, she said, and a fourth-generation Alexandrian.\u201cI\u2019ve been a member of Sporting for 52 years,\u201d she said, referring to the sports club where old money \u2014 including my own family \u2014 meets for tea and sends grandchildren for horseback riding lessons. \u201cWe love Alexandria,\u201d she said. \u201cMore than anything in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Stock Rally: Calamity Averted With a Little Charm", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe stock market is easily rattled, but it can also be easily seduced.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s long-term relationship with Wall Street is just getting started, but he has already demonstrated that he can not only shake up but also mollify the market. It soared to a record on Thursday, as Mr. Trump was preparing to meet with President Obama in the White House.Consider that through Election Day, the stock market heavily favored Hillary Clinton for president and that as recently as Monday, the market rose sharply on news that the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had found nothing in the latest batch of Clinton emails to warrant prosecution. The market\u2019s pro-Clinton bias was glaring on Tuesday night, as evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s strong performance trickled in and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chances dimmed.Shocked by the prospect of a Trump presidency, traders sold off Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index futures contracts as fast as they could, and the market cratered. Within just four hours, by 12:08 a.m., those futures contracts plummeted almost 6 percent \u2014 a disorderly rout that seemed to predict a calamitous day on Wall Street.Then Mr. Trump proceeded to charm the market, which remained in his thrall through Friday.Prices rose as Mr. Trump read smoothly from a teleprompter, uttering familiar bromides. When he is president, economic growth will double, he proclaimed. America\u2019s interests will come first, but other countries will be treated fairly.Then came one of the central points of his still nascent economic program, one that came naturally to a businessman who grew up in the New York City construction industry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201c And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201dWords like these have been more than enough to buoy the American stock market. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose to record territory and climbed further on Friday. But the Trump rally started earlier, in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. By the time that trading day ended in New York, the futures market had risen nearly 7 percent, an extraordinary ride.There are plausible explanations for this performance. One is that strategists set the bar so low for Mr. Trump that the mere appearance of normality has been enough to keep the bears at bay. Until Mr. Trump\u2019s actions and intentions are clearer, many strategists have simply decided to wait and see.\u201cI\u2019ve found that making an immediate response to news invariably leads to a bad decision,\u201d said Laszlo Birinyi, an veteran independent market strategist, who was cautiously bullish on stocks before the election, and remains so. \u201cI haven\u2019t made any changes so far.\u201dThere are more emphatic reasons for the market\u2019s complaisance. Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for Northern Trust, said he viewed the election results mainly as \u201ca Republican sweep of the White House and Congress\u201d rather than a Trump victory.\u201cOur view is that we will have unified government for the first time in six years,\u201d he said, and with less gridlock in Washington, \u201cthat means that we will have some pro-growth policies being implemented.\u201d Less financial regulation and less health care regulation and perhaps an end to Obamacare are the \u201cplump targets out there,\u201d he said, adding that he expected to see tax cuts.In a similar vein, a survey of 114 global fund managers on Wednesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research found that most of these professional investors thought Mr. Trump would probably soon reach an agreement to repatriate some of the American corporate money stashed overseas and increase spending on those infrastructure projects. Most said they didn\u2019t expect to reduce risk in their portfolios by raising cash. The single most attractive option for the group was to invest in the S.&P. 500.Mr. McDonald said he expected that new programs and tax cuts would effectively be a fiscal stimulus that should increase the gross domestic product by about half a percentage point, making American stocks more appealing. Bonds, by contrast, are likely to be hurt by an increase in inflation, he said. Bond yields have already risen, and prices, which move in the opposite direction, have fallen.There is also some historical backing for a bullish view on the election\u2019s stock market impact. Since 1901, stocks have flourished when one party has controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, data from the Bespoke Investment Group indicates. When Republicans have ruled, the Dow has gained 8 percent a year, on average, compared with 6.2 percent for all political configurations. (When Democrats have held the White House and Congress, stocks have gained 7.9 percent a year.)Yet the Trump rally has already spawned concern that things have gone too far. \u201cThese gyrations and inconsistent behavior attest to a manic market on medication,\u201d said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, in a note to clients.Even if the market\u2019s infatuation with Mr. Trump lingers, to predict rosy days ahead, you have to make a number of assumptions, and some of them may be a stretch. Make your own list.Here are a few suggestions, just to get started: Mr. Trump will always be a calm and soothing presence and will not lead the country into major crises; he will smoothly conclude legislative deals with conservative congressional Republicans for whom policies like deficit spending are anathema; his avowed \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies will not severely damage emerging market nations or start debilitating trade wars or otherwise destabilize the global economy; he will appoint effective Federal Reserve Board members; and his plans to deregulate industry and dismantle the Obama legacy will benefit the economy and the markets.That and more could all happen, but these are early days. We will simply have to watch the Trump presidency unfold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China-U.S. Trade War, Trump Would Have Weapons", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byAs president of the United States, Mr. Trump can use trade \u2014 a cornerstone of his populist rise \u2014 as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world\u2019s two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win.Yet the unsettling reality for Beijing is that Mr. Trump has a variety of ways to get back at China for trade practices that he, his supporters or people in the affected industries view as unfair. China sells a large array of goods to the United States that he can aim at for higher tariffs.The opportunities for China to retaliate would be more limited. In the most basic terms, China buys less from the United States.But China could make some strategic strikes at targets like Boeing, American automakers and American farmers. Beijing exerts tight control over China\u2019s airlines, for example, and sometimes steers contracts to Airbus, Boeing\u2019s European rival, when officials feel that Washington is uncooperative.\u201cBoeing complains, \u2018We have been pretty good friends with China. Why are we always a target?\u2019\u201d said He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now the co-director of the China-U.S.-E.U. Study Center at the influential China Association of International Trade in Beijing.\u201cHillary Clinton has claimed Trump\u2019s trade policies will start a \u2018Trade War\u2019 but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one,\u201d he wrote on his blog last summer. \u201cTrump clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to China\u2019s \u2018Mercantilist Trade War\u2019! A war it has been waging against us for nearly 2 decades!\u201dChina over the last two days has emphasized that a healthy relationship would benefit both sides. On Thursday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said, \u201cIt is in the common interests of both countries to develop a long-term, stable and prosperous trading relationship, and any American politician would take a policy in the interest of his country and the American people.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s views veer widely from the free-trade positions of the Republican Party in recent years and signal a return to the more hawkish positions of the Reagan administration, which repeatedly went after Japan on trade issues. Since President Ronald Reagan, Republican and Democratic administrations have been reluctant to confront countries that may be subsidizing or dumping exports, either because the evidence is unclear or because of a risk of damaging diplomatic or strategic relations.\u201cThis is the kind of stuff you learn in law school, and in the early days of your law career,\u201d said Alan H. Price, a longtime lawyer for the American steel and aluminum industries at Wiley Rein.When used, the measures were sometimes deemed ineffective.The case resulted in the United States producing more tires, but imports from other countries rose even faster. And the Obama administration later became more cautious about challenging China with trade restrictions.Any trade actions by Mr. Trump would face limits.China is more vulnerable given the sheer amount of stuff it sells to America. For more than a decade, China has consistently exported about $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of goods that it imports. Exports to the United States represent about 4 percent of the Chinese economy; American exports to China are only about two-thirds of 1 percent of the United States economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t have many things in the toolbox for retaliation, because we export more than we import,\u201d said Mr. He, the former Chinese commerce ministry official.Still, China could inflict pain on sensitive areas that provide American jobs, like Boeing\u2019s jetliners.Boeing declined to comment except to say, \u201cWe congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to make sure we continue to grow the global economy and protect our people.\u201dGeneral Motors and Ford Motor consider China a big contributor to sales. They mostly manufacture in China to supply the domestic market. But much of the design and engineering work is still done in the United States. China could hurt the automakers by adopting domestic policies that help their big European rivals, notably Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz.Other American companies may be less opposed to trade limits than in the past. Some American companies have been struggling to sell in China. Beijing has steered contracts to Chinese telecommunications companies after Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about American intelligence gathering in China. And Chinese state-owned enterprises have shifted much of their investment banking business from Wall Street to homegrown rivals.American farmers have welcomed Chinese purchases, but it is unclear how badly they could be hurt by any trade action. Chicken meat, soybeans, corn and other foodstuffs are commodities traded in world markets, and farmers are often able to sell elsewhere.Chinese goods have long helped keep prices down for Americans. But Chinese exports play a shrinking role in holding down prices as labor costs rise in China and as rivals like Indonesia, Vietnam and India expand manufacturing.China\u2019s biggest potential weapon is to disrupt the supply chains of multinationals by halting exports of crucial materials or components. But that could damage China\u2019s reputation as a reliable supplier.\u201cI don\u2019t think we will go that far at the moment, because there is a lot of room to negotiate,\u201d Mr. He said. \u201cIf we are forced too much, nothing can be excluded.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But political instability has hurt the Thai economy and the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October plunged the country into a yearlong mourning period. \u201cTourism is a major economic contributor to the country,\u201d Ms. Liew said. \u201cWe do feel the pinch.\u201d\u201cManufacturing has also slowed down,\u201d Mr. Yongkiettakul added, noting that every aspect of the situation affected every other one. He is a third-generation jeweler; his family\u2019s business manufactures jewelry for wholesalers in America, Germany and France.The Saks contract has given the 34-year-olds a new focus for the brand, while Mr. Yongkiettakul characterizes the Bahrain fair as a \u201cstarting point\u201d \u2014 although the Gulf countries have been on the couple\u2019s radar for several years.\u201cWe have some Middle Eastern customers in Bangkok and think our style of jewelry is a good fit for the market there \u2014 it\u2019s very adventurous,\u201d Ms. Liew said. \u201cThe new generation is not looking for only gold or big pieces, as before. There is a shift to more design-oriented jewelry.\u201dThat sentiment was echoed by Mohamed Al Mahmood, chief executive of Al Mahmood Pearls and the seventh generation in his family business, observing its 25th year at Jewelry Arabia. Customers in Bahrain, he said, \u201cwant to be up to date. Every year they ask for new designers.\u201d That is why, in addition to showing about 150 of its pearl-based designs, the company is bringing six foreign brands, including Kavant & Sharart and the Lebanese house Draga, to the Bahrain event. \u201cThey are fashionable,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s what people want right now.\u201dJoanne Ooi, founder of the jewelry retailer Plukka and a longtime observer of Kavant & Sharart, describes its designs as \u201cvoluptuous with a Star Trek edge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bold and decisive with a three-dimensional visual language,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is an incredible rarity to see in jewelry. It\u2019s very fresh.\u201dThat edge is evident even in the company\u2019s name. Mr. Yongkiettakul has long been drawn to the avant-garde, so he combined the word avant with his first initial to create Kavant while Ms. Liew\u2019s name and her affinity for Art Deco and Oriental arts produced Sharart. Its creations include Geo-Art Oto earrings, which arrange emeralds, sapphires and diamonds in a yellow-gold form that references Cubism and abstract art; and the more romantic Talisman Constellation 8 ring, setting an architectural medley of diamonds atop a yellow gold band.As for prices, the Geo-Art line starts at $1,700, while the Constellation pieces are priced from $700. Such figures are partly what attracted Mr. Al Mahmood, who says that his customers are notably price sensitive. Kavant & Sharart, he said, has \u201cnice designs, quality diamonds and the price point.\u201dAt Jewelry Arabia, Kavant & Sharart will showcase about 150 pieces, including one-of-a-kind creations with exceptional stones, priced from about $5,000. They are similar to the earrings that won the brand its prize in Las Vegas: set with blue sapphires and diamonds in an ombr\u00e9 effect and able to be worn seven different ways. The construction impressed the fair\u2019s judges, including Adam Glassman, creative director of O, The Oprah Magazine, who called the piece \u201cclever.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated design,\u201d he said, \u201cyet they made it look effortless.\u201dThe earrings took about four months to make and highlight how the designers, who met at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, work together.Designing earrings that can be worn multiple ways was the idea of Mr. Yongkiettakul, who has an engineering background.\u201cAs an engineer, you solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the Couture piece, that was versatility \u2014 how to give the consumer different options, whether wearing it during the day or night.\u201dThe ombr\u00e9, or dark-to-light, effect was Ms. Liew\u2019s decision and provided its own challenge. \u201cSetting the sapphires and getting the different tones required hours of work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was difficult, but, I think, worth it.\u201dThe designers are in talks with a Shanghai-based retailer to create a special line inspired by Chinese styles, which should appeal to a market that Ms. Liew said is \u201csaturated with high jewelry.\u201d\u201cWe are always trying to explore new markets,\u201d Mr. Yongkiettakul said, \u201cand ones that appreciate designer jewelry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Election Is Close, and What Trump and Obama Have in Common", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald J. Trump is in striking distance of winning the election with two days to go, and there\u2019s really just one reason for that: He\u2019s leading white voters without a college degree by a huge margin.In recent national surveys, Mr. Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 59 percent to 30 percent among that group. It\u2019s larger than the 57-35 lead that Mitt Romney had with those voters in the final polls in 2012.On their own, Mr. Trump\u2019s gains among this group have been enough to cancel out four years of favorable demographic shifts for Democrats among Hispanic and well-educated white voters.He has even won supporters among some of the same white voters who backed Barack Obama in 2008. It suggests that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama might have a little more in common than you might think \u2014 at least from a political standpoint.If Mr. Trump wins the presidency, that will ultimately be why. It has been a consistent pattern all year. Whenever Mr. Trump fights his way into a tight race with Mrs. Clinton, it\u2019s because he manages to run up the score with blue-collar white voters.In the past week, analysis of the early vote has already made it clear that turnout will be more than high enough for a Democrat to win a presidential election. Latino turnout will be high. Black turnout may not reach 2012 levels, but it will not be so low that one could reasonably blame black turnout for a Clinton loss.But Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among the white working class gives him a real chance at victory, a possibility that many discounted as recently as the summer. He could win enough Electoral College votes without winning the popular vote, through narrow victories in Midwestern and Northeastern battlegrounds like Wisconsin and New Hampshire, where Democrats depend on support among white working-class voters. Mr. Trump\u2019s strength with that group could even be enough for him to win Florida, where Mrs. Clinton\u2019s abundant support among Hispanic voters would otherwise all but doom a Republican.But exit polls tend to undercount the number of less educated voters, and the national exit polls obscured Mr. Obama\u2019s strength among white voters in the North. They showed him faring worse among white voters than any Democrat since Walter Mondale, but that was exclusively because of his weakness in the South. In many Northern states \u2014 like Iowa and Ohio \u2014 Mr. Obama did better among white voters than past Democrats. There was a lot of room for Mrs. Clinton to fall. She\u2019s proving it.For many, it was very hard to imagine that Mrs. Clinton \u2014 a white Democrat who excelled among white working-class voters in the 2008 Democratic primary \u2014 could lose voters who supported Mr. Obama in the 2012 election, or who approve of his performance today. It\u2019s even stranger if one believes that racism is at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal: If Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters are animated by racism, then why did so many of them vote for Mr. Obama?Racism might well animate Mr. Trump\u2019s base. But his appeal among some white Obama supporters suggests that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama might have something in common.Mr. Trump has changed the story lines of the 2012 and 2008 elections \u2014 and tapped into many of the same issues and frames that helped Mr. Obama.In 2008, Mr. Obama depicted himself as an agent of hope and change: He ran against Washington, the establishment and special interests. In 2012, the Obama campaign attacked its Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, as a plutocrat who would outsource jobs and help the wealthy, not the middle class.Those are the kinds of reasons that white working-class Democrats in places like Scranton, Pa., and Youngstown, Ohio, remained with the Democrats.In this election, Mr. Trump flipped that frame. He ran against the establishment \u2014 and against a candidate who embodies it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney. He depicted Mrs. Clinton as someone who supports corporate \u2014 even global \u2014 interests over the middle class on issues like trade and immigration. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complement the notion that she\u2019s not trying to help ordinary Americans.Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has spent more time questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the presidency than emphasizing the traditional Democratic campaign message about the economy.Mr. Trump is expected to fall short of the presidency, in part because of his problems capitalizing on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deep weakness among white working-class voters. There are probably many young white men without a degree, for instance, who liked Mr. Obama and don\u2019t like either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton.Regardless of the outcome, these voters will loom over American politics. Huge parts of the Republican Party\u2019s establishment would undoubtedly prefer a candidate who\u2019s friendlier to their views on immigration and trade. If Mrs. Clinton wins with strength among the well educated and Hispanic voters, much of the Republican establishment will conclude that those groups are in their electoral interest as well.But the voters receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s views on these issues would have pulled Republicans awfully close to victory, even with a deeply flawed candidate. They\u2019re also among the voters likeliest to be skeptical of Mrs. Clinton in four years. It would be difficult for the party not to cater to them.Democrats would have the opposite challenge. Four years after demographic shifts were credited for Mr. Obama\u2019s victory, the party would undoubtedly realize the extent to which they remain dependent on the support of voters whom they might have assumed they no longer needed. At the same time, their winning coalition would be better educated and more diverse than ever before. Without a Republican like Mr. Trump as a foil, it could be hard to devise an agenda and a message that would hold Mrs. Clinton\u2019s coalition together.Advertisement"}

There, too, a pro-Russia candidate appeared certain of victory over his pro-Western opponent, a former World Bank official. That would put a Moscow-leaning socialist in the Moldovan presidency for the first time since 2009.The two elections provided further evidence that nationalism is on the rise in many parts of the globe and delivered another burst of good news for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has aimed to weaken ties among European Union nations and erode international sanctions on Moscow. Mr. Putin also warmly welcomed the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States.Growing nationalism, driven by a rejection of Western liberal attitudes and inflamed by the largest refugee crisis since World War II, has further frayed ties among many European Union member nations as populist demands for national sovereignty increasingly drown out pleas for Western unity.At the same time, stubborn levels of corruption and national economies that continue to lag far behind the West have driven a rising number of voters in the region to cast a more approving eye toward Mr. Putin.When asked which city he intended to visit first, Moscow or Washington, the presumed victor in Bulgaria, Rumen Radev, said he intended to have close relationships in both capitals and praised Mr. Trump for his warmer attitude toward Mr. Putin.\u201cDuring his election campaign, the new American president-elect openly said that he was ready to develop a more in-depth relation with Russia,\u201d Mr. Radev, 53, said. \u201cThis brings big hope for finding a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine and avoiding further confrontation and escalation.\u201dIn both Bulgaria and Moldova, the presidency is largely a ceremonial post, with power concentrated in the prime minister\u2019s hands, a common arrangement in Europe. But the presidents are generally elected by a vote of the whole nation, rather than just one constituency.In Bulgaria, Prime Minister Boiko Borisov\u2019s coalition government took power two years ago, ending a period of fierce political turmoil that peaked with a major financial crisis in 2014 involving the collapse of the country\u2019s fourth-largest bank.Like other populist leaders, Mr. Radev has adopted a tough anti-migrant stance, pledging to prevent Bulgaria, which shares a border with Turkey, from becoming \u201cEurope\u2019s migrant ghetto.\u201dHe also vowed to repair ties with Moscow and to push for the end of international sanctions against Russia that were imposed after the seizure of Crimea. Bulgaria remains very dependent on Russia for energy and trade and as a prime source of summer tourists.\u201cThe big question is whether Radev would translate all this political talk during the campaign into actions,\u201d said Daniel Smilov, a program director at the Center for Liberal Strategies, a research group in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital.Since 2009, Moldova has been pursuing a pro-European Union path. In 2014, it signed an association agreement with the union, and Russia retaliated by imposing import restrictions on a number of Moldovan goods.The campaign of the likely winner in Moldova\u2019s presidential election, Igor Dodon, featured photographs of him with Mr. Putin. Mr. Dodon, 41, has said he wants to call a referendum on whether to extricate Moldova from its European Union agreement, in favor of membership in the Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union.The election was held at a time of increased dissatisfaction in Moldova. A separate banking scandal there in 2014 involved the disappearance of $1 billion, roughly an eighth of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, from three of the country\u2019s banks. Many people blamed those in power, as well as the influence of oligarchs, for the rampant corruption.\u201cIt is a sort of protest vote,\u201d said Igor Munteanu, the executive director of the Institute for Development and Social Initiatives, a Moldovan research group. \u201cThis is not a victory for Putin per se, but it is a defeat for pro-democratic forces.\u201dBoryana Dzhambazova reported from Sofia; Kit Gillet from Bucharest, Romania; and Rick Lyman from Warsaw.Advertisement"}

The way to address violations of the clause would be through impeachment, not a lawsuit, according to Richard W. Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Alternately, Congress could pass a resolution directed at the president-elect before going that far.The meeting has raised questions about how far Mr. Trump would be willing to use the power of the presidency to advance his business interests.Reports of Mr. Trump mixing business with his official duties as president-elect have prompted ethics experts to say that his actions threatened to compromise the integrity of the office.Norman Eisen, who served as the \u201cethics czar\u201d in the White House under President Obama, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s discussions of wind farms was \u201can extraordinary transgression of the core idea of public service.\u201dAmid all the uncertainty, at least one question received a solid answer this week.Trump Foundation money has been used to settle lawsuits arising from Mr. Trump\u2019s business and personal activities before.\"We demanded written assurance that the Trump University settlement would not be paid for by any charitable entity,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general.Being made partner at a big law firm used to be seen as a brass ring of prestige, wealth and security.There is more supply than demand for legal services so some big law firms are demoting partners \u2014 taking away their share in annual profits.Some are setting retirement dates or reducing them to salaried status and cutting them out of the yearly profit distribution.According to James D. Cotterman, a principal at Altman Weil, a legal consulting firm, \u201cwith law firms having to add 5 percent to 15 percent in new business each year just to stay even\u201d all law firms are going to have to slim down \u201cin some form.\u201d\u201cI came in with pretty low expectations, but the vending machine is pretty cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Election Highlighted a Growing Rural-Urban Split", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byThe Great DivideDonald J. Trump fared very poorly in American cities in Tuesday\u2019s election. Hillary Clinton did just as badly among rural voters. The political divide between the two groups has been growing more stark in America for years, and 2016 showed an even sharper split than 2012.Mr. Trump\u2019s own Manhattan gave him just 10 percent, a new nadir for a G.O.P. presidential candidate in the borough. His soon-to-be home, Washington, gave him just 4 percent.Most of the change, though, occurred not around the big cities \u2014 where Democratic candidates have only so many votes left to pick up \u2014 but far outside them. Just 15 counties tilted by more than five percentage points in favor of Mrs. Clinton relative to how they voted in 2012. By contrast, 1,826 moved by at least that much away from the Democratic candidate.The counties that swung the most drastically toward Mr. Trump, by 15 points or more, were nearly all in the Midwest. That abrupt shift was probably driven by numerous factors that are hard to untangle: weak economic prospects; Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lack of attention to those places on the campaign trail; Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobic message to voters anxious about change.But the widening political divergence between cities and small-town America also reflects a growing alienation between the two groups, and a sense \u2014 perhaps accurate \u2014 that their fates are not connected.\u201cIn a sense, the high-end economy in these urban areas is disconnected from the success from the rest of the country,\u201d Mr. Renn said. And the very things that drive success in Silicon Valley\u2019s tech industry, or New York City\u2019s financial sector, are what worries rural America: globalization, foreign trade, immigration. \u201cGoldman Sachs and Google do not really need America to be a broad-based middle-class success in order for them to be personally successful.\u201dThose economic forces will probably grow only stronger, even as the effects of an election that pushed urban and rural America further apart recede.Advertisement"}

This is because your feelings often dictate your short-term decision making.Lerner\u2019s conclusions suggest key insights into how emotions affect our financial decisions. Her anecdotal accounts of the experiments reveal something else, too. It\u2019s perhaps not only the emotion itself that leads toward poor decision making, but our inability to recognize how those emotions affect us.Lerner\u2019s conclusions suggest key insights into how emotions affect our financial decisions. Her anecdotal accounts of the experiments reveal something else, too. It\u2019s perhaps not only the emotion itself that leads toward poor decision making, but our inability to recognize how those emotions affect us.\u201cWe\u2019ll ask participants afterward, \u2018Is it possible that your feelings from that movie influenced how much you paid for this coffee mug?\u2019\u201d Lerner says. \u201cThey say, \u2018No. Don\u2019t be silly. That would be irrational.\u2019 They absolutely, firmly deny \u2014 and are even offended \u2014 that we ask about any kind of carryover (of their emotions from the video). In general, people have very little awareness of how emotions affect their decisions.\u201dWhen it comes to long-term investing, where emotions are proven to have a very real impact on our financial health, that can be a disquieting thought. To address these conflicting forces of emotion \u2014 the way we think we feel versus what we actually feel below the surface \u2014 OppenheimerFunds embarked on an unprecedented study, the Optimist Index, to use biometrics not only to identify this disparity but to demonstrate how remaining optimistic (and being aware of it) is often a safer path to financial stability in the long run.So what\u2019s your level of optimism? And more importantly, does it match your level of emotion? The behavioral experience below analyzes your emotions based on the science of colors, shapes and sound. To answer the questions, adjust the image so that it matches most closely with how optimistic you feel. Don\u2019t think about it too much; there is no wrong way to answer. Your answers will produce an individualized output of animation and music, reflecting your level of optimism and how you might approach long-term investing.In your lifetime, how do you think your health will be impacted by the cost of care?In recent years, the topic of decision making has been one of great interest for those working in and crossing over among a variety of fields of academic study: economics, neuroscience, psychology, biology and now biometrics. Known as behavioral economics or neuroeconomics, scientists are gaining greater and more profound insights into how emotions function in determining our courses of action and, more specifically, what we do with our money. While individual conclusions may differ, most agree on a simple premise: There\u2019s no escaping our emotions \u2014 sooner or later they will affect how our brains and bodies make decisions.\u201cYou can\u2019t make a decision without first experiencing some kind of emotional impulse in your brain,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Kramer, who specializes in behavioral finance at the University of California San Diego, Rady School of Management, and at the University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management. \u201cWe need to step back from the idea that we can even make decisions in the absence of emotion. I think it\u2019s more important to try to understand the way in which emotions do influence decisions, and then try to put in safeguards to prevent our emotions from causing us to make a catastrophic mistake in our portfolios.\u201d\u201cI saw that I was down a couple hundred dollars and automatically started having bad feelings about my financial advisor \u2014 should I stop listening to him?\u201d Brafman says. He had to remind himself that this was a long-term investment, not a one-off bet. \u201cI had to say to myself, \u2018Rom, you have to understand that over the long haul it\u2019s probably a good investment. You shouldn\u2019t be judging this on a day-by-day basis.\u2019\u201dIndeed, humans have evolved to think and see patterns more in the short term than the long term. We feel losses much more profoundly than we feel gains. In fact, the emotional impacts of a loss are felt, on average, two and half times more profoundly than the same quantity of gains, says Brafman.That\u2019s why maintaining an optimistic outlook could be the difference between making a rash financial decision (that may be costly in the long run) and remaining confident in your original plan, which could likely deliver the gains you expected in the first place.\u201cInstead of recognizing an overall pattern, and knowing that you need to stay the course on certain investments, people who are too emotionally reactive will instead constantly react to subtle changes in the market,\u201d says Lerner. \u201cThe reason is that the emotion system is doing exactly what it has evolved to do \u2014 interrupt us and call our attention to potential threats and opportunities. If you don\u2019t have the kind of expertise that says, \u2018OK, I'm alerted \u2014 a market fluctuation happened today, but we don't necessarily need to abandon our long-term investment,\u2019 then you can get into trouble.\u201dThroughout the course of long-term investments, conditions, outlooks and even our very emotions are bound to change. Fostering an optimistic outlook is one way to stay steady during trying times. As Dr. Kramer puts it, being aware of our emotions and avoiding the urge to make decisions during emotionally charged moments can contribute toward a more balanced approach to financial health.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a set of risk preferences that vary less over time,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be more consistent in the kind of decisions that you\u2019re making for your portfolio.\u201dThrough the Optimist Index research, OppenheimerFunds used biometric technology \u2014 sensor-based measurements of subtle physical activity such as facial expression, pulse and skin moisture that change with emotional state \u2014 to assess the disparity between how we say we feel and the physical cues our bodies exhibit when experiencing different emotions. The study looked at how investors of all demographics reacted to three key investment themes relevant to long-term investing, Aging, Emerging Markets and Innovation, and asked investors how they thought these themes will impact the long-term global economy.The study found that not only do risk appetites vary between demographics, but also there\u2019s a difference between how optimistic participants said they were versus how they measured using biometric technology.As people age, their risk appetites can shift, especially in a world that\u2019s changing so rapidly in population, technology and other factors.\u201cThe fact is that as people get older, they\u2019re approaching \u2014 and eventually passing \u2014 their retirement age. They worry about having enough money to be able to continue to pay the bills,\u201d says Dr. Kramer. \u201cThe stakes become even higher, as do the emotional reactions to blips in the market. The market crashes; my nest egg is now half the size it was. The reaction becomes that much more drastic.\u201dInterestingly, this bias was represented most profoundly in those approaching retirement, who measured having higher levels of optimism than self-reported, perhaps due to uncertainty regarding the political climate, according to the OppenheimerFunds study.Across a number of factors concerning aging, respondents were surprisingly more optimistic about retirement than expected given the projected higher costs associated with health care. When asked about the cost of health care and its impact on the global economy, those approaching retirement age at 55 measured far higher levels of optimism than reported, perhaps indicating that retiree fears are exaggerated. This was further corroborated by a subsequent spike in optimism at 65, an age when many have already entered retirement. Put another way, most pre-retirees have faith that their investments will serve them well into retirement despite current concerns about rising costs and an aging population.For instance, health care spending by those aged 60 and older is projected to grow by $1.4 trillion by 2030.\u00b9George Evans, CIO, Equities and portfolio manager of Oppenheimer International Growth Fund understands these concerns. He also sees opportunity. His investment strategy is to \u201cignore the short term noise, because when you invest for the long term you see it through.\u201dDespite representing lucrative and reliable investment opportunities, people often let their bias get in the way of making more rational decisions about diversifying their portfolios with foreign investments.\u201cOur gut instinct drives us to be very nervous about investing abroad,\u201d says Dr. Kramer. \u201cPeople tend to invest in what they know, and most people actually have way too much invested in their home country. We need to try to overcome that sense of comfort that\u2019s driven by our emotions, to seek exposure to the risks and the opportunities that are outside of our comfort zones. That includes emerging markets. Lacking that exposure in the portfolio can be very harmful in the long run.\u201dThis bias was most palpably seen in an older demographic of investors, compared to millennials who, despite having an optimistic outlook about emerging markets to begin with, were measured as having an even more positive outlook on emerging markets with biometrics, the OppenheimerFunds study found.When asked about the impact emerging markets will have on the world economy and their long-term investment potential, millennials were shown to be particularly optimistic. Perhaps due to cultivating a more global perspective as the first generation native to the Internet, millennials measured much more optimism than reported compared to non-millennials. Non-millennials, however, may still harbor feelings of skepticism toward globalized commerce despite being aware of its apparent economic benefits. This may suggest that deep-seeded anxieties over the unknown can be mitigated through facts \u2014 such as the growth of global markets \u2014 but never entirely leave us.For instance, over the last 50-plus years, global gross domestic product, or GDP, has exploded from $1.3 trillion to $70 trillion, with the United States making up a smaller share of the world\u2019s economic activity.\u00b2That\u2019s just one indication that it\u2019s time to take a global perspective, says Heidi Heikenfeld, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Innovators Fund. \u201cYou have to learn from the companies themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to be immersed in the culture ... to put it in the context of their local market.\u201dImprovements in technology can be a double-edged sword for long-term investors. On the one hand, they now have up-to-the-minute information on how markets and investments are performing. On the other hand, too much information can lead to panicked and premature decision making.\u201cNow, we\u2019ve got information coming from an uncountable number of sources. It\u2019s just beyond our brain\u2019s wiring to process this information. That\u2019s a real downside of technology,\u201d says Dr. Kramer. \u201cBut technology also offers some remedies. Now we\u2019ve got technology that allows us to delegate decision making at a low cost.\u201dFor those with greater assets, the additional savings afforded by technology innovations may do less to counterbalance the potential rewards, the OppenheimerFunds study found.That\u2019s just one indication that it\u2019s time to take a global perspective, says Heidi Heikenfeld, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Innovators Fund. \u201cYou have to learn from the companies themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to be immersed in the culture ... to put it in the context of their local market.\u201dTechnological innovation goes beyond the chips and software that drive the multi-trillion dollar Internet economy. It\u2019s also the force that powers ocean drilling, with rigs reaching depths of 10,000 feet today, a 10-fold increase over 1975.\u00b3That\u2019s the kind of progress that interests Michelle Borr\u00e9, portfolio manager of Oppenheimer Fundamental Alternatives Fund: \u201cThe things that we\u2019re investing around have not happened yet. Investors have never seen a period like this before, and that\u2019s what excites me.\u201dOppenheimerFunds is not affiliated with The New York Times.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "The Trump Effect on Tokyo", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorA Trump presidency could be the greatest challenge to U.S.-Japan relations since the end of World War II \u2014 at least if Mr. Trump intends to translate his campaign pledges into actual foreign policy. On the stump, he challenged the main tenets of the two countries\u2019 security relations, as well as America\u2019s approach to nuclear deterrence in the Asia-Pacific region and to multilateral trade agreements. Mr. Trump has cast unprecedented uncertainty on a partnership that has served Japan and America \u2014 and the rest of the world \u2014 in good stead.The U.S.-Japan alliance has been a cornerstone of stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region for decades. Under the Abe administration, the Japanese government is both more stable and more nimble today than it has been in years. Even before the U.S. election, Mr. Abe had signaled his government\u2019s resolve to see Japan take on a greater leadership role.Rather than lambasting Japan for not doing enough, Mr. Trump should recognize its recent efforts. That would stand a better chance of encouraging Tokyo to contribute even more in areas where it can, such as by cooperating with the United States on developing cutting-edge defense technology or increasing Japan\u2019s civilian coast-guard capacity-building in Southeast Asia.Mr. Trump must also reaffirm America\u2019s commitment to maintaining the so-called nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea, its guarantee to defend its non-nuclear allies if they come under attack.Another major plank of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign platform was his opposition to globalization and multilateral trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (T.P.P.). He said he favored bilateral arrangements instead. Promising to protect manufacturing jobs for Americans, he also said he would seek to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.The day after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Japan\u2019s House of Representatives ratified the T.P.P. Mr. Abe has said that the deal would not only bring economic benefits but also have \u201cawesome\u201d strategic value: It would indeed confirm the enduring relevance of the rules-based liberal international order that has helped maintain peace since World War II.Even if the T.P.P. isn\u2019t it, Mr. Trump will realize soon enough that, for both economic and strategic reasons, America must participate in multilateral trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region. Otherwise, it will be left out, in effect ceding the area to China and its economic expansionism \u2014 and undermining Mr. Trump\u2019s stated resolve to adopt a tougher stance toward China on trade issues.Mr. Trump\u2019s vision lacks strategic coherence \u2014 yet this is also an opportunity for Japan to help shape America\u2019s policies in East Asia.The Japanese and U.S. governments struggled to forge a common approach to China under the Obama administration, with Washington wavering between wanting a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Beijing and pushing back against it, especially its aggressive claims over islands in the South China Sea. Tokyo, on the other hand, has been unequivocal in its view that China is a great threat to the continuing development of a rules-based order in the region.Bridging this perception gap should be at the top of Mr. Abe\u2019s list of issues to address with Mr. Trump. He could, for example, propose the \u201cisosceles triangle\u201d model touted by Lee Kuan Yew, the late prime minister of Singapore, as a framework for their discussions. Mr. Lee promoted a set of relations among America, Japan and China that connected the three countries, but with America and Japan at the two closer corners.Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump would also do well to explore new areas of cooperation, such as with Moscow. Although Russia may seem like a disruptive power from the vantage point of the West, it could be an agent of stability in the Asia-Pacific region.Mr. Trump has said he is confident that he can \u201cget along\u201d with strongmen like Vladimir V. Putin. George W. Bush had claimed the same, and failed. Mr. Abe, however, has met Mr. Putin more than a dozen times and has built a reliable constructive relationship with him. Working through Tokyo, Mr. Trump could seek to improve U.S.-Russia ties and encourage Moscow\u2019s cooperation on issues of mutual interest, such as security on the Korean Peninsula, at the same time forestalling further rapprochement between Moscow and Beijing.The U.S.-Japan relationship is one of the most successful great-power alliances in recent history, and President-elect Trump must not allow the incoherences of his campaign-trail bluster to undermine it. If anything, he should take up Mr. Abe on his own commitment to bolster Japan\u2019s leadership in the Asia-Pacific region in order to further strengthen ties between the two countries.Yoichi Funabashi is Chairman of the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation, a think tank in Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Economic Data Is Kept Politics-Free", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTalk about an October surprise. The post on Twitter warning of a government conspiracy to swing the presidential election in the Democrats\u2019 favor popped up just moments after the Labor Department reported the biggest monthly decline in the unemployment rate in nine years.\u201cUnbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago guys will do anything,\u201d it said, referring to the Obama administration\u2019s crew. \u201cCan\u2019t debate so change numbers.\u201dMr. Welch later admitted that he had no evidence that any numbers had been cooked \u2014 only that the reported improvements did not match his own observations of the economy.Such suspicions about even the routine, day-in and day-out economic statistics produced by the federal government, voiced by a scattershot of skeptics in previous years, have turned into a steady roar this campaign season.\u201cPeople don\u2019t know where these figures come from, they don\u2019t know what they mean,\u201d Professor Kahan said. \u201cThey just have an emotional \u2018yay\u2019 or \u2018boo\u2019 response to them and anything else that they recognize as having a political significance.\u201dEarlier this year, Mr. Trump said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe those phony numbers,\u201d contending that the jobless rate was \u201cprobably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\u201d More recently, he declared the official 5 percent jobless rate \u201cone of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.\u201dBy affirming that view, Trump supporters are in effect signaling: \u201cI\u2019m with him.\u201dSo how reliable is the government data on employment, which will be reported again on Friday? Like all statistical measurements, it can be both honest and imprecise; a best estimate given the available tools but nonetheless subject to ambiguity, misinterpretation and error.\u201cEvery data collection comes with a set of strengths and weaknesses,\u201d said Karen Kosanovich, an economist and 24-year veteran of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the business of collecting information.\u201dThere are some basic ground rules, however, that prevent the process from spitting out any answers you please and undermine claims that the results are rigged for a political purpose.For starters, the people who generate the numbers are all career civil servants who have churned out reports for both Republicans and Democrats. And their basic methods do not swerve from one administration to the next. If the figures are biased, they are consistently biased in the same way regardless of what party is in office.\u201cI\u2019ve never had any outside influence that tells me what to do or how to collect and interpret information,\u201d Ms. Kosanovich said. \u201cOur approach is based on methodologies that have been proven over time and approved statistical practices. They are not based on political influence.\u201dThe most common misconception among the public, Ms. Kosanovich said, is that the unemployment rate is determined solely by counting people who are receiving unemployment insurance benefits. That is not the case.Rather, it is based on what is known as the Current Population Survey, a monthly survey of 60,000 households, or about 110,000 individuals from all around the country. (By comparison, most respected public opinion polls depend on a random sample of 1,000 to 2,000 people).In general, anyone who reports working for pay \u2014 even just an hour \u2014 during the previous week is considered employed. Anyone who was laid off or actively looked for work (sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, responding to help-wanted ads) during the previous four weeks, regardless of whether they received any government benefits, is considered unemployed. People who are not looking \u2014 this includes millions of students enrolled in college, plenty of parents who are happy to stay home with young children, and millions more retirees \u2014 are not counted as being in the labor force.To estimate how many jobs were created and lost, the labor bureau each month gathers data from 146,000 private business and government agencies covering about 623,000 work sites throughout the country.So what gives the best picture of the job market? That depends. The survey of employers, started in a bare-bones form more than a century ago, is considered a more reliable measure than the household survey, in part because the sample size is much larger. But it does not pick up all the types of jobs (the self-employed, unpaid family workers, domestic help and agricultural workers) or answer questions about workers\u2019 race, ethnicity, age and educational level. The household survey helps fill in those gaps.The official jobless rate comes from the household survey and represents the number of people who are 1) in the labor force, and 2) unemployed. In September that was 7.9 million Americans out of the 160 million in the labor force, or 5 percent.Many economists, however, consider the official unemployment rate to be an inadequate gauge of what people are experiencing. It does not take into account people who are working only part time because they cannot find a full-time job. Or the former steelworker who, after years of fruitless searching, has given up looking but would take a job if he could find one.Mr. Goolsbee called this \u201ca kind of invisible unemployment\u201d and noted that \u201cunderreporting unemployment has served the interests of both political parties.\u201dSince then, concerns about the shrinking size of the labor force have sharpened. The proportion of Americans officially in the labor force has failed to recover significantly after taking a steep dive during the recession. In 2008, about 66 percent of the population was actively looking or working; now less than 63 percent is.\u201cJust because people left the work force out of discouragement, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not available for work,\u201d said Patrick J. O\u2019Keefe, director of economic policy at CohnReznick and a former deputy assistant secretary in the Labor Department. \u201cIt just means the economy is not generating sufficient jobs at sufficient pay levels to get them back in.\u201dPositive or negative spin, however, is not part of the Labor Department\u2019s brief, Ms. Kosanovich said. She repeated a comment made by Kathleen Utgoff, a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner appointed by George W. Bush, that serves as the agency\u2019s unofficial motto: When asked whether the glass is half full or half empty, the bureau\u2019s response is, It\u2019s an eight-ounce glass with four ounces of liquid.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

The last two Republican presidents left office deeply unpopular, thanks to recessions. Ronald Reagan\u2019s record was much better but still not as good as Bill Clinton\u2019s.All told, economic growth under Democratic presidents over the last half-century has been 25 percent faster than under Republicans. Private-sector job growth has been more than twice as fast. Republicans even have a worse record running up the deficit. (These comparisons hold no matter when precisely you start the clock on a president\u2019s legacy.)Of course, presidents don\u2019t deserve full credit or blame for the economy\u2019s performance. But they do bear some responsibility. The notion that Republican presidents have been better economic stewards than Democrats but fallen victim to a terribly unfair mix of luck and timing is about as sensible as it sounds.There are reasons that the modern version of Republican economics hasn\u2019t worked so well. It takes the powerful ideas behind market-based capitalism to an extreme, where they often stop working.Now that he\u2019s won, he has to decide whether his differences with the Republican establishment are more stylistic than substantive. On the issues with the biggest impact on working-class lives, he will need to choose between pursuing the policies of a traditional Republican president and creating something new. In effect, he\u2019ll have to decide whether he is going to be his own president or a bigger version of Little Marco.Yet there are still two reasons to wonder if he will take steps away from traditional Republican economics.These proposals try to use a market-based philosophy to help working-class families \u2014 which is quite different from the recent Republican emphasis on comforting the comfortable. Presidents may not be able to directly control the economy\u2019s growth rate, but they do have enormous influence on which groups benefit most from government policy.For now, these issues remain obscured by Trump\u2019s fondness for sideshows and his sordid promotion of the family business. Those distractions won\u2019t disappear when he becomes president. No doubt, he\u2019ll often describe his policies however he feels like describing them.But something will change soon: He will need to begin making real decisions, with clear consequences for the people whose votes elected him.

How far? I don\u2019t know. But stay tuned, especially on climate.When asked where he stood on that climate change issue \u2014 which in the past he dismissed as a hoax \u2014 and last December\u2019s U.S.-led Paris emissions-reduction accord, the president-elect did not hesitate for a second: \u201cI\u2019m looking at it very closely. \u2026 I have an open mind to it. We\u2019re going to look very carefully. \u2026 You can make lots of cases for different views. \u2026 I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal-clean water is vitally important.\u201dDo you think climate change is caused by human activity?\u201cI think there is some connectivity,\u201d Trump answered. It is not clear \u201chow much,\u201d and what he will do about it \u201cdepends on how much it\u2019s going to cost our companies.\u201d Trump said he would study the issue \u201cvery hard\u201d and hinted that if, after study, he was to moderate his views, his voice would be influential with climate skeptics.On the question of whether the U.S. military should use waterboarding and other forms of torture to break suspected terrorists \u2014 a position he advocated frequently during the campaign to great applause \u2014 Trump bluntly stated that he had changed his mind after talking with James N. Mattis, the retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command.Trump said Mattis told him of torture: \u201cI\u2019ve never found it to be useful.\u201d (Many in the military and the C.I.A. have long held this view.)He quoted Mattis as saying, \u201cGive me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I always do better\u201d than anyone using torture. Concluded Trump, \u201cI was very impressed by that answer.\u201dSpeaking of the Middle East, Trump said unprompted: \u201cI would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d adding, \u201cI have reason to believe I can do that.\u201d And he hinted that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could be his special envoy and \u201che\u2019d be very good at it. \u2026 He knows the region.\u201d (Wow, watching Trump try to forge a deal between Bibi Netanyahu and the Palestinians would be pay-per-view!)The one area where I think Trump is going to have the hardest time delivering on his campaign promises is to create \u201cmillions\u201d of good-paying jobs by incentivizing and pressuring American companies to manufacture more in the U.S. He still talks about America as a manufacturing wasteland when, in fact, manufacturing remains the largest sector of the U.S. economy but employs far fewer workers.As the management consultant Warren Bennis famously observed: \u201cThe factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.\u201dBottom line: The campaign is over, but the struggle for Donald Trump\u2019s soul has just begun. Trump clearly learns by talking to people, not reading. Because so few thought he would win, many of those who gathered around him and had his ear were extreme characters.But now that he has been elected president he is exposing himself to, and hearing from, a much wider net of people. He mentioned that he had had telephone conversations with Bill Gates and with Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook. And he stressed repeatedly that he wants to succeed: \u201cI am doing this to do a good job.\u201dFor a meeting between the newsmaker and this news organization that has covered him without fear or favor, the lunch was fairly relaxed, but not without some jousting. Asked if he read The New York Times, Trump said: \u201cI do read it. Unfortunately. I would live about 20 years longer if I didn\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Protection Bureau Chief Braces for a Reckoning", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mild-mannered, lawyerly and with a genius for trivia, Richard Cordray is not the sort of guy you picture at the center of Washington\u2019s bitter partisan wars over regulation and consumer safeguards.And with a Republican sweep of Congress and the White House, they may get some or all of what they wish.Mr. Cordray, a reluctant Washingtonian who has commuted here for six years from Grove City, Ohio, where his wife and twin children live, is the first director of the consumer watchdog agency, which was created in 2010 after Wall Street\u2019s meltdown. By aggressively deploying his small army of workers \u2014 he has 1,600 of them \u2014 Mr. Cordray has turned the fledgling agency into one of Washington\u2019s most powerful and pugnacious regulators.And, according to Mr. Cordray, he and his team have barely scratched the surface of combating consumer abuse.\u201cWe overcame momentous challenges \u2014 just building an agency from scratch, let alone one that deals with such a large sector of the economy,\u201d Mr. Cordray said in an interview at his agency\u2019s office here. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with the progress we have made, but I\u2019m not satisfied in the sense that there\u2019s a lot more progress to be made. There\u2019s still a lot to be done.\u201dMr. Cordray, who also battled on behalf of consumers in his previous jobs as Ohio\u2019s attorney general and, before that, its treasurer, is praised in some circles as enormously effective, wielding the bureau\u2019s power to restructure some industries and terrify others.The bureau has \u201chelped save countless people across the country from abusive financial practices,\u201d said Hilary O. Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.\u2019s senior vice president for advocacy and policy.\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing law in this area for well over 40 years, and there\u2019s nothing that compares to it,\u201d Mr. Kaplinsky said. \u201cEvery company in the consumer financial services market has felt the effects.\u201dMr. Cordray said that as attorney general of Ohio, he had a front-row seat to the suffering that people endured during the last financial collapse. He was elected to the office in 2008 \u2014 the peak of the mortgage crisis.\u201cI had seen the foreclosure crisis up close,\u201d Mr. Cordray said. \u201cI had seen all the struggles people had with student loans. These were all things we wanted to prioritize.\u201dMr. Cordray said workers at the bureau were often drawn there because they felt the pain of the consumers they tried to help.\u201cMany people here, if you ask them why they came, they\u2019ll give you one or more personal stories\u201d of hardship at the hands of rapacious companies, he said, adding that workers at the bureau had learned how to speak publicly and effectively about \u201chow these issues affect people\u2019s lives. I think we\u2019ve gotten more and more systematic about doing that,\u201d he said, especially with consumers\u2019 stories submitted to the agency\u2019s complaint portal.Ralph Liberatoscioli of Mineola, N.Y., turned to the agency this year during a wrangle with Citibank over rewards points he said his wife was owed on her checking account. After several months of fruitlessly working through layers of customer service representatives, he gave up on talks with the bank and filed a consumer bureau complaint on his wife\u2019s behalf.Within a week, Citibank sent an apology letter and credited her account with the disputed points.\u201cThey have clout, and the banks recognize that,\u201d Mr. Liberatoscioli said.Because the appeals court\u2019s ruling is delayed until the challenge process plays out, Mr. Cordray still cannot be quickly removed from office by the president.Nor would it be easy or quick for the Trump administration to dismantle or weaken the bureau \u2014 and, after all the attention Wells Fargo stirred up, it might be politically unpopular.But Donald J. Trump\u2019s election revived calls from critics of the bureau to eliminate Mr. Cordray\u2019s position and replace the agency\u2019s leadership with a five-member, bipartisan commission. The critics say the move would temper the bureau\u2019s more radical impulses; supporters say it would hamstring the agency and prevent it from doing virtually anything.For now, the main obstacle for Republicans who want to gut the bureau, or steer it in a very different direction, is Mr. Cordray, whose term runs through July 2018.He took office in the shadow of Ms. Warren, but his fans and critics say \u2014 or complain \u2014 that he has proved to be every bit as fierce in carving out the agency\u2019s turf and using its regulatory and enforcement powers.\u201cThey don\u2019t fine-tune,\u201d said Craig Nazzaro, a lawyer in Atlanta who specializes in consumer-finance law and represents debt collectors. \u201cThey take a sledgehammer to the existing rules and redefine industry standards.\u201dThe housing crisis dominated the bureau\u2019s early days. When Congress created the new overseer, it also dictated its first priority: making mortgages safer. The deadline was tight. If the bureau did not introduce new rules within 18 months, a congressionally mandated set of lending guidelines would automatically take effect.The bureau made it with one day to spare.\u201cIt seems like the financial services industry has figured out how to adapt to this new regulatory regime,\u201d said David Reiss, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who studied the effects of the bureau\u2019s rule-making. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from the fox-in-the-henhouse market in the early 2000s, where you could get away with nearly anything, to this new model, where someone is looking over your shoulder.\u201dSo the bureau has relied heavily in the last few years on one of its other powers: enforcement. By suing and fining companies when they stray out of bounds, the agency has been able to reshape the playing field years before any new regulations are completed.\u201cTheir method is to regulate through enforcement,\u201d Mr. Kaplinsky said, echoing a common criticism of the bureau\u2019s approach. \u201cThey\u2019ve entered into more than 150 separate consent orders touching literally every kind of consumer finance product, and Director Cordray has indicated to the industry that you\u2019d better read the consent orders and follow them \u2014 even if you\u2019re not a party.\u201dAsk Mr. Cordray about that charge, and he grins a little.\u201cWhat that really boils down to is a criticism that we\u2019re enforcing the law too vigorously,\u201d he said.Whether the consumer bureau is enforcing the law or using stealth maneuvers to expand it is a source of fierce debate, and Mr. Cordray is regularly called on the carpet on Capitol Hill to defend his agency\u2019s actions. He has testified before Congress 27 times.Ms. Warren said she was delighted with what the bureau had achieved under Mr. Cordray\u2019s leadership.\u201cThe C.F.P.B. has exceeded my highest expectations,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tools lying around at various regulatory agencies that never get used. But the bureau is using all of its tools, and is out there making a difference.\u201dAsked if trying to police the entire field of consumer finance is like trying to boil the ocean, Mr. Cordray grinned again. \u201cGet a big enough boiler, and you can do it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He was 85.The cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, his assistant, Joann Allen, said.Mr. Ruff, a college dropout, had a roller-coaster career, starting out as a stockbroker. For a time he also supported himself as a singer. (One gig was at a synagogue, as what he described as the only practicing Mormon cantor in San Francisco.)Rather than defeating him, however, the setback led to an epiphany, he said: It inspired him to plunge into business-cycle research and forge a career as a faddish investment adviser, which made him a millionaire for a second time. But that enterprise, too, went belly up.\u201cSome people say that I couldn\u2019t succeed at anything, so I became a prophet of doom,\u201d he told Time magazine in 1979.That turned out to be another successful calling. In 1975 he started publishing a newsletter called Ruff Times, which mixed financial counsel (predicting inflation and recommending investment in gold) with conservative commentary. It drew more than 175,000 subscribers.He began a syndicated weekly television program called \u201cRuff House\u201d; organized forums that offered, for a fee, more or less conventional investment advice; and established companies that distributed natural vitamins and coins, as well as other for-profit and self-promotional ventures.Again he prospered, as reflected by a 20,000-square-foot home in Utah with an indoor pool.Mr. Ruff drew his widest attention in 1979 with his book \u201cHow to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years.\u201d It recommended survivalist strategies, like stocking a year\u2019s supply of food, and directed readers to other books including \u201cSafe Places East of the Mississippi\u201d and \u201cEating Weeds for Fun and Freedom.\u201d The book sold millions of copies and was a New York Times best seller for more than a year.Until about 1981, his followers reaped large capital gains by investing in precious metals. But by several measures his portfolios later underperformed market indexes and even Treasury bills, and some of his apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass, as inflation subsided and interest rates declined during the Reagan administration, and when the economy rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cHoward was a pioneer in the financial world when brokers encouraged investors to buy blue-chip stocks and bonds and charged high fixed commissions,\u201d Mark Skousen, the editor of Forecasts & Strategies, an investment newsletter, said in an email on Tuesday. \u201cRuff argued that Wall Street was hazardous to your wealth, especially investing in bonds that were big losers during the inflationary \u201970s.\u201dMr. Ruff became bullish on the bond and stock markets in the early 1980s, changing the name of his newsletter to Howard Ruff\u2019s Financial Success Report. But it reverted to Ruff Times in the mid-80s, and in 2008 he updated his book on the coming bad years, warning that whoever won the presidency in 2008 would be doomed by rising oil and gas prices and spiraling monetary inflation to become \u201cthe Hoover of the 2000s.\u201dAmong his other books were \u201cFamine and Survival in America\u201d (1974) and \u201cHow to Prosper in the Age of Obamanomics: A Ruff Plan for Hard Times Ahead\u201d (2009).Unlike some of his doomsaying colleagues, though, Mr. Ruff maintained a following through an engaging wit and a general willingness to admit mistakes.Urging investors to be mavericks, he compared the breed to \u201ca bovine that\u2019s left the herd,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd I feel the majority of the herd is going to be turned into hamburger.\u201dIn recommending readiness for economic collapse, he reminded his disciples, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t raining when Noah built the ark.\u201dHe co-founded a conservative lobbying group called Free the Eagle, and in 2000 he fought, unsuccessfully, to prevent Hillary Clinton, who had transplanted herself from Arkansas and Washington, from winning a Senate seat from New York.His Ruffpac political action committee prepared a television commercial that benignly featured babies and puppies playing in Central Park. It asked rhetorically what they had in common, responding: \u201cThey have all lived in New York longer than Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201dHoward Joseph Ruff was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Berkeley, Calif., the son of the former Rena Maxberry, a seamstress, and Wilson Ruff, who killed himself when Howard was 6 months old.\u201cI grew up broke,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe were too poor to afford a father.\u201dHe had wanted to be a singer since the age of 9, but, at his mother\u2019s insistence, instead of accepting a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he served a two-year mission in the eastern United States for the Mormon Church. He later majored in music education at Brigham Young University in Utah with a minor in economics.But by his senior year, he told The New York Times in 1979, \u201cI ran out of money and got out of college before it did me any personal harm, like ending up teaching high school music courses.\u201dInstead, after joining the Air Force, he toured with its symphony as a baritone soloist and also performed with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.Mr. Ruff released an album, \u201cHoward Ruff Sings,\u201d in 1982 on his own label, Target Records, featuring songs like \u201cI Walked Today Where Jesus Walked,\u201d \u201cIf I Were a Rich Man,\u201d \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d and \u201cMy Way.\u201d\u201cI did it for the shock value,\u201d Mr. Ruff said. \u201cI also did it to change my image. I have always been painted as a cardboard figure of doom.\u201dMr. Ruff is survived by his wife, the former Kay Felt; 13 of their 14 children (some of whom were adopted) \u2014 Larry, Eric, David, Megan and Timothy Ruff, Anthony Ramon, David Steinberg, Pamela Patterson, Sharon Slater, Patty Simpson, Liza Spencer, Debbie Rasmussen and Terri Lynn Bond \u2014 79 grandchildren; and 48 great-grandchildren.By 2002, Mr. Ruff\u2019s fortunes had slipped again. The circulation of Ruff Times had plummeted to 3,000, according to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance, and he had long sold his 10-acre Utah estate and moved to smaller quarters.\u201cHe was a self-made millionaire. Twice. He lost it all. Twice,\u201d his family said in a statement. \u201cHe often said he learned more from his failures than from his successes.\u201dBut he retained admirers. The journalist and financial analyst Mark Hulbert wrote on MarketWatch.com in 2013, \u201cIt would be easy to miss the lasting contribution Howard Ruff made to the investment advisory business.\u2019\u2019Mr. Ruff, he wrote, had brought \u201cinto the mainstream the notion that we don\u2019t need to rely on a Wall Street broker or analyst for advice on what to do with our money.\u201dHe added, \u201cRuff gave voice to the millions of middle-class investors who felt that the country\u2019s financial system was rigged against them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

However, the American banks are already subject to high capital requirements set out by the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe G.S.I.B. measure announced this morning by the F.S.B. does not have an impact on any of Citi\u2019s binding regulatory metrics,\u201d a Citigroup spokeswoman said on Monday.On Monday, the Financial Stability Board also deemed three banks less risky to global financial stability than they were last year: Barclays, HSBC and Morgan Stanley. All three have sold part of their riskier businesses or reduced the size of some of them in the past year.Worldwide, 30 lenders are considered global systemically important banks and are subject to additional capital requirements.They are separated into five potential risk categories, the highest of which would have to hold an additional 3.5 percent of capital on top of minimum regulatory requirements. No banks were put in that highest risk category this year, which is intended to discourage banks from becoming more systemically important.The dollar\u2019s strengthening against the British pound and other currencies also played a role in the latest shift in the rankings for American lenders.Though they are not all in the same group, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and I.C.B.C. each jumped up one place from the categories they were assigned last year.Under the Financial Stability Board\u2019s rules, Citigroup joined JPMorgan Chase this year in the second-highest group, facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of minimum regulatory standards. Citigroup said it already faced a 3 percent surcharge under Fed rules.Bank of America is in the third group, facing a 2 percent surcharge under the board\u2019s rules. Wells Fargo and I.C.B.C. are in the fourth group, with an additional 1.5 percent requirement under the board\u2019s rules.Higher capital buffer requirements set out by the Financial Stability Board began to be phased in this year and are expected to be fully in place by the beginning of 2019.

In recent weeks, there have been several large protests against the project, particularly in Vancouver, British Columbia. But Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, has repeatedly said that the project is critical to the future of her province\u2019s energy industry.Environmental groups began condemning the decision as Mr. Trudeau was making his announcement late Tuesday afternoon, but the prime minister said that the pipeline expansion did not contradict his pledges to improve environmental protection and mitigate climate change.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard clearly from Canadians that they don\u2019t want to see someone trying to make a choice between what\u2019s good for the environment and what\u2019s good for the economy,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference. \u201cThey need to go together, and the decisions we\u2019ve made today and leading up to today are entirely consistent with that.\u201dHe said that spending much of his childhood with his grandparents in British Columbia and then studying and working in Vancouver as a teacher helped inform his decision on the pipeline.\u201cIf I thought that this project was unsafe for the B.C. coast, I would reject it,\u201d he said.Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that he was \u201cunder no illusions\u201d that his approval of the multibillion-dollar project would not encounter strong opposition. The expansion\u2019s opponents include Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, who is generally a political ally, and some members of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal caucus in the House of Commons. But while Mr. Trudeau said the government welcomed people expressing contrary views, their opposition would not change what he characterized as a decision based on science.\u201cWe have not been and we will not be swayed by political arguments,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said.A number of factors underlie opposition to the Kinder Morgan project. Some people in British Columbia fear that the increase in tanker traffic to the port in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby will inevitably lead to a major oil spill. Many environmentalists charge that the pipeline will make it impossible for Canada to meet the carbon emissions targets set by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government \u2014 an assertion the government rejects.Environmental groups said they would move to stop the project through a variety of means.\u201cPeople are already standing up and fighting back, and that is only going to grow,\u201d said Sven Biggs, the energy and climate campaigner for Stand.earth, an environmental group previously known as ForestEthics. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be in the courts; it\u2019s going to be in the streets; it\u2019s also going to be at the ballot box.\u201dBefore Mr. Trudeau\u2019s announcement, some opponents of the Kinder Morgan pipeline predicted that its approval would lead to protests on the scale of the anti-pipeline demonstrations now underway at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.After a meeting on Monday with cabinet ministers in Ottawa about the pipeline, Chief Maureen Thomas of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, the indigenous community directly across from the tanker port in British Columbia, said in an interview that her community would mount a legal challenge if the project was approved.Court challenges by indigenous communities have previously stalled the Enbridge Northern Gateway, a pipeline plan to link the oil sands to the northern coast of British Columbia. On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau said the government had told its energy board to reject that proposal.Rona Ambrose, the interim leader of the Conservative Party, criticized Mr. Trudeau for rejecting that pipeline. But she was also pessimistic about the prospects for the Kinder Morgan project in the face of legal challenges.\u201cI don\u2019t think that will have a chance of being built,\u201d she told reporters.Advertisement"}

Utility stocks, which were in high demand, fell out of favor.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen changes like these in ages,\u201d said Dave Mazza, head of exchange traded funds and mutual fund research for State Street Global Advisors.The question now is whether the markets\u2019 preferences will change abruptly again.Some rollback toward pre-Trump market preferences can be expected, of course. \u201cSome of what we saw initially was just animal spirits and momentum,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. \u201cThe market often overreacts and then corrects itself, and that has been happening.\u201dYet it is possible that the election could be remembered as a pivotal moment in the markets, and in politics \u2014 and not just because a new Republican-controlled government is likely to enact some very different policies. It is at least arguable that the election has given the markets the impetus, and the excuse, to solidify deeper trends that were already underway.\u201cThe election shock has accelerated some changes that were already beginning to be evident \u2014 in a much smaller way,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cI think that some of those trends are likely to stick.\u201dThere is no denying that the election\u2019s outcome took the markets by surprise. The overwhelming assumption in financial circles, and in the polls, was that Hillary Clinton would win and that Mr. Trump would lose. The further expectation was that in the unlikely event of a Trump victory, there would be a major stock market decline. But that occurred for only several hours, and then there was a powerful stock market rally, which has slowed but not stopped.That\u2019s only part of the story. A revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place. Recent stars have faded, in the market\u2019s transitory judgment. New investments are in vogue.Traders have been voting with their dollars. Using State Street sector exchange-traded funds as a proxy for the broader market, Mr. Mazza reported unusually high inflows into the sector E.T.F.s for financial services, health care and industrials, and lesser inflows into materials and energy stocks. Traders stampeded away from utilities, technology and consumer staples shares. They were neutral or slightly negative about consumer discretionary and real estate shares.Take financial stocks and utilities. Until recently, investors shunned banks while celebrating utilities for their steady-Eddie dividend payouts.That shifted radically. In the five days after the election, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America gained at least 13 percent. Four leading utilities \u2014 Exelon, FirstEnergy, NextEra Energy and Entergy \u2014 lost at least 4 percent. Before the election, utility shares were ahead of financials for the year. Five days later, they were trailing.The nearly $5 billion inflow into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, for example, was the biggest of any week since the E.T.F.\u2019s inception in 1998, Mr. Mazza said. Such cash flows generally correlate with market price trends. The biggest weekly outflow was $3.5 billion, and it occurred in the week of Jan. 28, 2008, during the financial crisis. Investors found bank stocks as scary as they now find them attractive.Utilities, on the other hand, moved on election week to the avoidance list, with net outflows of $455 million in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, Mr. Mazza said.While traders may have shifted gears hastily, there is at least a rational basis for their movements.The problem lies in the assumptions behind these market shifts. Predictions about politics are risky. Those based on underlying economics may be a bit more reliable.For example, the bond market shift appears at least partly based on a judgment that inflation will rise because of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, inchoate though they may be. He has called for tax cuts and spending increases in the nation\u2019s infrastructure and military. That could be inflationary if they widen a budget deficit. But conservatives in Congress may not go along with an increase in deficit spending. It\u2019s not clear what the Trump administration will try to accomplish. All of these assumptions may not be borne out in fact.Similarly, technology shares have fallen sharply, at least partly out of concern for the possibly negative effects of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, said Larry Puglia, a portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price. It is possible, he said, that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to immigration will make it more difficult for highly skilled foreigners to receive visas for work at American tech companies, or that his trade policies will make the logistics of global tech manufacturing more cumbersome and expensive.People \u201cshouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions,\u201d Mr. Puglia said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d He said he had made few changes to his investment portfolios, preferring to wait and see.On the other hand, some sea changes may be underway in the economy, Mr. Paulsen said. The election could be giving traders an excuse to act on them. Recent data indicates that economic growth has been accelerating. The election aside, he said, it makes sense that bond yields will rise under these circumstances and that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term interest rates. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, says a rate increase is \u201crelatively likely\u201d to occur soon, perhaps at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in December.Rising interest rates generally help bank stocks and hurt utilities, whose dividends no longer seem as appealing. Furthermore, rising rates support a stronger dollar, justifying a decline in the price of gold, which has been out of favor since the election.In addition, the labor market has been improving for a long time, the American economy is in better shape than it was a year or two ago, and it\u2019s reasonable for investors to be more aggressive, Mr. Paulsen said.Still, the risk of geopolitical or domestic shocks is real, he acknowledged, and traders are only making educated guesses. If they turn out to be wrong, the market could turn upside down again.For most long-term investors, that is an argument for broad diversification. Despite the turmoil in the markets, simple balanced portfolios of stocks and bonds have barely moved since the election. In a period of extreme swerves and shifts, that may count as an achievement.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Surprise: A Trade Deal Wins Approval", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe rescue of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, the formal name of the Canada-E.U. accord, was greeted with relief by leaders of Canada and the bloc at their signing ceremony in Brussels. Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that everyone gets that this is a good thing for our economies, but it\u2019s also a good example to the world.\u201dThe agreement is supposed to eliminate most tariffs between Canada and the union and to level the playing field in other areas, benefiting both sides. Yet its near-death underscores the degree to which trade, and globalization in general, once trumpeted as a force for progress, have come to be seen as a vehicle for destroying jobs, making the rich richer and undermining national sovereignty. The backlash has been evident in the American presidential campaign, in the British vote to quit the union and in the populist parties sprouting across Europe.It would be unfortunate if the Canada-European Union agreement turned out to be the last gasp of an era of expanding trade. If global trade is to start growing again, popular support for major accords must be earned, not assumed, and both the benefits and costs, in terms of jobs, taxes and regulations, must be honestly explained.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Firm Arnold & Porter to Merge With Rival Kaye Scholer", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byTwo prominent law firms, Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer, winding up months of talks, announced on Thursday that they would combine to become a firm with more than 1,000 lawyers effective Jan. 1. The new firm will be called Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer.The combination was not a surprise. Each firm brings complementary expertise \u2014 Arnold & Porter is a litigation and regulatory issues powerhouse in Washington, and Kaye Scholer, based in New York, which is almost half the size of Arnold & Porter, is best known for its financial services and life sciences work. At each firm, however, the revenue and profit per partner has been buffeted in the changing legal landscape.In that respect, the linkup seems logical. But the legal trade press reported that some Arnold & Porter partners were unhappy to be tied to what they viewed as the less-prestigious firm.Kaye Scholer was founded in 1917 by Benjamin Kaye, a noted tax lawyer and playwright.But pedigree aside, modern-day financial considerations appeared to win the day. Last year, Arnold & Porter\u2019s revenue fell 6.4 percent, to $650 million, and the bellwether metric \u2014 profit per partner \u2014 fell 12.6 percent, to $1.21 million. Kaye Scholer\u2019s revenue also dipped last year, by 1.3 percent, to $370 million, and its profit per partner fell 2.1 percent, to $1.38 million, according to figures from the American Lawyer legal publication.In announcing the combination, Richard M. Alexander, the chairman of Arnold & Porter, noted that it would be \u201ccreating substantial economies of scale that will accelerate our investments in talent and technologies and enable us to pursue innovation in the efficient delivery of legal services.\u201dThere was no word from either firm about layoffs resulting from the merger, although redundant support staff is often a target in such mergers. The bulk of Arnold & Porter\u2019s nearly 700 lawyers are in the nation\u2019s capital, where Kaye Scholer has fewer than two dozen lawyers. About 100 of Arnold & Porter\u2019s lawyers are in New York, where many of Kaye Scholer\u2019s approximately 375 lawyers work.Over all, the two firms will have offices not only in Washington and New York, but also in California, Chicago, Denver, Houston and West Palm Beach, as well as several international locations.The merger may herald a new round of mergers, which in recent years have been clustered at the end of the calendar year. Only 12 combinations were announced in the third quarter, and they were mostly smaller firms, according to the legal services firm Altman Weil.Yet in recent years, law firm mergers have kept up a steady pace, as firms seek ways to keep on even financial footings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Bonuses Are Expected to Sink for 3rd Straight Year", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byWall Street bonuses are expected to decline for the third consecutive year, reflecting a period of busted mergers, limited trading activity and muted hedge fund returns.While mergers and acquisitions have been active (and even hit record levels in 2015), the bankers who advise on the deals get paid largely when the deals are completed. This year, antitrust officials thwarted a number of large mergers, including Halliburton\u2019s $35 billion bid for Baker Hughes, as well as the consolidations of the health insurance companies Anthem and Cigna, and Aetna and Humana.In addition, choppy markets damped stock trading activity and prevented skittish companies from making their debuts as public companies, except for a few prominent offerings. Investors dumped hedge fund holdings because of poor returns and high fees.Alan Johnson, the founder of Johnson Associates, describes this pattern as a \u201cmalaise,\u201d and one that is unlikely to reverse itself anytime soon.\u201cI don\u2019t see it changing for the next year or two, either,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe pressures in the industry on profit and fees are going to continue, and I think pay will likely continue to decline in 2017.\u201dEven more than in past years, competitors and clients pressured banks to reduce fees, as there was more disclosure around what companies can and do charge clients, Mr. Johnson said.In March, the state comptroller\u2019s office said that the average bonus for securities industry employees in the New York City area in 2015 was $146,200, while the average salary was $388,000. Both figures declined from 2014, but the compensation was still far higher than in any other industry in the area.According to the Johnson Associates report, some of the deepest cuts in bonuses this year will be among investment banking underwriting, hedge fund and equities professionals.Equity underwriting bonuses could be more than 20 percent lower compared with 2015.Within sales and trading, Johnson Associates said that there were lower levels of client activity, especially in equities, meaning bonuses could be from 5 percent to 15 percent lower than last year.Johnson Associates expects merger advisory bonuses to be about 10 percent lower.Nevertheless, there are more deals in the wings. Research by PitchBook found that through the third quarter of 2016, there was a record number of transactions valued at $10 billion or more. During the first nine months of the year, 31 such deals were signed, compared with 23 in all of 2015 and 16 in 2014. If this year\u2019s deals have better luck with regulators, banks could enjoy a payout later this year or next.Private equity bonuses will be little changed this year, according to the report, as firms were able to increase their assets under management but experienced \u201cmediocre returns.\u201dRetail and consumer banking was not quite as bleak. There, bonuses could actually gain as much as 5 percent over the previous year. That area of finance has benefited from deposit and loan growth as the economy recovers.Johnson Associates has been publishing its report annually for about 15 years. The consultants pore through public filings and interview from 30 to 50 clients to produce the results.Some of the challenges facing banks could soon reverse if interest rates go up meaningfully. With near-zero rates for almost a decade, banks have been able to lend money inexpensively but with lower returns than they received historically. If that dynamic reverses, it could be a boon to the industry, as long as the broader economy remains intact.\u201cIt could be water on the fields for many of these businesses in isolation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cNow the caveat is, what happens to the economy when rates go up?\u201dEconomic challenges are the reason European bank employees are worse off than American ones. And Britain\u2019s vote over the summer to leave the European Union, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d did not help European bank employees\u2019 situation, Mr. Johnson said.A portion of a banker\u2019s total compensation is based on how well his or her company has been doing in the stock market. The stock prices of some European banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, have declined about 50 percent each over the last year as they have grappled with government fines, increasing competition and greater regulation.Executives at those banks and others are talking about how to refocus their businesses to become more profitable.In New York, profit was not an issue. The securities industry generated $9.3 billion in profit during the first half of 2016, the comptroller\u2019s report showed, on track to surpass the $14.3 billion made in all of last year.But with thousands of job cuts and lower compensation for those in securities, it has become clear that the focus of those profits is primarily preservation, rather than making bankers wealthier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American in a Strange Land", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "FeatureAfter more than a decade away, a foreign correspondent comes back to take stock of his divided homeland.Supported byI didn\u2019t really know how to respond. I hadn\u2019t lived in the United States since 2003, when The New York Times moved me to Beijing as a foreign correspondent, along with my wife and two kids. We assumed we would move back home soon enough, but it never happened. We lived for six years in China, where our third child was born, followed by four years in New Delhi, where my beat was South Asia. By the time we settled in Rome in 2013, we had drifted into the category of American expatriates. When we saw our countrymen around the city \u2014 big, friendly tourists, a bit loud \u2014 my kids referred to them as \u201cthe Americans.\u201dWe weren\u2019t completely cut off. Most summers, we visited family and friends in the States; the kids streamed the American shows; my wife listened to \u201cMorning Edition.\u201d I worked for an American company, for American bosses, and I wrote articles trying to explain the world to a mostly American audience. All of this created the gentle illusion that we were still truly connected to home. Yet as the years passed, I realized that I had lost touch, that the country I left was no longer the same.The year I moved away, George W. Bush stood beneath a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner on an aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. Facebook hadn\u2019t yet been turned into a company. The iPhone did not exist. I left before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, before Detroit went bankrupt. I missed the Great Recession (though I am still living the European translation of it). I missed most of the last two presidencies. I missed Brangelina.Instead, I witnessed from the other side the global forces that would bring profound changes to America. I visited industrial regions of southern China where the ground seemed to vibrate under the weight and bustle of all the countless new factories. Once iPhones had been invented, it was Chinese workers who assembled them. I watched Bangladeshi seamstresses stitch clothes sold at Walmart. American consumers benefited from the cheaper goods, but American manufacturers did not. Between January 2000 and December 2014, the United States lost roughly five million manufacturing jobs.Then I moved to Rome and watched the European Union grow ineffective and paralyzed, as the dream of a vibrant, unified Europe seemed to wither. Democracy was losing ground in Hungary and the Philippines; it had all but surrendered in Russia. Syria became a slaughterhouse. The Islamic State dispatched terrorists around the world. China\u2019s politics became more oppressive, as President Xi Jinping cracked down on dissent and nurtured a Maoist-style cult of personality. Economic globalization was supposed to accelerate political liberalization around the world, but instead authoritarianism appeared to be on the rise. The West, it seemed, had failed to anticipate the possibility that globalization could contribute to the destabilization of \u2014 or pose a threat to \u2014 democracy, even in the United States.This summer, I decided I wanted to explore this place that had become a foreign country to me. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. I planned a zigzag route, revisiting places where I once lived or worked, a 29-day sprint through 11 states (and four time zones). I knew I would be moving too fast to make any sweeping declaration about the state of America, and I wouldn\u2019t ask people which presidential candidate they were voting for. I was more interested in why they were so anxious about the present and the future. I wanted to find out why the country was fragmenting rather than binding together. Most of all I wanted to see with my own eyes what had changed \u2014 and so much had changed.When I asked if he had any concern about this election damaging American democracy, he said he didn\u2019t worry too much about that. He talked about the European Union as evidence of the political dangers posed by immigration and described \u201cethno-nationalism\u201d and economic nationalism as potent political forces. \u201cI look around the world, and I think all those countries are coming apart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think ours is going to come apart. The melting pot is not melting anymore.\u201dI mentioned that I was leaving the next day to travel along the Texas-Mexico border. Buchanan grimaced for a moment and jokingly offered to lend me a shotgun. I thanked him, and later I flew off into the heat.I had been in contact with United States Customs and Border Protection but never thought to mention my aerial tour. A few hours after we landed, an agency spokesman emailed me. He was friendly but anxious: Agents reported seeing someone taking photographs from a helicopter tracing the border. Was it us?I had gone to El Paso often as a national correspondent for The Times, and I always liked the atmosphere there. Everybody seemed to know everybody else. El Paso is isolated from most of Texas, yet Ju\u00e1rez lies no more than a long baseball toss away. There is a fluid give and take between the two sides, even as the disparities are stark: Ju\u00e1rez has frequently ranked among the most violent cities in the world, while El Paso routinely rates among the safest municipalities in the United States.My helicopter ride had come about in typical El Paso fashion: I called a state senator, who connected me to the county judge, who nudged a local businessman to organize the trip. They saw it as a good opportunity to help rebut the 2016 election narrative that the border was a lawless, out-of-control sieve through which illegal immigrants flooded north and wreaked violence upon unsuspecting Americans. The county judge, Veronica Escobar, had grown wearily accustomed to the assumptions made in other parts of the country. \u201cOne of the first questions people frequently ask is, Will I be safe?\u201d she told me. \u201cYou can tell people that deportations are up and that in-migration is down from Mexico. You can tell people that the border has never been safer. You can provide people with as many statistics as possible \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201dEscobar, a Democrat and El Paso County\u2019s highest elected official, grew up here and considers the city an unlikely oasis of tolerance. She is Mexican-American; the city\u2019s police chief is African-American. We had dinner my first night in El Paso, and when I mentioned something Pat Buchanan said to me \u2014 he dared me to drive around El Paso with a Trump bumper sticker on my car \u2014 she laughed. But she worried that El Paso was changing. Even some of her own relatives, people who had moved away from El Paso, have posted pro-Trump, anti-immigrant messages on Facebook. Fear and anger overcame the facts on the ground, she said.\u201cHow did America get that way?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dI was starting my journey in El Paso because six months earlier I was across the border in Ju\u00e1rez, on the outside of America, looking in. As a correspondent based in Rome, I also cover the Vatican, so I traveled with Pope Francis\u2019 retinue on his trip to Mexico in February. His final stop was Ju\u00e1rez. As he prayed for migrants at the border\u2019s edge, I stared through the fence into the United States. Snipers were posted on rooftops; police cars with flashing lights blocked an overpass; agents watched from horseback or peered across the border with binoculars. Presumably some of this was to protect the pope, but I flew back to Italy startled by this show of force, this demonstration of American power and anxiety.A girl playing at her house in Baton Rouge, La., not far from where the police shot and killed Alton Sterling.\u00a0Soon after setting out in my rental car from El Paso, I saw just how thoroughly the Texas border had become militarized. Since I left, the number of Border Patrol agents nationwide had roughly doubled, to more than 20,000, a vast majority of them stationed along the 1,989-mile border with Mexico. They have motion detectors, helicopters, cameras, fixed-wing aircraft and drones at their disposal. Their boats ply stretches of the Rio Grande. Texas state troopers have also been dispatched to \u201csecure the border.\u201dThe El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, who has criticized the buildup, told me that so many troopers were present that they often had little to do besides enforce traffic laws. \u201cIt is a waste of money,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cIt was a response to the rhetoric that the border is unsafe. And that is wrong.\u201d (A new study by the Border Network for Human Rights found that troopers have been disproportionately stopping Latino motorists in many border counties, including El Paso.) At a convention of the Texas Republican Party this year, Gov. Greg Abbott falsely stated that the Islamic State was \u201crunning through the border.\u201d In April 2015, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted that the Islamic State had a training camp in Mexico, near El Paso. Again, there was no evidence to back up the claim.Safety feels like a tenuous concept right now, when a malcontent can detonate a homemade bomb in Chelsea or suicide bombers can blow themselves up outside a soccer stadium in Paris. But so much of the safety rhetoric around the border blends legitimate concerns \u2014 especially when it comes to smuggled drugs, money and weapons moving in both directions \u2014 with political opportunism. The rate of people being apprehended while trying to cross the border from Mexico declined in 2015 and is now at its lowest point in more than 40 years. And even as President Obama pushed for immigration reform, his administration approved high numbers of deportations.One afternoon, I pulled up to a checkpoint on Interstate 10, about an hour or so east of El Paso, near the town of Sierra Blanca, Tex. A Border Patrol agent in a bulletproof vest asked if I was an American citizen while a dog sniffed the rental car for drugs. Less than an hour later, a Texas state trooper pulled me over on State Highway 90 in Presidio County for failing to use my blinker while changing lanes. The road was so quiet that a jack rabbit hopped across. The trooper asked if I was an American citizen, checked my passport and sent me on my way with a warning. Traffic enforcement.\u201cThis country is huge,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said one day. \u201cIt is like 50 countries all together.\u201dTom\u00e1s, a Chilean, has traveled the world, but this was his first long tour across the United States. On seeing one rural road sign, he asked what it meant to \u201cadopt a highway.\u201d Another day, another road sign: \u201cHitchhikers May Be Escaping Inmates.\u201d Tom\u00e1s was startled by how thoroughly so many American cities emptied out at night. In Colorado Springs, we attended a rodeo where the announcer made a long soliloquy praising our military for defending our freedom at home. Tom\u00e1s had embedded many times with American forces in Afghanistan. He liked the soldiers, but he didn\u2019t understand how sending troops to other countries, particularly Iraq, kept Americans free at home.Before the rodeo, I met two ranchers, Rob Alexander and Bill Craig. The air smelled faintly of horse manure as we sat on a plastic cooler drinking Coors. Alexander, 53, explained that the rodeo was a fund-raiser for ranch hands, who often lacked health insurance or a safety net to help out in emergencies. Ranching families had taken a hit in the past two decades, in part because trade agreements led to the consolidation of many cattle operations and an increase in imported beef from South America. Craig, 35, is a fourth-generation rancher, but he said land is now so expensive and profit so meager that he could never afford to start a ranch from scratch today. They talked like men whose lifestyles and values were endangered.\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWatch the TV. The moral compass is so far out of whack in our country right now.\u201dAt the University of Texas at Austin, I met Lisa Moore, a professor of English and women\u2019s studies who is one of three plaintiffs suing to overturn a new state law allowing students to carry concealed handguns on campus. Born in Canada but a resident of Texas for 27 years, Moore is a naturalized American citizen who is still a bit baffled by her new country. \u201cThat is the weirdness of the United States to me: Everybody is always talking about their rights,\u201d she said, while identity in Canada derives from the idea of the social compact.Moore is a gay, married mother of two children who teaches courses on L.G.B.T. literature. \u201cCampus carry\u201d infringes on free speech, she argues, by inhibiting her ability to provide a safe learning environment. What if a student becomes enraged by the subject matter and pulls out a Glock?American gun manufacturers produced 3.3 million guns the year I left for China, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. By 2014, the number was nine million (supplemented by 3.6 million guns imported into the country). According to some recent estimates, there are now roughly as many guns as people in the United States, maybe even more. To many foreigners, the American infatuation with guns is an inexplicable, if defining, national trait. On a taxi ride in Beijing once, the driver, upon discovering I was American, shaped his hand like a pistol and began shooting imaginary bullets.At a firing range outside Austin, I met six guys shooting semiautomatic rifles. Several of them worked for Defense Distributed, the open-source organization in Austin that came up with a plastic handgun whose design can be downloaded from the web and produced with a 3-D printer. The State Department ordered the company to remove the design code, but the company is challenging that order in court. For Benjamin Denio, at the time a 36-year-old who worked in desktop support and did product testing at Defense Distributed, being able to produce your own plastic gun is a safeguard against the tyranny of the state. \u201cThe term I would use to describe the level of vitriol in the country,\u201d Denio said, \u201cis that it is the \u2018cold civil war.\u2019\u2009\u201dI was running into so many disgruntled people that I began to worry, as I dipped in and out of places, that I was inadvertently being drawn to angry people. I figured I would get a taste of Middle America by stopping in Russell, Kan., which I visited 20 years earlier when a local hero, Bob Dole, was the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Walking along the redbrick Main Street, I saw a crowd streaming out of a local theater. Inside, Christina Fowler, a pastor, had just finished services for her nondenominational congregation. Today was her son\u2019s birthday, and she invited me to a potluck lunch with the congregation in her backyard.Everyone sat at folding tables eating potato salad and lasagna. I sat with the associate pastor, Lonnie Whitten Jr., and a congregant named Cindy, who asked that her last name not be published. Whitten, who had a bushy ZZ Top beard and arms covered in tattoos, described himself as a reformed bad boy. This congregation, he said, was moving away from the culture of the \u201ccorporate church\u201d and also opposed same-sex marriage. Cindy had been part of a local delegation taken to San Diego for the 1996 Republican National Convention as living proof of Dole\u2019s hometown values. \u201cWe were treated like royalty!\u201d she said. Now 59, Cindy explained that too many ministers around the country watered down the true message of the Gospel, serving up baby food, not meat. And what was the real message? That homosexuality is a sin. That Islam is incompatible with Christianity.\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time when someone gives the signal,\u201d she told me of Muslims living in America, \u201cand we\u2019re all going to be beheaded.\u201dI ate some potato salad, a bit stunned.Living in Louisiana in the 1990s, I regularly visited the capital for stories about state politics. I thought back to 1991, when the white supremacist David Duke made it to a runoff in his gubernatorial campaign against Edwin Edwards, the former Democratic governor who was perpetually under investigation for corruption. \u201cVote for the Crook: It\u2019s Important,\u201d his supporters\u2019 bumper stickers read. (Years later, he was finally convicted.) Now Duke is running for the Senate, and his re-emergence has coincided with the racial splintering of Baton Rouge.On July 5, Alton Sterling was shot by the police as he sold CDs outside a convenience store. The police shooting of yet another black man, captured on video, became a national scandal. Twelve days later, a black veteran of the Marines shot six law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, killing three, including one who was black.One afternoon, Lionel Bazile Jr. picked me up at my hotel for a tour of the neighborhood where Sterling was killed. Bazile, a 66-year-old retired postman, is a Roman Catholic and a member of an interracial, interfaith coalition called Together Baton Rouge. It was founded about six years ago, after a prominent black pastor, Lee T. Wesley, led an outreach effort to some white ministers and community leaders because he felt the city was dangerously, if silently, divided. That split became clear when a predominantly white group of organizers in southern Baton Rouge sought to create their own school system and, ultimately, incorporate their own city, St. George. They needed a new school system, they argued, because the East Baton Rouge Parish schools were struggling. But carving out a wealthy area of Baton Rouge as a new municipality would have drained tax revenues from the surrounding city and gutted the funding for Baton Rouge public schools. The new municipality was also laid out to include the Mall of Louisiana, a major source of sales-tax revenue. Bazile, along with others from Together Baton Rouge, helped defeat the St. George movement, but the underlying problems had hardly gone away.\u201cNow we are crossing Florida Boulevard,\u201d Bazile told me as we rode in his truck. \u201cWe call Florida Boulevard the Mason-Dixon line that divides Baton Rouge.\u201dOnce we entered North Baton Rouge, the historically black section of the city, the road immediately became bumpier. According to Bazile, the neighborhood received only a small slice of the money from the citywide road-improvement project. \u201cYou are not going to see too many shopping centers around here,\u201d he said as we passed dilapidated strip malls. We drove by a hospital where the emergency room had been closed down. During our drive, I did not see a single national chain store.North Baton Rouge had apparently died from gradual abandonment. Most politicians ignored the neighborhood. When crime began to rise, Bazile\u2019s home was burglarized four times, and the value of his property began to depreciate. He and his family moved out, as did many middle-class black families. The Mall of Louisiana opened in the late 1990s near the city\u2019s predominantly white southern suburbs and soon became a magnet for more public and private investment. \u201cNorth Baton Rouge was dying,\u201d Bazile said, \u201cbut southern Baton Rouge was booming.\u201dBazile and I pulled into the parking lot of the Triple S Food Mart, where Sterling was killed. Someone had painted Sterling\u2019s image on the side of the store, and soggy bouquets of flowers and tributes lay piled on the pavement. Veda Washington-Abusaleh, one of Sterling\u2019s aunts, stood nearby with a protest poster rolled up in her hands. She told me she was out there every day. When I explained that I was a journalist, she began shouting. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing changed!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still the same. I can tell you what needs to change! White police officers need to be better trained.\u201d She pointed to the spot in the parking lot where activists and political leaders erected a stage in the days after the killing. \u201cRight where his blood stained the street,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt is a political thing for them. But I want justice.\u201dA lot of people did. Today, Baton Rouge is a reminder of the entrenched racial and economic segregation in many American cities. Nationally, stubborn disparities remain between whites and blacks as far as income, college-graduation levels and employment. The median adjusted income for white households was roughly $71,300 in 2014, compared with $43,300 for black ones. The median net worth of white households is about 13 times as high as that of black ones, according to the most recent figures from the Pew Research Center. John Logan, a sociologist at Brown University, told me that racially biased economic development is one reason these disparities remain entrenched. Black communities have been routinely passed over for commercial projects, like shopping malls, which attract other development projects and lift property values.On my last morning in Baton Rouge, I met Gary Chambers Jr., a black civil rights advocate and journalist who was a leader of the protests over the Sterling killing. We met at an IHOP, which Chambers picked because the franchise was black-owned. Chambers had become an outspoken advocate for North Baton Rouge and a blunt critic of the city\u2019s racial status quo. He blamed the police and politicians, including the city\u2019s black mayor. Chambers described his own agenda as being unabashedly \u201cpro-black.\u201d \u201cWe are supposed to live in this society where we want everybody to be a part of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd we do. But I live in Baton Rouge, and it\u2019s just not the case.\u201dTo Chambers, the Sterling killing was as much about economics as bad policing. \u201cWhy is Alton Sterling selling CDs in the middle of the night, outside a convenience store in the hood?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have economic opportunities in North Baton Rouge.\u201d When I mentioned Together Baton Rouge and the efforts to build deeper relationships between whites and blacks, Chambers chuckled softly and then paused a moment. \u201cThey are all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying.\u201dBut I could tell he was skeptical. He told me that it was time for the older generation to simply get out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m 31,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve been in office since the \u201980s and my community looks like this, then you have some blame. My generation is inheriting this. We didn\u2019t create this. So don\u2019t tell us how to feel about it.\u201dA week or so after I left Baton Rouge, the city flooded; some areas were inundated with six to eight feet of water. Parts of the region were declared disaster areas. After I sent a sympathy note to Broderick Bagert, an organizer of Together Baton Rouge, he wrote back: \u201cWe\u2019ll invite you back when the plague of locusts arrives, which I understand is expected to be next week.\u201dThis has pushed some low-income people onto the streets, or out of the city, and intensified the pressure on street people to move on, often to the Tenderloin and other commercial neighborhoods downtown. After three days in the city, Tom\u00e1s and I were dazed by what we had seen: drug addicts shooting up; two people engaging in oral sex, in broad daylight; a young woman vomiting on the sidewalk, unable to digest a donated pastry; homeless people camping on streets that reeked of urine; two old men, wheeling their possessions in dueling grocery carts, fighting midday on Market Street near the offices of Twitter, with one man waving a steel rod and the other swinging a bear knife until the police arrived.\u201cHomelessness issues are very real, but they are also very symbolic of so many other inequities and stressors that are happening in the city,\u201d Peter Cohen, an affordable-housing advocate, told me one morning. \u201cYou say, What\u2019s the problem? The tech economy is booming. Employment is up. It only becomes apparent when you drill down to the level of the neighborhood. We are struggling in San Francisco, to some extent, with the excesses of wealth that have concentrated here.\u201dIn the November elections, San Francisco has multiple local ballot initiatives related to homelessness (which has been a woefully nonexistent issue in the presidential campaign). There is also a battle over the rapidly expanding sharing economy, some of whose largest companies were started in the area. Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco, markets thousands of units in the city and spent heavily to defeat a local ballot initiative last November that would have severely restricted short-term rentals. In June, the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved some restrictions anyway, prompting a lawsuit from Airbnb. Whatever the outcome, the usual parameters of housing issues \u2014 say, tenants versus landlords \u2014 seem forever changed.Dale Carlson, a consultant who has played a central role in the political fight against Airbnb, said the sharing economy has contributed to the rise in rents and has encouraged some landlords to evict tenants and convert apartments to short-term rentals. (Advocates for house-sharing platforms say the rentals are vital in helping people make extra money to afford the high cost of living in the city.)\u201cIt\u2019s essentially, Who gets to live here?\u201d Carlson said of the political fight. \u201cAnd who is squeezed out?\u201dOne day, I drove down Highway 101 to Silicon Valley to meet Reid Hoffman, a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock and the chairman of LinkedIn, the professional-social-networking company, which was then in the process of being sold to Microsoft for $26.2 billion. Hoffman founded LinkedIn the same year I left for Beijing; now he was a billionaire. He is politically active, having supported and advised Obama and raised money for and donated money to Hillary Clinton. I mentioned how the election had become a referendum of sorts on globalization and trade, yet there had been little discussion about the next big earthquake \u2014 artificial intelligence, or the approaching world of self-driving cars, smartphones that can diagnose a melanoma and much more. Globalization may have ravaged blue-collar America, but artificial intelligence could cut through the white-collar professions in much the same way.Hoffman said the reactions to artificial intelligence range from utopian to dystopian. The utopians predict huge productivity gains and rapid advances in medicine, genetic sequencing, fighting climate change and other areas. The dystopians predict a \u201cRobocalypse\u201d in which machines supplant people and, possibly, threaten humanity itself. \u201cMy point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it is a massive transformation and does really impact the future of humanity, but that we can steer it more toward utopia rather than dystopia with intelligence and diligence.\u201dEither way, another major economic shift is coming, perhaps sooner than people realize. Hoffman said that many of the jobs in today\u2019s economy will change fundamentally during the next 20 years. On the same day I met with Hoffman, Uber announced a pilot program to test self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. It also bought a company developing self-driving trucks. \u201cWe have to make sure that we don\u2019t have a massive imbalance of society by which you have a small number of people that own the robots and everyone else is scrambling,\u201d he said.Back in the Tenderloin, I met with Del Seymour, a former drug dealer who runs a nonprofit organization called Code Tenderloin, in which he trains local low-income people for the job market. In recent years, the city had granted major tax breaks to companies that opened offices in the area, and Seymour offered tours to show tech workers their new neighborhood. I joined a small group from Zendesk, a cloud-based customer-service software company founded in Denmark whose headquarters are in the Tenderloin. Its employees had already done volunteer work with a local nonprofit organization, distributing clean syringes to local drug users to prevent the spread of AIDS. It was not the usual tech job.The tour ended inside the Cadillac Hotel. Jerry Garcia once lived there in the early 1960s, Muhammad Ali once sparred there, and it now has many subsidized rooms for low-income residents. Seymour asked the Zendesk employees to sit in the lobby and praised the company for its volunteer work. But then he pointed out that tech companies hire more than just techies \u2014 about 30 percent of the jobs, he said, did not require technical training. He told them how he was once one of the biggest dope dealers on Taylor Street. He had changed, however, and other people in the Tenderloin could, too. \u201cLet us in your back door,\u201d he said, his voice rising like that of a preacher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your food. We don\u2019t want your sympathy. We want jobs.\u201d\u201cThere will be fires tonight,\u201d Elaine Cromie said as we drove through the city streets. \u201cThat is for sure.\u201dCromie, a freelance news photographer, was giving me a tour of the city. Even though Detroit was out of bankruptcy and downtown boosters were pushing a resurgence narrative, the arson fires were still happening often enough that the local media had to pick and choose which ones to cover. \u201cIt\u2019s really only news if it is a hazardous-materials fire,\u201d she said.We turned onto Goldengate Street and parked near a few vacated houses. Trees still shaded the rotting homes where middle-class families once lived, before many of them walked away from bad mortgages. The emptiness of some streets reminded me of photographs of the depopulated, decaying buildings left behind after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. That part of Ukraine has been largely without people for 30 years and is now known as the Zone of Alienation, which seemed like a fitting phrase to describe parts of Detroit too.Five years back, the organizers of Occupy Detroit spent the winter on Goldengate, but the anticapitalist movement fizzled and the street today is mostly populated by hippies and squatters. It is, in fact, a counterculture oasis, known as Fireweed Universe-City. Cromie was looking for a guy who was supposed to connect us with a community leader, Doctor Bob, but instead we bumped into Zack Zduniak. Zduniak, 26, had simply checked out of mainstream America, which today\u2019s Detroit made possible.Zduniak grew up in suburban St. Clair Shores in an era of diminished prospects, while the local auto industry declined. He liked living off the grid, but it wasn\u2019t easy; he was sleeping with his cat in a friend\u2019s delivery truck. He worked part-time at a restaurant, sometimes foraged for berries and knew which churches gave out free food. Visitors turned up, often Europeans, some via couchsurfing.com, for a binge of partying or a voyeuristic taste of life on the antimaterialist fringe. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be involved in this crazy, consumerist society,\u201d he told me.Zduniak thought Doctor Bob could better represent the community, so we knocked on his door. Bob Pizzimenti is a chiropractor, urban farmer and the proprietor of the healing center and vegetarian cafe down the street, which was the only nearby outpost of private enterprise that I spotted. Everyone called him Doctor Bob. He bought his two-story brick house six years ago for $1,400 when others were fleeing. He liked that there were seemingly no rules in Detroit. He bought several empty lots around his house and planted corn and other vegetables on them. He wanted a different type of community, something new. He thought America had lost its way.Advertisement"}

It has also highlighted some fundamental truths about the United States circa 2016, lessons that political leaders should heed beyond Tuesday\u2019s elections.But Mr. Trump has outdone even Bernie Sanders in tapping this anxiety. While economic worries cut across all demographic lines, he has gotten away with exploiting the real concerns by attacking immigrants and trade agreements, but offering no cogent policies for creating good jobs and lifting wages. His economic and tax proposals would hurt ordinary workers and blow a hole through the federal budget. By contrast, Hillary Clinton has offered practical ideas that could improve the economic situation for most Americans.These proposals are a powerful response to the anti-government zealots who have hogtied Congress into inaction on anything besides futile, partisan investigations. For deeply frustrated citizens, this end run around political dysfunction may be the only way to move the country forward.Advertisement"}

Trump says in a rascally conspiratorial half-whisper. \u201cWatch what I do when the crowd gets bored.\u201dMr. Trump is never more cocksure than when he\u2019s talking about his sway over his supporters. He takes the stage in Macon, Ga., to applause from 6,000 people. But before long they grow listless as he complains about the news media. Then, without any warning, Mr. Trump veers wildly to a new subject.\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall,\u201d he said, \u201cand Mexico\u2019s going to pay for it! Believe me!\u201dMaking the powerless feel powerful: that talent helped sustain Mr. Trump during middling periods in his campaign, like late last fall when the Macon rally took place, and it remained crucial to his appeal through the primaries and into the general election. For men and women who feel left behind by the economy, left behind by politicians, left behind by a changing country \u2014 left behind, period \u2014 Mr. Trump says that \u201cwe\u201d can make everything great again. And the implications are clear: \u201cWe\u201d will make others \u201cpay\u201d whatever price or burdens we dictate, be they Mexicans, illegal immigrants, Muslims, and countless others.When the history of the 2016 presidential race is written, there will be many answers to one central question: Why, to paraphrase Mr. Trump from January, could he stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose voters? A sizable fraction of the electorate stuck by him for much of 2016 in spite of countless controversies, including the nine women who accused him in October of forcing himself on them.Hatred of Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t the whole story. For many people, Mr. Trump held an undeniable magnetism, and it wasn\u2019t because they were all racist or sexist or otherwise \u201cdeplorable.\u201dMr. Trump, an inveterate showman, believed that the star on stage always needed to give a \u201cbig league\u201d performance, as he put it in another interview with The Times. And he was determined to live up to his billing.All presidential candidates lavish interest, attention, and time on voters, of course. But no nominee has ever been famous like Mr. Trump. He became a candidate in an era when celebrity commanded the attention of many Americans who are otherwise distracted by working two jobs, struggling with bills, and just trying to keep their head above water. People heed when Lady Gaga or Beyonc\u00e9 drops a new album; we watch the Super Bowl, we go see Star Wars, we share videos that captivate our attention. When Mr. Trump appeared on television, ratings spiked. When he came to town for a rally, the numbers were, compared to a usual politician\u2019s draw, yuge, to put it in the Trump vernacular.Those rallies were critical to minting Mr. Trump as a top-tier candidate. Like a hit Broadway show, he became a \u201cword-of-mouth phenomenon\u201d that people were willing to line up to see, as he said in the spring. Even when he won the Republican nomination, he said he wouldn\u2019t stop holding the rallies: They were critical to his appeal and a big part of what voters loved about him.By mid-August, though, the rallies seemed like they would be Mr. Trump\u2019s undoing. He kept undercutting his own political message by going off script at his rallies with caustic attacks on Mrs. Clinton, a Gold Star family, and even fellow Republicans. The arrival of Teleprompters helped keep him on point for a few weeks, but eventually he unraveled again, criticizing a former beauty pageant winner for several days in October.With his fusillade of attacks, his rants on Twitter, his complaints that the election is rigged again, Mr. Trump seemed to shrink in stature, not grow. The days of making the powerless feel powerful suddenly seemed long ago. Now it was about making the powerless feel as resentful as he did. Any politician can do that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Globalism: A Far-Right Conspiracy Theory Buoyed by Trump", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump\u2019s election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media, the banks and the government.President-elect Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word: globalism.It is a word that conjures many images, none of them good: shuttered factories, unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that, believers say, controls the economy and the media.Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the president-elect. They say it carries multiple meanings \u2014 from benign to sinister \u2014 and often serves as a \u201cdog whistle\u201d for racist, anti-Semitic and antigovernment conspiracy theorists.\u201cGlobalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the United States,\u201d said Ryan Lenz, the editor of Hatewatch, a blog published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cIt is the enemy, ultimately.\u201dGlobalism is often used as a synonym for globalization, the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions, environmental organizations and opponents of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But for the far right, the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, according to Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League.Lauren Southern, a host on the right-wing Canadian media site Rebel Media, explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in September. She said the word meant rule by autocrats \u2014 such as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and the United Nations \u2014 who value \u201cthe false flag of diversity\u201d and \u201cunchecked immigration from the third world.\u201d\u201cGlobalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition, disdain national culture, laugh at religion and generally despise the West while holding a creepy affection for the third world,\u201d she added. \u201cThey want open borders, cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions, and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it.\u201dA list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.He has been called \u201cthe most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among his claims: the Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an inside job.Mr. Jones posted his own definition of globalism to YouTube in 2014. In his trademark shout, he described it as a \u201cglobal digital panopticon control system\u201d engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites. He called it \u201cthe total form of slavery.\u201dThe host, who has enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump, hailed the Republican as a \u201cGeorge Washington-level\u201d historical figure. Mr. Trump, who appeared on his show last year, has in turn heaped praise upon Mr. Jones.So what is Mr. Trump talking about when he talks about globalism? His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, provided a definition in an email before the election last week:\u201cAn economic and political ideology which puts allegiance to international institutions ahead of the nation-state; seeks the unrestricted movement of goods, labor and people across borders; and rejects the principle that the citizens of a country are entitled to preference for jobs and other economic considerations as a virtue of their citizenship.\u201dFar-right groups in the United States began to refer to globalism at the end of the Cold War, when it replaced communism as an idea that was an ever-present danger to the nation, Mr. Pitcavage said. They have also referred to it as the New World Order, and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere.The shape of that conspiracy had distinctly anti-Semitic overtones, in part because many of communism\u2019s foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to Judaism, Mr. Pitcavage said. Members of the far right became fixated on prominent Jews like the businessman and philanthropist George Soros.The term\u2019s multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool, and Mr. Trump\u2019s and his allies\u2019 frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience.\u201cAnti-globalism is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right\u201d from the mainstream to the extreme, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.Professor Levin called globalism \u201cthe defining folklore and narrative for the racist right\u201d but said it had also \u201cbecome a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the United States is perceived to be in.\u201dConspiratorial talk has continued after the election. Mr. Trump referred to a plot against him again last Thursday, when he complained on Twitter that anti-Trump protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters. Lou Dobbs, a Trump ally and host on Fox Business News, later accused Mr. Soros of \u201cinciting riots.\u201dMany on the far right have celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy.Last Friday, Mr. Jones claimed on YouTube that Mr. Trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon. Ms. Hicks, the Trump campaign\u2019s spokeswoman, did not reply to an email seeking comment late Sunday night.Mr. Jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important: the coming destruction of \u201cthe globalists that hijacked the country,\u201d primarily the news media and international business people. Soon they would be destroyed once and for all, he suggested.\u201cThis is America battling back to restore humanity and to break the chains,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not gonna be any d\u00e9tente.

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Proved to Be Sign of Things to Come in U.S.", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump\u2019s victory was hailed by European far-right leaders, including the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban. And there were immediate concerns about how the anti-elitist surge will affect other European votes, and how a Trump presidency might respond to a post-Brexit Britain.Mr. Trump\u2019s victory may also help former President Nicolas Sarkozy in his difficult battle for the right\u2019s nomination for the presidency against the more centrist former prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 this month, which is likely to be the first political indicator of the impact.\u201cIt will feed into the process in France,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a French analyst. \u201cMarine Le Pen actually looks sensible by comparison, and the one who will look most like Trump is Sarkozy.\u201dThose like Mr. Farage who want a sharp break with the European Union also took heart that after President Obama said that Britain would be \u201cat the back of the queue\u201d for a bilateral trade deal, Mr. Trump promised that Britain would \u201ccertainly not be at the back of the queue, that I can tell you.\u201dOn Monday in North Carolina, Mr. Trump told a rally: \u201cIt will be an amazing day. It will be called \u2018Brexit plus plus plus!\u2019 You know what I mean?\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Many Americans might not have known what he meant. But Britons and Europeans understood immediately.Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union sent tremors through the political and financial system and the center-left news media. It was a blow to the betting markets and to the pollsters. It was a rejection of the governing political class. And it was delivered by older, working-class voters in areas of Britain hit hard by globalization, angered by immigration and anxious about their nation\u2019s identity in a borderless world.\u201cAt first blush, the parallels with Brexit are uncanny,\u201d said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a research institution in London. \u201cI heard older voters in Florida saying that they \u2018wanted their country back again,\u2019 almost exactly the same language\u201d used in England and Wales.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer \u2018the economy, stupid,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018identity, stupid,\u2019\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cWhat we are seeing here is what we saw in the Brexit referendum, which is that identity and cultural politics are even bigger determinants of people\u2019s politics than we thought possible.\u201dJohn Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, said he saw a similarity in the confrontation among classes. \u201cThe divide between the liberal, the educated and the young versus the older and undereducated has been an important factor in both the U.S. elections and Brexit,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s the rebellion of the Rust Belt,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bigger, broader message to the elites is, \u2018Hey, guys, a large portion of the public is rebelling against the consequences of globalization.\u2019\u201dThe big question for Europe is whether its leaders will finally recognize that Brexit supporters and other nationalists might have a point. \u201cThe continued insistence on linking free trade with free movement of immigration will increasingly come under democratic pressure,\u201d Mr. Curtice said.Despite the euphoria on the far right, some observers said the shock over the British vote and the Trump victory might bring \u201can element of soberness to Europe and make it harder rather than easier for populists to win,\u201d Mr. Niblett said.\u201cThis is a wake-up call for European leaders,\u201d said Guy Verhofstadt, the president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who will help prepare the European Union\u2019s negotiations with Britain. \u201cDonald Trump has declared several times that our priorities are not his.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump pulls back from his campaign stands, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cthose with an interest to undermine and destabilize NATO and Europe will be emboldened.\u201dAnd she worried about another possible parallel to Brexit in the rise of hate crimes and discrimination against foreigners and nonwhite Britons that followed the referendum.While the parallels are real, said Jan Techau, the director of the Richard C.

{"Headline": "Mexico Awaits Trump\u2019s Next Move", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 On Nov. 8, this mountain capital was soaked by a ferocious off-season thunderstorm, the type of tempest that can lead to jokes about the Aztec rain god Tlaloc being angry. At the same time, over the Rio Grande, a political storm raged worthy of the deity\u2019s fury: The United States elected a president who promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it, deport millions of immigrants and rewrite or rip up a trade deal that Mexico depends on for almost a third of its income. Within hours, an economic storm also seemed to be brewing, with the peso losing value at the fastest rate since the \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of 1994.The rise of Donald J. Trump to the presidency could potentially be the greatest foreign policy challenge to Mexico for generations. The actions that Mr. Trump has called for, such as slapping 35 percent tariffs on cars made in Mexico, could push this nation of 120 million into recession. Deporting millions more here could increase unemployment and crime. Moreover, Mr. Trump could change the basic nature of a relationship that has endured since World War II from one of peace and trade to one of bullying and conflict.The phrase \u201ccould potentially\u201d is key. Since the election, analysts here have all been trying to predict what a Trump presidency will actually do, and whether it will or won\u2019t be what he said \u2014 whatever that is. Indeed, much of what he has said regarding Mexico is highly ambiguous.Mr. Trump has veered from calling for a \u201cdeportation force\u201d against all undocumented migrants to a program of sending back criminals, which is in fact the current policy. He has pushed for a wall along the entire border, but more recently he has talked about merely extending the existing fences, and hasn\u2019t offered a realistic plan for Mexico to pay. And there is a lot of wiggle room in a revamping of the North American Free Trade Agreement.And of course, there are limits to what Mr. Trump can do alone; Congress, the courts and business will all have much to say on all these issues, and could well force him to take a more moderate position.But even if none of these things happen, there\u2019s the underlying question of whether Mr. Trump will continue to use Mexico as a punching bag. Perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s position will merely lead to a \u201cphony war\u201d of words, rather than a real diplomatic or trade conflict. But perhaps it will cause major turmoil. While bullying and punishing Mexico may play to Mr. Trump\u2019s base, it would not only cause pain south of the river, but would also bring the United States more problems.The call to make Mexico pay for the wall is a particularly salient issue. Not only does the United States command an economy that is 10 times the size of Mexico\u2019s, but there is a blatant absurdity in extorting another country to pay for your own building. The demand, shouted at rallies, seems to seek more to humiliate Mexico than to actually secure funding. Such bravado helped Mr. Trump win the election, but as a real foreign policy goal, it could gain nothing and cause deep antagonism.Mexico and the United States haven\u2019t always been at peace. They clashed repeatedly in the 19th and early 20th century, mostly to Mexico\u2019s loss. American troops raised their flag in Mexico City in the Mexican-American War, before securing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which gave the United States almost half of Mexico\u2019s territory. In 1914, American troops returned to bombard and occupy the port of Veracruz. Gen. Francisco Villa, better known to history as Pancho Villa, stormed over the border into Columbus, N.M., in 1916, and in 1938, Mexico expropriated American oil companies.In 1969, President Richard M. Nixon unleashed Operation Intercept, under which every vehicle crossing the border was searched as a way to pressure Mexico to spray poison on marijuana and opium poppy crops. In 1985, corrupt Mexican policemen worked with cartel members to kidnap and murder an American agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Enrique Camarena.Yet these disputes never changed the fundamental nature of the bilateral relationship or stopped trade between the two countries from rising steadily to more than half a trillion dollars last year. And during this time, Mexico and the United States have coordinated on many actions, from disaster relief (the Mexican Navy helped after Hurricane Katrina) to sharing river water.In 2014, a record number of unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras arrived on America\u2019s southern border, causing what the White House called an \u201curgent humanitarian situation.\u201d The flow ebbed only when Mexico stepped up its own detentions of Central Americans. After human rights groups criticized these mass arrests, Mexico has promised to make it easier for the Central Americans, many who have fled brutal gang violence, to gain asylum.However, trying to force Mexico to pay for a border wall, or slapping on tariffs that would savage its economy, could fracture this cooperation. Mexico may be smaller than the United States, but it is still a major economic and political power. If Mr. Trump pushes too far, it could hit back with its own tariffs that hurt American exporters. It would see no incentive to reduce the flow of migrants and refugees from other countries to the United States. And pushing Mexico into recession may only make more people here pick up and head north anyway.As much as Mr. Trump seems to like abusing Mexico and its people, President Trump would be wise to try a different tack.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Make Bullish Bet on Trump, and an Era of Tax Cuts and Spending", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byTwo weeks after Donald J. Trump swept to victory, investors from around the world are betting that his promises of tax cuts, fewer regulations and a spendthrift federal government can recharge the American economy.This burst of exuberance sent the major markets to record highs on Monday, as investors continued to pull out of government bond funds whose yields are miserly. The momentum has shown few signs of slowing and has resulted in significant flows of money being poured into United States stocks.For that reason, many economists have warned that the downside to a Trump-inspired revival of the United States economy is a spate of calamities in emerging markets, as investors head quickly for the exit.The recent euphoria stands in sharp contrast to Wall Street\u2019s prediction, before the election, of market mayhem if Mr. Trump were to win. The view had been that his unpredictable ways would spook the financial world, not least his threat to rip up trade agreements with Mexico and fight China on its exports to the United States.After a sharp but very brief slide in Asian trading on election night, when it became clear that Mr. Trump would win, markets rallied quickly as the Trump economic agenda was quickly assessed.\u201cOnce this thing starts, you will see people piling on and the prosperity will blow you away,\u201d said Arthur Laffer, a lower-tax evangelist who advised Mr. Reagan on economic policy and is doing the same with Mr. Trump.Mr. Laffer said little about the budget deficits and the surge in debt that resulted from Reagan-era policies. But his ebullience mirrors the mood in the markets as investors choose to set aside gloomier notions and bet instead on a jamboree in stocks that will \u2014 they hope \u2014 be supported by a Trump-style economic boom.At the root of the postelection reappraisal, economists and investors contend, is the view that Republican control of the Senate and House, as well as the White House, will put an end to the divisive politics of the Obama years that prevented his administration from taking more direct steps to stimulate the economy.Moreover, political analysts point to the fact that while Democrats have been criticizing the president-elect on many fronts, on the one subject investors have rallied around the most \u2014 infrastructure spending \u2014 there has been broad agreement with the president-elect.When it comes to market rallies, this one does not match the record set during President Obama\u2019s first term, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 84.5 percent. If the markets were to duplicate that gain during a Trump administration, the S.&.P. 500 would have to be over 4,000 by late January 2021, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The Obama stock market boom was fueled by an unprecedented period of central bank activism in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. Central bankers around the world flooded markets with easy liquidity that flowed into every type of financial asset.With interest rates on the rise and inflation picking up, central banks are now in retreat. That means that the Trump administration will need fiscal policy \u2014 government spending and tax cuts \u2014 rather than relying on the Federal Reserve.Still, on Monday, four major measures of the stock market reached record highs.The benchmark S.&P. 500 closed up 16.3 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,198.18. The S.&P. is now up about 3 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.47 percent on Monday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended up 0.89 percent. The Russell 2000, a benchmark of companies with smaller market values, ended the day up 0.50 percent.It was the first time since Dec. 31, 1999, when stocks were still enjoying the dot-com boom, that the Dow, the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 reached highs on the same day, according to Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. All but the Russell, however, had previously reached record highs together on the same day just last August.Shares of energy companies led the stock market rally on Monday as oil prices climbed nearly 4 percent to a three-week high. Marathon Petroleum surged nearly 9 percent, Chesapeake Energy rose 7 percent, ConocoPhillips ended up 3.6 percent, and Exxon Mobil closed up 1.42 percent.In recent years, a low oil price has signaled fears of global stagnation and deflation and the worry that hamstrung governments were not in a position to stimulate growth.Now, in contrast to past decades when a high oil price would spark worries about inflation, its trend upward is being seen as a positive, perhaps heralding a move by governments around the world to spend more to lift their economies.Like all stock market upticks, this one has been driven by sharp inflows of money. Not least from investors who had been seeking safety from uncertainty, political and otherwise, in government bonds. In the last 10 years, $1.5 trillion has moved into bond mutual funds, according to Merrill Lynch, while little has been able to stick in the stock market.Now, as optimism spreads about Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda, investors are pulling out of their bond funds and buying stocks that benefit when the economy turns around, like commercial banks.\u201cInvestors are experiencing what I call FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at the research firm CFRA. \u201cThey are playing catch-up.\u201dWhile he describes the recent run as impressive, he also points out that potential disappointments are lurking.\u201cThis will be more of a challenge than people are now thinking,\u201d Mr. Stovall said, referring to the high hopes for infrastructure spending. \u201cThe Republican Congress is still relatively conservative, so for every dollar of spending they will be asking for cutbacks, because our debt is already approaching 100 percent of G.D.P.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about investors\u2019 exuberance over potential economic growth under the incoming administration misidentified whom Democrats broadly agree with on infrastructure spending. It is the president-elect, not the president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "William Trevor, Spare Chronicler of Diminished Lives", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byAn AppraisalHe didn\u2019t start writing until he was in his early 30s, after failing to make a living as a sculptor and woodcarver. He quickly made up for lost time and went on to publish nearly 20 novels and more than a thousand pages\u2019 worth of short stories, which will almost certainly be his lasting legacy. (In England, he was also well-known for his television screenplays and adaptations, including one of Dickens\u2019s \u201cThe Old Curiosity Shop.\u201d)He was mostly self-taught, and all of his writing retained a kind of sculptural solidity, spare and well polished. There were no metaphors, no Nabokovian special effects, no authorial introspection. Mr. Trevor seldom used the first person, or even the limited third person that confines itself to the inside of a single character\u2019s head. He was an old-fashioned, omniscient author, a storyteller. One of his stories even begins, \u201cOnce upon a time.\u201dHis style was so pure and uncluttered that when he first came on the scene, in the mid-1960s, it almost seemed radical.What interested Mr. Trevor was not himself but his world, or two worlds, really: England and Ireland, though he never fully belonged to either. He wasn\u2019t, like Yeats or Wilde, born to the Anglo-Irish gentry. His family was middle-class, and he grew up a Protestant in the Catholic south of Ireland, where he was, inevitably, an outsider.He lived most of his adult life in London and then Devon, but his writing toggles back and forth between the countries, with roughly half his fiction set in each. Mr. Trevor\u2019s England in many ways resembles that of V. S. Pritchett, his only real rival as a master of the British short story. There are the same lonely bed-sits, rundown boardinghouses, cheerless cafes.The difference is that Mr. Pritchett\u2019s world is enlivened by his cheerful embrace of eccentricity, while Mr. Trevor\u2019s London is drabber, sadder, a place of widows and widowers, blighted romances, unraveling relationships. It would be a depressing place to read about if Mr. Trevor didn\u2019t describe it with such care and fondness. He never pitied or condescended to his solitaries; instead, he loved and understood them.Mr. Trevor\u2019s Ireland is just as lonely, or even lonelier, than his England, and additionally burdened by the weight of the past, which is always tugging his characters backward. There are occasional topical references in these stories, snatches of pop songs or allusions to the Troubles, but many of them take place in a changeless, timeless Ireland where ancient patterns and identities are always asserting themselves.\u201cThe Ballroom of Romance,\u201d for example, one of Mr. Trevor\u2019s most famous stories, is about a rural Irish dance hall where solitary men and women, most pushing middle age, go every Saturday night in hope of finding love, and leave with the certainty that nothing will ever change.The title characters of \u201cThe Hill Bachelors\u201d are Irish farmers tied to the land by an inheritance of guilt and obligation. They yearn to be married, but the available women all want to live in town, not in some dreary cottage with a turf fire.So many of the stories are set in this sort of eternal past that it\u2019s often hard to tell a story written in the \u201960s, say, from one written in the \u201980s or \u201990s. He found his voice right at the beginning, and it didn\u2019t evolve much, except for getting a little darker.Here, for example, is the beginning of a story called \u201cThe Piano Tuner\u2019s Wives,\u201d which lays everything out \u2014 two marriages and an entire social world \u2014 in just a couple of brisk sentences:\u201cViolet married the piano tuner when he was a young man. Belle married him when he was old. There was a little more to it than that, because in choosing Violet to be his wife the piano tuner had rejected Belle, which was something everyone remembered when the second wedding was announced.\u201dLike so many Trevor stories, this one is about loss and diminishment but ends with a moment of wry understanding and forgiveness: \u201cBelle would win in the end because the living always do. And that seemed fair also, since Violet had won in the beginning and had had the better years.\u201dWriting like this is the real source of Mr. Trevor\u2019s greatness: at once familiar and magisterial, polished and unassuming, every word clicking into place as surely as a key fitting a lock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Against China Might Be a Fight Trump Couldn\u2019t Win", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWho gains from a trade war with China?At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Peru over the weekend, one of the biggest questions was whether Donald J. Trump, as the next president, would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against Beijing, dragging the United States into a tit-for-tat confrontation with the world\u2019s second-largest economy.No such war has begun, yet it seems clear that the United States has already lost. China has been steadily gaining in the global economic system.Waging war against globalization, America is making China\u2019s case. Eswar Prasad, a former head of the Chinese division at the International Monetary Fund, argues that \u201cover the long term China comes out a winner no matter what.\u201dChina\u2019s economy would surely suffer if the United States were to impose a 45 percent tariff on nearly $500 billion worth of Chinese imports. The United States absorbs only 16 percent of Chinese exports, but it is China\u2019s healthiest export market. Fears of American protectionism are already stoking capital flight from China.And that may not even be the worst part. Circling the wagons around the American border plays directly into China\u2019s hands in other ways.Washington would be cast as the villain in the fight. No matter how many tricks the Chinese government might deploy against American interests, it would remain the victim in the eyes of many nations, a champion for the cause of open rules-based trade.Even if Mr. Trump is just bluffing, as many of his allies say, to gain leverage in some future negotiation, much of the damage has been done. His bluster has changed the perception of the role the United States will play in the world.In the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries \u2014 like Britain and France \u2014 China has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of globalized capitalism.\u201cChina is the one major power still talking about increased integration,\u201d said Nicholas Lardy, a China specialist at the Peterson Institute. \u201cChina is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that globalization brings benefits.\u201d And that is the United States\u2019 loss.A great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy. By turning inward \u2014 a move already reinforced by the rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 the United States appears to have little to offer.Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, conveyed that point only a few days after the American election by saying that his nation would work to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \u2014 a Chinese initiative among 16 Asian and Pacific countries that excludes the United States \u2014 and would support Beijing\u2019s proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific. Ditto for Peru and Chile, which, according to a senior Chinese official in Lima, are also now seeking to join the Chinese trade initiative.\u201cAlmost certainly every economy in the Asian region sees its future lying more closely linked with China,\u201d Mr. Prasad, the former I.M.F. official, told me. \u201cWith Trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for protection, it will be tough for Asian countries to resist China\u2019s embrace.\u201dAnd if Washington\u2019s actions against China start to disrupt Asia\u2019s supply chains, the United States could quickly become the region\u2019s economic pariah.The question is, to what purpose? It can\u2019t simply be about stopping currency manipulation. That\u2019s an outdated fear. Instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its exports, China has spent about $1 trillion lately to prop up the value of the renminbi in the face of capital flight. If it stopped, the currency would drop like a stone, enhancing China\u2019s trade competitiveness.Moreover, slapping trade barriers against China would do little to narrow the American trade deficit. American companies building things in China wouldn\u2019t bring much manufacturing home; in most cases they would go to some other country with cheap labor. And to the extent they did \u201creshore\u201d production, most of it would be highly automated, employing few additional Americans.\u201cIt does not make economic sense for Trump to want to balance trade with China,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBalanced trade doesn\u2019t bring back jobs.\u201dInitially, Mr. Trump might look like a winner, resolute in his defense of the working class. But any increase in popularity would be unlikely to last as the consequences started to become apparent.Washington has already been playing a relatively weak hand trying to contain China\u2019s influence. China has skillfully deployed investments to win over countries from Africa to Latin America, broadening its network of influence. Its proposed Asian infrastructure bank proceeded, despite opposition from the Obama administration, after Britain and other American allies jumped on board.\u201cChina is becoming a leading member of the international community,\u201d Mr. Prasad wrote in his new book \u201cGaining Currency,\u201d but not, \u201cas the West prefers, by being co-opted into existing institutions under the current rules of the game.\u201d Instead, China is \u201cco-opting other countries into the system of rules it wants to dictate.\u201dMr. Trump just gave China\u2019s alternative system of rules a big push forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Unfinished Presidency: Obama Passes the Baton", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byWhite House Letter\u201cBecause of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America,\u201d the new president-elect vowed.But as the nation prepares to choose President Obama\u2019s successor on Tuesday, the bold agenda he described that morning remains incomplete. What Mr. Obama discovered \u2014 and what his successor will learn \u2014 is that every presidency lasts for only a brief moment in time.\u201cThere is a lot of unfinished business,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader from South Dakota, a longtime supporter of Mr. Obama. \u201cThe satisfaction comes in knowing that he has changed the landscape in a very profound way. The frustration comes in knowing what might have been.\u201dJen Psaki, the White House communications director, said that Mr. Obama had always understood he was part of a continuum. \u201cHe recognizes that who he passes the baton to will have a huge impact on whether you build on the progress he made,\u201d she said.White House aides point to what they call the highlights of that progress: digging the country out of a deep economic recession, rescuing the auto industry, extending health insurance to 20 million people, pressing the world to confront climate change, reducing America\u2019s combat role in two overseas wars.But for a president who won the highest office in the land by promising big, sweeping change, Tuesday\u2019s election is a reminder that it will be up to someone else to complete the change he long envisioned.Health care may be the most important example. Passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 drastically reshaped the insurance markets in the country, improving access to medical care. But even Democrats agree that much more needs to be done to improve the cost and quality of that care.\u201cIf this was a football field, I\u2019d put us on the 30-yard line with 70 yards to go,\u201d said Mr. Daschle, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first pick for secretary of health and human services but withdrew after questions about his taxes.\u201cThat latitude has worked for us,\u201d Mr. Daschle said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Trump presidency, it could work against us.\u201dBut the international agreements Mr. Obama helped forge will play out over decades. It could be years before his environmental regulations are in place, if ever. It will be up to future presidents to navigate the politics of climate change, around the world and here at home.\u201cObama has set the stage for both effective domestic and global climate protection,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. \u201cBut most of the heaviest lifting is going to be done by his successor, especially regarding domestic politics.\u201dMs. Psaki said the fact that large, developing countries like India and China are addressing climate change is \u201ca tremendous step forward\u201d that Mr. Obama can claim credit for. \u201cAround the world, a number of countries have cemented their goals. It\u2019s not a flash in the pan.\u201dAnd yet, Mr. Obama will have long since left office by the time the United States reaches its deadline to significantly reduce carbon emissions in 2025. And much of the rest of the world has pledged to reach its climate goals by 2030, in the fourth presidential term from now.Mr. Obama concluded his remarks in Grant Park by talking about a 106-year-old African-American woman, Ann Nixon Cooper, who had cast her ballot in Atlanta. He wondered aloud what changes his daughters would see in America if they lived to be the same age. It was, in a sense, a recognition that the consequences of his time in office would be shaped by others long after he left.\u201cWhat change will they see?

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Reels After Trump\u2019s Election", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley\u2019s luminaries woke up Wednesday morning to a darkened new global order, one that the ceaseless optimism of their tech-powered visions seemed suddenly unable to conquer.\u201cThe horror, the horror,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist at the firm Sherpa Capital who, like just about every leading light in tech, had strongly supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThere were too many people in the tech industry who were complacent. They waited and waited and waited to get engaged in this election. And now we have this nightmare.\u201dOthers were more succinct in their devastation. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of the corporate messaging service Slack.For some, buried in the visceral reaction was also a realization that the tech industry\u2019s relationship with government \u2014 not to mention the public \u2014 looks bound to shift in a fundamental way.Mr. Trump\u2019s win promises to rip apart that relationship. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during the interminable campaign that led to his victory. Mr. Trump promised to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon, repeatedly vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States, and then called for a boycott of the company when it challenged the government\u2019s order to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration plans are anathema to just about every company in tech.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft offered no immediate comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s win, or how the new administration\u2019s stated policy goals would affect their businesses.But it seems clear that a shift is in the offing. Leaders of these behemoths have long spoken in ambitious, gauzy sentimentalities about a broadly progressive future. Their goals weren\u2019t simply financial but, they said, philosophical and democratic \u2014 they wanted to make money, sure, but they also wanted to make the world a better place, to offer a kind of social justice through code. Theirs was a tomorrow powered by software instead of factories, and offering a kind of radical connectivity that they promised would lead to widespread peace and prosperity.In private, during the campaign, many tech leaders were positive that their vision would prevail over Mr. Trump\u2019s. When asked about whether they were preparing in any way for a Trump victory, bigwigs at many of the industry\u2019s leading tech and financial firms were bemused by the notion. They thought it would never happen.The deeper worry is that tech is out of step with the national and global mood, and failed to recognize the social and economic anxieties roiling the nation \u2014 many of them hastened by the products the industry devises.And then you get to the economic problems. Unlike previous economic miracles, the tech boom has not led to widespread employment. Much of the wealth generated by the five biggest American tech companies flows to young liberals in California and the Pacific Northwest, exactly the sort of \u201cglobal elites\u201d Mr. Trump railed against in his campaign.\u201cWe need to figure out how to connect more Americans to the economic engine of technology,\u201d said John Lilly, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners.On Wednesday, some in Silicon Valley worried about their disconnection from the mass of voters who chose Mr. Trump.\u201cIn tech, we need scale, so we look at the world through the lens of aggregate metrics like page views, active users and even revenue,\u201d Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of a start-up called Mattermark, wrote in an email. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we understand the people on the other side of the screen as individuals. That\u2019s the danger, and the opportunity.\u201dOthers weren\u2019t as high-flying, but were nevertheless resolute.Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, an online document storage company, suggested that the tech industry promote specific policy issues.\u201cTo shift to an economy driven by innovation from tech-enabled businesses, we need to get ahead on the issues we\u2019ve been talking about in Silicon Valley for years, like education, patent reform and immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, minus taxes and some tax repatriation issues, much about Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been antithetical to most of the big businesses that are driving the economy.\u201dMark Suster, a venture capitalist at Upfront Ventures, echoed the idea.\u201cTech needs to take a deep breath, and then reflect on how this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd have policy proposals that can realistically address the inequality in our country.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.comKatie Benner contributed reporting.Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Poised to Get Grammy Awards Back in 2018", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byAfter a hiatus of more than a decade, the Grammy Awards are expected to return to New York in 2018, several people familiar with the city\u2019s bid to lure the ceremony from Los Angeles said.The decision caps months of talks between the de Blasio administration and the Recording Academy to bring the 60th Annual Grammy Awards to the city \u2014 an effort that included a burst of last-minute fund-raising from business leaders.The hurdle in returning to New York this time around was the price tag: The Recording Academy said that producing the awards in New York would cost several million dollars over what it cost in Los Angeles; changing the venue would require bridging that gap.Another factor in Los Angeles\u2019s favor: The Staples Center had been designed to accommodate the Grammys, a key factor in keeping the ceremony there.A formal announcement regarding the 2018 ceremony, which will take place at Madison Square Garden, was expected to be made in the coming weeks by Mayor Bill de Blasio, but those involved in the negotiations and various members of the host committee have been informed of the impending move.\u201cThis is going to be incredible for this city,\u201d said Daniel Glass, a member of the Grammys host committee assembled by city officials, and the chief executive of Glassnote, an independent music label based in New York that represents artists including Phoenix, Chvrches and Childish Gambino.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was official until a few days ago; I found out from the mayor\u2019s office,\u201d Mr. Glass added.Neda Azarfar, a spokeswoman for the Recording Academy, said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled the Recording Academy is in extensive discussions to return the Grammy Awards to N.Y.C.\u201d in 2018.On Wednesday, the academy and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment are hosting a dinner in New York to \u201cdiscuss the return of the Grammys\u201d to the city in 2018, according to an invitation sent to the host committee members.Rosemary Boeglin, a spokeswoman for the mayor, also declined to confirm the move back to New York, saying the city hoped for \u201ca formal decision soon.\u201d\u201cAfter a 15-year absence,\u201d Ms. Boeglin continued, \u201cwe\u2019re confident New York City is the rightful home for the Grammys\u2019 60th anniversary.\u201dJon Patricof, another host committee member and the former president of the Tribeca Film Festival, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate in New York, but I think we\u2019re always looking to have those signature award shows that bring industries together. Having the Grammys back will be just terrific for us.\u201dCoaxing the awards back to New York has involved months of quiet but intensive behind-the-scenes wrangling by the de Blasio administration, not often known for its promotion of marquee events that attract major corporate sponsorship. No announcement of the effort was made, in part because for many months it was not clear it would succeed.The city plays no formal role in hosting the event; no public money or tax incentives were granted as part of enticing the show to return, City Hall officials said.The Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, viewing the awards as an economic boon, helped to line up sponsors like Adidas, secured monetary commitments from city business leaders and worked with a key union \u2014 Local One of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 on labor concessions for the ceremony, two people familiar with the negotiations said.The effort began early this year with Julie Menin, the commissioner of the office of media and entertainment, traveling to Los Angeles to begin talks with the Recording Academy.But even after New York City officials believed they had covered the added cost \u2014 with sponsorships and presold luxury suites in Madison Square Garden \u2014 the academy said it would require more than $2 million in additional contributions, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City and a member of the host committee.The solution was an 11th-hour push in early November to secure promises of donations from the host committee, made up of business and civic leaders as well as music and clothing companies.\u201cThe partnership considers this an important investment in the New York City economy,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.With commitments to help cover the additional costs should the event be relocated, the Recording Academy appeared poised to go ahead with the move, Ms. Wylde said.A spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden declined a request for comment. The union\u2019s president did not respond to a message seeking comment.Daniel L. Doctoroff, the former deputy mayor in charge of economic development under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said that after Sept. 11, 2001, the city had been focused on bringing events like the Country Music Awards and the Republican National Convention that would attract visitors who might not ordinarily come, who would then spread word of the city\u2019s recovery.\u201cThere were brief conversations and they made clear that there would be a significant economic cost,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said of discussions with the Recording Academy about staying past 2003. \u201cWe decided at that point that we had other priorities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Dallas Bankruptcy Threat, Italy\u2019s Crisis, Change in the Air", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byThe scenario: elected officials promising workers nice pensions based on wishful thinking. Sound familiar?Its pension fund for police officers and firefighters is near collapse and is seeking an immense bailout.How can this be when Dallas has the fastest economic growth of the 13 largest cities in the country?Panicked local retirees have pulled $220 million from the fund in the last six weeks after a recommendation that they no longer be allowed to take out big blocks of money.Even before that, there were reports that the fund\u2019s investments were worth less than stated.Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat who has been in the statehouse since 1973, recalled enthusiastically voting in 1993 for the plan that sent the pension fund on its ill-fated quest for investment returns of 9 percent.\u201cWe all know some of the benefits, guaranteed, were just probably never realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was good while it lasted, but we\u2019ve got some serious financial problems because of it.\u201dHere\u2019s a puzzle for you:1. Europe may never regain economic vigor if Italy\u2019s banks are in a state of perpetual emergency.2. Italy\u2019s banks cannot get healthy without economic growth.3. Italy\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow without healthy banks.The country\u2019s banks have muddled through for years, but with the economy so weak, bad loans have festered and good loans have deteriorated. Nearly a fifth of loans in the system \u2014 worth nearly $400 billion \u2014 are classified as troubled by the International Monetary Fund.If this also sounds like a familiar theme, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a longstanding problem and one that affects the rest of Europe. Italy\u2019s troubled loans represent about 40 percent of all the bad loans within the eurozone.But, \u201cbanking is a symptom, not the cause,\u201d says Ignazio Visco, the governor of the Bank of Italy.He argues that the bulk of Italy\u2019s bad debt is backed by collateral and most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt.Economists, however, are unconvinced.They say banks prop up zombie companies that will never repay their loans, extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts.This year\u2019s presidential election could be remembered as a pivotal moment for the markets, which have been given the impetus to solidify deeper trends that were already underway.A revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place.But traders are making educated guesses and if they turn out to be wrong, the market could turn upside down again.What does this mean for most long-term investors? Broad diversification, Jeff Sommer writes. Simple balanced portfolios of stocks and bonds have barely moved since the election.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a crazy technical background to do this job. A lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\u201d\u2022 Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, will answer questions at the European Parliament.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Prescription. First: Do Harm.", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump is positioned to achieve the most radical reshaping of economic policy since Ronald Reagan. Even under Reagan, Republicans never controlled both houses of Congress.Since Mr. Trump has yet to provide many specifics, I can\u2019t thoroughly assess the overall impact of his plan. But at the least, if he follows through on his ideas, we could face higher prices on imported goods, rising interest rates, substantial inflation and a further shift of wealth to the upper classes.For starters, Mr. Trump has promised an immediate attack on trade deals, at least with countries he views as manipulators. Presidents have significant authority to act unilaterally in this area, and Mr. Trump has insisted he would put 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on those from China.Trade, which has been proved to stimulate economic growth both here and abroad, has already been slowing, and Mr. Trump is determined to slow it further in an effort to protect blue-collar manufacturing workers, many of them his supporters.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs would raise the prices of imported goods sharply, cutting the purchasing power of every American. Lower-income Americans \u2014 including Mr. Trump\u2019s core supporters \u2014 would be hurt the most because they disproportionately buy less expensive imported items. For China, and particularly Mexico, the economic costs would be significant, which is why at one point on Wednesday the Mexican peso had plunged by more than 13 percent.The centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is a huge $5.8 trillion tax cut unaccompanied by specificity around what expenses would be cut to pay for it. (Indeed, the president-elect has proposed more spending on defense and infrastructure.)As soon as Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendancy became clear on Tuesday night, interest rates on Treasuries began to rise. Usually, an unexpected event causes a flight to the safety of government debt, pushing yields down. That the opposite occurred reflects fears that the deficit might balloon out of control.Mr. Trump has promised to keep Medicare and Social Security benefits unchanged, a commitment at odds with Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s own economic proposals. As a fiscal conservative, Mr. Ryan is unlikely to accept large tax cuts unaccompanied by major spending reductions. That could lead to the evisceration of many of the discretionary federal programs \u2014 think education or research and development \u2014 critical to putting our economy on a stronger footing.Then there\u2019s the regulatory arena, where Mr. Trump also has a free hand to act unilaterally. And act he has promised to do, starting with a moratorium on new rules not required by Congress and a reversal of many executive orders.If Mr. Trump sticks to his pledge, it will be open season on regulations, as businesses go after their most disliked provisions and agencies. Industrial companies will take aim at the Environmental Protection Agency. Financial institutions, including the big banks, will push to repeal Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s just for starters.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are united in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, potentially ending the free or subsidized coverage that 20 million Americans are now receiving. Those Americans would be facing higher costs or loss of coverage.Some of the efforts at dismantling government may face hurdles in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to break filibusters, more than the Republicans will have. But under a process known as \u201creconciliation,\u201d matters relating to taxes and spending \u2014 and potentially the repeal of Obamacare \u2014 can be passed by a simple majority of 51.Last, Mr. Trump\u2019s signal issue was immigration, where he promised stricter standards, deportation of undocumented workers, a potential moratorium on the entry of new Muslim immigrants and a wall along the Mexican border.Immigrants, including undocumented workers, play an important role in our economy, doing jobs that many native-born Americans won\u2019t and paying taxes. The conservative American Action Forum calculated that his deportation plan would cost $400 billion to $600 billion and, because there are not enough citizens and legal residents to fill the demand, the plan would shrink the labor force and reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion.It\u2019s hard to know whether the conflicting forces unleashed by Mr. Trump will create a recession. For the moment, at least, the stock market is betting no. But in addition to higher interest rates, financial markets are signaling higher inflation rates.This much is certain: Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals would confer vast monetary gains on wealthy Americans while leaving middle- and working-class Americans \u2014 his electoral base \u2014 further behind. For his supporters, the irony of a Trump victory is that they may end up even less well off.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Since Republicans kept control of the House and Senate, dissenters within Mr. Trump\u2019s party may hold outsize influence over exactly how he can govern as president.Mr. Graham took a reserved approach in his statement on the election on Tuesday, saying that he would aim to help Mr. Trump govern \u2014 within the bounds of a fairly conventional Republican agenda.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

China has seen the emergence of private businesses and a vastly expanded middle class. In the early days of the reform period, social mobility increased notably, producing many rags-to-riches stories.But after decades of breakneck economic growth, the country\u2019s wealth has ceased trickling down, bringing social mobility to a standstill. Chinese people have fewer opportunities to move up the socioeconomic ladder. State-controlled capitalism and corruption have led to the demise of the Communist ideal of a classless society.When the rungs of the income ladder grow farther apart, it\u2019s more difficult for people to climb upward.Meanwhile, the wages of low-income laborers have not kept up with increases in the cost of living. And as economic growth continues to slow, low-income workers are unlikely to see significant gains in wages anytime soon.Access matters in such a corrupt society. Ever since the introduction of the market economy, corruption has been expanding. It is repeatedly cited in surveys as a top concern of the public.At the core of the corrupt culture are wealthy businessmen, state monopolies, private-property developers and government officials. In China, the government controls not only a large portion of the wealth but the market itself. Those who are close to powerful officials have access to financial resources. This system feeds on itself, making the rich richer and the powerful more powerful. \u201cA waterfront pavilion gets the moonlight first,\u201d as the Chinese would say.Education used to serve as one of the few class equalizers. \u201cIn books, one can find beauty and golden mansions,\u201d as the traditional saying goes. Throughout imperial China, young men from humble backgrounds often became wealthy officials after passing through the civil-service examination system.But today, education is failing to help people move up the social ladder. Like everything else in the market economy, education has become a commodity. The better a university, the more expensive it is. Children from impoverished families struggle to afford college, even if they succeed in passing the strict entrance examination. Children from the countryside face more hurdles: Many of the spots in the better urban universities are reserved for local students, putting rural residents at a disadvantage. One report from last year said the percentage of university students from a rural background is half of what it was 30 years ago.For the vast majority of children of migrants living in cities, the race is lost before they reach college age. Because of the many barriers for migrants to enroll their children in legitimate city schools, parents often send them to hometown schools or substandard city schools for migrants run by staff who lack proper qualifications. Struggling in a legal gray area, many migrant schools are frequently shut down by authorities.Even if some migrant children manage to complete a university education, they face an increasingly competitive job market in which \u201ca good dad works better than a good grade.\u201dWe Chinese have seen vast wealth transform our country in a generation. Those who have yet to benefit from the nation\u2019s success need some hope that, with hard work, they too can move up the social ladder. Underprivileged people who feel trapped in their class may eventually take to the streets to protest how the system is rigged against them.If the Chinese government is serious about wanting to foster a stable and harmonious society, it should address the limits on social mobility before it\u2019s too late.Lijia Zhang is the author of the forthcoming novel \u201cLotus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens to the Markets if Donald Trump Wins?", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byDealBookAssume, for a moment, that Donald J. Trump wins the presidency.But what exactly happens the day after? To markets? To the economy?In explaining his prediction, Professor Johnson wrote that Europe\u2019s economy is so fragile that \u201cTrump\u2019s trade-led recession would tip Europe back into full-blown recession, which would likely precipitate a serious banking crisis.\u201d After that, he continued: \u201cIf this risk were not contained \u2014 and the probability of a European banking debacle is already disconcertingly high \u2014 there would be a further negative spiral. Either way, the effects on emerging markets and all lower-income countries would be dramatic.\u201dProfessor Johnson\u2019s view may be a bit hyperbolic, but to one degree or another, his pessimism is shared by many economists across Wall Street, from Citigroup to Goldman Sachs. Each cites a different set of reasons the markets will fall if Mr. Trump wins.But is the conventional wisdom right?In all likelihood, a Trump victory would lead to a swift, knee-jerk sell-off. Many investors will choose to sell stocks and ask questions later.But in the days and weeks after a Trump victory, among investors who cull their portfolios carefully, the decision about buying and selling will be company by company, industry by industry, currency by currency and so forth.In truth, it\u2019s impossible to predict how the markets would settle into a Trump presidency, despite the speculation on all sides. In all likelihood, it will take time for investors to truly make sense and \u201cmath out\u201d how his policies would affect the economy. Yes, the Mexican peso would most likely fall on fears of a trade fight \u2014 Goldman Sachs says it could fall by as much as 25 percent \u2014 and shares of some insurance companies could tumble on the uncertainty of what would happen if Obamacare were repealed.But oil companies and other sectors of the traditional energy industry would be likely to rally given Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to repeal regulations. (Renewable energy companies would fall.) Health care and biotechnology stocks, which have been driven down over concerns that Mrs. Clinton will seek greater regulation and possibly even price controls, might also pop.The biggest test for the stock markets might be pegged to the future leadership of the Federal Reserve. \u201cThere is much more uncertainty regarding who Trump might nominate, though he has made it clear he would not renominate Chair Yellen,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. \u201cHis criticisms of Fed policy are somewhat ambiguous; he has suggested rates have been left too low for too long, but also warns of negative consequences of rate hikes. We would expect that financial markets would view a Trump victory as having slightly hawkish implications, since it would make a change in what many view as a dovish-leaning Fed leadership much more likely.\u201dA handful of economists have suggested that despite all of the promises made by the candidates, the outcome of the election might not actually decide what direction the markets will take.\u201cPutting aside their personalities and policy proposals, it will likely not matter who the next president is when it comes to where markets go,\u201d Mr. Boockvar wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAs we are in the second-longest bull market of all time, and as we approach the eighth year of this economic expansion,\u201d he wrote, \u201codds are high that whoever the next president is, they will preside over a recession, a bear market and rising debts and deficits.\u201dThat might be too bearish of a view, but given that we\u2019ve had a financial crisis of some sort about every eight years or so for the last several decades, it is hard to believe that we will go through the next four years without a hiccup. If merger activity is a gauge of the market\u2019s cycle, the recent spate of deals suggests we\u2019re closer to the ninth inning than the first.Lawrence G. McDonald of ACG Analytics, who has commented on the potential benefits of a Trump presidency, said, \u201cTrump will create a colossal panic, but the relief rally will be outstanding.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton is clearly the favorite choice of Fortune 500 chief executives and investors, Wall Street, perhaps surprisingly, is less enthusiastic about the idea of a Clinton presidency combined with potential Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. \u201cThe S.&P. 500 has tended to react poorly to increases in the implied probability of a Democratic sweep, after removing the estimated effects of changes in growth, inflation and policy expectations,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote. \u201cThe upshot is that the equity market appears to favor Clinton to Trump, but also seems to prefer divided government over single-party control.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Hope in the Flint Police Department", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFlint, Mich. \u2014 I joined the Flint, Mich., police force nearly 20 years ago because I believed I could make a difference. Police officers are problem solvers. But sometimes it seems as if the problems have no end. How can a city fall so far that we lose sight of the possibility of solutions?In recent years here in Flint, we have been asked to do more with less. Our wages and benefits have been cut by more than a quarter since 2011. Because of budget issues, many of us have been laid off and rehired multiple times (for me, it was three times in six years). We used to number roughly 300 police officers; now there are only around 100. Nationwide, there is an average of three police officers for every 1,000 citizens; in Flint, it\u2019s half an officer for every 1,000 citizens.In one of America\u2019s most dangerous cities, the people who secure the city are less secure than they\u2019ve ever been. Yet we continue serving, as we did through the loss of General Motors, through the crack cocaine epidemic and, most recently, through the mass lead poisoning of Flint citizens.The crisis around Flint\u2019s poisoned water points to a larger issue of structural racism and poverty in urban society. How can citizens in Flint trust the police to protect them when they can\u2019t even trust their government to provide them with clean water? This is the kind of question that has placed police officers and African-Americans on a collision course. Police officers are seen as outsiders in urban America. White officers are seen as racist, while black officers like me are seen as traitors to our race.We\u2019re policing a community in survival mode, where adults lack jobs and children lack opportunities, where drugs and guns are plentiful, where the abnormal has become normal. Police officers deal frequently with behaviors that, while suspicious, are not criminal \u2014 or at least not criminal in any meaningful way: panhandling, loitering, mentally ill people endangering themselves walking in traffic, people carrying televisions down the street. Sometimes it\u2019s a guy riding a bike, pulling a lawn mower on one side and a dog on a leash on the other. Is the lawn mower stolen, or is this just another oddity produced by the stresses of our environment? At a time when relations between the community and the police are under great scrutiny, tensions in these everyday interactions are inevitable.Police officers do sometimes make bad decisions when dealing with citizens, but the bigger problem is the social structure that dictates the negative interaction in the first place. While cultural competency for police officers can always be improved, the real solution would be the elimination of the ghettos and poverty. Politically speaking, America desperately needs an urban agenda.Those police officers who make it are resilient men and women of all races who have been tested in just about every way possible. When those people come together and realize that they\u2019re all in the same boat, what you have is a strong, experienced, formidable police force.When families are in crisis, it\u2019s the police officer who becomes a counselor. When children go astray, the police officer becomes a surrogate parent. When the economy fails, police officers help feed families. When neighborhoods break down, police officers help facilitate understanding. When citizens can\u2019t reach local politicians, it\u2019s the police officer who must answer their questions.I\u2019ll never forget the night I received a call to check out a home where neighbors suspected that small children had been left alone. The house sat on a dark corner where the streetlights didn\u2019t work. As I walked up to the front of the house, I saw there was a light on inside and the door was partly opened. When I knocked, a small boy, about 7, answered. He asked me, \u201cDid you come to bring us food?\u201dWhen I entered the home I found his four brothers and sisters, between the ages of 5 and 12, in the kitchen, searching for food that wasn\u2019t there. The boy asked me again, \u201cDid you come to bring us food?\u201d I asked the child where his mother was, and he pointed me to the living room, where I found the young mother, crying on the couch. She had been evicted, and the family had to leave the house that night. But she had no car, no phone to call anyone to help her, and no way to feed her children.I made some calls for her on my cellphone until we could arrange a ride. While she waited for the ride, I went to a local restaurant and got meals for the family.These are things that Flint police officers of all races and genders do for citizens on a regular basis, though often the police administration and City Hall officials have no idea. Protecting and serving in an urban community is about much more than crime fighting.The police officer in Flint is arguably the most accessible leader available to the people. We are always judged by our response times. No other city leader has this level of accountability. The more hats we wear, the more society expects from us. People expect the police to positively resolve every situation they\u2019re called into, and when they can\u2019t, they\u2019re quickly criticized.In the end, the burden placed on urban police is that they have the power to either tear a city apart or help hold it together. With all that Flint has been through, I believe it still stands today because of its Police Department.Brian Willingham is a pastor and an officer with the Flint Police Department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dear President-Elect Trump: Here\u2019s How to Fix Your Conflict-of-Interest Problem", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byDealBookDear President-elect Trump:Consider this small example: Over the weekend, the chief executive of one of the largest companies in the nation \u2014 who was a Hillary Clinton supporter \u2014 told me he planned to have his staff stay at your new Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue as an \u201ceasy way\u201d to ingratiate himself with your new administration.As far as I have seen, so far you appear unfazed by the headlines about kleptocracy. \u201cPrior to the election, it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world,\u201d you wrote on Twitter. \u201cOnly the crooked media makes this a big deal!\u201dYou have said that you have no plans to sell your companies or put them into a blind trust \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be effective anyway, since it\u2019s impossible to blindly hold real estate assets that have your name affixed to them. In the meantime, there are reports that you may lease multiple floors of Trump Tower to the Secret Service for millions of dollars, which you would pocket.The entire situation is \u2014 how else to put it? \u2014 untenable.You understand the conundrum. \u201cIn theory, I don\u2019t have to do anything\u201d to distance yourself from your business holdings, you told journalists at The New York Times last week, \u201cbut I would like to do something \u2014 I would like to try and formalize something.\u201dSo, in the spirit of offering a constructive solution rather than demagogy, let me offer you an idea: Voluntarily agree to hire what is known as a \u201ccorporate monitor,\u201d an independent overseer with unfettered access to your organizations who will provide regular reports to the public about any possible instances of conflicts.Many well-known companies have done this under regulatory and legal duress, but you could do it voluntarily and pay for it yourself, offering a jolt of trust to those who fear you could engage in self-dealing.I even have a suggestion for someone to take this role \u2014 someone who told me on the phone Monday that he would be happy to do so. (More on that later.)There is a clear benefit to you, Mr. Trump. You\u2019ll be able to accomplish a lot more. If voters and the members of Congress perceive that your legislative proposals are meant to enrich you, your family or your business partners \u2014 even if that is not the case \u2014 you run the risk of undermining whatever progress you hope to make.But whatever you do, the most critical piece is the corporate monitor, someone with an impeccable reputation.The name of someone who could be that person: Kenneth R. Feinberg. As you\u2019ll recall, he is the lawyer who oversaw the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, worked as the special master for TARP Executive Compensation, and served as a government-appointed administrator of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster victim compensation fund. He also supervised General Motors and Volkswagen in their recall struggles.Mr. Feinberg\u2019s reputation is considered beyond reproach. He is known as a straight shooter who cannot be bought or sold.Admittedly, this is not a perfect solution, but assuming that the person selected for the role of corporate monitor is trusted, it would go a long way toward assuring the public that your political and business interests won\u2019t overlap or compromise America\u2019s interests.Yes, some of your critics will deride the corporate monitor as mere window dressing. And the fact that this would be a novel application of the corporate monitor role \u2014 such people are typically appointed as part of a settlement in a legal case, as a move by a company to ease the punishment \u2014 might give you pause.But appointing one would also suggest that you take the conflict issue seriously, not only to the American public but also to the rest of the world, which has long looked to the United States as a model of democracy. If your administration even raises the specter of corruption in the White House, that would undermine the entire country, as well as our economy.Companies like Apple, BP, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Siemens and Zimmer have been subject to corporate monitors. Typically, such a person is installed at the behest of the government after a business has been involved in breaking antitrust laws or foreign corrupt practices laws. For example, the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen was required to hire a corporate monitor to oversee Point72, his family office, as part of an insider trading settlement.A corporate monitor traditionally provides reports to the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission to make sure the company he or she oversees is in compliance with the law.A New York Times contributor, Steven Davidoff Solomon, has critically called the idea of corporate monitors in the business context \u201ca full employment act for former federal prosecutors that may have little effect on the way any company that is forced to hire a monitor conducts its business.\u201dThat\u2019s true when companies hire cronies or other friends. That\u2019s why it is important to hire someone truly independent.When I called Mr. Feinberg to run my idea by him, he paused to consider it. We went over the positives and the negatives.He seemed to warm to it quickly. \u201cThe perfect is the enemy of the good,\u201d he said. He told me, \u201cYou\u2019ll get pushback\u201d from critics who will say the monitor is \u201cin bed with the guy paying him.\u201dStill, he said the idea brought to mind a famous quote from Justice Louis D. Brandeis: \u201cSunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dAssuming the monitor has no operational authority and no bonus associated with performance, Mr. Feinberg said, \u201cAt least we know from an unimpeachable source, here is the way it is.\u201dSo, would Mr. Feinberg accept the position? \u201cI\u2019ll take the job,\u201d he said with both a laugh and a genuine sense of sincerity.In that same spirit, I want you to know, Mr. Trump: I\u2019ll happily waive my finder\u2019s fee if you take up this idea.A picture caption with a column on Tuesday about President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s business interests and his new job misidentified a building. The picture showed the Trump Building in Lower Manhattan, not Trump Tower.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Under Fidel Castro, Sport Symbolized Cuba\u2019s Strength and Vulnerability", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byOn July 24, 1959, months after coming to power, Fidel Castro took the mound at a baseball stadium in Havana to pitch an exhibition for a team of fellow revolutionaries known as Los Barbudos, the Bearded Ones.He pitched an inning or two against a team from the Cuban military police and, by some accounts, struck out two batters.\u201cHe threw a few pitches, people were swinging wildly and letting themselves be struck out by the Leader,\u201d said Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda, a native of Cuba who is a literature professor at Yale and the author of \u201cThe Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball.\u201dThe persistent notion that Mr. Castro\u2019s fastball had made him a potential big league prospect has long been debunked by historians. By many accounts, his primary sport as a schoolboy was basketball. He was tall, at 6-foot-2 or 6-foot-3, and he told the biographer Tad Szulc that the anticipation, speed and dexterity required for basketball most approximated the skills needed for revolution.Yet it was primarily baseball, along with boxing and other Olympic sports, that came to symbolize both the strength and vulnerability of Cuban socialism.Successes in those sports allowed Mr. Castro to taunt and defy the United States on the diamond and in the ring and to infuse Cuban citizens with a sense of national pride. At the same time, international isolation and difficult financial realities led to the rampant defection of top baseball stars, the decrepit condition of stadiums and a shortage of equipment.The former Soviet bloc and China also acutely understood the value of sporting achievement as propaganda, but there seemed to be some fundamental differences in Mr. Castro\u2019s Cuba.For one thing, Cuba under Mr. Castro promoted mass sport, not simply elite sport. About 95 percent of Cubans have participated in some form of organized sport or exercise, from children who start physical education classes at age 5 to grandmothers who gather to practice tai chi, said Robert Huish, an associate professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who has studied Cuban sport, health and social programs.Secondly, \u201cI think Fidel Castro legitimately liked sports,\u201d said David Wallechinsky, the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \u201cOne got the sense with East Germany, for example, that it really was a question of propaganda and that government officials didn\u2019t have that obsession with sport itself that Fidel Castro did.\u201dWhatever hardships they endured, Cubans could take pride in their sports stars.As Javier Sotomayor, the only man to clear eight feet in the high jump, soared to his records in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cubans for a time marked the height of his jumps in their doorways, according to Robert Huish, an associate professor of international development studies at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who has studied Cuban sport, health and social programs.\u201cThere was a real effort to connect nationalistic pride to athletic achievement,\u201d said Mr. Huish, who was scheduled to make his 42nd trip to Cuba on Monday. \u201cBoxing became a really important factor in that. You would hear how it was connected to revolution and how socialism and having universal access to sport meant that the victory of the boxer is really everyone\u2019s victory.\u201dTe\u00f3filo Stevenson, a three-time Olympic heavyweight boxing champion from 1972 to 1980, once famously explained why he had turned down a chance to sign a professional contract and perhaps to fight Muhammad Ali, saying, \u201cWhat is a million dollars\u2019 worth compared to the love of eight million Cubans?\u201dThe idea that sports \u201cwere healthy and good for developing bodies,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda said, derived from the American role in helping to establish Cuba\u2019s educational system while occupying the country from 1898 to 1902 after the Spanish-American War.In \u201cCastro\u2019s Cuba, Cuba\u2019s Fidel,\u201d a biography by the American photojournalist Lee Lockwood, Mr. Castro spoke little of baseball, instead stressing his long love for basketball, chess, deep-sea diving, soccer and track and field. \u201cI never became a champion,\u201d he told Mr. Lockwood, adding, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t practice much.\u201dIn 1946, an F. Castro was listed in a box score as having pitched in an intramural game at the University of Havana, where Fidel Castro attended law school, though Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda said he could not confirm it was the future leader.The only known photographs of Mr. Castro in a baseball uniform were taken while he played for Los Barbudos, the informal revolutionary team, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda said. Mr. Castro was never scouted by the major leagues, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda said, and the notion that Mr. Castro was once a promising pitcher \u201cis really a lie.\u201dInstead, Peter C. Bjarkman, a baseball historian, argues that Mr. Castro\u2019s post-revolutionary identification with baseball derived from two factors: One, an acknowledgment of the entrenched popularity of a sport played in Cuba since the 1860s and as popular there as soccer was in Brazil. And two, a stoking of revolutionary zeal at home and a forging of propaganda victories abroad.While Mr. Castro staged some exhibitions and played some pickup games after coming to power, a primary objective was to bedevil the United States in a \u201ccalculated step toward utilizing baseball as a means of besting the hated imperialists at their own game,\u201d Mr. Bjarkman wrote in an article for the Society for American Baseball Research.Mr. Castro banned professional sports in Cuba in 1961, and several years later, said, \u201cAnybody who truly loves sport, and feels sport, has to prefer this sport to professional sport by a thousand times.\u201dHis strategy worked for decades as Cuba played baseball against mostly amateur competition, or non-major leaguers, winning 18 championships in the Baseball World Cup from 1961 to 2005 and three Olympic gold medals from 1992 to 2004.But the collapse of the Soviet Union (and later Venezuela\u2019s oil economy), cost Cuba its financial benefactors. And its dominance began to ebb amid rampant defections of top Cuban players and the growing inclusion of professionals from other nations in international baseball tournaments.Cuba won only one of the three Olympic tournaments held after 1996, before baseball was discontinued for the 2012 London Games (it will return at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.) And Cuba has yet to win the World Baseball Classic, a quadrennial tournament that began in 2006 and features major leaguers.Meanwhile, the American trade embargo, still in place even though the two countries have begun to normalize relations, has left Cuba with poor sports facilities, including some pools with no water; fewer night baseball games because of the cost keeping the lights on; games halted in some stadiums until fans can retrieve foul balls; and a leaky roof and soaked mats at the national wrestling center.In 2013, Cuban officials took a more pragmatic approach to professionalism, allowing athletes to compete for earnings and to play in other countries (though not in Major League Baseball). Cuban coaches are also being exported to other countries in exchange for hard currency. The athletes keep 80 percent of their winnings and agree to compete for Cuba in international competitions.Antonio Castro, a son of Fidel Castro and a vice president of the International Baseball Federation, told ESPN in 2014 that Cuban players should be permitted to play in the Major Leagues and be able to return to Cuba \u201cwithout fear.\u201d\u201cThen no one loses,\u201d Antonio Castro said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have to be separated from their family, from their friends.\u201dBut after President Obama attended an exhibition baseball game in Havana in March as the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since the 1959 revolution, Fidel Castro threw a brushback pitch.In a column, he criticized renewed relations between the two countries, writing, \u201cWe don\u2019t need the empire to give us anything.\u201dAn article on Monday about the way sports symbolized the strength and vulnerability of Cuban socialism under Fidel Castro misstated, in some editions, when baseball was discontinued as a sport at the Olympics.

Around the world, his election is already shaping events \u2014 or at least perceived to be shaping them \u2014 even though he will not take office for seven more weeks. Companies hoping to profit from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies have seen shares soar. Countries fearing his anti-trade stance have seen the value of their currencies plunge against the dollar. Governments are recalibrating policies on trade, defense and immigration.The behavior of the global markets toward Mr. Trump has been uneven. On Monday, stocks and the dollar slipped slightly and bond prices rose, perhaps indicating a bit of caution after the postelection stock market surge.Much of the markets\u2019 mixed reaction reflects uncertainty about a new president who has never held public office, leaving political leaders, business executives and international institutions to make bets on how a Trump administration may rewrite rules that have governed global affairs under American presidents of both parties.Another company that has seen its share value increase since the election is Magal Security Systems, an Israeli firm that helped develop high-tech security barriers around Gaza and the West Bank. With Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico, investors expect that firms like Magal could get some of the business. Magal\u2019s shares rose as high as 24 percent above their pre-election level, with trading volume as much as 150 times higher.Other economies have reacted with trepidation amid fears that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may drive up interest rates and inflation, an expectation that some traders call Trumpflation.In China, initial optimism about Mr. Trump is giving way to skepticism. \u201cWe should stop imagining what benefits Trump\u2019s election could bring to China,\u201d Zhu Chenghu, a retired major general, said at a seminar at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing on Friday. \u201cHe will return to the traditional policies that rely on the role of the U.S. dollar and seek expansion overseas.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s election is getting credit, or blame, for all sorts of events, no matter how tangential. In Russia, a newspaper interviewed an analyst who suggested that the arrest of a cabinet minister on bribery charges may have resulted from Mr. Trump\u2019s success because Moscow no longer had to fear going after prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of reformers who were once close to Washington.Members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition expect Mr. Trump to abandon the practice of Mr. Obama and presidents of both parties who tried to restrain Israel from building housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Shortly after the election, a Trump adviser said settlements were not an obstacle to peace, appearing to have adopted the argument Mr. Netanyahu makes.\u201cThe next few weeks present a unique window of opportunity for Israel,\u201d Naftali Bennett, who leads a pro-settler party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, told a conference sponsored by The Jerusalem Post last week. After years of American pressure, he added, \u201cit\u2019s ours to decide.\u201dBetty Herschman, the director of international relations for Ir Amim, a group that opposes settlement construction, said it was too early to know what Mr. Trump\u2019s policy would actually be. But she said one thing was clear: \u201cThe Israeli right is already celebrating.\u201dBrachie Sprung, a spokeswoman for Mayor Nir Barkat, said last week\u2019s action by the municipal planning committee was a result of the developer\u2019s coming back to the city with revisions to his plan that required new approval.\u201cThere has been no political statement here with this piece of land,\u201d she said.\u201cI intend to exploit the change of the guard in the U.S.A. and bring them to approval,\u201d Mr. Turgeman told Israel\u2019s Channel 2. Until now, he said, there had been pressure from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office not to proceed to avoid angering Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s over. From now, we intend to take the plans out of deep freeze.\u201dReporting was contributed by Geeta Anand from New Delhi; Steven Erlanger from London; Yufan Huang from Beijing; Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow; Motoko Rich from Tokyo; and Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Stiffens Sanctions on North Korea, Trying to Slow Its Nuclear March", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe new restrictions on North Korean coal were relatively easy for Beijing to approve. They serve the purpose of expressing China\u2019s displeasure with Mr. Kim\u2019s agenda, yet they fall short of inflicting crippling pain on North Korea.China seems to have judged that reducing the coal imports will not upend the North Korean economy and cause social unrest and flows of refugees into China, an outcome it most fears.On Wednesday, China\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations, Liu Jieyi, called on North Korea to halt its nuclear tests, saying they undermine regional stability and Beijing\u2019s \u201cstrategic interests.\u201d He said the resolution demonstrated \u201cthe uniform stance of the international community.\u201dSamantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said Wednesday that \u201cthe United States recognizes China in working closely with us.\u201d Negotiations lasted for three months, since Pyongyang\u2019s fifth and latest nuclear test in September.The original sanctions \u2014 which the United States at the time hailed as \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \u2014 had sought to limit coal exports, unless it was for what the measure called \u201clivelihood\u201d reasons. In spite of the sanctions, exports to China increased.American officials conceded this week that there was some \u201cvagueness\u201d in the original measure. The new resolution aims to shave $700 million from North Korea\u2019s coal revenues. The resolution says North Korea can sell no more than 7.5 million metric tons of coal a year, or bring in no more than $400 million in sales, whichever comes first.The measure also urges countries to allow North Korean diplomatic missions around the world to have only one bank account. That, the United States says, is intended to limit the country\u2019s penchant for using its envoys and embassies to further its nuclear program.How successful the new measures will be, of course, depends on the willingness of countries to abide by them.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called the measures the \u201ctoughest\u201d sanctions imposed by the Council. But he warned that the passage alone would be insufficient. \u201cIt is incumbent on all member states of the United Nations to make every effort to ensure that these sanctions are fully implemented,\u201d he said.The bigger uncertainty is what posture Mr. Trump will take toward North Korea and Mr. Kim \u2014 and, by extension, toward Beijing.\u201cIf you look at North Korea, this guy, I mean, he\u2019s like a maniac, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in January. He went on to say that \u201che really does have missiles, and he really does have nukes.\u201d Since then, Mr. Trump and his transition team are likely to have been briefed on the nature and scope of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal.The Security Council measures adopted on Wednesday are a response to the Kim government\u2019s fifth and largest nuclear test. The revised sanctions are aimed at cutting into North Korea\u2019s ability to profit from coal exports and to tighten the noose around individuals and companies involved in its nuclear program. The measure expands the list of people subject to asset freezes and travel bans; they include some envoys to countries like Egypt and Sudan.American officials said the new sanctions would also clarify that the \u201clivelihood\u201d exemption applies to North Korean citizens, and cannot be used to protect the livelihoods of Chinese importers.Publicly, China has defended its coal imports since the sanctions earlier this year. Even if statistics showed increased imports, the trade was legal under the livelihood exemption, the Foreign Ministry said.Chinese analysts point to conditions flourishing in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and say rudimentary market trading in rural areas is keeping much of the population afloat.And even though some Chinese steel makers in northern China value North Korea\u2019s high-grade coal, the new curbs would have relatively little impact on China\u2019s industrial output, said Deng Shun, a coal market analyst with Success Futures, a trading company in Guangzhou.Somini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Banks Are in a Slow-Motion Crisis. And Europe May Pay.", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byMILAN \u2014 Victor Massiah has grown weary of talk that the Italian banking system is so threadbare and stuffed with terrible loans that it threatens Europe with another financial crisis.The mansion that serves as local headquarters for the bank he runs, UBI Banca, one of Italy\u2019s largest lenders, does not feel like a place on the verge of running out of money. An inlaid marble fireplace sits in a conference room beneath wooden beams worthy of a castle. A statue of the Greek goddess Athena stands triumphantly over a staircase.\u201cAs you can see,\u201d he says, sweeping a hand across the scene, \u201cwe\u2019re not necessarily bankrupt.\u201dAmong policy makers alert for signs of the next financial disaster, Italy\u2019s mountain of uncollectable bank debt is a subject discussed in tones ordinarily reserved for piles of plutonium. Its banks seem at once too big to fail and eminently capable of doing so, menacing the global economy.For years, Italian lenders have muddled through, hoping time would cure their afflictions. But Italy\u2019s economy has been terminally weak, not growing at all over a recent 13-year stretch. Bad loans have festered. Good loans have deteriorated.All of which leaves Italy and Europe, and to some extent the global economy, with a formidable conundrum. Europe may never regain economic vigor so long as Italy\u2019s banks are a slow-motion emergency. But Italy\u2019s banks cannot get healthy without growth. And Italy\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow without healthy banks.Mr. Massiah has no patience for stories that cast banking as the source of danger. A few irresponsible cases aside, Italy\u2019s lenders are not the cause of trouble, he insisted. Rather, they are the victims of their times.A recession that lasted seven years wiped out nearly a quarter of Italian industry. The unemployment rate sits above 11 percent. The population is aging, and too few women are working, limiting spending power. Too many Italian businesses are small operations that are especially vulnerable to globalization. Family-run craft and apparel makers have been destroyed by low-cost competition from China. Negative interest rates maintained by the European Central Bank to encourage lending have cut into bank profit margins.\u201cThis is a bank-centric country, and there was a huge crisis,\u201d Mr. Massiah said. \u201cWhen the tide goes out, you don\u2019t see everything nice in the sea.\u201dItaly\u2019s banking pain is a symptom of an Italian business style that has traditionally favored relationships and community ties over a dispassionate analysis of the bottom line \u2014 a perception the nation is eager to alter. To visit senior Italian officials in their offices decked out like personal versions of the Sistine Chapel is to hear a recitation of complaints that reforms have gone underappreciated. They betray resentment that Italy continues to be caricatured as the reckless debacle at the center of European economic decline.The comically ineffectual former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 a fiercely tanned media magnate \u2014 has been dispatched to history. At the controls today is the young technocrat Matteo Renzi, who has delivered a spate of politically perilous reforms long sought by solemn-faced officials in Brussels.Under Mr. Renzi\u2019s direction, Italy has made it easier to fire workers. This has somewhat diminished a major disincentive to giving people jobs \u2014 the not-irrational fear that problem hires will stick around forever, like grown children tethered to the refrigerator. Italy has also sped up civil processes in its notoriously inefficient courts.The prime minister is now seeking a constitutional change that would refashion the entire legislative process in an effort to break a logjam in the upper chamber of Parliament. He argues it would eliminate obstructions to further pro-growth measures.Italians vote on the amendments next month. If they reject the proposal, Mr. Renzi has suggested he may step down.Yet in the telling of some economists, the reforms are a sideshow: The trouble lies with the banks. They prop up so-called zombie companies that will never repay their loans, extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts.Suggest this to the man in charge of the system, Ignazio Visco, governor of the Bank of Italy, and he recoils as if someone has thrown an offensive object on his elegant silk carpet. The bulk of Italy\u2019s bad debt is backed by collateral, he said. Most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt, provided that economic growth returns.\u201cIt is the result of bad economic conditions, seven years of almost continuous recession,\u201d Mr. Visco said. \u201cBanking is a symptom, not the cause.\u201dBanking is also an activity that in such conditions seems equal parts math and hope.Mr. Massiah, the man heading UBI Banca, confronts a contradictory set of imperatives. His bank is strong in northern Italy, home to some of the most productive industrial areas in Europe. If he frets too much about limiting risk, he may deprive the companies that could build a more vibrant future. But if he lends too aggressively, he risks creating more bad loans.He is putting stock in Darwin. \u201cThe weaker companies are dying,\u201d he said. \u201cThe survivors will be of higher quality.\u201dIf natural selection is playing out, workers in the industrial enclave of Nave fear that they are threatened with extinction. A speck of a town carved into the foothills of the Alps some 60 miles east of Milan, Nave has long drawn sustenance from its steel mills.Now many of those plants are abandoned, their concrete walls disintegrating, their windows broken. Locals call the old factories \u201cthe cemeteries.\u201dOutside the Stefana steel mill, beyond the shuttered gates, idled workers hold vigil, waving placards at the occasional passing vehicle in the hopes that their presence will somehow translate into a resumption of their jobs.Stefana\u2019s business has disintegrated in the face of a global glut of steel and the disappearance of construction projects in Italy and Spain. In late 2014, workers began hearing that management was having difficulty paying for gas and electricity. For two weeks, the plant shut down, then work resumed.Then, UBI and other Italian lenders stopped delivering bank loans. The end came in June.Most of the workers used to earn about 1,800 euros a month (about $1,964), plus pension and other benefits. Now they get half that via state aid and a local emergency fund. The company sits in legal limbo as a judge sifts through claims from creditors.Twenty years have passed since Fabio Stefana (no relation to the plant owners) moved out on his own, courtesy of the wages he earned making steel. When his wages stopped in June, he found himself asking his parents for help with groceries.His father worked at the mill and retired from there. Now the father\u2019s pension payments are supporting his 39-year-old son.\u201cI have to have lunch with my mother,\u201d said Mr. Stefana, who frequently goes home for meals as a way to save money. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right reason to eat with your parents.\u201dMr. Massiah acknowledges the pain when his bank stops lending, but he does not dwell on it. The son of Libyan Jews who fled to Italy in the early 1960s, he favors pinstriped suits and round tortoiseshell glasses. He looks at once like the University of Rome graduate student in economics he used to be, and the head of a bank large enough to be regulated by the European Central Bank.\u201cYou have winners and losers,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the steel companies are doing very well, because they are more sophisticated. They do specialized stuff. And others that were not managed in a proper way went bankrupt.\u201dUBI may be the quintessential large Italian lender.Nor is UBI like UniCredit, the one Italian financial institution large enough to be deemed systemically important on a global scale. Though UniCredit also feels pressure to raise capital, it has a portfolio stocked with choice assets it would most likely be able to sell.UBI was created by combining local cooperative lenders \u2014 institutions meant to aid local merchants, not churn out profits for investors. It reflects a spirit of collective undertaking that has made Italy a beloved vacation destination and trusted source for food and fashion. People paying a premium for a bottle of Italian wine may savor the idea that the vintner feels a kinship with the people harvesting the grapes.But such emotional dealings do not generally produce positive results when it comes to managing money.Since becoming chief executive of UBI in 2008, Mr. Massiah has sought to inculcate a modern banking culture. He has been in the socially awkward position of having to honor the sense of community while saying no to people who feel entitled to hear yes.\u201cWe say, \u2018Let\u2019s sit,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s see the business plan. Because if it\u2019s not feasible, we are just making your agony longer.\u2019\u201dThe bad loans on UBI\u2019s books dropped to \u20ac8.3 billion from \u20ac9.3 billion at the end of last year.Yet UBI, too, faces allegations of wrongdoing. On Thursday, Italian prosecutors announced they had concluded an investigation finding evidence that Mr. Massiah and 38 other bank officials obstructed Italian regulators who had been looking into claims that the company had improperly elected a supervisory board in 2013. Those accused have three weeks to prove that they do not deserve to be charged.Mr. Massiah dismissed the prosecution as the outgrowth of a highly politicized battle for control of the bank following a merger.Under the rules that had governed the entity, then a cooperative, the new board was formed through an election in which all individual shareholders had equal votes, regardless of how much of the bank they owned. When a group of investors holding less than 1 percent lost the election seeking board seats, they accused bank executives of rigging the outcome, Mr. Massiah said.\u201cThe people who lost were saying the bank was influencing the people who went to vote,\u201d Mr. Massiah said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not true. They are doing this because the ones who lost were trying to take control of the bank. There\u2019s no accusation that we mismanaged one single euro. It\u2019s not a money story.\u201dMr. Massiah added that he and the board ultimately changed the structure of UBI to ensure transparency. Votes are now apportioned to the size of the investment.Mr. Massiah spends hours with his branch managers, counseling them on how to more intently scrutinize balance sheets while delivering bad news. Even when they face a clash between cold numbers and what he calls \u201cthe important values of life\u201d \u2014 a young couple wanting a mortgage, for example, so they can buy a home and start a family.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the people to manage the emotional part of the story,\u201d Mr. Massiah said. \u201cThe guys that we do have at the branch are human beings and feel bad. It\u2019s terrible to say no, in particular in our culture. In a way, in the Anglo-Saxon culture, there is a more direct way to interact. Our culture is less straight. Our culture is less confrontational.\u201dBut Italy is awash in the expensive consequences of social graces governing banking.\u201cSometimes a \u2018no\u2019 is protecting somebody,\u201d Mr. Massiah said. It\u2019s a polite way of saying to a young couple, \u201cI\u2019m killing you, accepting that mortgage. Please rent a house for the moment, and then when you earn more you can buy a house,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to understand that we have to live at the level that we can allow.\u201dSometimes \u201cno\u201d is just another word for not knowing how to assess the deal. This is Marco Rossi\u2019s takeaway, as he looks back at his futile effort to pry loose a loan.Mr. Rossi had been working as a business consultant when, six years ago, he stumbled on an opportunity of his own. A German pharmaceutical company was in the process of merging with an Israeli firm. The two companies needed to sell some overlapping operations. One unit sold over-the-counter drugs like aspirin. Another owned a respiratory drug.Mr. Rossi purchased the two units for the grand total of nothing. He merely agreed to take responsibility for paying 80 workers along with their pension obligations. He negotiated a deal with the union, agreeing to eschew layoffs. And he bought licenses from other Italian pharmaceutical companies enabling him to sell additional drugs, seeking to squeeze more revenue out of his sales force.In his first two years of existence, he doubled his revenue to \u20ac12 million from about \u20ac6 million.But achieving profitability required that he increase his sales further. Mr. Rossi purchased a license to sell a new cholesterol drug, but he needed funds to buy it wholesale.All he needed was \u20ac300,000, he said. \u201cThat was the last piece of the puzzle.\u201dUBI had always seemed keen for his business, Mr. Rossi said. When he started the company, he had promptly deposited \u20ac2 million in his account. \u201cThey were very happy about that,\u201d he said.Mr. Rossi went to his local branch in central Milan and sought a loan. They asked for collateral, and he presented invoices worth \u20ac2 million. But the bankers were unimpressed. \u201cIt was not a building,\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201cIt was not something solid. It was paper.\u201dThe local branch sent him to a central office, which told him there was no guarantee his business would continue to grow.\u201cThey said, \u2018Give us your balance sheets for the last three years,\u2019 and I told them that I only had two,\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a new company.\u2019\u201dThis was not a good thing to be.\u201cI had to face ignorant people,\u201d Mr. Rossi said, fuming. \u201cThey refused me the loan.\u201dDesperate, Mr. Rossi tried another bank, Veneto Banca. Its bankers were prepared to extend a loan \u2014 with one major catch.\u201cThey said, \u2018You need \u20ac300,000. We are prepared to give you \u20ac600,000,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rossi recalled. \u201c\u2018But you have to take the extra \u20ac300,000 and buy the bank\u2019s stock.\u2019\u201dThat would have doubled his payments while placing a sizable bet on a dicey bank. If it failed, he would still be responsible for the loan. This seemed dangerous and unsavory.\u201cThe next step is the Mafia,\u201d Mr. Rossi said.His reluctance was ultimately validated. This summer, as Veneto Banca teetered toward collapse and was eventually bailed out by a private investment fund, depositors yanked money out of branches and shareholders\u2019 savings were wiped out. In August, the Italian authorities arrested a former chief executive of the bank on allegations that the bank had lent customers cash so they could buy company shares.For Mr. Rossi, his inability to borrow stopped his expansion plan. In January 2013, he sold the company for \u20ac3 million, he said \u2014 10 times what he had been seeking to borrow.He rented a ballroom at a local hotel and gathered his entire staff. There, he delivered the grim news: Sixty people \u2014 three-fourths of the work force \u2014 were losing their jobs, though the sale enabled him to pay severance and maintain pensions.\u201cI wanted to grow in Italy, and the support that I received was zero,\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201cThis is a country where we have a huge unemployment rate. We have a lot of skilled people. We have smart people with ideas. Why don\u2019t we create something?\u201dMr. Massiah of UBI listened to this account with a pained grin. \u201cNo one ever tells the story of the bad idea that we didn\u2019t give money to,\u201d he said.And yet, he offered, maybe his bank is overdoing it. Maybe, in their understandable eagerness to avoid a future with more bad loans, his bankers are being so conservative that they are perpetuating a long and lean present.\u201cI could be wrong and overshoot it,\u201d Mr. Massiah said. \u201cWe are asking ourselves always if we are doing something wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Congress Both Want Tax Cuts. The Question Is Which Ones.", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported bySeveral economic issues divide many Republicans in Congress from Donald J. Trump, the Republican president-elect. Free trade versus tariffs to limit imports. Immigration reform versus a border wall. Cutting Social Security and other benefit programs versus protecting them.But one economic matter unites just about every member of the Republican party: support for tax cuts, particularly for those at the top of the income ladder.\u201cTax reform is the thing that always unites Republicans,\u201d said William Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush. \u201cI would guess that that\u2019s Item 1 on the congressional agenda.\u201dHouse Republicans already have a fairly detailed blueprint for Congress and the White House to follow.\u201cMy sense is that Trump doesn\u2019t really have the details of a tax reform package that he wants,\u201d Mr. Gale said. \u201cHe has broad ideas, and then the Congress will go at it and pin down the details. The House blueprint seems like the place to start and may be fairly close to where they finish.\u201dThat does not mean Mr. Trump will not have his own ideas. Mr. Gale expects a Trump White House to insist on continuing a deduction for interest paid on debt-financed projects, a provision dear to real estate developers. (The House plan proposes ending the deduction, instead allowing businesses to immediately deduct expenses and investments.)While sweeping tax cuts were never a crusading theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s, they have long been near the top of Mr. Ryan\u2019s agenda. And Mr. Trump has suggested he would be happy to let Congress take the lead.There is certainly a significant overlap. Both would cut income tax rates across the board and keep rates low on income from investments, an approach intended to spur savings that effectively guarantees the juiciest cuts for the wealthy.Lowering the tax on capital gains \u2014 which also benefits the wealthy the most \u2014 draws wide support among the leadership headed for both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in 2017 as well.Republicans say they also want to provide some tax cuts for those lower on the income ladder. Senator Marco Rubio, who was re-elected to represent Florida after his failed presidential bid, favors increasing the child tax credit; Mr. Ryan, who is working closely with Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, supports expanding the earned-income tax credit to poor working families without children. Mr. Trump has suggested he wants to provide tax cuts to two-income families with children as well.For all the similarities, there are important differences as well. The biggest contrast between Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Ryan\u2019s tax approaches can be seen on the corporate side, where they differ on how to tax capital investment and debt. They also differ on the proposed tax rate for most small businesses.The most compelling target for business tax reform is the roughly $2.6 trillion that American corporations like Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and Pfizer have kept abroad on an extended tax holiday, out of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s reach.\u201cEveryone agrees that the foreign tax situation is ludicrous because it doesn\u2019t raise any revenue and keeps several trillion dollars abroad,\u201d said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.Mr. Trump has said he was determined to get multinational companies to pay their American tax bills every year, although the sting would not be as great since he would also cut corporate rates and allow credits for foreign taxes paid.By contrast, the House Republicans have been pushing for what is known as a territorial system, which would tax all businesses solely on what goods and services they sold in the United States.The flaw in a territorial approach, Mr. Pozen and other economists have pointed out, is that it encourages businesses to shop the world for lower tax rates, ultimately shifting even more profits and jobs overseas.\u201cWhy is that good for a president who wants to have more jobs and more facilities in the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Pozen asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can reconcile those goals under a territorial system.\u201dMr. Pozen favors a global minimum tax that every American business would have to pay. Companies that shift their tax home or try to funnel more profits through low-tax nations would nonetheless be required to make up the difference between that rate and the minimum by paying the United States Treasury.However part of that stash is recaptured, there is a broad consensus in Congress that some of the new revenue should be used to invest in repairing and improving public infrastructure. Mr. Trump spoke of spending $1 trillion over 10 years on roads, bridges, waterways and airports, although he said he planned to rely primarily on tax credits for private companies, equity investments and privately raised debt.Linking international reform to infrastructure funding could work, said Janice Mays, a former staff director of the Ways and Means Committee who is now a managing director at the tax and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cI do think Trump wants to do infrastructure, to help people get jobs and stimulate the economy.\u201dBut as a longtime veteran of budget and tax battles on Capitol Hill, Ms. Mays warned that obstacles continually pop up in both expected and unexpected places. The size of the projected deficit from the various tax-cutting plans \u2014 as much as $7 trillion over a decade \u2014 could set off an internal war among Republicans who favor restraining spending on Social Security, Medicare and benefit programs for the poor and those, like Mr. Trump, who say they want to prevent the blue-collar families who flocked to his campaign from losing government programs that help keep them above water.\u201cI just think they may be a little optimistic at the moment,\u201d Ms. Mays said.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Along the way, he has tried, with limited success, to reassure audiences that Mr. Trump will not discard the agreements and priorities that Mr. Obama has devoted much of his presidency to advancing.His toughest task was here at a summit meeting of an organization that helped birth the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, an accord that is almost certainly dead as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. Also, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign strategies was to demonize immigrants from Latin America, and he referred to those crossing the border from Mexico as rapists and criminals. Just about every question posed to Mr. Obama from the audience here had to do with the anxiety Mr. Trump has stirred in this part of the world.\u201cThe United States is such a big country that, after any election, people are uncertain,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think it will be important for people around the world to not make immediate judgments.\u201dHe also predicted that relations between Latin America and the United States would not change much.\u201cThe main message I want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the United States government,\u201d Mr. Obama said to applause. \u201cAnd we are going to work together.\u201dPart of the reason relations are unlikely to change dramatically, he said, is that the United States\u2019 security depends on Latin American nations\u2019 faring well enough that their people decide to remain home instead of attempting the arduous journey to enter the United States illegally.\u201cThe best way for my daughters to be secure in America is to make sure that people in Guatemala or El Salvador are also feeling secure because, if they\u2019re not, that may spill over the borders to us,\u201d he said.Answering a question on Saturday from a Venezuelan audience member, Mr. Obama painted a dark portrait of the progress of freedom around the world, and said the wave of countries adopting democratic governance had reversed itself.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some countries that are going backward rather than forwards in terms of freedom of press, freedom of the internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society,\u201d he said.Venezuela\u2019s economy is nearing collapse as its government cracks down on opposition leaders in an increasingly desperate effort to cling to power.Mr. Obama also said a growing number of people were now arguing that democracy is incompatible with development. China\u2019s success over the past 30 years in creating a manufacturing colossus through its authoritarian measures has some leaders, particularly in Asia, insisting that too much democracy can be detrimental.But Mr. Obama said that, over the long term, countries that pursue democracy, transparency and accountability fare far better than those that do not.\u201cIn this time that we live in, development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said.In authoritarian systems, economies respond poorly to change because their populations are not as well-informed or as flexible, he said.\u201cYou can maintain order for a while with repressive nondemocratic governance, but it will rot from within,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cOver time, those governments fail and those economies fail.\u201dMr. Obama told the crowd here to avoid fervent nationalism and identity politics, which he said could lead to conflicts.\u201cIf the most important thing about you is that you are an American,\u201d Mr. Obama began, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump, \u201cif that\u2019s the one thing that defines you, then you may end up being threatened by people from other places, when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities.\u201d Mr. Trump has defined his governing philosophy as \u201cAmerica First,\u201d and has already appointed avowed nationalists to top positions in his administration.Mr. Obama described himself as a proud American, but said the world was far too interconnected for leaders to be wholly focused on their own nations.\u201cIf there\u2019s pollution in China, then that affects you here in Peru,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Policies May Bring Fresh Wave of Deals", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWith a man who is co-author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d as president-elect, deal making can be expected to increase.This rise will be determined by whether a Trump administration can govern with stability. A conciliatory and seemingly normal victory speech combined with a turnaround in the markets on Wednesday make that seem like a real possibility and bode well for mergers and acquisitions.Part of the momentum will come from a change in tax laws. Donald J. Trump\u2019s plan for individuals is to simplify and reduce. Instead of seven brackets, there would be three. Instead of a top rate of 39.6 percent, there would be a top rate of 33 percent on income over $225,000 for married joint filers.But the biggest change could be in capital gains and carried interest. The 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on capital gains would be repealed under his plan.And carried interest would be taxed as personal income. This would mean a tax increase for the barons of private equity.Under his plan, corporate taxes would be simplified and reduced. And there would be a one-time tax holiday for the repatriation of cash to the United States \u2014 the repatriation tax reduced to 10 percent.So what will this do for deal making?Yet structural changes in taxes and policy do generally spur or reduce deal making as industries realign.Here we are going to see lots of change that will drive deal making. The Dodd-Frank Act is likely to be revised \u2014 some would say \u201cwatered down.\u201d The Affordable Care Act may be amended. Mr. Trump has said he would seek to repeal it, but some provisions, like the requirements that there be no pre-existing exclusions, are too popular to repeal.The result is likely to be a fresh wave of transactions in the health and financial industries as banks and health care companies realign to the new laws. Coming deficit spending may also spur more deal making in industries including construction.One consequence of the increased government deficit spending and decreased taxes could be the long-awaited rise in inflation and interest rates. This is likely to drive more short-term deal making to capture the cheap money, but in the long term, it may do more than anything else to drag down deal making.In addition, the ability of companies to bring back cash to the United States and the passage of corporate tax reform may stop the slow bleed of companies abroad and provide powder to mergers and acquisitions here.In part, this will also be driven by the economy. If the economy stays stable and growing (albeit not greatly these days), then deal making will continue apace as the forces pushing companies together \u2014 industry consolidation and technological shift \u2014 continue. A weaker economy will mean fewer deals.And of course there is trade. The trade deals pending, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are now dead on arrival. Others may be renegotiated.As a result, companies may use deals to readjust to a more domestic orientation or to prepare themselves for a decline in trade. But untangling existing trade deals will be quite hard, so tinkering is more likely.If Mr. Trump does move aggressively against China, this may also stem the growing Chinese investment in the United States. The national security review process is likely to be even more intensive, limiting Chinese investment.And then there is the biggest factor these days in deals \u2014 antitrust. A Trump administration may not relax antitrust enforcement the way a normal Republican administration would. Instead, we may see tighter review of big mergers \u2014 indeed, as a candidate, Mr. Trump already called for the tie-up between Time Warner and AT&T to be blocked.Make no mistake, huge shifts are coming that could markedly change how the economy functions and runs. This has the potential to bring back instability and perhaps throw the economy into decline. It may also go the other way, of course, spurring economic growth.Either way, companies will be working to reposition themselves in this economy and buy growth. It all means that the long-term forces now pushing companies toward making deals are likely to continue, but with some big caveats, namely whether Mr. Trump can govern from a position of stability and consistency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Guide to Getting a Bachelor\u2019s Abroad", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byThere was a time when the self-confident undergraduate took a semester or two abroad to taste an unfamiliar culture and dip a toe into the waters of higher education on a foreign shore. Today, tasting is timid stuff.While graduate programs have long attracted international students, undergraduates are seizing upon the vast opportunities to enroll in foreign colleges for a complete bachelor\u2019s degree. The number of options to do so is growing by the year. The online platform StudyPortals reports an estimated 5,670 English-language degrees in non-Anglophone countries. In Europe alone, 300 colleges and universities offer more than 1,500 English-taught bachelor\u2019s degrees, according to Beyond the States, an international college adviser.The benefits of a thoroughly international education in the age of globalization are conspicuous. But the game-changer is that college abroad can save parents tens of thousands of dollars. In many countries, including Turkey, Thailand, Brazil, Iceland and some in continental Europe, college is either free or virtually so, with tuition less than a couple thousand dollars. Many other universities offer a bachelor\u2019s degree for under $7,000 a year.Icing on the cake: It\u2019s possible to obtain financial aid, both need- and merit-based, from universities outside the United States, as well as government aid from home. (The Department of Education website lists nearly 900 foreign colleges and universities where Americans can use federal financial aid.)A bachelor\u2019s abroad isn\u2019t for everybody. Students must be prepared to immerse themselves in the customs of an unfamiliar habitat far from home. It\u2019s an endeavor for the intensely curious and resourceful, those who can adapt to systems that do grading, testing and instruction quite differently. Forget intercollegiate sports, frats and clubs. Even partying is not the same \u2014 less binge drinking, for example \u2014 and campus life, when there is any, isn\u2019t as cozy. But the rewards are great, say graduates and educators, and recognized by employers seeking go-getters.Giovanni Hashimoto, a 23-year-old out of Washington, D.C., transferred to the University of Milan after two years at Pacific Union College in California. Though it took some digging online and follow-up emails, Mr. Hashimoto, who speaks no Italian, found what he wanted in the university\u2019s English-language political science and economics program. With tuition at $4,000, he calculates he saves $20,000 a year studying in Italy.But, more critically, acquaintances in Washington\u2019s world of public policy and politics, where he wants to eventually work, told him that a foreign degree \u201cconnotes a willingness to try things outside one\u2019s comfort zone\u201d and would work in his favor.The British Isles have catered to overseas students for, quite literally, centuries, and to masses of Americans since the day Bill Clinton \u201cread\u201d at Oxford in the \u201960s.Of course, if you don\u2019t have a Rhodes scholarship as Mr. Clinton did, studying in Britain can be pricey: between $16,000 and $20,000 a year for humanities programs at most of the top colleges, less for smaller names. Oxford and Cambridge charge another $6,000 to $10,000 in special college fees. Everywhere in Britain you have to tack on about $4,000 for degrees in natural sciences, and even more for medical and veterinary programs.But the three-year diplomas in England and Wales will tempt the impatient and undercapitalized, and many schools besides Cambridge and Oxford have global reputations. Imperial College London and University College London rank right up with the Ivies, too, with the likes of the University of Edinburgh, King\u2019s College London, the University of Manchester and the London School of Economics close behind. Most are nearly as packed with international students as the University of Sussex near Brighton, 27 percent of whose graduates hail from abroad.The admissions process involves a sliver of the stress, and mystery, that colleges in the United States insist upon. Apply to up to five universities via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. Lists of extracurricular activities are of little interest. Requirements usually include SAT or ACT scores, a single reference and an essay explaining your passion for a particular field, often with Advanced Placement and/or SAT subject test scores to back it up. Websites will tell you the minimum acceptable scores, and if you hit them, you are likely to get in \u2014 with the exception of the ultrapicky Oxbridgians. Cambridge accepted 23 of 323 American applicants into its class of 2018; Oxford took in 40 of 563. (Cambridge wants at least a 1460 SAT or 32 ACT; University College London will take a 1380 or 29, the University of York a 1200 or 26.)A knuckleball for many teenagers, and this goes for much of Europe and beyond: Applicants must pick a major and stick to it. So from the get-go you have to know what you want to study. You apply not just to a given university, but to a specific degree program or college within it. This goes for medicine and dentistry, too.So, forget the broad-based liberal arts thing, and all the requirements affixed to it. There are no general ed or writing 101 classes. You\u2019re expected to be able to write a topic sentence upon arrival. And in general, there\u2019s much less hype over grades, which are based on a final exam or paper \u2014 no quizzes, midterms, multiple choice. No taking of attendance, either.Scotland is a wee bit different. Undergraduate programs last four years, and allow students to switch majors midstream. The University of St. Andrews and the University of Edinburgh are longtime international favorites despite the bland cuisine and grim seasons \u2014 the more northerly you venture, the darker the winters. Both double over backward to please (after all, overseas tuition is a cash cow). They provide orientation for \u201cfirst years\u201d (say \u201cfreshman\u201d and you\u2019ll get guffawed out of the room), dorms and meal plans, trips to whisky distilleries and Gaelic festivals called ceilidhs. Edinburgh even has a North American student society.Irish universities roll out the red carpet, too. International students are even assigned advisers to help bridge gaps. A 2015 survey by StudyPortals of 17,000 international students found they were happiest on the Emerald Isle, appreciative of the community atmosphere, support structures for foreigners and vibrant student life. (Of 18 countries, Britain polled a lowly 10th; students gripe about high living costs and subpar housing. France came in dead last on account of poor student services.)Trinity College Dublin, the alma mater of Beckett and Swift, is highest ranked of Irish institutions and so most desirable. You\u2019ll bump up against almost 700 American students on campus, some 200 of them working toward a bachelor\u2019s \u2014 48 percent more than just three years ago. Trinity requires a minimum 1290 SAT or 28 ACT and a B+ average. Tuition, about $20,000 to $25,000, is competitive with top British programs.Less prestigious names, like the National University of Ireland Galway, the University of Limerick and the University College Cork, charge about $14,000 and are in cities cheaper than Dublin. Cork has an award-winning green campus with an environmentally minded curriculum to match.The amazing perk of Europe\u2019s public universities is their price tag. In Germany, Norway, France and Austria, they are largely free to anyone from anywhere in the world. Plus, health care is often fully covered, and housing aid available.The rationale for this incredibly generous offer to nontaxpaying foreign nationals is itself an incentive to study in Hamburg or Oslo. With its slumped demographics, Germany wants highly educated people to keep its world-class economy chugging when Germans are too few to do so themselves. In a globalized world, the Netherlands and the Nordics want to bolster their knowledge economies with the world\u2019s brightest, as well as attract international research funding. Foreign students also fuel local economies, whether they pay tuition or not. According to the German Academic Exchange Service, half of foreign students remain after graduation.Germany, like most of Europe, is a newcomer to the bachelor\u2019s degree, part of an overhaul of the traditional universit\u00e4t that was implemented, at first ungladly, at the European Union\u2019s behest. But now Europeans have the drill down, and more English-taught undergraduate programs crop up every year. There were nearly 200 in Germany in 2016, according to the German Academic Exchange Service; about 680 Americans were working toward their B.A. last year, which while not an invasion is almost double that of six years ago.Most English-language bachelor\u2019s at public universities are still in fields that use English anyway, such as English lit or American studies, as well as computer science, hotel management, international relations and international law. Along the Rhine River, deep in viticulture country, Geisenheim University offers an English-language degree in international wine business. And this year, for the first time, a foreigner can study management and technology at the renowned Technical University of Munich, paying for just the cost of living in Bavaria\u2019s capital, about a half-hour from the Alps.Command of a country\u2019s lingua franca opens the door to hundreds more \u201cbilingual bachelor\u2019s,\u201d taught in the native language and English. With advanced German and high school A\u2019s, one could win admission to the top-ranked Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t Munchen (L.M.U. Munich) or to Heidelberg University, as well as Humboldt University in Berlin (Hegel\u2019s old office is just behind the main building).But students say that to do the half-German route, your language skills better be up to snuff. \u201cDoing your bachelor\u2019s degree in German requires a very high knowledge of German that most American students will not attain in such a short time,\u201d said Sofia Isabel Fabiancic, a New York City native who dropped out of New York University\u2019s Berlin-based program as a junior because she wanted \u201ca more immersive experience.\u201d She applied straightaway to the Free University of Berlin. \u201cI had a perfect G.P.A. at N.Y.U. and am now getting really mediocre grades, working harder than I ever did,\u201d she said. But she believes the \u201chuge challenge\u201d will pay off in the end.The same language caveat goes for studies in Spain, where several hundred bilingual courses are listed, along with classes for polishing up your espa\u00f1ol. The University of Lille in France and the University \u200b\u200bof Li\u00e8ge\u200b in Belgium offer bilingual B.A.s, \u200bbut you might want to record lectures for later review, as the French comes at you fast and furious.Most European programs require foreign students to take at least one introductory class in the native tongue, and if English isn\u2019t your native tongue, you have to pass a proficiency test. But in general, the application processes are even easier than those in Britain.Turkish, Dutch, Danish and Polish universities proffer a palette of majors for Anglophones, as well as a few, such as plastic arts in Turkey or Slavic philology in Poland, that you won\u2019t find most anywhere else. Poland\u2019s picturesque student cities of Cracow and Wroclaw are now on the international radar, the newest hot spots among foreign students, even those who hate beets.The Netherlands has about 300 English-language undergraduate degree programs at 42 universities, most of which cost $7,000 to $13,000 a year. Internationals obsessed with the nitty-gritty of how Europe works can enroll in European Union studies at Maastricht University or the University of Amsterdam, a short hop by train to the heart of it all in Brussels. But the Dutch don\u2019t own the field: The London School of Economics and the European University Viadrina, which straddles the Oder River along the German-Polish border, are also big names in E.U.-focused courses.On the Continent, undergraduates are more on their own than in the Anglo-Saxon world, both on and off campus. Foreign students can feel a bit lost, especially at first. Some European programs tend to stress theory in a big way, which can throw hands-on types. In many countries, student housing is an option for one year, but not always beyond that.A bit more mothering comes at a price. There are private colleges, like Schiller International University in Heidelberg and Bard College Berlin. Tuition at Schiller, which also has campuses in Florida, London, Madrid and Paris, is about $17,700, while Bard\u2019s offbeat liberal arts program, strong in social and political thought, runs $27,000 for tuition, room and board. The Bard program is heavy on theory, too \u2014 ethics, aesthetics, modernism, the Greeks \u2014 but on its leafy campus, professors take the thoroughly international student body through the canon in small, informal groups, spoon in hand.In Italy, where public universities are notoriously tough to navigate, there\u2019s John Cabot University, an accredited American university smack in the middle of Rome. Its art history and classical studies majors spend as much time in museums and clambering over archaeological sites as in the classroom.\u201cI\u2019ve learned about my own country through the eyes of people who don\u2019t come from it,\u201d said Gillian McMurray, a John Cabot senior from Chicago. Ms. McMurray admits that the lower cost played in her decision to study abroad, noting that her four years will cost less than her brother\u2019s at University of Michigan. She\u2019s learned how to speak and write in Italian and, she says, no longer hangs around exclusively with other Americans, the way the semester-abroad students tend to do.\u201cI\u2019ve become more aware of myself,\u201d she said.Academies Down Under are a magnet for international students, not least because their Foreign Ministry doles out plentiful scholarships. That\u2019s critical, because the average cost of an academic year is comparatively pricey \u2014 about $23,000 to $28,000 in tuition alone \u2014 though many programs take only three years to complete.Australian National University (ranked 22nd in the world by QS World University Rankings), the University of Melbourne and the University of Sydney all carry the imprimatur of first-rate centers of research and learning. At the University of Queensland, undergraduates can study marine sciences at field stations on the Great Barrier Reef in disciplines like physical and molecular science, engineering, ecology, nature conservation and global change science. And internationals rave about the robust campus life, beaches and cosmopolitan cities.This island nation of 5.5 million has six national universities, all steeped in the British tradition, a hangover from colonial rule that serves it well today. English is one of the city-state\u2019s four official languages, but you can always learn a bit of Mandarin, Malay or Tamil.The \u201clion city\u201d is known for its thriving, globalized economy and is fast becoming a hub of higher education. The universities, like the top-flight National University of Singapore (tuition: $21,125), are as international as the city, with one in five students from abroad. The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Yale and the Technical University of Munich are among private Western universities with collaborative programs there. Another plus: The travel opportunities \u2014 to Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia \u2014 are mouthwatering.Bachelor\u2019s programs in English have been sprouting like wild dandelions across the middle kingdom, most of them in business and technical fields, reflecting the Chinese economy\u2019s keen interest in graduates with expertise in those subjects and knowledge of Chinese ways. The University of Science and Technology of China, widely considered among China\u2019s finest, is just one example; it offers bachelor\u2019s degrees in English in materials science and engineering and in environmental engineering. The country\u2019s ambitious goal is to double its international students by 2020 to half a million.So far, though, at least from the West, it\u2019s been mostly students with Chinese in their family tree who have ventured to Chinese universities. The cultural differences, from gastronomy to pedagogy, present a strange world to most young people from foreign shores.Insiders gripe that the big, traditional universities simply translate their standard curriculum into English, which makes the programs a better fit for native Chinese students with strong English than for Western students. Even those fired up to learn Mandarin are best advised to have some under their belt before taking the plunge. But with annual tuition rates between $3,300 and $9,900, and cheap student digs, there are open-ended possibilities there for those who see the future in a rising China.An easier way to go is the Sino-British College in Shanghai (tuition, room, board: $15,000). This pioneer project, now a decade old, is the brainchild of nine universities in Britain and the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, situated on the latter\u2019s campus in this buzzing port city. The four-year bachelor\u2019s is British, as is most of the teaching power. Students can switch to one of the British universities or do the whole program in China. The college prides itself on nurturing cross-cultural smarts and placing graduates in companies in Asia, like Volkswagen and Accenture. If China seems a long way to go for a college visit, take the two-and-a-half minute YouTube tour.You can also look into N.Y.U. Shanghai, one of three pillars of New York University\u2019s global network, along with Abu Dhabi and New York City. N.Y.U. has caught plenty of flak for locating liberal arts programs in countries ruled by monarchs and Communists, but it contends that its schools are unimpeded bastions of free thought in illiberal environments. Shanghai, like Abu Dhabi, is a full undergraduate campus. It costs about the same, too, at $64,722 a year, including travel, room and board.The internationals say they love the \u201ccraziness\u201d of Shanghai, and after a bit feel at home. \u201cThere\u2019s no divide between the Chinese nationals, Americans and other foreign students here,\u201d said Noah Greyson Singer from Jupiter, Fla., who rooms with a Chinese national. The program currently has 1,112 undergraduates \u2014 54 percent Chinese nationals, 28 percent American and the remainder from 64 other countries. Mr. Singer admits to having felt a pang of homesickness at first, but got over it with the help of Skype.\u201cFamily and friends,\u201d he said, \u201care just a call away.\u201dAn article on Page 21 this weekend about obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree abroad misidentifies the alma mater of James Joyce. It is the University College Dublin, not Trinity College Dublin. The article also misidentifies the country that is home to the University of Liege. It is Belgium, not France. And the article misidentifies a university that ranks alongside Ivies. It is the University of Edinburgh, not Edinburgh College.Paul Hockenos, who is based in Berlin, is author of \u201cBerlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Loud Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin,\u201d to be published in the spring.

{"Headline": "Trump-Size Idea for a New President: Build Something Inspiring", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseHere\u2019s how President-elect Trump could unify a bitterly divided America, provide well-paying jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for him, and lift the economy, stock market and tax rolls.All he needs to do is what he presumably does best: build something.And I don\u2019t mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge.Build something awe-inspiring. Something Americans can be proud of. Something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come.All of these are Depression-era public works projects that are still in use.In fairness to Mr. Obama, Republicans in Congress bitterly opposed his public works spending plans, and he lamented there were too few \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects.That didn\u2019t stop Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration, using combinations of public and private money, solicited proposals from states and cities, hired millions of workers and eventually built 78,000 bridges, 650,000 miles of roads, 700 miles of airport runways, 13,000 playgrounds and 125,000 military and civilian buildings, including more than 40,000 schools \u2014 in most cases to high standards of quality and design.The federal government built the La Guardia, Ronald Reagan Washington National and Los Angeles International airports, the Upper Mississippi locks and dams, the Bonneville power project on the Columbia River, the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge in New York, and the Florida Keys Overseas Highway. Most are still in use today. To a large degree, this is the infrastructure that made America great, to borrow Mr. Trump\u2019s catchphrase.What Roosevelt accomplished \u201cis astounding,\u201d said Scott Myers-Lipton, a sociology professor at San Jose State University and author of the books \u201cRebuild America: Solving the Economic Crisis Through Civic Works\u201d and \u201cEnding Extreme Inequality.\u201dBut it\u2019s not so much the numbers people remember today. \u201cMost people just know there was an alphabet soup of organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they see and remember are the landmarks: the Bay Bridge, Reagan National Airport or the baseball stadium in San Jose. We\u2019re living on that legacy today.\u201dRepealing Obamacare, lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy people, overhauling the immigration system and privatizing Medicare \u2014 what congressional Republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities \u2014 would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines. But nearly everyone agrees that America has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the world, notably China, has raced ahead.Who could disagree? Hillary Clinton also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending.\u201cThe single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation network, the highways, railroads and airports,\u201d said Roger Noll, an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s been neglected for 30 years.\u201d\u201cI was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media sensation,\u201d he told me this week from California, where he\u2019s working on the state\u2019s high-speed rail project. \u201cI found out it\u2019s pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure. For a nation that leads the world in global trade, our systems are failing.\u201dPulling off something on the scale of the Depression-era public works programs would be no small feat. Recent federal infrastructure efforts, including reconstruction after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, as well as the Obama stimulus program, hardly inspire confidence.Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia, said he doubted Mr. Trump could replicate Roosevelt\u2019s achievements. \u201cRoosevelt had a coherent mission, if not always a consistent way to address the Depression and the economic crisis,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cHe was eclectic in his approach because he was pragmatic.\u201dEven more important, \u201cRoosevelt was informed, surrounded himself with informed people, and was prepared on Day 1 to begin. I\u2019m not sure that Trump\u2019s policies go beyond his electioneering slogans,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid a new P.W.A.,\u201d he added, referring to the Public Works Administration, \u201cwill stand for Promises Without Actions.\u201dBut in the spirit of magnanimity, let\u2019s give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt, as Mr. Obama has suggested. He\u2019ll need his own versions of Harold L. Ickes, Roosevelt\u2019s interior secretary, who ran the P.W.A., and his close adviser Harry L. Hopkins, who ran the W.P.A.So where should President Trump start?For a sense of what might be possible, I asked Mr. McNichol to pretend he had just been tapped as Mr. Trump\u2019s new infrastructure czar and to come up with a list of his top 10 infrastructure projects, balanced between red and blue states. Most are shovel-ready, or close to it. Here\u2019s what he suggested, along with estimated costs:Cost: $23.9 billionCost: $65 billionAmerica\u2019s first modern high-speed rail project would connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, about 400 miles apart, in under three hours.Cost: $2.1 billionA rebounding Detroit needs another link to Canada. The privately owned Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, serves over three million vehicles a year and is one of the busiest border crossings in North America.Cost: $3 billionSeven new sewage and water tunnels would rescue Cleveland\u2019s antiquated lines, which are overwhelmed by even moderate rainfall and feed contaminated water into Lake Erie. Picture pristine beaches and fishing, swimming and kayaking along a rejuvenated North Coast.Cost: $100 billionTraveling at 300 miles per hour on a cushion of air, magnetically levitated trains could cut the commute from New York to Washington to an hour and render the painfully slow Acela obsolete.Cost: $20 billionCost: $1.17 billionCost: $5.6 billionThe Washington metro area suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in the country. Maryland wants to build more than 16 miles of light rail to link its suburbs to Washington\u2019s existing Metro system (which needs extensive repairs) and Amtrak. Supporters say it would remove 17,000 cars each day from area roads.Cost: $685 millionCost: $10 billionEven without a federal program, Texans are actively looking for private investors for a high-speed rail link between Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. Passengers would make the 240-mile, one-stop trip in 90 minutes. If successful, the line could be extended to San Antonio and Austin, covering the so-called Texaplex, which includes 75 percent of the state\u2019s population and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies.The Common Sense column on Friday, about major public works projects that President-elect Donald J. Trump might consider, erroneously included one project among those started under the New Deal.

It was planned, and site preparation had begun, before the New Deal.The Common Sense column on Friday, about major public works projects that President-elect Donald J. Trump might consider, referred imprecisely to the Golden Gate Bridge. While the Works Progress Administration did site work and lighting and built approaches and ramps, the bridge itself was not a project of the New Deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Foe of Dodd-Frank Says Overhaul Will Face Test in Senate", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A prominent Republican lawmaker on Wednesday laid out his agenda for restructuring the financial system in the next Congress, including his plan to roll back major portions of the Dodd-Frank Act.Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has long been a vocal opponent of the 2010 financial reform law. But he now has an ally in President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has repeatedly called for taking apart Dodd-Frank, and he has Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.\u201cThere has been a fairly constant dialogue with the Trump transition team about the Choice Act,\u201d he said on Wednesday during a lunch meeting of the Exchequer Club in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s also been dialogue with our speaker and our leader in the House.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s transition team has said on its website that it \u201cwill be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage growth and job creation.\u201dMr. Hensarling\u2019s bill seeks to revamp the oversight of financial institutions and how big banks are wound down in times of trouble, as well as make structural changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the broader rule-making process. It would also repeal the Volcker Rule, which is intended to stop banks from making risky bets with their own money, and call for stronger penalties for bankers who break the law, among other provisions.Mr. Hensarling introduced the plan in June, and the Financial Services Committee approved it in September with a vote largely along party lines.\u201cEven though Republicans will be nominally in charge of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue soon, I remain painfully aware of the Senate\u2019s cloture rules,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said. \u201cThat means there will continue to be a need to work with members of the other party.\u201dHe added that his team was \u201cre-examining our legislation\u201d since the committee approved it and that he was \u201cinterested in working on a 2.0 version.\u201dBut whether Democrats will offer support is another matter.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of the most outspoken supporters of Dodd-Frank, has already vowed to protect core tenets of the law, including her brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.This week, she warned lawmakers on Twitter that any votes to weaken the consumer agency, from either side of the aisle, \u201cwill declare loud & clear they represent giant banks, not working families.\u201dMr. Hensarling was rumored to be on the shortlist for Treasury secretary in the days after the election, though he has said he is not seeking a cabinet position. Instead, it appears he hopes to make inroads in Congress.\u201cA hard-fought election may be over, but our work is just beginning,\u201d he said during his remarks.In addition to undoing large parts of Dodd-Frank, Mr. Hensarling noted that he planned to pursue reforms to the Federal Reserve and an overhaul of the housing finance system, including the unwinding of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those efforts would most likely build on previously introduced legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy \u2014 it\u2019s the very definition of a \u2018heavy lift,\u2019 but our committee looks forward to working with the Trump administration, to finally build a housing finance system that is sustainable for homeowners, for hard-working taxpayers and for our economy,\u201d he said.Of the Federal Reserve, the chairman added, \u201cour economy would be healthier \u2014 and more Americans would have the opportunity to achieve success \u2014 if our Federal Reserve did not wander into fiscal policy and if our Federal Reserve conducted monetary policy in a more transparent, rule-like fashion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voters Legalize Marijuana in Three States", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byVoters in California, Massachusetts and Nevada legalized marijuana on Tuesday in what advocates said was a reflection of the country\u2019s changing attitude toward the drug.Leading up to the election, recreational marijuana use was legal in four states: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, along with the District of Columbia.With the addition of California, Massachusetts and Nevada, the percentage of Americans living in states where marijuana use is legal for adults rose above 20 percent, from 5 percent.Supporters in California portrayed legalization as both a social justice and a criminal justice issue, saying the measure would help redress the disproportionate numbers of arrests and convictions among minorities for drug crimes.A bill to legalize marijuana in Vermont, supported by Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, failed this year. But in Massachusetts, public support for legalization rose during the fall, even with bipartisan opposition from the state\u2019s top elected officials and an organized anti-legalization campaign.In addition to Tuesday\u2019s votes on recreational marijuana, Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota all passed medical marijuana initiatives.Among the other major ballot measures:Voters in Massachusetts easily turned aside a $26 million effort to increase the number of charter schools, delivering a blow to that movement and a victory for the unions that spent heavily trying to defeat it.\u201cWe held the line,\u201d said Barbara Madeloni, the president of the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, the Massachusetts Teachers Association. She added, \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy our public schools.\u201dThe initiative, which would have allowed up to 12 new charter schools to open in the state each year, became the most hotly contested election issue in deeply Democratic Massachusetts, with spending on the question shattering state records as the campaign turned into a pitched battle over the role of charter schools and unions in the public school system.There was little dispute from either side that the existing 78 charter schools had performed well. But the state caps how much money communities can send to charter schools, and nine communities, including Boston, have hit the cap or can open only one more school, and thus have long wait lists. The battle turned to the question of equality: Would creating more charters help close the achievement gap for minority children in those cities? Or would it drain money from traditional public schools and create a tiered education system?Opponents spent about $15 million trying to defeat the initiative, hoping to show that unions in Massachusetts still have the clout to stop the charter movement, which has expanded rapidly in other parts of the country.JESS BIDGOODVoters in four states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington \u2014 approved initiatives to increase minimum wages, furthering a national trend toward greater compensation and benefits for the country\u2019s lowest-paid workers.The proposals that were approved will elevate the states\u2019 wage floors to amounts ranging from $12 to $13.50 an hour by 2020. Voters in a fifth state, South Dakota, rejected, by a large margin, a measure to exclude teenage workers from an across-the-board increase that passed in 2014.Since 2009, when Congress passed the current floor of $7.25 an hour, President Obama has struggled to rally support for increasing the federal minimum wage. State and local governments have taken on the matter themselves; 18 states have increased their wage floors since 2013, as have dozens of cities, including Santa Fe, N.M., and Lexington, Ky.Supporters say that higher minimum wages, which often go to big-box-store employees and entry-level government workers, allow for more spending, stimulating economies. Opponents say that mandatory increases stymie job creation and leave fewer work opportunities available to those who lack skills and higher education.Minimum wages vary widely across the country. Washington, D.C., has a higher floor than any state, at $11.50 an hour, while five states with no minimum wages \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee \u2014 are held to the lower federal limit.In all of the states that voted on wage increases this year, supporters far outspent their competition. In Arizona, the campaign favoring the wage increase spent $3 million to opponents\u2019 $26,000, according to the latest financial disclosures.CAITLIN DICKERSONWashington turned down a measure intended to make the state the first in the nation to place a tax on carbon emissions.State revenue would not have increased if the tax had been approved. Instead, the money generated would have been offset by reductions in other taxes; the state sales tax would have decreased to 5.5 percent, from 6.5 percent, for example.Supporters argued that residents were morally obligated to combat climate change. Opponents said the tax would hurt residents by increasing gasoline and electricity costs.JULIE TURKEWITZVoters in California, which already has some of the country\u2019s toughest gun laws, passed an initiative tightening them a bit further.California \u2014 one of four states, along with Maine, Nevada and Washington, that were considering gun-related measures \u2014 will require those buying ammunition to complete a background check and to obtain authorization from the state\u2019s Justice Department; ammunition would have to be bought from licensed dealers. The initiative also bans large-capacity magazines for firearms, extending previously passed restrictions on the ownership of such magazines.Voters in Washington State overwhelmingly passed an initiative that will allow courts to issue \u201cextreme risk protection orders\u201d that would prevent the people named in such orders from owning or obtaining firearms if they were deemed at risk of harming themselves or others.In Maine, voters rejected a proposal to more tightly regulate gun purchases by extending the requirement for background checks to most private sales of guns.Nevada voters, however, narrowly approved a proposal similar to Maine\u2019s, requiring most private buyers and sellers to conduct a background check through a licensed gun dealer.JOHN SCHWARTZVoters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment that would have made Colorado the first state in the nation to adopt a single-payer health insurance plan covering all residents.JULIE TURKEWITZColorado voters accepted a proposition that would allow terminally ill people to take their own lives using medication prescribed by a doctor.Proponents argued that the measure would expand options for people facing painful deaths. Opponents said the proposition was morally wrong and deeply flawed because it lacked safeguards against abuse by patients, doctors and insurance companies. JULIE TURKEWITZIn Oklahoma, voters protected the state\u2019s death-penalty procedures. The state, the first to develop the lethal injection protocol, was challenged on the constitutionality of its methods after a botched execution. The referendum will prevent the death penalty from being declared cruel or unusual punishment under the state\u2019s Constitution.Voters rejected Proposition 62, which would have ended the death penalty and set the strongest punishment available under California law as life without the possibility of parole.Residents, however, were leaning in favor of the other measure, Proposition 66, although the margin was razor thin and the race remained too close to call on Wednesday afternoon. That measure was intended to eliminate obstacles to carrying out the death penalty and shorten the time between conviction and execution. JOHN SCHWARTZAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Climate Change Vow, China Pushes to Dig More Coal", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byBut there is a problem: Even as it does so, China is scrambling to mine and burn more coal.A lack of stockpiles and worries about electricity blackouts are spurring Chinese officials to reverse curbs that once helped reduce coal production. Mines are reopening. Miners are being lured back with fatter paychecks.China\u2019s response to coal scarcity shows how hard it will be to wean the country off coal. That makes it harder for China and the world to meet emissions targets, as Chinese coal is the world\u2019s largest single source of carbon emissions from human activities.Among China watchers, the turnabout also has contributed to questions about the fate of China\u2019s current crop of economic planners.Here in Jincheng, a smoggy city in China\u2019s coal country, the about-face has led to a steady hum of activity. On a recent afternoon, other trains stopped to make way for two electric locomotives, their horns blowing, pulling more than 50 empty coal hopper cars ready to be filled. Large coal-carrying trucks now form half-mile lines.Allan Zhang, an electrician who works at a mine here, said his employer had raised monthly pay by nearly 50 percent since the summer.Two years ago brought \u201cthe autumn of coal, and 2015 and earlier this year were the winter of coal,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cNow is the springtime of coal.\u201dThe revival of coal production shows the flaws in the country\u2019s half-finished evolution from central planning to the free market.China\u2019s coal problems stem from a series of official decisions that ramped up activity from energy-intensive industries even as they curbed mining output. Speculators in China\u2019s volatile financial markets, already prone to producing bubbles, ran up the price of coal. Weather and other setbacks haven\u2019t helped.\u201cI get a kick out of people in the West who think China is decarbonizing, because I see no sign of it whatsoever,\u201d said Brock Silvers, a Shanghai banker who has previously served on the boards of two Chinese coal companies.Troubled by pollution and worries about rising sea levels, China moved in recent months to rein in coal. Coal production dropped 3 percent last year \u2014 a result of that effort, but also a sign of slowing economic growth as well as a gradual shift in the Chinese economy toward American-style consumer spending and away from exports and heavy manufacturing.That prompted the International Energy Agency to offer an optimistic reassessment this autumn: Chinese coal use peaked in 2013 and would now decline.China\u2019s reversal now is prompting skepticism. \u201cThere is still a peak coming,\u201d said Xizhou Zhou, the head of Asia and Pacific gas and power analysis at IHS Energy, a global consulting group. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to increase.\u201dIHS Energy forecasts that Chinese coal demand will not peak until 2026.Johannes Tr\u00fcby, a senior coal and power analyst at the International Energy Agency, said that long-term trends in the Chinese economy meant that China\u2019s coal use would decline over all. But with China stepping up production now, he said, \u201cWe cannot exclude the possibility of a transient spike in coal demand in the next couple years that might take demand above 2013.\u201dThe coal situation has put China\u2019s powerful economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, under pressure.Many executives and Chinese political experts predict that coal problems could be the final straw in a long list of difficulties that could lead President Xi Jinping to replace the agency\u2019s director, Xu Shaoshi. Mr. Xu is 65, an age at which Chinese ministers often retire, unless they are kept on to serve their terms or are promoted to vice premier.One of those experts, Christopher K. Johnson, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that such a move \u201cwould be consistent with other recent personnel changes\u201d by Mr. Xi, who is chief of the Communist Party, to eliminate officials beholden to other factions.That could clear the way for Mr. Xu to be replaced by Liu He, a deputy director of the agency who is close to Mr. Xi. Agency officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Two years ago, cutting emissions looked easier for Beijing to achieve. China\u2019s electricity consumption was stalling, and many coal-fired power plants began operating only half the time. But state-owned coal mining enterprises, flush with loans from state-owned banks, kept building more mines, leading to losses and dropping coal prices.But developments were coming together to push prices up. Chinese investors piled into Chinese commodities markets, betting prices would rise. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as more speculators rushed in and bought more coal when prices rose.An unusually hot summer and early autumn added to power demand. China\u2019s banking regulators decided to let banks release a flood of mortgages to home buyers to bolster economic growth. That produced strong demand for electricity from the steel and cement industries.Along the way, China had a run of bad luck. Flooding disrupted mines and rail routes last spring. A government decision to withdraw many trains from service this year for a new safety improvement campaign made it difficult to deliver supplies quickly. As a result, Chinese coal prices almost doubled from the start of this year until early November.\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite fascinating, how all of these things have come together,\u201d said Arnoud Balhuizen, the president of marketing and supply at BHP Billiton, the Australian mining giant.In recent weeks, China changed course. It halted most coal trading on commodities markets and encouraged state-owned mines to sign long-term contracts at low prices with power stations. This month, the National Development and Reform Commission raised the number of days that mines could operate to 330 days per year.China will most likely be able to avoid blackouts, said Chang Yijun, the president of Shanxi Fenwei Energy, a regional coal consulting firm, who added that remaining output caps like the 330-day rule would still limit growth in emissions of greenhouse gases.Residents in mining towns are delighted. An avenue here in Jincheng is lined with huge billboards, each carrying the same cheery message: \u201cCoal prices are going up, and miners are smiling.\u201dMr. Zhang, the mine electrician, said that his mine\u2019s work force had shrunk from 300 two years ago to a maintenance crew of eight early this year, but that it had now expanded to 60 and the mine was still hiring.The mine\u2019s stockpile of coal has nearly vanished. As more coal is hauled up from far underground, it is trucked away within two hours. \u201cLast spring, there were no lines of trucks,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are so many.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.

{"Headline": "For a Welsh City, the Tides Offer Renewal", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported by5 PhotosSWANSEA, Wales \u2014 From the brackish, brown water of the bay, Swansea\u2019s past fortunes are plain to see.The towers of blast furnaces rise from the east at Port Talbot\u2019s struggling steel plant, where workers worry about the fate of their jobs. Swansea\u2019s port, once among Britain\u2019s busiest, now handles only modest commercial traffic. On a nearby mud flat, local cockle pickers collect mollusks along the shore of South Wales, a nod to a previously bustling fish trade.A glimpse of the city\u2019s future may lie beneath the surface of the water.One local company wants to build a series of enormous dams housing dozens of hydroelectric power turbines along the Welsh coast, harnessing the region\u2019s tides. While the technology is still untested, its proponents say the project could generate huge amounts of emission-free electricity.Like many once-powerful industrial centers, Swansea is trying to find a new engine of economic growth. If all goes as planned, the project could rejuvenate a lackluster economy by creating jobs, attract tourists with a distinctive design and fuel urban renewal.\u201cWe really need something different to happen,\u201d said Ashley Jones, whose family has been raking shellfish in the area for six generations. \u201cThings just can\u2019t go on the way they are.\u201dOnce referred to as Copperopolis for its central role in the global trade of copper, which reached a peak in the 1860s, Swansea and the surrounding area was also a force in coal mining and steel production. But decades of international competition, most recently from China, have been tough for the city.Today\u2019s Swansea is far from the throbbing center of industrial activity it once was. A drab and dated downtown contrasts with its long stretch of pebbly beach and a lively bar and restaurant district.Major industries have shut down. And Tata of India, the current owner of the steel works at Port Talbot, which employs 4,000 people, has sent shudders through the area by saying it was exploring options including a sale or a joint venture for the money-losing business.The city \u201clost its way,\u201d said Huw Bowen, a professor of history at Swansea University.The company is pushing a 1.3 billion pound, or $1.6 billion, project to build a looping six-mile wall along the coast that would close off a section of Swansea Bay. The area was chosen for its calm, shallow waters, as well as enormous tidal flows that can trap the unwary but have huge potential to generate electric power. At certain times, gates embedded in the wall would shut, letting the tide build up, and then open to allow the pent-up water to surge through giant turbines.Though solar and wind power are more established forms of renewable energy, tidal energy, in some ways, offers greater potential.Solar and wind sources wax and wane in terms of generating electricity because of changing weather and light conditions, creating difficulties for the grid as it balances supply and demand. The tides, by contrast, are more consistent and create more reliable power.The Swansea project, which aims to power 155,000 homes, is the first in a series of green power programs \u2014 worth an overall \u00a340 billion \u2014 that the company is promoting nationwide.If the Swansea project succeeds, Tidal Lagoon Power hopes to replicate it elsewhere. Another proposed tidal power system, in the Welsh capital, Cardiff, would be comparable in capacity to a new nuclear plant, providing enough electricity for 1.4 million homes, or all of Wales.In a best-case situation, the benefits extend beyond just power generation.A path along the wall is intended to attract sports enthusiasts, promoting tourism. And there is a plan for urban renewal, centered on an oyster-shaped visitors\u2019 center and local art exhibits on the coastal barrier, including a large dragon \u2014 the symbol of Wales. Thousands of jobs could be created, both directly and indirectly.The project represents a chance to arrest \u201ca 40-year decline,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Shorrock.That is the argument supporters of the Swansea plan have been making to the powers that be. Because of its scale, the project needs approval from the British government in London, and probably from Prime Minister Theresa May. A former minister is set to publish a report on the technology\u2019s viability in Britain in the coming weeks.For now, Mr. Shorrock and his colleagues are hopeful.So far, the plan appears to have garnered local support, and central to that has been the promise of jobs.While unemployment of about 5.3 percent in Swansea is only modestly above the British average, much of the city\u2019s population has been grappling with joblessness for generations. Local residents complain of streets plagued by drugs and an economic ladder that can be tough to climb.\u201cThere are too many people here and not enough jobs,\u201d said Kelly Martin, 37, a site manager for a construction company thanks to a local government program that finds work for the long-term unemployed.The Swansea project would directly create 2,200 jobs, with the company pledging that at least half of its spending would remain within Wales, and 65 percent within Britain. Dependent industries, like steel fabrication and aquafarming, would also benefit.As the project awaits approval, Tidal Lagoon Power is lining up investors \u2014 like the infrastructure fund InfraRed Capital Partners, based in London, which wants to put in more than \u00a3100 million \u2014 and suppliers, which range from small local players to behemoths like General Electric.General Electric, which has spent three and a half years developing its proposals for the Swansea lagoon, views the project as a test case for a promising new technology that could be exported around the world.\u201cThis is a significant opportunity to create an industry that can supply a global market,\u201d said Mark Elborne, General Electric\u2019s chief for Britain.That is the hope. The reality is more complex.As with many new renewable energy technologies, the Swansea plan requires a guaranteed price for power. In effect, that is a subsidy the government promises to pay for the electricity generated. The figure would, in theory, gradually wind down as the project becomes more economically viable.The legacy of the region\u2019s declining industrial base also complicates matters, creating a jobs mismatch.There is a shortfall of workers with crucial skills, and local entrepreneurs say finding the welders, metal fabricators and other laborers required to build the Swansea lagoon will be tough. Tidal Lagoon Power is working with local institutes and the Welsh government to ensure appropriate training is available.\u201cThere is quite a large skills shortage,\u201d said David Kieft, who runs an electrical contracting business based in Swansea.To those in Swansea, though, there are few other options.Sipping an evening beer at the city\u2019s yacht club, Nick Revell ticked off a series of businesses that had closed their doors recently. Mr. Revell, who employs several hundred welders and other metal workers at his steel business, sees trouble ahead if the plan is vetoed.\u201cUnless something like this takes off,\u201d he said, referring to the Swansea lagoon, \u201cyou will see more closings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quit Social Media. Your Career May Depend on It.", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsI\u2019m a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a blog. Demographically speaking I should be a heavy social media user, but that is not the case. I\u2019ve never had a social media account.At the moment, this makes me an outlier, but I think many more people should follow my lead and quit these services. There are many issues with social media, from its corrosion of civic life to its cultural shallowness, but the argument I want to make here is more pragmatic: You should quit social media because it can hurt your career.This claim, of course, runs counter to our current understanding of social media\u2019s role in the professional sphere. We\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s important to tend to your so-called social media brand, as this provides you access to opportunities you might otherwise miss and supports the diverse contact network you need to get ahead. Many people in my generation fear that without a social media presence, they would be invisible to the job market.I think this behavior is misguided. In a capitalist economy, the market rewards things that are rare and valuable. Social media use is decidedly not rare or valuable. Any 16-year-old with a smartphone can invent a hashtag or repost a viral article. The idea that if you engage in enough of this low-value activity, it will somehow add up to something of high value in your career is the same dubious alchemy that forms the core of most snake oil and flimflam in business.Professional success is hard, but it\u2019s not complicated. The foundation to achievement and fulfillment, almost without exception, requires that you hone a useful craft and then apply it to things that people care about. This is a philosophy perhaps best summarized by the advice Steve Martin used to give aspiring entertainers: \u201cBe so good they can\u2019t ignore you.\u201d If you do that, the rest will work itself out, regardless of the size of your Instagram following.A common response to my social media skepticism is the idea that using these services \u201ccan\u2019t hurt.\u201d In addition to honing skills and producing things that are valuable, my critics note, why not also expose yourself to the opportunities and connections that social media can generate? I have two objections to this line of thinking.My research on successful professionals underscores that this experience is common: As you become more valuable to the marketplace, good things will find you. To be clear, I\u2019m not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant. I\u2019m instead arguing that you don\u2019t need social media\u2019s help to attract them.My second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless. Consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy. Social media weakens this skill because it\u2019s engineered to be addictive. The more you use social media in the way it\u2019s designed to be used \u2014 persistently throughout your waking hours \u2014 the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom.Once this Pavlovian connection is solidified, it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require, and your brain simply won\u2019t tolerate such a long period without a fix. Indeed, part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate \u2014 the skill on which I make my living.The idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete, and it should be to you if you\u2019re serious about creating things that matter.Most social media is best described as a collection of somewhat trivial entertainment services that are currently having a good run. These networks are fun, but you\u2019re deluding yourself if you think that Twitter messages, posts and likes are a productive use of your time.If you\u2019re serious about making an impact in the world, power down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work.Cal Newport is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and the author of \u201cDeep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World\u201d (Grand Central).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Question on Climate Crisis: How to Inspire Innovation", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byAround the world, energy innovation seems to be speeding up. Large historical forces are converging to create unprecedented turmoil and opportunity in what had long been one of the most hidebound industries.The changes are coming just as governments have finally resolved, after two decades of failed efforts, to tackle the global climate crisis. The emissions that cause global warming have already fallen in some of the biggest countries, including the United States.Yet none of it is happening fast enough.Experts say that to forestall the worst effects of global warming, emissions need to drop by 80 percent or more globally by 2050, a mere 34 years from now. But at a global scale they are not falling at all, and the promises countries have made about the energy transition, even if kept, would get the world nowhere close to where it needs to be.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.That means, experts say, that innovation in the field of energy will have to accelerate if governments hope to stave off catastrophe.While the cost of renewable energy sources has plunged, it is still not low enough in most places to drive dirty energy out of the market. And while renewables have shown that they can replace large amounts of fossil fuels, many experts say they believe they cannot do the whole job and new technologies will be needed in coming decades to get greenhouse emissions to zero.Progress on those new approaches has been halting, at best. So the future habitability of the Earth might depend on the answer to this question: How can innovation in the energy business be pushed into overdrive?Many people have a pretty clear idea about how innovation works \u2014 or at least they think they do.After all, millions of people have one of the most dazzling fruits of modern technology, the smartphone, in their pockets. At the root of innovations like the smartphone and the flat-screen television are microchips that get ever faster, reducing the cost of gadgets even as their capabilities mushroom.Now that almost everyone accepts that dirty energy is a problem, could it not be fixed with that same kind of innovation? It is a rational question, and only a few years ago some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley were asking it, too.Billions of dollars poured into \u201cclean-tech\u201d investments. Most of them failed, and within a few years, investors were acknowledging they had misjudged the difficulty of the problem.\u201cThey ran up against the hard realities of the energy sector,\u201d which does not remotely work the same way as most of the technologies emerging from Silicon Valley, Mr. Norris said.To understand why, start with this: Though energy may appear to be a free market, with prices rising and falling as traders buy and sell oil and electricity, appearances are deceiving.The most obvious example is electricity. Because the delivery of electricity is a natural monopoly \u2014 multiple sets of wires would be a chaotic mess \u2014 state governments essentially took control of the electricity business a century ago.They dictated what companies were allowed to build and set the prices they were allowed to charge, usually by lumbering, bureaucratic procedures that took years. The focus was on forcing the utilities to keep prices low while eking out modest returns on their investments.Not surprisingly, electric utilities were among the least innovative businesses in the entire economy, spending next to nothing on research and development. Some aspects of the business have been reformed in recent years, but progress has been halting.That means governments exercise a huge influence over supply; they can and do manipulate it for reasons having nothing to do with business principles.On top of that, the oil industry benefited for decades from government favoritism, including big tax breaks in the United States and big consumer subsidies in other countries, that helped lock in a global dependency on oil.As it became clear late in the 20th century that the emissions from coal, oil and natural gas threatened the world\u2019s climate, a cry for change arose.But the tight linkages between energy companies and governments meant that if change was to come, it would only come as a result of strong public policies.That, in turn, set off a debate that is still underway: What, exactly, should those policies be?For two decades, Europe has been the world\u2019s hothouse of experimentation in energy policy. Along the way, European governments have learned painful, expensive lessons.The governments saw promise in technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, but realized these would never be able to compete with entrenched utilities unless the market for them grew large enough that manufacturers could benefit from economies of scale. They tackled that head-on, creating subsidies funded from the pockets of electricity consumers.It worked, driving down the cost of renewables at a precipitous pace in recent years. Germany has pushed hardest among the large European countries and now gets a third of its power from various forms of renewable energy.State governments in the United States also adopted renewable targets, though the United States is behind Germany, with about 13 percent renewable electricity, counting power from dams.Despite their success in building the market, European governments were slow to adjust their subsidies, even as renewable power grew cheaper. Over time, the cost ballooned. The average German family is paying close to $300 a year on its electricity bill to support the green-energy push.Among environmental groups, the subsidies and mandates are largely seen as a success.That view is supported by a powerful argument: Economists have recognized that the falling cost of green energy is directly related to the size of the market. Every time the market for solar panels doubles, for instance, their cost falls by nearly 20 percent, according to research from a consultancy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance.So the preferred energy policy of the green groups is basically a more ambitious version of this established approach. If governments keep using subsidies and mandates to push for scale, they say they believe green energy will eventually be able to compete on economic grounds, giving society the tools it needs to reach low emissions by the middle of this century.But many energy experts say they believe this will not be enough, and see an urgent need to speed the pace of research and development. Their concerns center on the limitations of renewable power. Because the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, solar panels and wind turbines are not entirely reliable sources of electricity.Now, they are finding a better way.Recently, instead of handing out fixed subsidies, they have been running \u201creverse auctions\u201d for new wind projects. The company that asks for the lowest subsidy on a particular project gets the deal, and the subsidy.The results have been startling, awakening fierce price competition among the developers of wind projects.Offshore wind farms have been installed only in shallow water, but Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, and other companies are pursuing floating turbines that could work in many parts of the world where the sea floor drops off steeply. Statoil will soon start building the first commercial project of this type, a pilot off the coast of Scotland.On the outskirts of this city, it is testing a method in which surplus electricity would be used to heat up rocks, with the heat recovered later and used to generate power when renewable output is low. The energy could potentially be stored for days or weeks. The company will begin a much larger test next year.\u201cWe already know it works,\u201d said Till Barmeier, the Siemens project manager, as he offered a tour of the hot rocks one recent afternoon. \u201cThe question is, does it work well enough?\u201dEven with all the recent progress, it is still unclear just how far renewable energy can go.A few experts argue that the electricity system could go 100 percent renewable. But others reject that because of the intermittency problem, arguing that in the 2030s and beyond, society will need new huge power plants that can run most of the time without generating greenhouse emissions.If they are correct, only a handful of options are on the horizon.They could include new types of nuclear power plants, designed so that it is physically impossible for them to explode or leak radiation. Another possibility is to burn fossil fuels, but to capture the emissions.With big ideas like this, the basic problem is that building a large prototype plant can easily cost $1 billion or more, and private financiers are often reluctant to take the risk on unproven technology.One solution, of course, is for governments to spend money to subsidize big demonstration projects. Many Americans probably imagine that quite a bit is being spent already. But the numbers are actually low. The federal budget devoted to new energy technology is on the order of $6 billion a year, less money than American consumers spend on potato chips.It is not yet clear, though, whether Congress will honor President Obama\u2019s pledge.Speaking recently in New York, the secretary of energy, Ernest J. Moniz, sounded optimistic. He said he believed the political parties could find common ground by focusing on energy innovation, and if they did so, \u201cthe American approach\u201d would prevail.What is that approach?\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Dr. Moniz explained. \u201cWe recognize it. We solve it.\u201dFollow Justin Gillis on Twitter @JustinHGillisLike the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Odes to Military March, China Puts Nationalism Into Overdrive", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 It took all of five minutes for Wang Lei, a gruff veteran of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, to start humming and stomping his feet.The curtain had just risen on \u201cThe Long March,\u201d a new opera celebrating the early days of the Chinese Communist Party, and a rifle-toting chorus of performers dressed as soldiers was rushing onstage at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing.\u201cWe come from different places,\u201d they sang as they took their places. \u201cSome wear straw sandals. Some wear gowns. Some are barefoot. Some are hungry. We differ in status, but we have the same aspiration: to join the Red Army. To change the world!\u201dMr. Wang, 73, seated next to me in the upper balcony, closed his eyes in bliss. \u201cThese are the songs of our homeland,\u201d he told me at intermission. \u201cThey might be lost now, but they reflect the true feelings of the Chinese people.\u201dThese are triumphant times for the Communist Party. President Xi Jinping, the general secretary, governs with seemingly unobstructed authority. The balance of power in Asia and the Pacific appears to be shifting in China\u2019s favor. Extreme poverty, especially in rural areas, is nearing eradication.And yet the Communist government seems intensely vulnerable at times as it confronts a slowing economy and a society in the throes of staggering change. In a country still working to find its place in the world, the party whips up nationalism as an elixir. Lately, it has gone into overdrive, inventing new forms of agitprop.Across China this fall, the party is turning the obscure anniversary of a cherished political touchstone into a cause for passionate celebration. It has been 80 years, we are told again and again, since the end of the Long March, the 6,000-mile retreat of Communist forces that established Mao\u2019s pre-eminence and gave the party its soul. More than 80,000 people died in the march, which began in 1934, but the bravery of the soldiers inspired generations of Chinese people to rally behind the party and its leader.In Beijing, it is impossible to miss the patriotic fervor. Outside my office, a giant LED screen flashes every few minutes with scenes from \u201cRed Star Over China,\u201d a new mini-series about the Long March.At home in Beijing on a recent Saturday night, I was bombarded with Long March coverage on nearly every TV channel. On one network, a troupe of child performers, dressed in gray military uniforms, sang of the power of the \u201cbright red star to shine through the generations.\u201d On a financial channel, commentators offered analysis of the economic impact of the march.President Xi has been making the case for a \u201cnew long march,\u201d using the anniversary to rally the public and warn against creeping complacency, especially among the young. \u201cA nation that forgets its origins will find itself in a blind alley,\u201d he said in a speech late last month.On the whole, the spirit of the propaganda campaign is unambiguous: Chinese citizens should seek to emulate the ideals of self-sacrifice and perseverance that the soldiers of the Long March embodied. Above all, the messaging makes clear, people should show unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party.The Long March allowed the Red Army to escape defeat at the hands of the Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-shek in southern China. The Communists regrouped in the north before going on to victory in the civil war in 1949.Anne-Marie Brady, a professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has challenged the official narrative, which portrays the march as a victory for the Communists and a turning point in their efforts to win over the public. Pointing to testimonials of foreign missionaries captured by Communist soldiers, she argues that it was instead a humiliating moment in which Red Army soldiers ransacked villages and abused peasants.But by invoking the journey, she said, Mr. Xi is betting that the party\u2019s idealized version of history will resonate across generations.\u201cThis is a heroic narrative that is meant to inspire young people in China,\u201d Professor Brady said. \u201cXi wants to remind people what is unique and distinctive about China and to ask: \u2018How did we get to where we are today? What is this journey that we\u2019re on? What are we aiming toward?\u2019 \u201dMr. Xi has used the Long March more expansively than his predecessors, linking it to his signature slogan of a \u201cChina Dream,\u201d a call to build a prosperous, more powerful nation with a deeper respect for traditional culture.The propaganda might help rally the public behind the party as it asserts Chinese military might abroad, in the disputed South China Sea and elsewhere. And the Chinese government has also tried to draw connections between the Long March and modern-day social issues.A scene in \u201cThe Long March\u201d in which soldiers are under fire.A book released in conjunction with the anniversary promotes the Red Army\u2019s support for gender equality. (\u201cWomen demand liberation! Who says they are inferior to men?\u201d) A concert to mark the anniversary showed the Red Army being greeted by an adoring crowd of ethnic minorities, a stark contrast to the ethnic tensions that plague parts of China today, including Tibet and Xinjiang.Some hope the Long March will become a call to arms that helps China overcome challenges such as a slowing economy and rampant social inequality.\u201cNowadays, the younger generation is very fickle and impetuous,\u201d said Xie Haishan, 32, an employee at a social welfare organization in Beijing who attended the opera and a Long March museum exhibit. \u201cMany people are shortsighted and lack the kind of commitment seen during the Long March. That\u2019s what we need nowadays.\u201d\u201cThe Long March\u201d opera, in development for four years, is a highlight of the government\u2019s unfolding spectacle, featuring a cast of nearly 200 and a cymbal-heavy score that blends Chinese folk songs with Italian-style arias. It is one of the grandest political operas to debut in Beijing since the Cultural Revolution, when Mao and his wife, Jiang Qing, made works celebrating the Communist Party a mandatory part of the repertoire at Chinese concert halls.Yan Weiwen, a prominent tenor who plays the leading role of Commissar Peng, a military official, said the tenacity of Red Army soldiers set an example for all Chinese people.\u201cThe Long March spirit will help Chinese people forge ahead,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur lives will only be better if we have conviction and dreams.\u201dNear the end of the opera, as Red Army soldiers confront the scourges of disease and starvation, eating tree bark to survive, a young soldier named Ping Yazi is poisoned by wild vegetables. He becomes lost in a swamp, firing a shot into the air to warn away his fellow troops.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death,\u201d he sings, sinking underground. \u201cI\u2019m just reluctant to leave the Red Army.\u201dSoon after, red lights illuminate the theater, revolutionary flags fill the stage, and a song-and-dance routine breaks out. \u201cLong live the Red Army!\u201d the soldiers sing. \u201cLong live the Long March!\u201dMr. Wang, the P.L.A. veteran sitting next to me, rose to his feet. He looked to the stage, squinted his eyes and shouted, \u201cBravo!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 14, 2016Joshua WrightMatt StollerThe proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger is a watershed moment for our political system. Will we continue to allow the further concentration of economic power at the top, or will this be the moment when democracy fights back?ATT-Time Warner would be a giant in pay-TV, wireless service, broadband, news and entertainment \u2014 it could certainly shape the media to its advantage in a myriad different ways. But most people don't need these studies to know they are being ripped off by their cell phone, broadband, and cable providers, and that medicine and air travel, for example, cost too much. But the U.S. has a model for de-concentrating power in order to lift up the middle class. More interesting still: The concentration bill was approved by all parties in Israel, from the extreme right to the extreme left \u2014 a rare feat in a country with fractious politics. Starting with AT&T-Time Warner, perhaps stronger anti-monopoly policy is something all Americans can agree on.\u201cBig is bad\u201d is perhaps the only thing this year's presidential candidates agreed upon.  Too many big mergers, too little enforcement, goes the narrative.Sometimes a concentrated industry is noncompetitive. Consider hospitals, where the Federal Trade Commission has successfully challenged proposed mergers with convincing economic evidence that greater concentration would lead to increases in price and reduced quality of service. What's more, the evidence that supports the conclusion that markets are actually becoming more concentrated is  exceptionally weak.  The Council of Economic Advisors concluded that we have a monopoly problem because, in a handful of industries, the combined market shares of the top 50 firms have seen a modest increase over the past few decades. But a closer look shows that the council found that the combined market shares of the top 50 firms is below 50 percent in nearly all industry sectors.  The average market share for a firm in these industries is less than 1 percent. That is certainly not evidence of a monopoly problem. Economists have long rejected the \u201cantitrust by the numbers\u201d approach.  Indeed, the quiet consensus among antitrust economists in academia and within the two antitrust agencies is that mergers between competitors do not often lead to market power but do often generate significant benefits for consumers \u2014 lower prices and higher quality. Sometimes mergers harm consumers, but those instances are relatively rare. Because the economic case for a drastic change in merger policy is so weak, the new critics argue more antitrust enforcement is good for political reasons. Big companies have more political power, they say, so more antitrust can reduce this power disparity. Big companies can pay lower wages, so we should allow fewer big firms to merge to protect the working man. And big firms make more money, so using antitrust to prevent firms from becoming big will reduce income inequality too.  Whatever the merits of these various policy goals, antitrust is an exceptionally poor tool to use to achieve them. Instead of allowing consumers to decide companies\u2019 fates, courts and regulators decided them based on squishy assessments of impossible things to measure, like accumulated political power.  The result was that antitrust became a tool to prevent firms from engaging in behavior that benefited consumers in the marketplace. The antitrust agencies are full of talented economists and lawyers who use the most up-to-date and sophisticated techniques to identify mergers worthy of challenge on behalf of consumers.  Economic analysis has more often than not trumped ideological politics in antitrust policy for the past 35 years.  Let\u2019s keep it that way.Does the government need to more proactively pursue antitrust cases? Is it time to bring back trust-busting?"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Hard to Make a Website for the Government?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.O\u2019Farrell, who has been involved with government food programs since graduating from college nearly three decades ago, understood why his office would be a promising target for this kind of tech push. California\u2019s food-stamp participation rate, roughly 50 percent of eligible residents, was one of the lowest in the country, and the bureaucratic friction in the application process deserved at least some of the blame. Enlisting technology\u2019s aid made a lot of sense: More than three-quarters of Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year now use the internet, and Obamacare has ushered in a new generation of social-service clients who grew up on their smartphones and expect to interact with government the same way they do everything else. Yet CalFresh \u2014 in contrast to the Silicon Valley companies in the neighborhood, where teams of designers, product managers and data scientists cater to their online users with intense precision \u2014 offered a poor \u201cuser experience\u201d for clients on its digital channels. It lacked text or email support; its website didn\u2019t work well on mobile devices. These were just the sorts of problems that Code for America fellows figured they knew how to solve.The fellows soon discovered that an external vendor, Hewlett-Packard, had been contracted for years to maintain the site. A bigger obstacle to remaking MyBenefits CalWin would have been negotiating the cooperation of all 18 counties that used it. But one fellow, Jake Solomon, had an idea. The only information legally needed to submit a complete food-stamp application, he had learned, was a name, an address and a signature. Code for America could work around MyBenefits CalWin and build its own simple website just for CalFresh applicants. At the very least, this would make for a good proof of concept, a way to show various government officials that social-service delivery could be, in Solomon\u2019s words, \u201cdead simple.\u201d In 2014, after his fellowship had ended \u2014 he was still affiliated with Code for America \u2014 Solomon pitched this idea to his colleague Dave Guarino one afternoon, and they coded a prototype over the next few days.The following week, Solomon and Guarino gave a demonstration at O\u2019Farrell\u2019s office. Guarino handed a phone with the prototype on it to O\u2019Farrell, who filled out an application in a few minutes. With its clear language and big buttons, it felt slick, like Twitter or Facebook, not kludgy, like most .gov sites. O\u2019Farrell was impressed. \u201cThis could be a game changer,\u201d he said. \u201cGo for it. We like it.\u201d\u201cMy biggest lesson this year was that local governments are constrained,\u201d Solomon wrote in a blog post. \u201cThey\u2019re constrained by a complex web of local politics, state legislation and federal laws. The constraints cascade downhill, as does the responsibility.\u201dIn 2013, Code for America had nearly 30 fellows \u2014 selected by competitive application \u2014 working on behalf of 10 partner cities. Its annual operating budget was $7 million, more than half of which came from private grants. Pahlka often found herself on the road, giving talks and courting donors. Her pitch was simple: Use technology to make government better. What exactly she meant by that could be hard to parse, but the apps she cited and the anecdotes she shared were compelling, with a folksy, community-driven appeal. (Take care of your neighborhood storm drain!)Solomon, Guarino and Williams, part of the 2013 class of fellows, were initially assigned to different cities and themes. Solomon went to the Human Services Agency of San Francisco. Before Code for America, he worked for the RAND Corporation on health policy; before that he was at Palantir, a Silicon Valley data-analytics start-up that created software for intelligence services and other clients. Guarino, a software developer and policy wonk who had spent time at the California Health Benefits Review Program, devoted his fellowship year to building an app that allowed residents in South Bend, Ind., to report on the conditions of vacant and abandoned properties. Williams, a designer, built digital trail maps for parks in northeast Ohio. As a junior at Tulane during Hurricane Katrina, he had seen the storm sweep across Lake Pontchartrain and then flood much of New Orleans. \u201cI watched government fail on so many levels,\u201d Williams says. \u201cIn this very visible, physical way, where levees failed, but also the soul-crushing process that people went through afterward to get FEMA support.\u201dThe three young men had an easy rapport from the start. None of them fit the stereotype of the Silicon Valley engineer. Each majored in a social science \u2014 Solomon in economics, Guarino in political economy, Williams in English and political science. I saw them at their most animated in long conversations over Mexican takeout, talking about John Rawls and social contracts and the unfortunate amount of discretionary power wielded by street-level bureaucrats. For them, and for many of their Code for America colleagues, technology was a means more than an end, a lever with which they could move people\u2019s lives toward the good. While their peers in Silicon Valley wanted to play with cool new programming languages for the sake of playing with cool new programming languages, Solomon, Guarino and Williams, it seemed, found their motivations elsewhere. \u201cI care about helping people, period,\u201d Guarino told me.The normal process worked like this: Once an application was received \u2014 whether delivered in person, online or via fax \u2014 and entered into the database, the CalFresh office in the applicant\u2019s county would schedule an interview, to be held either over the phone or in person. At these sessions, eligibility workers, whose job is to determine whether clients qualify for social services, review documents like pay stubs, utility bills and identity cards. Eligibility is set at 200 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $41,000 in gross income for a family of three, but subject to a host of caveats; in granting exceptions to these caveats, eligibility workers exercise a great deal of discretion. They can choose to overlook missing documentation or demand additional receipts. They can verbally elicit information omitted from the application.The Code for America team\u2019s plan had always been to leave the scarier stuff off the website \u2014 questions like, \u201cHave you ever traded food stamps for explosives?\u201d or \u201cHave you ever committed a felony?\u201d Those questions could be answered during the live interview. The key was to settle on how much information to ask for at the start. Require too much, and users would be put off and give up; too little, and the eligibility workers, who preferred more details rather than fewer, would complain. In the end, the team settled on a compromise. After the user submitted a name and an address, two choices would present themselves: to continue filling out the rest of the application or to \u201cStop working and submit application now.\u201d Clicking the second option would lead to another page and the warning: \u201cAre you sure you want to submit right now? Since we only know your name and address, it will be hard to process your application. Instead of finishing it on the phone, we will have to send you paperwork in the mail.\u201dThe main technical challenge confronting the team followed directly from Solomon\u2019s initial flash of insight to create an independent site. Because GetCalFresh wasn\u2019t actually replacing MyBenefits CalWin, but was instead just offering an alternative point of access, they still needed to work with its existing infrastructure, which lacked an A.P.I., or application programming interface. Modern websites consist of a front end, or web page (what a user sees on the computer screen); a back end (a database and a server that hosts it); and usually an A.P.I. that sends data between them. We all regularly rely on things that function like A.P.I.s in the physical world. Say, for instance, you want to get takeout from your favorite Chinese restaurant. In this analogy, the front end would be your phone, the back end is the kitchen and the A.P.I. is whichever restaurant employee relays your order to the cooks. She\u2019s how you place an order of dumplings, cancel that order or modify it to include sweet-and-sour soup.In software development, A.P.I.s allow coders to change front-end or back-end components easily, while leaving the core of a program intact. The lack of an A.P.I. for MyBenefits CalWin meant that GetCalFresh, however great it looked, couldn\u2019t actually put any information into the earlier site\u2019s database. The state would not officially know about any of the applications it received; it wouldn\u2019t even know where to send a check. So the Code for America team\u2019s members, when they received an application through GetCalFresh, needed to figure out a way to get that information into the MyBenefits CalWin system.In April 2015, Guarino, while on a trip to Utah with Solomon and Williams, finally came up with a workaround. If the problem they faced was relying on people to manually enter information into the database, why not just write some code to take care of that part? Guarino used a technology called Selenium WebDriver that mimicked a user\u2019s activity on a website. Playing the role of the applicant, the webdriver would go to MyBenefits CalWin\u2019s front end and fill in each question using the information collected through GetCalFresh, then click \u201cnext.\u201d This was not exactly best practice when it came to coding: Webdrivers are used primarily in testing web applications, not in their actual operation. Because the webdriver couldn\u2019t catch all errors, when someone mistakenly submitted an impossible birth date, for example, or a nonexistent ZIP code, that information would trigger an error when it was entered into the legacy system. A human being would then have to correct the information from that faulty entry by hand.Williams worried, when giving demonstrations to county representatives, that the whole process would seem amateurish to them, the way it sometimes did to him. But he came to realize that the existing systems used by CalFresh staff members tended to be far more cumbersome and time-intensive than his inelegant webdriver. They didn\u2019t see the absence of tests and logs, the redundant code, the inability to deal with errors like missing information gracefully. He recalled a presentation at which the projector was broken, so the audience gathered around his computer. When he ran the webdriver, a new browser window opened up straight away to the legacy website, and the applicant\u2019s data automatically appeared, as if typed in by unseen fingers. Williams describes it as \u201ca magical moment.\u201d The genius of the webdriver was that it didn\u2019t require clerical workers to do anything different: no encryptions, no new data entry or software systems to deal with. It did exactly what workers at food banks and community-based organizations already did \u2014 fill out the legacy application on behalf of clients \u2014 except faster. It reinforced technology\u2019s most basic power: the ability of automation to eliminate boring and repetitive tasks.No one had a good answer, including the executives at Code for America. By many measures, GetCalFresh had surpassed all of the nonprofit\u2019s previous projects, and Code for America now found itself in unfamiliar territory. It had typically presented its projects as proofs of concept, but many of them, as one of the organization\u2019s officials later admitted in a blog post, lacked \u201cconsistent paths to sustainability.\u201d By that fall, out of the many dozens of apps created by Code for America fellows, fewer than 10 had found enough support to justify being spun off into start-ups. Many of them had not been updated on Github, the website where most collaborative coding projects are hosted, in months.As Solomon, Guarino and Williams saw it, a couple of obvious paths lay before them. The first was to solicit funds from traditional philanthropic sources. The second was to become a government I.T. vendor and sell to other counties and states. Neither path appealed to them. Donor funding, while probably necessary in the short term, seemed unsustainable in the long term \u2014 especially because, under the reigning Silicon Valley ethos, even philanthropic tech projects are expected to present a business model. Government I.T. vending work, on the other hand, was self-sufficient but uninspired. It was limited, by definition, to what was imagined under any given contract. \u201cIt abdicated responsibility for anything outside the software,\u201d Williams says. And for all of Code for America\u2019s beliefs that tech could serve as a lever for good, the bad code plaguing the public sector was rarely the only problem with a particular program; it would be a hollow improvement to give CalFresh a better application site without, say, making sure that reminder letters were sent out before an appointment or that the customer-support lines were adequately staffed.As the months passed and the financing remained unresolved, the team submitted proposals to several organizations \u2014 including Molina Healthcare in Long Beach, Calif., from which they sought $3 million over three years, characterizing their project as a preventive-health measure. But their reluctance to work for the government seemed to come from some deeper motivating force. In the beginning, I wondered whether it had to do with prestige. Public employees can get stuck working in rooms with ugly linoleum floors writing memos that may never be read; I.T. vendors, meanwhile, are the equivalent of enterprise software sales. Perhaps either fate seemed at odds with the team\u2019s self-image.But in talking to them, I found that their worries seemed to revolve less around social standing than around effectiveness. Having been exposed to the way government operated, they saw a decision-making system in which the status quo always wins. The lengths to which the team would have had to go to modify the legacy site, MyBenefits CalWin, was one example. The process to amend a notice of action \u2014 a letter informing CalFresh clients of changes in their eligibility, for example \u2014 was another. \u201cWhen you work for the government, ties go to the county, ties go to the state,\u201d Solomon told me. At the moment, the Code for America team controlled almost every aspect of GetCalFresh: If they wanted to, say, experiment with live chat for customer support, they could. That freedom would be curbed if they began collecting paychecks from the state.\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Cantonese, do you?\u201d he asked me as soon as I entered. I did not, alas. Many of the clients of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank were non-English speakers, and among them Cantonese was the most common native tongue. But the Cantonese-speaking employee who was supposed to be on duty that morning had called in sick. Liliana Sandoval, the food bank\u2019s senior program manager, was scrambling to find a replacement.A half-hour later, Sandoval and the replacement arrived, dragging a large file folder between them. His name was Calvin Yan, he worked for the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and, thankfully, he spoke Cantonese. They pulled out a pair of Microsoft Surface tablets. \u201cGo to demo.GetCalFresh.org,\u201d Solomon instructed. The landing page for GetCalFresh showed a glossy image of an Asian woman holding a toddler and standing in front of the produce aisle in an unidentifiable grocery store. At the top, it read: \u201cGet extra money for groceries every month. Take the first step. Apply for CalFresh in 10 minutes.\u201d In the footer: \u201cGetCalFresh.org is a service delivered by Code for America on behalf of the people of California.\u201d The favicon, the tiny image that appeared in the browser tab space when you navigated to the site, was a federal building with Corinthian columns and the symbol for Wi-Fi overlaid on the roof.Yan flipped through the screens. \u201cOh, this is really short,\u201d he said.\u201cYup,\u201d Solomon said, satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d Yan said, before asking if eligibility was still at $1,900 per month.\u201cNo,\u201d Sandoval chided. She tossed him a San Francisco-Marin Food Bank resource guide. \u201cYou should be fine. The only thing might be sponsors.\u201d Sponsors backed immigrants, making them financially responsible for the new arrivals, but in practice they could be difficult to track down. Sometimes food-stamp applicants said they hadn\u2019t had contact with their official sponsors in years.At 10 a.m., the doors opened, and the first clients arrived: an attractive young couple, the man blond and beefy, the woman dark and wide-eyed. Each wore a backpack. Sandoval began speaking to the woman in Spanish. What was her monthly income? How many people in her household did she regularly shop for groceries with? Were any of them students? The woman reached out and touched her boyfriend\u2019s arm. Sandoval switched to English. How many classes was he taking at city college? Three, he said. Did he know how many credits that was? He didn\u2019t. There was a meek, quiet pause. \u201cWould it be helpful if I found out?\u201d he asked.The issue, Sandoval told him, was that full-time students were ineligible for CalFresh, although there was a long list of exceptions \u2014 he could be eligible, for instance, if he had kids. He shook his head. No kids. Then he should probably go to the registrar and confirm his status, Sandoval said. Meanwhile, she would submit a CalFresh application for his girlfriend and refer them to a food pantry in their neighborhood.Sandoval turned to Yan. \u201cCan you pull up the food-pantry locator?\u201d she asked. Another in-house civic-tech team had put together a search tool for food pantries.\u201cWhich neighborhood?\u201d Yan replied, typing on the Surface.\u201cNorth Beach,\u201d the woman answered.Yan flashed her a smile. \u201cMy neighborhood. O.K., the bad news is that there aren\u2019t too many options. But the good news is that there is a food bank just around the corner from your building. It\u2019s not in the search tool.\u201d He tapped his temple. \u201cBut I know it because it\u2019s just down the street from me. I\u2019ll write down the address for you.\u201dSandoval continued: \u201cOnce a week, you can go and pick up a bag of groceries.\u201d\u201cYou can pick what you want?\u201d the woman asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a 30-pound bag, more than 15 pounds of which is fresh produce, and then the rest, staples.\u201d She said they would hear back about their application in a few weeks. The couple shrugged on their backpacks. They thanked Sandoval.After the couple left, everyone waited. A good 45 minutes went by. No one else showed up. After noon, Solomon and I went to grab lunch. In all of our previous meetings, Solomon had projected an unrelenting positivity bordering on pretense. Today he seemed tired, less guarded. \u201cJust think about if every person from all those organizations \u2014 their energy were redirected toward software development,\u201d he said. I pointed out that not everyone had the skills for software development. And in any case, the event suggested the limits of technology. Sandoval\u2019s Spanish skills, Yan\u2019s local knowledge \u2014 these were the things that the technology, at least as of now, had yet to replace, and their softening effect called to a mind an earlier line from Solomon himself, that \u201cstigma was created or eroded at the point of service delivery.\u201dAs we waited for our sandwiches, Solomon got some bad news he\u2019d begun to expect: The $3 million they were seeking from Molina Healthcare \u2014 which could have kept their effort to expand GetCalFresh going \u2014 had been rejected because of restrictions on what the company could support.\u201cWhat else do you have in the pipeline?\u201d I asked.\u201cRight now, nothing,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cC.F.A. has been extremely generous, but they can\u2019t just let us carry on without strategic funding and strategic partners.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe need to figure out whether this model\u201d \u2014 digital nonprofits in the social-services sector \u2014 \u201cactually works or not.\u201dAs in the private sector, the GetCalFresh team\u2019s work would apparently be judged by people\u2019s willingness to pay for it. To me, this seemed absurd: Wasn\u2019t the whole purpose of government to fund collective projects that are irrational for individuals to take on alone? But Solomon and his team seemed to be caught between a public sector unwilling to finance them and a private philanthropic culture that didn\u2019t see enough value in what they did.Williams and Jaime-Alexis Fowler, then director of marketing at Code for America, joined Solomon for lunch. The waiter who came up to take the orders greeted them like old regulars. \u201cHey! I thought one of you guys was done.\u201d\u201cThis is his new office,\u201d Fowler quipped.\u201cMy new H.Q.,\u201d Solomon said.Fowler told me that in the last couple of weeks, a few significant individuals and foundations in Silicon Valley had come forward as sources of funding for GetCalFresh. The money wasn\u2019t in the bank yet, but things were looking promising, despite all the stresses and doubts of the previous months. Some people still believed in improving digital delivery by government \u2014 \u201cpeople who are saying what you are doing is really important and it\u2019s O.K. that you haven\u2019t figured out all the ins and outs of it.\u201dAfter the kale salads arrived, I asked Solomon what he was going to do now. GetCalFresh was his brainchild, and this creation process, he had told me before, represented the best job he ever had.His plan was to dream up similar projects, he said, but as a kind of social entrepreneur. \u201cIt just became increasingly apparent that moving forward we were going to be working for the government, which is great. There\u2019s a lot that can be done there. But I think my interests are closer to advocacy work than enterprise software. I need to set up a situation where I\u2019m working for my clients, my users.\u201d He paused. \u201cOne of the first things I\u2019m going to do is figure out whether there\u2019s a market for an intermediary in food stamps, the way that people are willing to pay $50 not to deal with the I.R.S.\u201d At the high end, these intermediaries were attorneys and financial advisers. In the middle, they were TurboTax, travel agencies, real-estate brokers. At the low end, of course, there was nothing.If government interactions are so unpleasant that intercessors are necessary, I suggested, then perhaps we should reform government instead of creating another go-between.\u201cBut I think intermediation is often \u2014\u201d Solomon began.Williams threw up his hands. \u201cYes!\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes!\u201d\u201cIn many cases it is those intermediaries who are the strongest pressure for reform,\u201d Solomon said.\u201cThey\u2019re also the strongest opponents of reform in some cases.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Solomon admitted. \u201cIntuit is a great example.\u201d Several years ago, California proposed simplifying tax returns for some taxpayers, but it was opposed by Intuit lobbying.Williams prodded his food with his fork. \u201cSo who\u2019s the most powerful actor?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the intermediaries oftentimes. And that can be a force for good, or a force for self-serving interest.\u201dAs lunch wound down, I asked where Dave Guarino was. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. \u201cDave is coding,\u201d Williams said.Now that things on the funding side were looking up, feature development could begin again. The GetCalFresh team was replacing Solomon with an engineer, Andrew Hyder, who was a Code for America fellow with Solomon, Guarino and Williams in 2013. And once the money arrived, there would be resources for hiring more people too. Williams looked meaningfully at Solomon when he said that.As it happened, the money would come in, and then some. In April, California declared its intent to award GetCalFresh a two-year \u201coutreach\u201d contract, federal money designed to reimburse nonprofits that helped clients through the application process for social services. It would be the first time California had made an award for web-based application assistance. \u201cWe see this as a major first piece of a client-based revenue model \u2014 since we will receive reimbursement based on the number of people we help,\u201d Williams told me. He credited, above all, the support of people like Leo O\u2019Farrell and Kim McCoy Wade, who became the state\u2019s new head of CalFresh in 2015. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who really pulled for us,\u201d Williams said. The team\u2019s immediate financial future secured, its members \u2014 Williams, Guarino and Hyder (three new hires were planned) \u2014 steeled themselves for a long summer leading up to a Code for America summit meeting in Oakland, where they hoped to persuade the various CalFresh directors to try them out.In my last conversations with Williams, the tone was one of cautious optimism. While the California contract kept GetCalFresh going for another two years and gave the team a sense of momentum, it hardly solved all their problems. A real A.P.I. needed to be built and additional county CalFresh directors won over. Above all, the team needed to show impact \u2014 in terms of numbers of users, applications and food-stamp approvals \u2014 on the scale that everyone had come to expect from tech ventures. Everything they had done until now \u2014 all the prototyping, hand-holding, cajoling, fund-raising \u2014 was just preparation. Now the work would really begin.It\u2019s hard to predict whether GetCalFresh will become the vanguard of a new movement in social services or a forlorn entry in the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. But GetCalFresh has made it further than the vast majority of civic-tech projects. It has overcome every kind of crisis \u2014 technical, financial, existential \u2014 while exposing the distance between the current fetishization of innovation and the reality of implementing even the best ideas within intransigent organizations. Perhaps most important, its team has demonstrated a commitment that goes beyond Silicon Valley opportunism.\u201cFor the longest time, if someone asked me what I did at a party or something,\u201d Williams told me, \u201cI would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a product designer,\u2019 or \u2018I work in tech.\u2019 Now I say I work in social services.\u201d Even Solomon, the prodigal son, hasn\u2019t strayed far. Back at the lunch at Citizen\u2019s Band, it occurred to me that despite his qualms, the public sector built so little of its own software that even so-called in-house projects were often procured from vendors. So in the end, you could either pay $30 to have someone outside the government handle the food-stamp application process for you, which is what Solomon wanted, or the government would pay a contractor $30 per successful food-stamp application, which is what Williams and the team wanted: a system in which government contracting outside the I.T. world could align with users\u2019 interests. This seemed a distinction without a difference \u2014 maybe they\u2019d all work together again at some point.Solomon smiled at that. \u201cI think over the next year, he\u2019s going to continue to try to recruit me, and I\u2019m going to continue to try to recruit him, and we\u2019ll probably meet somewhere in the middle.\u201d \u2666Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer based in New York.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Less Frenzied Black Friday as Millennials Opt to Stay In", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIf you\u2019re in the retail business in the United States, you probably really care about these two things: millennials and Black Friday.But more and more, these two big drivers of the industry don\u2019t mix inside stores \u2014 a dynamic that is reshaping one of the country\u2019s biggest shopping days.Young people of all kinds, a coveted group for retailers because of their free-spending ways, are increasingly turning to their computers and phones to do their holiday shopping, spreading out more widely the days they open their wallets. Crowds on Friday, the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season, will tilt older than a few years ago, and also, it appears, more cautious with their money.As a result, the mix of retailers with high expectations for the day is changing quickly, skewing more toward dollar stores and discount retailers and toward essential products like food and cookware. And it is also making the day itself less and less important for the industry over all.\u201cAs big as the event or the weekend has become, it\u2019s substantially muted for the fact that all of the people are buying online,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.A decade ago, the day after Thanksgiving accounted for 6 percent of all shopping for the holiday season, according to Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm. This year, he expects shoppers to spend $27 billion on Black Friday, but that will account for only 4.3 percent of the spending this season.Over all, people are expected to spend $632 billion this holiday season, up from $607 billion last year, the company estimates. But for the first time, more than half that growth will come from online shopping, Mr. Johnson said.At the same time, there is a distinct division in who is shopping online. More than half of baby boomers surveyed said they would do none of their holiday shopping online, according to a study by CivicScience, a market research company. Nearly 40 percent of those age 18 to 34 \u2014 the group known as millennials \u2014 will do most or all of their shopping on the web, and another 35 percent said they would shop both online and in-store.Televisions, headphones and electronics, as always, are expected to be a big draw at big-box stores like Walmart and Target. Department stores that offer big discounts, like Macy\u2019s, will remain a top destination during the weekend, too. Macy\u2019s website is blanketed with its Black Friday promotions, with ads for everything from coats to Apple watches to blenders. \u201cBlack Friday Starts Now!\u201d declares a big banner at the top.But discount and dollar stores, which generally haven\u2019t been big draws on Black Friday, are also expecting strong sales. Over all, dollar stores will experience one of the biggest rises in turnout this year over last year, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adults by the data company Nielsen.\u201cWhen you think about Black Friday, you don\u2019t think about Dollar General, you think about Walmart and Target and Amazon,\u201d Mr. Dengler said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying a little bit more.\u201dDiscounters like dollar stores and so-called off-price stores like T. J. Maxx and Ross also are different in another way from rival retailers: They have little to no e-commerce presence. That has made them somewhat immune to certain industry pressures, and could give them greater incentive to entice people into stores.\u201cI think e-commerce has allowed for Black Friday to start whenever Amazon wants it to start,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, an analyst with Nomura. For the last few years, Amazon has offered Prime Day, its own annual one-day shopping bonanza. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t exist for T. J. and Ross.\u201dAnother trend working in favor of discount and dollar stores is the rising popularity of food and kitchen items, like mixers and cookware, as holiday gifts. That\u2019s in part because of new fads like \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d and \u201cFriendsmas,\u201d when, you guessed it, friends rather than family get together for a holiday meal.\u201cAs a result, food is going to be more central to the holidays than ever before,\u201d said Jordan Rost, vice president for consumer insights at Nielsen, in an email.Walmart, for example, said it would offer some specials on kitchen appliances for under $10, as well as deals on nonstick cooking sets and griddles.More generally, though, stores at the higher end of the income spectrum \u2014 like Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale\u2019s, for instance \u2014 have continued to more quietly promote their Black Friday sales.\u201cI think the low-end consumer is still looking for the best deal, but I think the higher-end consumers are looking for the best products and the best services,\u201d said Liz Dunn, the founder and chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a consumer and retailing consulting firm.\u201cI think it\u2019s been a consistent theme for many, many years,\u201d she said, \u201cthat these high-end stores don\u2019t necessarily want to participate in the promotion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece, Seeking Dose of Stability, Is Rattled by Trump\u2019s Win", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Before last week, Greece expected that it might benefit from what was supposed to be a triumphal valedictory lap by President Obama as he lands in Athens on Tuesday to kick off his final world tour.Mr. Obama has been supportive of Greece\u2019s efforts to get its finances in order, and of Europe\u2019s bid to keep Greece stable. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hoped that Mr. Obama, who travels to Berlin on Thursday, might even persuade the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to offer Greece some debt relief by the end of the year.Instead, Mr. Obama will arrive in Athens with his legacy threatened and his leverage sorely reduced. His visit has turned into yet another reminder of the ways in which Mr. Trump\u2019s ascendancy is changing the calculations of leaders across Europe. Mr. Tsipras is among the most vulnerable of them.\u201cThe expectation was that Obama would relay a message about how impressed he was with Greece\u2019s progress,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economics consultant based in Athens and a former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force on Greece. \u201cBut given that Trump will assume the presidency, all bets are off.\u201d\u201cI would definitely stay back,\u201d he said in an interview last year with Fox Business Network. \u201cGermany is very powerful and strong. I\u2019d let Germany handle it.\u201d\u201cWe have enough problems,\u201d he said, adding that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could ride in \u201cto save the day if Germany doesn\u2019t.\u201dFor Greece, in the worst case, a failure to secure debt relief before Mr. Trump is sworn in could spell a new round of political and economic instability, with implications for the wider European Union.The risk now is that Greece could re-emerge as a weak link in the eurozone, as pivotal elections in several European countries next year may shift the focus from stabilizing Greece.Under the deal, Mr. Tsipras won pledges from creditors to relieve some of Greece\u2019s large debt, and he is angling to strike a concrete accord in early December.\u201cThe danger is that if this drags on to next year, the issue remains open, and that\u2019s a nightmare for the Greek government,\u201d said Nick Malkoutzis, the editor of Macropolis, a political analysis website. \u201cIt will lead to heightened uncertainty and renewed speculation about whether Greece will continue in the eurozone.\u201dWhile the eurozone has held together despite Greece\u2019s troubles, Mr. Trump has also hinted that he sees the shared currency as a potential threat. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the whole euro situation was created to compete against the United States,\u201d he said in the Fox Business interview. \u201cThis was all set up to hurt the United States.\u201dWhether Mr. Trump takes that view to the White House remains to be seen. \u201cHe draws a red line,\u201d Mr. Bastian said. \u201cBut how thick that red line is, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201dWith the popularity of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza party plummeting, he has been insisting that Athens is gearing up for a firm commitment on debt relief on Dec. 5, when eurozone officials are to discuss Greece\u2019s situation.The International Monetary Fund, of which the United States is the largest member, has called on Greece\u2019s creditors to be flexible, warning that the country cannot meet its budget-tightening goals if the debt load is not reduced. Germany remains skeptical of cutting Athens more slack.Mr. Obama has repeatedly underlined the need for debt relief and a shift away from austerity, and Greek officials believed Hillary Clinton would have adopted the same stance.Greece\u2019s government spokesman, Dimitris Tzanakopoulos, expressed optimism that the debt issue would be resolved before Mr. Trump assumes office, and he added that the government was not worried about a shift in Washington\u2019s stance on the Greek debt issue. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that there will be any discontinuity,\u201d he said.Others take a darker view.\u201cTrump\u2019s policy will certainly be different to Obama\u2019s,\u201d Georgios Kyrtsos, a member of the European Parliament from the conservative New Democracy party, told state radio after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cAs regards Greece\u2019s debt, I don\u2019t think Washington will exercise any pressure for restructuring.\u201dShould creditors decide that Greece has not done enough to satisfy the terms of its bailout, and push a decision on debt relief into next year, the chances of securing a deal become ever fainter.Negotiations for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union will start in earnest in 2017, draining the appetite of European leaders for having to deal with Greece\u2019s problems yet again.In addition, elections will be held in Germany, France and the Netherlands, where Mr. Trump\u2019s rise has fueled ambitions by right-leaning parties who see in his victory a chance at their own, and who have little patience for giving Greece more financial aid.A similar headache awaits Mr. Tsipras amid concerns that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory will embolden the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn political group, which remains Greece\u2019s third most popular party, even though its leaders are on trial for a string of crimes including attacks on migrants.Golden Dawn hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a victory against \u201cillegal immigration\u201d and in favor of \u201cethnically clean states.\u201dWith so much uncertainty washing over Europe, Ms. Merkel may opt to push for preserving as much stability as possible on the Continent while she can.\u201cMerkel may wish to ensure that, at a time when so much has become unpredictable, stability is guaranteed, which would mean doing a deal on Greece,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Party That Wants to Make Poland Great Again", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "FeatureIn just a year, Law and Justice has shown how a far-right nationalist government in Europe really governs \u2014 and how far it can push the limits of democracy.Supported byIt was a strangely knockabout inquisition. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even give us any documents to read or respond to,\u201d Rafal Trzaskowski, the former minister of European affairs, who testified at the audit, told me when I visited him in his office two days later. \u201cEach minister just got up and made accusations.\u201d The Law and Justice prime minister, Beata Szydlo, kicked off the audit by claiming that Civic Platform had squandered 340 billion zlotys ($88 billion) through waste. Trzaskowski listened in amazement as one of Szydlo\u2019s colleagues accused an unnamed Civic Platform minister of using a state discount to buy an iPhone for less than the retail price.The foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, declared that Civic Platform had sold out Poland\u2019s national interests to the European Union. The defense minister, Antoni Macierewicz, in a speech that lasted for more than an hour, claimed that under Civic Platform, Poland\u2019s military-and-intelligence officials had been doing Russia\u2019s bidding \u2014 perhaps, he conceded, unknowingly \u2014 and presented a photograph that he said showed Polish intelligence officers playfully donning Russian navy caps at a gathering in St. Petersburg. Trzaskowski was shocked. \u201cHe was saying that leading ministers and generals had betrayed Poland,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was dumbfounded. I had to smoke a cigarette, and I don\u2019t even smoke.\u201dAfter she left the lectern, Szydlo stopped to receive a congratulatory embrace from a short, stocky man sitting immediately to the right of the lectern: Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the founder, guide and master of the Law and Justice Party. The grayest of eminences, Kaczynski holds no government post. Yet neither allies nor enemies doubt that Kaczynski runs Poland; he did not speak during the audit, but it was plainly his affair. To Trzaskowski, the entire spectacle appeared to have been engineered for the benefit of the supremo, who occasionally beamed with delight as the allegations unfurled.Poland has been the great success story of the former Eastern bloc, a nation that rapidly adopted democratic norms and moved toward a free-market economy after the fall of communism in 1989. But over the last year Kaczynski and his followers have moved with astonishing speed to alter this trajectory, in hopes of deflecting Poland from the orbit of Western Europe and returning it to a past defined by family, church and home. In its first months in power, the new government moved swiftly to gain control over the country\u2019s public media, its Civil Service and its judiciary, and it has largely neutralized the Constitutional Tribunal, the nation\u2019s highest court. The European Union, in a rare rebuke, accused Law and Justice of undermining the rule of law; Kaczynski told the E.U. to mind its own business.Law and Justice\u2019s particular resentments, above all its virulent anti-Communism in the absence of actual Communists, may be distinctly Polish. But in its revolt against European liberalism, the party stands at the forefront of a growing movement. The one unifying feature of Western democracies today is the rise of nativist, nationalist parties. All of them tap a deep and thickening vein of pessimism about the economic and political prospects of the West. In part their ascent reflects the aftershocks of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, which shook the faith of many working-class and middle-class voters in the wisdom of liberal elites. The continuing refugee crisis has also provoked a fierce backlash against newcomers in many countries. And anxieties about a globalized world have created a bull market in nostalgia.These are the fears that carried the day in the Brexit vote and that propelled Donald Trump to the Republican nomination. As the largest country in the West to have elected one of these authoritarian-minded parties to power, Poland may be a harbinger. Radoslaw Markowski, a leading political scientist, told me that he had begun to have an awful premonition. \u201cMaybe this 25 years of democracy and liberal values in Poland is a deviant period,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe now we\u2019re returning to normal.\u201dThe Kaczynski brothers were born in Warsaw in 1949. At 12, they became famous as the adorable, mop-topped stars of a children\u2019s film, \u201cThose Two Who Stole the Moon.\u201d Both received law degrees, then became caught up in history. In 1976, Jaroslaw joined the Committee for the Defense of Workers, or KOR, a group that formed in the aftermath of a government crackdown. Lech, who by chance had moved to the Gdansk region, went to work for Walesa. When, in December 1981, the Communist government declared martial law, outlawing Solidarity and imprisoning many of its leaders, the Kaczynskis continued to work underground with the union. After Walesa was released from prison, the Kaczynskis returned to his side, writing policy briefs and drafting memos on legal issues. The twins became his functionaries.\u201cThey were useful in a support role,\u201d Walesa told me when I met him at the office he now keeps at the Solidarity Center, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t have the ability to be leaders themselves.\u201d This was a view I heard from a number of Solidarity veterans: The Kaczynskis did work no one else wanted to do but never fully tasted either the suffering or the sublime romance of Solidarity. Walesa speculated that Jaroslaw\u2019s turn against the liberal post-Communist consensus arose from \u201can inferiority complex,\u201d a massive chip on Kaczynski\u2019s shoulder.Law and Justice supporters marching to the Presidential Palace to mark an anniversary of the plane crash that killed, among others, Lech Kaczynski.\u201cFrom the very beginning,\u201d Walesa told me, \u201cwhen they were kids, they used to fight, fight, fight. It\u2019s like Romulus and Remus. They knew how to pick fights, but sometimes they chose the wrong fights.\u201d At first, they fought for Walesa himself. Many of Solidarity\u2019s intellectual leaders, who were steeped in the Western tradition of limited government, broke with Walesa when he ran for president, fearing that he planned to become a new autocrat. The Kaczynskis stayed by his side. Their parents had fought in the anti-Nazi, anti-Communist resistance, and the children grew up ardent patriots and conservatives.Then an election in 1991 brought a conservative prime minister, Jan Olszewski, to power. One of the new government\u2019s ministers, Antoni Macierewicz, claimed that dozens of members of Poland\u2019s lower house had cooperated with the secret police; this was the same man who, a quarter of a century later, would serve as Kaczynski\u2019s inquisitor in the audit of Civil Platform. His accusations smacked of the kind of ideological bloodletting that Solidarity\u2019s leaders had vowed to put behind them. The Kaczynskis, however, left Walesa to join Olszewski. And when Olszewski fell, in 1992, the Kaczynskis fell with him.In 2001, the twins began clawing their way back to the center of Polish political life with the founding of Law and Justice. The party appealed to those who felt left out of the new, cosmopolitan Poland, with its cafe culture and its easy flights to London and Frankfurt. As Europe has secularized, Poland has remained a deeply Catholic country. Poland, in short, was less liberal than it looked from the outside. In addition, many Poles were disgusted with the persistence of ex-Communists in Poland\u2019s economic and political life, which was a consequence of the decision made by Solidarity leaders not to prosecute the apparatchiks of the old regime. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, Law and Justice narrowly edged out Civic Platform as the largest party; soon after that, Lech Kaczynski defeated Donald Tusk of Civic Platform to become president.A very strange thing happened at the moment that Lech learned that he had been elected president. On national television, he turned to his brother and said, \u201cMr. Chairman, I report: Mission accomplished.\u201d Lech was president; but Jaroslaw, the party leader, was boss. Almost everyone who knew the two was struck, first, by their near indissolubility, and second, by Lech\u2019s deference to his brother. Walesa told me that every time he offered the twins a bonus \u2014 he couldn\u2019t quite tell them apart \u2014 Lech would say, \u201cGive it to my brother.\u201dThe twins were quite different as people. Lech was a temperamental moderate who fancied himself a statesman-intellectual; Jaroslaw was the wily back-room operator. He has never lived abroad and rarely travels. Lech had a wife and child. Jaroslaw lived with his mother until her death in 2013; his only bedtime companion, he has said, is his cat, Fiona. Until recently, he had, famously, neither a bank account nor a driver\u2019s license. His asceticism functions as a kind of charisma.At first Jaroslaw remained in the background, but in July 2006, he took the job of prime minister for himself. Poland\u2019s two highest officials were now twins.That September, Jaroslaw Kaczynski delivered a little-noticed speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, which in retrospect offers an invaluable guide to his worldview. The liberals who led Poland for much of the post-Soviet era, he argued, had made no effort at \u201cchanging the social hierarchy,\u201d which remained dominated by ex-Communists. The old elite simply exchanged its former political power for wealth. How, he asked, had these despised anti-Polish elements gained the legitimacy to remain at the top rungs of Polish life? Who smoothed their way? It was \u201cthe most influential portion of the counterelite\u201d \u2014 the liberals. They had agreed to be \u201cco-opted to the socially privileged sphere.\u201dKaczynski was claiming that his own former colleagues, the heroes of the anti-Communist struggle, who had endured isolation and prison, had secretly joined forces with the Communists and betrayed the nation. But now, he went on, a momentous reclamation had begun. Poland was witnessing the \u201ctempestuous process of reconstructing social awareness, restoring history and exposing post-Communist legitimation myths.\u201d A real revolution was finally supplanting a specious one.That was Kaczynski\u2019s view and his goal. But Law and Justice\u2019s plans ran into resistance in Parliament and with the Constitutional Tribunal, and in 2007, the ruling right-wing coalition \u2014 of which Law and Justice was part \u2014 collapsed amid accusations of scandal. Civic Platform won the ensuing election. Poland was barely scathed by the financial crisis, and in 2011 voters awarded Civic Platform a new term. During the party\u2019s eight years in office, Poland\u2019s economy grew by 25 percent, one of the highest rates in Europe. Life was getting better. Tusk thought, as many intellectuals did, that after centuries of tragedy and oppression, Poland had at last sailed out into the calm waters of Francis Fukuyama\u2019s supposed end of history. Civic Platform had little ideology beyond keeping hot water on tap, as Tusk put it.\u201cBut he was wrong,\u201d says Konstanty Gebert, a leading Polish journalist and intellectual. \u201cPeople wanted history, they wanted glory, they wanted meaning.\u201d In 2015, Gebert said, Law and Justice \u201coffered a meaning. Their meaning was: \u2018We\u2019ll make Poland great again.\u2019\u2009\u201dSiedlce has a slow and sleepy feel, perhaps because so many young people have left in recent years for England and other European destinations. Over the last six or so years, the big steel plant in town, Polimex-Mostostal, has shed half its jobs. Albert Milatti and Slawomir Szczepanik, who run the two unions at the plant, support Law and Justice and say that most of their members do as well. Both men share the party\u2019s cranky anti-Communism, but jobs and wages are paramount for them. The average worker at the plants, they told me, earns $700 a month, with little wage growth over the years. \u201cRight now we\u2019re stuck in the mud,\u201d Milatti told me. The party, he went on, \u201cis our only hope to improve.\u201d Both union bosses, along with many others I talked to around the region, believe that Civic Platform systematically ignored a region that gave it few votes, while Law and Justice will send investment their way.The sense of marginalization among Law and Justice supporters has a basis in economic reality. Among the zealots, however, it feels more like a psychic condition. Zbigniew Sobolewski, a local businessman, keeps pictures of the Kaczynski twins on an office wall, where they flank a Polish eagle. When I asked him to speak of Jaroslaw, he warned me that he might get emotional, and he promptly started to tear up. \u201cIn personal relations,\u201d he conceded, \u201cJaroslaw Kaczynski is not such an easy person. But he is a man who is very strict in his values. At our very first meeting\u201d \u2014 in the early 1990s \u2014 \u201cI knew that he was the man who could save Poland.\u201dWhen we spoke of Kaczynski\u2019s rivals, Sobolewski\u2019s mood blackened. He described Tusk, now the president of the European Council, as a traitor. Civic Platform, he insisted, was controlled by \u201cthe sons and daughters of those who after World War II were destroying our country.\u201d\u201cYou mean Communists?\u201d I asked.\u201cIn the broad sense, yes.\u201dThis sort of paranoia has grown more pronounced in the Law and Justice worldview since April 10, 2010. That day, Lech Kaczynski, beginning a new campaign for president, was traveling to Smolensk in Russia with dozens of political leaders and government officials to attend an event marking the 70th anniversary of the murder of 20,000 Polish military officers by the Soviet secret police \u2014 a catastrophe that devastated Poland\u2019s officer and intellectual class and has reminded Poles ever since of Soviet barbarity. On its descent into the airport, the delegation\u2019s plane crashed, and all aboard were killed.Polish and Russian investigations concluded that crew members made fatal mistakes in response to worsening weather conditions. Almost immediately, however, officials of Law and Justice cited supposed evidence that Russia had brought the plane down and that the Tusk government had conspired either in Lech\u2019s death or in covering up Russian involvement, despite the fact that several Civic Platform officials also died in the crash. For the die-hard supporters of Law and Justice, the word \u201cSmolensk\u201d soon came to be shorthand for \u201ca conspiracy so immense.\u201d Three plaques commemorating the dead were placed in front of the Presidential Palace, which became a place of vigil for the party faithful. On the 10th of every month \u2014 not just on April 10 \u2014 Jaroslaw Kaczynski stands on the sidewalk in front of the palace to deliver a speech in honor of the dead.All the Law and Justice supporters I met in Siedlce believed that Civic Platform had been complicit in Kaczynski\u2019s death or at least in a Russian cover-up. Sobolewski told me of a picture of Tusk with Vladimir Putin where Tusk \u201cseems to be expressing the feeling, \u2018You see, we did it.\u2019\u2009\u201d A vast constellation of enemies was plotting against the faithful. Sobolewski gravely informed me that the brother of Adam Michnik, the great Solidarity intellectual and activist who spent years in prison for his beliefs, was a judge who \u201cput our greatest patriots in jail\u201d under the Communists. (Actually, it was his half brother.) Michnik is Jewish, and I asked Sobolewski if he viewed the opposition as Jewish. Siedlce and the surrounding area were among the heavily Jewish regions of Poland before the population was liquidated by the Nazis. Sobolewski said, \u201cI would recommend that you read a book by Henry Ford: \u2018The International Jew.\u2019 He had a lot of knowledge.\u201dIn the waning days of the election, Kaczynski made a rare campaign speech, in which he warned of the dangers of the refugees then streaming toward Europe from Syria and elsewhere, \u201cThere are,\u201d he claimed, \u201calready signs of emergence of diseases that are highly dangerous and have not been seen in Europe for a long time: cholera on the Greek islands, dysentery in Vienna. There is also talk about other, even more severe diseases.\u201d The speech was widely credited with helping put Law and Justice over the top. Though Poland lies far north of the route refugees take from Turkey to Europe, many Poles shared the fear of an alien Muslim presence widespread in Eastern Europe. The Civic Platform government had agreed to take 7,000 of the 160,000 refugees European officials were hoping to distribute across the continent. Law and Justice repudiated the agreement and vowed not to take a single refugee.Though Law and Justice won only 38 percent of the popular vote, fragmentation among the other parties allowed it to gain an outright majority in Parliament. Once in office, the party moved to gain control over all those sectors that, according to Kaczynski, remained in the hands of the nomenklatura and their liberal allies, starting with the Constitutional Tribunal, which had frustrated him in his previous time in office.The outgoing government had made appointments to replace five of the court\u2019s 15 judges, who were scheduled to retire, a decision that was plainly unconstitutional with regard to two of the judges, whose term expired after that of the current Legislature. But the new Parliament simply invalidated all five choices and picked five new judges, which was an even more gross violation of the constitutional order. When the court refused to accept them, Duda, the president, went ahead and swore them in anyway. And that was only the beginning. In December, Parliament adopted a measure that required a two-thirds vote, rather than a majority, for binding decisions. The law also stipulated that at least 13 of the 15 judges be present to hear a case. Together, the two amendments would effectively neutralize the court.The new government went on to eliminate the independence of Poland\u2019s chief prosecutor, placing him underneath the minister of justice. It passed an antiterror law giving the police expanded access to digital data. An amended Civil Service law eliminated merit-based appointments for high-ranking officials, permitting them to be named by the government. Most controversial of all, a law passed in January transferred the power to pick the head of public broadcasting from a government-appointed panel to the ministry of the Treasury. The minister promptly appointed Jacek Kurski, who had once described himself as Jaroslaw Kaczynski\u2019s \u201cbull terrier.\u201dIn April, the European Parliament adopted a resolution stating that Poland\u2019s move against the independence of the Constitutional Tribunal constituted \u201ca risk to constitutional democracy,\u201d adding that \u201cother issues that are of serious concern ... may constitute breaches of European law and fundamental rights.\u201d Poland could be stripped of its vote. But such decisions must be unanimous, and Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, who has presided over a similar rollback of civil liberties in his own country, has already stated that he will defend Poland. As Adam Bodnar, Poland\u2019s official ombudsman, puts it, \u201cThe lesson learned from Orban is not only about the weakness of European institutions but also about how you can buy time by playing with the E.U. Meanwhile, you can make systematic changes in the way the government operates. Even if you get rebuked, you can take a step back, and you\u2019re still operating in a completely different world.\u201d Bodnar believes that Law and Justice\u2019s ultimate goal is to \u201creshape the country in terms of an authoritarian model.\u201dI was eager to hear Law and Justice\u2019s views from its own officials, but that proved extremely difficult. Kaczynski rarely speaks to the Western press, and spokesmen for several senior party figures did not respond to requests for interviews. Strikingly, none of the liberal scholars and journalists I met in Warsaw had any contacts inside Law and Justice; they came from different worlds. The party spokeswoman did not respond to emails and phone calls.Finally, however, I was able to arrange a conversation with Ryszard Terlecki, the head of the party\u2019s parliamentary caucus and one of Kaczynski\u2019s small circle of confidants. When we met, late on a Sunday evening in the dark and deserted Parliament building, I learned that Terlecki belonged to a political category that I had never before encountered: ex-hippie anti-Communist hard-liner. Youthful dissolution had taken its toll. At 67, Terlecki is a prematurely played-out looking man, tall and gaunt, with graven cheeks, a grizzled chin and great bags beneath dark eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve always been a member of right-wing parties,\u201d he told me. He shared Kaczynski\u2019s conspiratorial view of recent Polish history. The post-Solidarity elite, he assured me, made common cause with the Communists \u201cbecause it was the only way they could stop the conservative Catholic movement that was rising up in Poland.\u201d Terlecki said that he was not anti-Western. The difference between Law and Justice and the opposition, he said, was that \u201cwe don\u2019t want a Poland that is a colony of the West.\u201d Terlecki meant not only that Poland should not blindly follow Germany, as he accused the previous government of doing, but also that Poland should embrace its own values, above all the conservatism of the church and the belief in the sanctity of the family.It was clear that Terlecki did not accept the difference between the ruling party and the state. For him, all institutions served as instruments of power either for his side or the other, and the other side was out to harm Poland. How then, I asked, could he possibly accept the idea of political compromise? Terlecki laughed dryly. \u201cWhat kind of compromise do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for one.\u201dBut Solidarity\u2019s leaders did not risk their lives and livelihoods in order to bow before the authority of the church. And those figures are not so very old today: Walesa is 73; Michnik is 70. These founding fathers have called the new government a menace to Polish democracy. A new protest movement known as KOD \u2014 a conscious echo of KOR, the pre-Solidarity intellectuals\u2019 movement \u2014 formed last year. In early May, a demonstration called by KOD in Warsaw brought out a crowd estimated by the city\u2019s mayor at roughly 250,000 (and by the police at 45,000).No one mistakes KOD for Solidarity. The movement has been limited to the big cities and attracts mostly older and better-educated people. Until recently, the inroads the government made on personal freedom felt abstract to most Poles. In early October, however, an estimated 100,000 people demonstrated against a new abortion law, strongly advocated by the Catholic Church, that would have subjected doctors and women seeking abortions to potentially long prison sentences. The government abruptly withdrew its support for the legislation. Activists hope that the mass protests will fan the embers of opposition.Michnik feels as if he has seen this drama before. He is still the publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza, the daily newspaper he founded with other Solidarity leaders in 1989. Along with Vaclav Havel, Michnik defined the meaning of the anti-Soviet uprisings both for the people of the Eastern bloc and for readers in the West. Michnik stressed the idea that Solidarity must function not simply as an instrument for organization and negotiation but as an embodiment of another, better way to live: egalitarian, truthful, free from fear. He spent years in prison for his beliefs.\u201cThe great objective of this government is to reorganize Poland into a Putin-like system,\u201d Michnik told me when we met at the newspaper\u2019s office. \u201cThere will be some democratic trappings left behind to appeal to those concerned about democracy, but at its core, it will be Putinism.\u201d Michnik fears that the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, a member of the Kaczynski inner circle, could open criminal investigations of leading members of the opposition. Even the threat of such a process, he says, might intimidate lawmakers into falling in line on important votes.The veterans of Solidarity have learned to trust the Polish people in a crisis. Eventually, say Michnik and others, people will awaken to the threat that the Law and Justice government poses to the liberties for which Poles began fighting four decades ago. But what is \u201ceventually\u201d? What transgression would trigger a truly national response? How much damage would be done to Polish democracy in the meantime? \u201cOne thing is obvious,\u201d Michnik said. \u201cBehind us is a wall, and we see inscribed on that wall the specter of dictatorship. We cannot go back.\u201dJames Traub is a columnist and contributor at foreignpolicy.com. His latest book is \u201cJohn Quincy Adams: Militant Spirit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Rode to Power in the Role of the Common Man", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byMan in the NewsDonald John Trump defied the skeptics who said he would never run, and the political veterans who scoffed at his slapdash campaign.He attacked the norms of American politics, singling out groups for derision on the basis of race and religion and attacking the legitimacy of the political process.He ignored conventions of common decency, employing casual vulgarity and raining personal humiliation on his political opponents and critics in the media.14 PhotosAnd in the ultimate act of defiance, Mr. Trump emerged victorious, summoning a tidal wave of support from less educated whites displaced by changes in the economy and deeply resistant to the country\u2019s shifting cultural and racial tones. In his triumph, Mr. Trump has delivered perhaps the greatest shock to the American political system in modern times and opened the door to an era of extraordinary political uncertainty at home and around the globe.The slashing, freewheeling campaign that took him to the doorstep of the White House replicated a familiar pattern from Mr. Trump\u2019s life, but on an Olympian scale.The son of a wealthy real estate developer in Queens, Mr. Trump, 70, spent decades pursuing social acceptance in upscale Manhattan and seeking, at times desperately, to persuade the wider world to see him as a great man of affairs. But Mr. Trump was often met with scoffing disdain by wealthy elites and mainstream civic leaders, culminating in a mortifying roast by President Obama at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011.So Mr. Trump fashioned himself instead as a proudly garish champion of the common man \u2014 a person of unsophisticated tastes but distinctive popular appeal \u2014 and acted the part in extravagant fashion, first in the New York tabloids and then on national television. He became a pundit of sorts, fulminating against crime in New York City and international trade and Mr. Obama\u2019s legitimacy as president, often in racially incendiary terms.His candidacy unfolded in much the same way: as the rampage of an aggrieved outsider, aligned more with the cultural sensibilities of blue-collar whites than with his peers in society.On the first day of his run \u2014 June 16, 2015 \u2014 Mr. Trump drew a direct parallel between his determined quest for success in New York and his entry into the political arena.Addressing a crowd made up largely of reporters in the atrium of Trump Tower, Mr. Trump noted that political seers had predicted, \u201cHe\u2019ll never run.\u201d Seconds later, he mused that his father, Fred Trump, had urged him never to compete in \u201cthe big leagues\u201d of Manhattan.\u201c\u2018We don\u2019t know anything about that. Don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump quoted his father as saying. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go into Manhattan. I\u2019ve got to build those big buildings. I\u2019ve got to do it, Dad. I\u2019ve got to do it.\u2019\u201dBased on exit polls, the 2016 presidential election seems to have dramatically redefined how certain demographic groups vote.Powered by that same grasping ambition, Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy was marked by countless missteps and grievous errors, from the crude and meandering speeches he delivered daily, to the allegations of sexual assault that appeared to cripple him in the final weeks of the race. No other presidential candidate in memory has given offense so freely and been so battered by scandal, and lived to fight on and win.Amid all his innumerable blunders, however, Mr. Trump got one or two things right that mattered more than all the rest. On a visceral level, he grasped dynamics that the political leadership of both parties missed or ignored \u2014 most of all, the raw frustration of blue-collar and middle-class white voters who rallied to his candidacy with decisive force.Mr. Trump rallied them less with policy promises than with gut-level pronouncements \u2014 against foreign trade, foreign wars and foreign workers. He left his Republican primary opponents agog at his dismissals of mainstream policy, and exposed a yawning breach between the program of tax cuts and fiscal austerity favored by traditional conservatives, and the preoccupations of the party\u2019s rank and file.Ridiculed by critics on the right and left, shunned by the most respected figures in American politics, including every living former president, Mr. Trump equated his own outcast status with the resentments of the white class.Even the invective and incivility that appalled the traditional guardians of political discourse seemed only to forge a tighter bond between Mr. Trump and his inflamed following. He dismissed American social norms as mere \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d mocking the physical appearance of an opponent\u2019s wife, savaging Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage and wielding stereotypes of racial minorities \u2014 all to the applause of his base.In sum, Mr. Trump offered himself to the country as a tribune of white populist rage, and pledged at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to defend \u201cthe laid-off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.\u201d\u201cThese are the forgotten men and women of our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPeople who work hard but no longer have a voice.\u201dHe pledged: \u201cI am your voice.\u201dThe message resonated especially in the Midwest, where a stunning victory in Ohio helped give Mr. Trump the Electoral College votes he needed to win. But his ultimate triumph was driven less by region than by race and class. His winning coalition consisted of restive whites and scarcely anyone else.Donald J. Trump made good on his strategy of stoking the enthusiasm of white voters to defeat Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump\u2019s winding path to the presidency began 10 miles east of the spot where he would build Trump Tower, in the wealthy Queens enclave of Jamaica Estates, where his father\u2019s self-made real estate empire granted Mr. Trump an easy entry into the world of construction and development. He showed little interest in politics as a young man, obtaining deferments to avoid fighting in the Vietnam War but declining to participate in the protest movements of that era.He found his way into the political arena by way of his commercial interests and social aspirations: Under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, the legendary and infamous former adviser to Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, Mr. Trump made himself a presence at fund-raising events and political conventions. As early as the 1980s, he insinuated himself into the company of leaders in both parties, giving money to Ronald Reagan as readily as to Mario M. Cuomo, the liberal governor of New York.But while Mr. Trump earned headlines at that stage mainly for his romantic escapades and business failures \u2014 a lurid divorce from his first wife, Ivana, and a series of corporate bankruptcies \u2014 even then he gave hints of loftier political goals. In the run-up to the 1988 presidential campaign, he traveled to New Hampshire to give a speech warning of foreign threats to American economic power.The next year, Mr. Trump stirred fierce controversy in New York by calling loudly for the institution of the death penalty, in the aftermath of a brutal assault and rape in Central Park, though the five young men charged with the crime were later exonerated.Still, even as he began to campaign in the early presidential primary states, blasting Mexican migrants in acid language and demanding a shutdown of Muslim immigration into the United States, Mr. Trump never entirely shed his image as a boastful but ultimately benign showman.Republicans of august political lineage, like Jeb Bush, derided him as \u201can entertainer,\u201d and trusted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that voters would discard him as such in the end.Democrats, too, who viewed Mr. Trump as plainly unelectable from the start, acknowledged at times that they might have been wrong to sneer at him early on.Hillary Clinton, appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d last winter, noted that Mr. Trump had initially provoked \u201chysterical laughter,\u201d before his call for a crackdown on Muslims.\u201cI no longer think he\u2019s funny,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a talk show host who joked with Hillary Clinton about Donald J. Trump. He is Seth Meyers, not Myers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teslas in the Trailer Park: A California City Faces Its Housing Squeeze", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byThe town of Mountain View, Google\u2019s home, wants to do something about that. Given new marching orders from a reform-minded City Council that was swept into office here two years ago, Mountain View is looking to increase its housing stock by as much as 50 percent \u2014 including as many as 10,000 units in the area around Google\u2019s main campus.\u201cWe need to provide housing because there\u2019s a housing shortage,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a Mountain View councilman. That may seem an obvious tautology, but it turns out to be highly contentious in a state where most cities and suburbs are still dominated by anti-growth politics that seek to maximize the construction of tax-generating offices while minimizing the number of budget-depleting residents.Mountain View\u2019s political evolution, combined with some limited cases elsewhere, suggests that as rent and home prices have reached the point where even highly paid tech workers are struggling \u2014 the median home here costs $1.4 million, according to Zillow \u2014 the tide is slowly shifting away from resisting growth at all costs and instead trying to channel it.This Silicon Valley city of about 80,000 people is also a reminder that, despite the outsize attention given to big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, any solution to California\u2019s housing crisis is going to rely heavily on suburbs as well.This was underscored by the results of last week\u2019s election, when voters across California passed various affordable housing measures along with new transit funding, and, in some cases, rejected efforts to restrict or cap development. In Palo Alto, several pro-housing candidates were elected to the City Council. Residents in Mountain View approved rent control.\u201cHousing used to be about \u2018them\u2019 \u2014 like poverty or unemployment,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cBut it has become so expensive in the Bay Area that housing now touches enough people to win elections.\u201dMany employees say they would prefer to live closer to work. But these companies reside in small cities that consider themselves suburbs, and the local politics are usually aligned against building dense urban apartments to house them.Take Palo Alto, the Silicon Valley city that has become emblematic of the state\u2019s reputation for rampant not-in-my-backyard politics. Palo Alto has one of the state\u2019s worst housing shortages. With about three jobs for every housing unit, it has among the most out-of-balance mixes anywhere in Silicon Valley.But instead of dealing with this issue by building the few thousand or so apartments it would take to make a dent in the problem, the city has mostly looked to restraining a pace of job growth that the mayor described as \u201cunhealthy.\u201dFarther up the peninsula near San Francisco, the small city of Brisbane told a developer that its proposal for a mixed-use development with offices and 4,000 housing units should have offices for about 15,000 workers, but no new housing.Play that out a thousand times over and the crux of the state\u2019s housing crisis is clear: Everyone knows housing costs are unsustainable and unfair, and that they pose a threat to the state\u2019s economy. Yet every city seems to be counting on its neighbors to step up and fix it.The results are strange compromises like the one made by Rebecca and Steven Callister, a couple in their late 20s who live in a double-wide trailer in a Mountain View mobile home park whose residents are retirees and young tech workers.Mr. Callister is an engineer at LinkedIn, the sort of worker who, in most places, would own a home. But given the cost of housing in Mountain View and the brutal commute times from anywhere they could afford, a trailer makes the most sense and lets him spend more time with the couple\u2019s two young children.\u201cWe joke that it\u2019s the only mobile home park with Mercedeses and Teslas in the driveway,\u201d Mrs. Callister said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the new middle class in California.\u201dIn contrast to Palo Alto, Mountain View is trying to wedge new apartments into its office parks. Much of the action centers on the North Bayshore area, a neighborhood of low-slung office buildings surrounded by asphalt parking lots.Each weekday morning, North Bayshore fills up with cars and young Google employees. They pack the narrow sidewalks and zip around on multicolored bikes. But then the day ends, everyone goes home and there is not much left besides sounds from the nearby freeway and overachievers working late.Mr. Siegel, the city councilman, wants to turn this prototypical example of sprawl into a bustling urban neighborhood. The city has plans for nearly 10,000 new apartments and hopes that businesses like a grocery store, bars and retail shops will follow them.Here in Mountain View, as in many places, residents are mostly aligned against putting too many apartments near the city\u2019s core single-family-home neighborhoods. The city is looking to create new neighborhoods by pushing growth to areas like North Bayshore, where there are already a lot of jobs and few neighbors to complain.Versions of that strategy are taking hold across the Bay Area.Sunnyvale, where Yahoo is based, is looking to transform an older industrial area near one of its rail stations into a new development that would include offices and housing. Menlo Park is studying how to allow for up to 4,500 housing units to be built on industrial land near Facebook\u2019s headquarters.Chris Meany, a partner at Wilson Meany, a real estate development firm in San Francisco, recently headed up a project in San Mateo, about a half-hour south of San Francisco. There, a defunct horse-racing track is being redeveloped into a mixed-use project that sits along a train stop and will eventually comprise five office buildings and 1,000 houses, apartments and condos.Given the political resistance to new housing and the cascade of lawsuits that are a good bet to follow any new proposal, Mr. Meany said he and other developers were more likely to focus on mega-projects with a bigger payoff.\u201cA planner would go out and say, \u2018We should do things regionally and scatter housing throughout the area,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the developer who has to actually get it done, it is better to go off and find large areas of problematic land than trying to choose the smartest location.\u201dNorth Bayshore was historically farmland and the site of the city dump, but in the 1970s, when tech first started booming, Mountain View looked to develop it into a low-density office park.The area has since become a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s booms and busts. Early tenants included faded giants like Silicon Graphics. Then came the 1990s and the dot-com boom and bust.In 1999, just before the bust hit, a little start-up named Google moved from Palo Alto to North Bayshore when it had only a few dozen employees. Today, Google has about 20,000 workers here, and the crush of daily commuters leads to long backups at the three freeway exits into the area.Four years ago \u2014 as Google was swelling, rents were exploding and eviction stories were becoming commonplace \u2014 Mountain View started looking to redevelop North Bayshore. The acrimonious debate over whether to add housing included both predictions that the neighborhood would fill up with the tech equivalent of Chinese factory dorms and worries that residents would disturb a habitat for local burrowing owls.Since then the Council has approved about 2,000 new units elsewhere in town. In all, Mountain View is studying how to add a total of 17,000 units. Mr. Siegel said developers submitted more proposals for housing than the city could process, so the town was looking to hire more planners.There are plenty of desks and a budget to pay them, but few want to take the job.\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba, Amid Intense Hype, Confronts a Slowdown on Singles Day", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byWith clever marketing and help from an online spending boom, the Alibaba Group, in less than a decade, turned Nov. 11 into a symbol of the power of the Chinese consumer. By the end of Friday, by Alibaba\u2019s count, more than $17.7 billion had changed hands on its platforms \u2014 exceeding sales from last year\u2019s event, but a marked slowdown in growth from the previous year.Yet the very dynamics that helped Alibaba engineer the Hallmark-like holiday out of thin air have turned against it.Growth in new internet users is slowing in China, as is growth in the number of Chinese people and companies opening stores on Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms. More important, growth in the value of the goods sold on the company\u2019s platforms is decelerating.Even the numbers underlying the event \u2014 which investors scrutinize as a gauge of the health of Alibaba and the Chinese consumer \u2014 are under a cloud. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how Alibaba reports its Singles Day operating data.Pressed by investor expectations on one hand and a slowdown in growth on the other, investors are watching closely to see what Alibaba\u2019s next act will be.In response, the company has been investing billions of dollars outside China and in a number of thus-far unprofitable businesses like cloud computing. One of its biggest pushes is in entertainment, and Singles Day this year appears aimed at using show business to maintain the buzz.The event this year featured a concert by OneRepublic and appearances by Scarlett Johansson, David and Victoria Beckham, Kobe Bryant and the German soccer player Thomas M\u00fcller. (The singer Katy Perry pulled out of the event, citing a family issue.) The company has also hosted a fashion show, and it is producing a series of television shows for the holiday and introducing a Pok\u00e9mon Go type of augmented reality game.Singles Day has become a symbol of the rise of one of those sources: Chinese consumption. So widely watched is the holiday that Chinese Communist Party leaders have met with the company about the event.\u201cYou live by the sword, you die by the sword,\u201d said Duncan Clark, the founder of the investment advisory firm BDA China and an early adviser of Alibaba who has written a book about the company. \u201cAlibaba has to keep these numbers growing. A slowdown obviously wouldn\u2019t be welcomed by the government.\u201dAlibaba says sales volume is only one metric by which it judges Singles Day, and it said in a written statement that \u201cit is inevitable that the law of big numbers comes into play.\u201dSingles Day was originally an obscure, little-practiced holiday for singles in China to celebrate themselves, and it is held on Nov. 11 for the solitary feeling that the date 11/11 invokes. The company\u2019s version of the holiday was created in 2009 by Daniel Zhang, Alibaba\u2019s current chief executive, who at the time oversaw its Tmall service, the company\u2019s platform for major brands like Adidas and Disney. The promotion, which was intended to help the then-fledgling Tmall platform, posted $7.7 million in sales.Those sales were not reaped by Alibaba, however. The company uses a statistic called gross merchandise value that measures the monetary worth of transactions that flow through its services. Alibaba makes money by charging vendors on its platforms to advertise and for a percentage of sales.\u201cEver heard of a logistics company that reported the value of the goods they shipped?\u201d said Marshall Meyer, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, adding that the metric was confusing in Alibaba\u2019s context.Gross merchandise value is also not defined under accounting standards, and critics have grown increasingly skeptical of the numbers. For example, it does not include returns, which for Singles Day can be as high as 30 percent of sales, analysts say. Alibaba says that returns are usually only in the single digits.Vendors also report that there is pressure to offer steep discounts on Singles Day, ginning up even more sales volume. \u201cIf you don\u2019t lower your price as asked for Singles Day, then in future you will be less favored,\u201d said Odyssey Cheng, a merchant on Alibaba\u2019s sites who sells luxury goods and wine.Alibaba has de-emphasized the metric in recent months and no longer reports it on a quarterly basis. Still, Mr. Zhang, the holiday\u2019s originator, said in an interview that Alibaba decided it would report the number in real time throughout the holiday, as it had in the past.Alibaba, Mr. Zhang said, \u201chad a very transparent conversation with the S.E.C.\u201d He said that Singles Day was a quirk of the Chinese internet that they were proud of, \u201csomething new that didn\u2019t happen in the U.S.\u201dIf it is a novelty, it has its analogues. Perhaps the best comparison might be Apple\u2019s product unveilings each autumn. If Apple\u2019s event has an air of exclusivity and focus on products, Alibaba\u2019s is a far more boisterous, egalitarian affair, but one that turns the company into an emblem of China\u2019s economic rise.\u201cI think me and many in the industry were inspired by Jack Ma and the successful internet businesses of his time,\u201d said Mr. Cheng, the Alibaba merchant. Merchants like Mr. Cheng supply a huge chunk of Alibaba\u2019s revenue as they spend ad dollars on its websites.The same sociopolitical dynamics are at work for Singles Day, except they increasingly include the product-buying audience at home.\u201cThe economy has grown so quickly that more and more people are left with the feeling of not being able to participate fully in the economic miracle,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of the technology research firm Marbridge Consultants. \u201cAll these people now have this holiday where they can celebrate themselves.\u201dWith growth slowing, Alibaba is increasingly counting on those viewers. Last year, the company\u2019s four-hour gala attracted more than 100 million views on television and live-streaming.And Mr. Zhang said that Mr. Ma, who has stepped back from the company\u2019s day-to-day operations, was nonetheless enthusiastic about being part of the show. \u201cJack,\u201d he said, \u201cis very happy to be involved as a participant.\u201dAn article on Friday about Singles Day, an online discounting day in China, misspelled, in some editions, the name of a vendor who uses Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms. He is Odyssey Cheng, not Chang.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Unions Got Wrong About Trump", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisFor the nation\u2019s labor unions, the day after Election Day was going to be a victory lap. They planned to boast to the world that their vaunted get-out-the-vote operation had delivered the White House to Hillary Clinton by winning three crucial Rust Belt states for her: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But the unions, to their shock and horror, failed to deliver those states \u2014 or victory \u2014 to Mrs. Clinton.\u201cWe underestimated the amount of anger and frustration among working people and especially white workers, both male and female, about their economic status,\u201d said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s political committee.One official with the United Steelworkers said his Pittsburgh-based union had urged members to back Mrs. Clinton, but many preferred Mr. Trump, largely because of his tough talk on trade with Mexico and China. Many lapped up his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs, hinting at a return (an improbable one) to the 1950s and \u201960s, when manufacturing boomed and unions were mighty. (Mr. Trump\u2019s G.O.P. allies are spoiling, however, to further hobble labor unions, which are far weaker than in the \u201960s.)Many steelworkers, the official explained, disliked Mrs. Clinton because of her ties to Wall Street, because her husband had championed Nafta and because she had supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership before coming out against the trade pact during the campaign.Most labor leaders viewed Mr. Trump far more harshly than his union backers did; they often attacked him as a con artist and a threat to unions and workers. Mrs. Clinton would have prevailed had she adopted a more muscular pro-worker message, union leaders lament, more like Bernie Sanders\u2019s message attacking trade deals and inequality.With Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and with Republicans now controlling both houses of Congress, unions are expecting a series of stinging blows. Even as Mr. Trump talks of spending $1 trillion to improve infrastructure, many Republicans are eager to repeal an 85-year-old law requiring that contractors pay union-level wages on federal projects. Congressional Republicans are likely to take up nationwide \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation, which would sap union treasuries by barring any requirement that workers pay union dues or fees. And even if Senate Democrats manage to block such a law, Republican gains in Kentucky and Missouri mean those states are likely to enact their own right-to-work laws.Just 11.1 percent of American workers belong to unions, half the level when Ronald Reagan became president and down from 35 percent in the 1950s. However, businesses and Republicans remain wary of labor\u2019s power. \u201cUnions are a small minority of the work force, but they still have a strong war chest that can be used for political purposes,\u201d said Randel K. Johnson, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce.Yet with each new step weakening unions, organized labor will become less of what John Kenneth Galbraith called a \u201ccountervailing power\u201d to balance corporate might. Labor won\u2019t be able to put up as big a fight to raise the minimum wage or prevent cuts in Medicare and tax cuts for the rich.Jacob S. Hacker, a political-science professor at Yale, said the shrunken movement, which represents just 6.7 percent of private-sector workers, faces \u201can existential crisis.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an irony here,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions are probably the most consistent voice for the broad middle class of any organization today, yet the voice of the middle class was seen as an important part of Donald Trump\u2019s victory. The further decline of labor is going to hurt many members of the middle class.\u201dUnions are brainstorming how to weather a Trump presidency. Some will no doubt work with Mr. Trump on rebuilding infrastructure and overhauling trade agreements, while other unions will do battle with him \u2014 on his plans to repeal Obamacare, deport millions of immigrants and much more.Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said that with progressive groups on the defensive, unions would team up increasingly with embattled women\u2019s, environmental and immigrant groups. She said unions needed to continue fighting, no matter who was president. \u201cOur strong belief is collective action is the way for us to win wage increases and create good jobs,\u201d she said.As unions grow weaker, many workers will inevitably continue to search for new ways to band together to make their voices heard.Steven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When A.I. Matures, It May Call J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber \u2018Dad\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byIn a visit with him in this idyllic Swiss city in the mountains near the Italian border, it is easy to understand why he believes that his pioneering work in the field often, as the comedian liked to say, gets no respect.Far away in Silicon Valley, on the other side of the world, the tech industry is building cars that drive themselves and household appliances that respond to your voice commands and even try to predict what you will do next.In certain circles, the people who did the early work that made this technology possible are stars. There is Sebastian Thrun, a roboticist who did groundbreaking research on self-driving cars at Google. Adam Cheyer and Tom Gruber worked on the A.I. program Siri, later acquired by Apple. And Facebook hired Yann LeCun, an expert in \u201cneural networks\u201d who left New York University to start a research program at the social media giant.On a recent train ride to Zurich, Dr. Schmidhuber, an athletic 53-year-old who is co-director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research here, reflected on how he believed his early research was often overlooked or ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s like much of the rest of society,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s postfactual.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber\u2019s complaints are well known within the fraternity of researchers who have turned what until a half-decade ago was an academic backwater into a multibillion-dollar industry. He has been accused of taking credit for other people\u2019s research and even using multiple aliases on Wikipedia to make it look as if people are agreeing with his posts.\u201cJ\u00fcrgen is manically obsessed with recognition and keeps claiming credit he doesn\u2019t deserve for many, many things,\u201d Dr. LeCun said in an email. \u201cIt causes him to systematically stand up at the end of every talk and claim credit for what was just presented, generally not in a justified manner.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber counters that criticism with a bigger point: He is not the only one who is not getting due credit among A.I. researchers. In fact, he says work going all the way back to the 1960s is regularly ignored by today\u2019s research luminaries.Although he insists he doesn\u2019t harbor ill will toward those better-known researchers, it grates on him that history hasn\u2019t been kinder. \u201cCertain researchers in my field have acted as if they invented something, although it was invented by other people whom they did not even mention,\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber said.But understanding the disconnect between his early work and his lack of celebrity isn\u2019t easy \u2014 and cannot be entirely explained by the fact that he lives thousands of miles from the tech industry\u2019s center of gravity.The dispute is about the roots of neural networks, which allow machines to learn by recognizing patterns that can then be applied generally. Applications include recognizing speech and language, visually identifying objects, navigating in self-driving cars and making robot hands grasp more deftly. As a scientific field, it dates to the 1940s. But only in recent years have researchers in this area made striking progress.For decades, neural networks were laboratory curiosities, often met with skepticism. But in the 1990s, with faster and cheaper computers as well as new ideas about how to design neural nets, there was finally progress.Just as humans do not restart learning from scratch every second, a certain type of neural network adds loops or memory that interpret each new word or observation in light of what has been previously observed. LSTM strikingly improved these networks, leading to huge jumps in accuracy.It may be that Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s misfortune is that he was simply too early \u2014 a few years ahead of the powerful and more affordable computers we have today. It was not until recently that his concepts started to pan out.But between Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s and Dr. Hochreiter\u2019s research and today\u2019s progress there was a big gap \u2014 and that\u2019s the rub. Other researchers say it took many contributors to get from Point A to Point B, where we are today.\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of seminal stuff,\u201d said Gary Bradski, an A.I. scientist who created a popular computer vision system known as OpenCV. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t the one who made it popular. It\u2019s kind of like the Vikings discovering America; Columbus made it real.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber also has a grand vision for A.I. \u2014 that self-aware or \u201cconscious machines\u201d are just around the corner \u2014 that causes eyes to roll among some of his peers. To put a fine point on the debate: Is artificial intelligence an engineering discipline, or a godlike field on the cusp of creating a new superintelligent species?Dr. Schmidhuber is firmly in the god camp. He maintains that the basic concepts for such technologies already exist, and that there is nothing magical about human consciousness. \u201cGenerally speaking, consciousness and self-awareness are overrated,\u201d he said, arguing that machine consciousness will emerge from more powerful computers and software algorithms much like those he has already designed.It\u2019s been an obsession since he was a teenager in Germany reading science fiction.\u201cAs I grew up I kept asking myself, \u2018What\u2019s the maximum impact I could have?\u2019\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber recalled. \u201cAnd it became clear to me that it\u2019s to build something smarter than myself, which will build something even smarter, et cetera, et cetera, and eventually colonize and transform the universe, and make it intelligent.\u201dToday, he will not be pinned down on when such thinking machines might arrive, saying only that given the vast improvements in computing power it will be soon.In 2014, he and others founded a company to commercialize some of the technology that he helped create and to work on \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d artificial intelligence.Nnaisense\u2019s chief executive is an American computer scientist, Faustino Gomez, who has been Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s research collaborator for many years. He defends both his partner\u2019s claims of having done pioneering work and his optimism about the field that has begun shaking up industries and economies around the world.\u201cWe are at the beginning of the end of the beginning in A.I.,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece, Property Is Debt", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 At law courts throughout Greece, people are lining up to file papers renouncing their inheritance. Not necessarily because some feckless uncle left them with a pile of debt at the end of his revels; they are turning their backs on what used to be a pillar of Greece\u2019s economy and society: real estate. Growing personal debt, declining incomes and ever higher taxes as Greece\u2019s depression grinds on have turned property and the dream of easy money into dread of a catastrophic burden.The figures are clear. In 2013, two years after a property tax was introduced (previously, real estate tax revenue came mainly from transfers or conveyance taxes), 29,200 people declined to accept their inheritance, according to the Justice Ministry. In 2015, the number had climbed to 45,627, an increase of 56 percent in two years. Reports from across the country suggest that this year, too, large numbers of people are refusing to inherit.\u201cThis can be very painful,\u201d said Giorgos Voukelatos, a lawyer. \u201cPeople may lose their family home. Because if the father or mother had debts, the child might be unemployed and unable to carry this weight as well.\u201dThe growing aversion to property is evident in the drop in business at notaries public. The national statistics service, Elstat, reported in July that in 2014 there were 23,221 deeds in which living parents transferred property to their children, down from 90,718 in 2008. The number of wills drawn up or notarized has been steady through the crisis, at around 30,000 annually, suggesting that many inheritances being rejected were not part of formal wills. (More than 120,000 people die each year.)The desire to inherit used to be so great that some took it upon themselves to give fortune a hand. Greeks were stunned in 1987 when the police uncovered a gang that had killed at least eight rich elderly people after forging their wills. The plot\u2019s leader was a lawyer and former mayor of an Athens suburb; accomplices included a notary public and a gravedigger. Murder Inc., as the news media called it, was seared into popular consciousness as an instance in which criminals acted out a common desire.Today, people are more likely to run away from real estate than be tempted to kill for it.The collapse of the real estate market shows why. The total number of transactions dropped by 74 percent from 2004 to 2014. People once hoped that if they came into property they could sell it and live easier; now they fear that they will be unable to sell it and the taxes will drag them down. If they did find a buyer, they would be unlikely to gain much, as prices of apartments have fallen by 41 percent since 2008, according to the Bank of Greece. Construction of homes has collapsed, dropping by 95 percent from 2007 to 2016. With no end to the crisis in sight, people will continue to dread coming into property.Among the many disruptions of the past few years, this one shows how traditional conceptions \u2014 and a sense of security \u2014 can be shattered. With a history full of wars, bankruptcies and rampant inflation, Greeks had always seen land as a haven. Homeownership, at 74 percent of households in 2014, is well above the European Union average of 70 percent. Old-timers used to urge younger Greeks to buy property to avoid losing savings as they did in frequent currency devaluations \u2014 or in the monster inflation during the Axis occupation in World War II. Parents felt duty-bound to help their children acquire homes or leave them property as the only possible hedge against hardship.\u201cWe have entered a new era,\u201d said Poppy Kakaidi, a lawyer. \u201cWhereas parents wanted to leave their children with a roof over their heads, now the children themselves say, \u2018I don\u2019t want this burden.\u2019\u201d She has several clients who have turned down inheritances, mostly to avoid the deceased\u2019s debts.A striking example of the perils of property is provided by charities that have been richly endowed with real estate. For example, in Athens, the Asylon Aniaton, a hospice, used to fund itself by renting or selling property. Now it\u2019s unable to sell anything, and of its 887 properties, 396 are without tenants. In 2015, its revenue came to 2.17 million euros while it had to pay taxes of 1.83 million euros (of which 908,839 euros were property taxes). What was left went toward caring for 180 patients.Property turning toxic may not be as photogenic as the stock images of the Greek crisis \u2014 masked youths hurling gasoline bombs, or people lining up at soup kitchens \u2014 but it reveals the depth of the crisis and a history of political mismanagement. After many years in which only very valuable properties were taxed, many Greeks went from paying almost no taxes on real estate to not having enough money to pay. In 2010, property taxes accounted for 0.26 percent of gross domestic product, while this year they are around 2 percent, according to state budget figures.Property, which along with tourism could be a pillar of recovery, is not helping. The Bank of Greece noted in June that demand for real estate \u201cis hampered by red tape, unclear urban planning regulations and their numerous violations, and the lack of a stable and clear framework for land-planning and use of land.\u201d It also noted the lack of \u201ca comprehensive and precise\u201d land register.It is inconceivable that after six years of crisis such problems would not have been solved. And yet, the leftist government recently proposed adding further documents and costs to selling or renting property \u2014 a compulsory \u201cenergy performance\u201d certificate and a civil engineer\u2019s assurance that there are no illegal constructions. The property owners\u2019 federation, Pomida, declared that these new obstacles \u201cthreaten to turn the country into an endless \u2018property graveyard\u2019 where nothing will be sold, nothing will be bought and nothing will be rented.\u201dIf he could see Greece today, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the 19th-century anarchist who declared \u201cProperty is theft,\u201d might change his cry to \u201cProperty is debt.\u201dNikos Konstandaras, the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A City Laid Low, Its Team Even Lower", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byOn SoccerSUNDERLAND, England \u2014 Just outside the dressing rooms at Sunderland\u2019s Stadium of Light, the walls are decorated with outsize portraits of the club\u2019s players. They are pictured with arms crossed, eyes narrowed.Each image, as well as an inspiring slogan urging them to \u201cfire the city,\u201d is superimposed on a backdrop of coal. The iconography has not yet had the desired effect; this season\u2019s Sunderland team runs the risk of becoming the worst side the Premier League has ever seen. The message, though, is clear: This is who you are, and this is where we came from.Amid the Premier League\u2019s global glamour, the bond between a team and its home can be easily broken. As clubs have become ever more internationalist, seeking out new markets on new horizons, a sense of dislocation has grown. They exist in a place, but they are not necessarily of it.That is not true of Sunderland. It is not a relic, but it is certainly a reminder of what teams used to represent, a time when a club was a cornerstone of a community.The stadium itself stands on the abandoned shaft of Monkwearmouth Colliery, shut down in 1993, five years after the city\u2019s last shipyard closed its doors, a rapid double blow that stripped Sunderland not just of its past, but of a generation of its future, too.It is all there to remind fans and players of Sunderland\u2019s origins, its place, its meaning. The redesign of the stadium tunnel, and the images of pitmen that went up at the club\u2019s training complex at the same time this summer, was inspired by the same motive: a desire to root the club in its home, to assert the team\u2019s history in the present.On Thursday, the club\u2019s manager, David Moyes, did his bit to maintain that tradition, taking his squad on a tour of the Nissan automobile factory in nearby Washington. It is the largest such factory in Europe, directly providing 7,000 area jobs, and as many as 30,000 more in the supply chain.It is not a replacement for the mines and the yards, but it is as close as the city will get, and a considerable source of local pride. \u201cIt is important we are in touch with the people from the area,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cAnd let them know we know how well they are doing.\u201d\u201cIt has the feel of \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt verges on emotional abuse. We have moved from one managerial catastrophe to another. The only real bright spot was the appointment of Sam Allardyce last year: By the end of the season, we felt we had some kind of platform.\u201d\u201cWe sell out our allocation at every away match,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an affluent place, but we still took 1,500 people to Southampton for a League Cup game on a Wednesday night. Most wouldn\u2019t have got back until 5 a.m. the next day.\u201dOn Saturday, Moyes\u2019s team will be cheered on by 1,200 at Bournemouth, on England\u2019s south coast. It is a round trip of 700 miles.That dedication is proof of the other side of the bond: how much the city needs the club. Sunderland\u2019s is still a fragile economy, as illustrated by the aftermath of Britain\u2019s June referendum on whether to leave the European Union.Sunderland was the first city to report its vote. Despite considerable European Union investment in the city in recent years and Nissan\u2019s threatening to depart in the event of Brexit, 61 percent of voters chose to leave. Paul Watson, the local council leader, warned that the consequences of such a move would be seismic, not just to those employed at the plant but to the \u201cbutchers, bakers and candlestick makers\u201d who relied on those workers\u2019 wages for their own incomes.Last week, Nissan struck a deal with the British government to keep the plant open. The scare served as proof, though, of how delicate the city\u2019s future remains; the soul-searching that followed its apparently self-immolating Brexit vote exposed deep fault lines within a disaffected community.Rebecca Ball described the image of Sunderland portrayed after the referendum as \u201cthe story of a lost city.\u201d Ball is the director of Sunderland\u2019s bid to become the United Kingdom\u2019s City of Culture for 2021. The project is intended to imbue the city with a collective identity and purpose.That is a role that, for more than a century, the club has taken. Roy Keane, who once managed Sunderland, noted in his autobiography that it is the kind of place where \u201cwhat happens on the pitch makes or breaks\u201d the city\u2019s week. Barker calls the club Sunderland\u2019s \u201clifeblood,\u201d and it has endured even in the lean years.Barker is clear that it should not, however, be taken for granted. Over the last few years, Sunderland has drifted into disrepair under the stewardship of Ellis Short, the club\u2019s billionaire, Missouri-born owner. Signings have made \u201cthe squad bigger, but not much better,\u201d Barker said. Managers have come and gone; so, too, models, with two sporting directors appointed and then dismissed. Rumors that Short will sell the club \u2014 if only he could find a buyer \u2014 are constant. True or not, they have allowed fans to detect that, at the top, apathy has been allowed to set in.\u201cPeople at the club need to switch on,\u201d Barker said. \u201cIf that passion goes, all that\u2019s left is apathy. That\u2019s like carbon monoxide. It quietly kills you. Once the fans go, they can be hard to get back.\u201dThat is, in part, why Moyes and his players took an afternoon off to visit Nissan this week. The city has always sought strength in its club in times of weakness. Now it is time for the club to do the same.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Campaign\u2019s Easy Answers Confront Hard Reality", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe harvest had just begun when agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service stormed across the onion fields of Vidalia, Ga., in 1998, sweeping up 21 immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the United States, pulling onions out of the ground for 75 cents per 50-pound bag.And immigration enforcement caved: Shortly after the raid, onion growers in 19 counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate.Welcome to reality.Last week, Donald J. Trump was elected president based on a straightforward promise to make the United States great again. He aimed his message primarily at tens of millions of white working-class Americans who feel left behind in the growing economic prosperity, undercut by the advancement of minorities and women, competition from illegal immigrants at home and cheap workers in other countries.This week, Mr. Trump is being forced to acknowledge that his straightforward solutions are, in fact, much less straightforward than he promised they would be.Mr. Trump has not yet clarified his promises on trade, but most experts say it will be very hard to simply walk away from Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against imports from China. \u201cIn an age of global supply chains,\u201d said Dani Rodrik of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, \u201cyou cannot take a chain saw to trade agreements and not end up cutting your foot off.\u201dSure. But where does that leave Donald Trump\u2019s supporters? To Larry Bartels, the political scientist at Vanderbilt University, the apparent shift in Mr. Trump\u2019s position is unsurprising. Politicians don\u2019t follow the interests of average voters, he argues, they hew to the interests of the rich.\u201cTrump\u2019s \u2018populist\u2019 instincts on economic policy seem to have fallen by the wayside over the course of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Bartels told me. \u201cAnd the need to work with Republicans in Congress will probably reinforce that shift.\u201dIn his book \u201cUnequal Democracy,\u201d published this year, Mr. Bartels offered a snapshot of voter preferences in 2006, before the onset of the financial crisis. On the bottom of the income scale, most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes. But at the top, most opposed them. The picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending. The rich were much more supportive than the poor.And what did voters get? After a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the abyss, they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester.\u201cWhat is going to happen is unclear,\u201d said Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist. \u201cBut what Paul Ryan will want to do is quite clear.\u201dFinally, while Mr. Trump has pitched deregulation \u2014 notably the repeal of President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 as an engine for job growth in the nation\u2019s Rust Belt, he is also set to deliver enormous gains to Wall Street by undoing core provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of 2008.There is definitely a silver lining if Mr. Trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda. The economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting 5 percent of American workers would be immense.But the only real sliver of good news for blue-collar workers, is in Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale. But how will Mr. Trump\u2019s base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to 10 percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them home? And would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working class?For decades, political analysts on the left have been perplexed by working-class Americans who give their vote to a Republican Party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich. This time around, however, they delivered their vote to a Republican who promised to directly address their plight.He has already come up short. Oxford Economics, under its most upbeat assumptions \u2014 a big tax cut and infrastructure spending delivering a lot of economic stimulus while new trade barriers are limited \u2014 foresees growth picking up for a while before falling back to the rate of roughly 2 percent a year that the United States has been living with for the last seven years. If Mr. Trump pursues all-out protectionism, however, Oxford Economics predicts the American economy will plunge into recession.Under either situation, the frustrated working-class voters who cast their vote for Mr. Trump are likely to remain as frustrated as ever: stuck with insufficient education in a world of low growth and diminishing opportunity. Maybe they will figure out that most of the industrial jobs they lost are gone for good, that protectionism can\u2019t bring them back, and that the main driver of their plight is technological change.The critical question then is not so much how Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters will respond politically but how Mr. Trump will react to their inevitable disappointment.Mr. Rodrik \u2014 who is generally sympathetic to the notion that globalization has gone overboard, imposing opaque global rules on democratic governance \u2014 still worries about Mr. Trump\u2019s response.\u201cWhat happens when Trump realizes he cannot adequately respond to the expectations he has raised?\u201d he asked. \u201cDoes he respond to economic failure like all populists around the world do \u2014 by further polarizing the nation and deepening divisions based on identity? And what does that do the quality of our democracy?\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this column misstated when the person shown was arrested. It was October 2015, not last month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vote Highlighted a Gender Gap, With Both Sides Feeling They\u2019ve Lost Ground", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisCall it pink and blue America.To the many divides this ugly presidential campaign has exposed, add the chasm over the treatment of women, the plight of men and the proper roles of each.This was an election that showed how much we still talk past one another when we talk about gender. It made plain profound gaps in how men and women perceive one another\u2019s lives and prerogatives.This was an election in which the grievances of white men \u2014 their economic upheaval, their cultural displacement \u2014 exploded. The fallout included toxic paroxysms of racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and sexism. Misogyny, it appears, thrives in corners of the United States.Donald J. Trump\u2019s hyper-masculinity \u2014 the sexual swagger, the belittling of his opponents, his need to dominate \u2014 appealed to some men who believed he could restore them to their rightful place.Yet men at Trump rallies also spoke of their faith that Mr. Trump, whose business acumen they revered, would bring an outsider\u2019s willingness to take on the elites who put them down.The campaign became a battle of two caricatures: male chauvinist pig against scheming, dishonest woman. It exposed parallel universes. In one, women flooded social media with their memories of sexual assault after Mr. Trump was caught on tape boasting about forcing himself on women. In another, men dismissed the tape as locker room talk or were surprised at how many women told them such harassment was commonplace.As in politics, so in the workplace. At work, women have made substantial inroads and dominate the fastest-growing (and lower paid) segments of the economy, the \u201cpink collar\u201d industries such as health and education. More than a fifth of American men between 20 and 65 had no paid work last year.On campus, young men and women are facing off over what is assault and what is a sexual pass gone awry. Young men frequently protest that they are denied due process in campus hearings of sexual assault; young women charge that their attackers too often go unpunished.Even reading habits diverge: Women read mysteries and true crime; men read science fiction and history, according to Peter Hildick-Smith, the president of Codex Group, which surveys reading patterns.There has been much talk of healing in this fervid season. The racism that President Obama\u2019s election forced to the surface emboldened the so-called alt-right, but also forced many white Americans to acknowledge lasting inequities. That may well be the case during the tenure of President Trump: an eruption of sexism and an inability to deny its virulence.\u201cSome men have this feeling that women are coming \u2014 in education, on polls, on social media, they have a voice,\u201d said Marianne Cooper, a sociologist at Stanford\u2019s Clayman Institute for Gender Research. \u201cThis upends a long history of women knowing their place.\u201dKaty Cockrell, 25, backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but found herself weeping as she cast a vote for Mrs. Clinton and thought of her grandmothers. \u201cThey lived in this \u2018Mad Men\u2019 era, and I thought about how much I admired them as they fought the sexism they\u2019d experienced,\u201d she said.Now, she added of Mr. Trump, \u201cthe tough part for me and women of all ages is that we are going to look at him every day and be reminded of every time we\u2019ve faced sexism in our own lives.\u201dRon Ritz, who attended a Trump rally in Ambridge, Pa., last month, saw in Mrs. Clinton a symbol of all that\u2019s gone wrong in his world. Steel and energy companies once dotted the area; now they are gone. \u201cWe had industries that shut down,\u201d Mr. Ritz, 69, said. \u201cPeople have no jobs, things are bad. And she turns around and tells them they\u2019re deplorable. That\u2019s like kicking a dog that\u2019s tied.\u201dSome research has found a backlash when men feel they are losing their status.Iris Bohnet, the director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School, is a behavioral economist who believes in the principle of \u201cnudging\u201d people toward social norms. That typically means telling people, for example, that their friends have voted in order to prompt them to vote, too.To test if she could induce diversity in hiring, Ms. Bohnet told research volunteers that the group before them had hired a predominantly female team. Men balked and chose to hire more men than women, she found.So what comes next, now that Mr. Trump has defied political convention and political correctness? Some of the men who feel pushed aside are looking to him to rebalance the scales they feel have tipped against them. Many women are wondering whether words and deeds that a half-century of feminism tried to put off limits will now be acceptable.The pink and blue divide may prove as deep, fractious and mutually incomprehensible as the red and blue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At U.N. Meeting, Diplomats Worry Trump Could Cripple Climate Pact", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byMARRAKESH, Morocco \u2014 Diplomats at an annual United Nations global warming summit meeting here expressed shock at the election of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change accord, worrying that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could cripple a decade of climate diplomacy.And some called for retaliation to compel American compliance. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, who is again running to lead his country, suggested imposing a carbon tariff on imports from the United States, based on the amount of carbon dioxide pollution emitted to produce various goods.Salaheddine Mezouar, the Moroccan foreign minister, who is presiding over the Marrakesh meeting, said: \u201cWe really want the U.S., naturally. It has a huge role, a huge weight.\u201dOfficials from the Obama administration sought to reassure the world that even if Mr. Trump rolls back the United States\u2019 federal climate change policy, many states and electric utilities have already turned toward investing in the growing market for low-carbon energy.The Obama administration rolled out a slew of last-minute regulations since the election of Mr. Trump, and more are planned in the coming weeks.\u201cYou can\u2019t keep the waves off the beach,\u201d Ernest J. Moniz, the secretary of energy, said in an interview here, describing his message to counterparts. \u201cWe are heading to a low-carbon economy. The train has left the station.\u201d .And no government has said publicly that it will follow the United States away from the Paris agreement, which committed more than 190 countries to develop plans to combat climate change. Leading diplomats said they expected the pact to be followed with or without the United States.\u201cThe agreement is not dependent on the U.S.,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change envoy, who played a key role in brokering the Paris deal. \u201cMany countries have domestic rationale for wanting to reduce their emissions.\u201dStill, she added, \u201cI hope President Trump considers the laws of physics. Climate change will not stop, even if he stops implementing the rules.\u201d\u201cIt is a new world order,\u201d Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Program, said. \u201cLeadership on climate change policy has now gone to the developing countries, China among them.\u201dA new analysis of carbon dioxide emissions trends published on Monday concluded that planet-warming emissions had leveled off for the past three years in a row, chiefly because of a sharp reduction in China\u2019s emissions.\u201cThe big story is China over the last decade,\u201d said Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, and co-author of the study, an annual analysis published in the journal Earth System Science Data. \u201cNo one expected China\u2019s emissions to grow so fast, and no one expected them to level out and come to such a sudden halt.\u201dChina had long resisted pressure to enact plans to cut its emissions. But that changed after 2014, when President Xi Jinping outlined his plan to lower China\u2019s emissions by 2030. Next year, Mr. Xi plans to start a national program to force industrial greenhouse gas emitters to pay a fee to pollute.Zou Ji, deputy director general of China\u2019s National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, which advises the government, said the Paris Agreement could survive despite Mr. Trump\u2019s election.The leadership vacuum offers Beijing \u201ca way of raising its status, power and leadership in the global order,\u201d Mr. Zou said.The Chinese delegation decorated the walls of its office in red banners, photographs of nature and printouts of English-language quotations about protecting the planet.\u201cWaves of new blood on board, we devote to the affairs of family, nation and globe, composing chapters of commitments,\u201d one read.Mr. Moniz tried to maintain a position for the United States on the diplomatic stage.\u201cWe have made a huge dent by playing a role in innovation and getting the rest of the world to do it,\u201d he said.Behind the scenes, many United States climate officials acknowledged that they remained shellshocked by the results of last week\u2019s election. Plans for the White House delegation to join the governments of Mexico and Canada here on Wednesday to detail a North American road map for aggressive emissions cuts by 2050 have been thrown into question.After last week\u2019s election, some longtime climate policy analysts initially feared a reprise of the fate of the world\u2019s first climate change treaty \u2014 the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. In Kyoto, Al Gore, who was then vice president, pledged that the United States, the world\u2019s largest carbon polluter at the time, would enact an ambitious climate change policy. But President George W. Bush withdrew the United States from the Kyoto accord, and it ultimately had little impact.But unlike Kyoto, the Paris deal has already entered into legal force, since more than half the nations of the world have formally ratified it.\u201cThere is no comparison with Kyoto,\u201d Mr. Mezouar said. \u201cCountries are now legally bound to Paris. They are staying.\u201dStill, he conceded, money is one of the crucial questions going forward. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton promised the rest of the world that rich countries would mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to the ravages of climate change. Without action by the United States, \u201cmuch of the financial contribution could be taken away,\u201d Mr. Mezouar said.Others said the impact of global warming might change Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. A study this week from the World Meteorological Organization found 2016 on track to be the hottest year on record, blowing past the records set by 2014 and 2015.\u201cTrump\u2019s election, in a moment when climate action has finally been mainstreamed into the economy, gives Republicans a chance to reconcile with real life,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Ferretti, a coordinator of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, said. \u201cIn real life, we keep breaking temperature records, and extreme events impact Democrats and Republicans alike.\u201dChristopher Buckley contributed from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Official: Many Orchestras Are Now Charities", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 There is a stark reality increasingly facing American orchestras: They are now charities, relying more, on average, on philanthropy than on the ticket sales that used to buttress them.Orchestras (and their growing marketing departments), for example, must now spend more to sell single and group tickets \u2014 at a time when it is harder to fill seats. (Attendance declined by 10.5 percent between 2010 and 2014, the study found.) And as ensembles and their development departments work to appeal to philanthropists, many are now going beyond merely making music, offering more educational programs and community engagement initiatives. Finally, there is increasing pressure from many boards and administrators to try to curb growing costs, which can lead to labor disputes like the strike here.The question of how effectively orchestras can attract philanthropic support is increasingly the key to their survival. The report found that in 2014, an average of 43 cents of every dollar orchestras received came from contributions, while 40 cents came from ticket sales, touring, hall rentals, parking and other sources of earned income; and the remainder from investments. (These are averages, and some orchestras still bring in more revenue from ticket sales, but fund-raising is crucial to all.)\u201cIt\u2019s shifting,\u201d Jesse Rosen, the president and chief executive officer of the League of American Orchestras, said in an interview. \u201cIt has been a transactional thing: We put on concerts, you buy a ticket, and we take your money, and that keeps us going, and everything is fine. Now it is: What is the value we make in this community? Because it\u2019s now primarily philanthropic support driving the engine.\u201dMr. Rosen said that the report showed that while contributed income had dipped during the Great Recession, it has now recovered, and even exceeds its prerecession levels. And he said that fewer orchestras were now running deficits than during the recession.But the period since the recession has been unusually tumultuous. Since 2010, labor battles have led to at least 14 work stoppages at orchestras \u2014 half because of strikes, and half because of lockouts \u2014 according to the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, a players\u2019 conference of the musicians\u2019 union, the American Federation of Musicians. A handful of orchestras \u2014 in Louisville, Ky.; Honolulu; and Philadelphia \u2014 have filed for bankruptcy.And marquee orchestras have not been immune to serious pressures: The New York Philharmonic has run deficits every season since 2001-2, orchestra officials said.But others, particularly those that own valuable mixed-genre performance spaces, have shown remarkable strength. The Los Angeles Philharmonic has the Hollywood Bowl; the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Tanglewood \u2014 both robust sources of revenue.Others are working their way back. The Minnesota Orchestra, which endured a bitter 16-month lockout, returned to tour Cuba and Europe. The Louisville Orchestra is playing again with a charismatic young conductor, Teddy Abrams, but its forces have been reduced to 55 musicians from 71. And the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, which locked out its musicians twice in recent years, announced last month that it had raised $25 million to help restore positions that had been left unfilled. (In recognition of a $2.5 million gift from the Delta Air Lines Foundation, its principal tuba player will hold the Delta Air Lines Chair.)Meredith Snow, who was elected chairwoman of the musicians\u2019 conference in August, said that there was concern among players that some boards were trying to use the recent downturn as an excuse to force long-sought cuts in pay and benefits, which would ultimately damage artistic quality. She suggested many would be better off increasing their fund-raising efforts.\u201cI know their job is hard, to go out and raise money,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut you don\u2019t raise it by going around saying, \u2018This is impossible!\u2019\u201dAdministrators note that not all cities can afford the same kind of orchestra, and some ensembles that once played in industrial powerhouses now find themselves in struggling Rust Belt cities.The players, who question management\u2019s forecasts, noted that a 15 percent cut to their current base pay of $107,000 would mean that they were no longer among the 10 best-paid American orchestras. But early on, they did indicate flexibility on the pension issue. (The two sides are not speaking publicly right now, as they have been meeting with a federal mediator.)Outside Heinz Hall one recent morning, the picket line continued. Cynthia Koledo DeAlmeida, the orchestra\u2019s principal oboe, held a sign that said, \u201cI\u2019d Rather Be Making Oboe Reeds.\u201d Inside, the stage was set with empty chairs, empty music stands, and an empty podium. The hall was silent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our New Urban Oases", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.A former conduit for coal and other freight, the viaduct exudes the late-capitalist poetry of urban neglect. You can follow a path through waist-high weeds hacked by enterprising city explorers, who cut holes in fences emblazoned with NO TRESPASSING notices to gaze nostalgically at ghostly ironworks signage, or at the reddish girders of a defunct energy-transfer station. Paulownia trees dot the viaduct, another relic of long-gone global commerce: The tree\u2019s pistachio-shell-shaped seeds were used as packing material for Chinese porcelain in the 19th century, falling out of crates to seed and sprout along railways around the world.Soon this sprawling postindustrial vision, too, will be part of the past. Ground was broken last month on the Rail Park, a rehabilitation project to turn the Reading Viaduct into an elevated park. It follows a recent flurry of similar parks: the Bloomingdale Trail in Chicago, the Atlanta BeltLine and, of course, the wildly successful High Line in Chelsea in Manhattan. All drew inspiration from the Promenade Plant\u00e9e in Paris, completed in 1993, the first conversion of an elevated railway into a pedestrian park.If the new railway parks have revitalized the infrastructure of the early-20th-century industrial economy, the process of \u201ccapping,\u201d building green spaces over freeways, turns urban expressways, the hallmark of midcentury planning, into vital links among communities. In 2012, Klyde Warren Park capped the Woodall Rodgers freeway in Dallas, bringing together northern and southern parts of the city, while Boston\u2019s notorious Big Dig project was covered by the Rose Kennedy Greenway in 2008. Monuments to ways of life and work that we no longer require are being converted, one by one, into promenades and playgrounds, changing what we think cities are for and how they ought to be used.This model of urban design has come to be known as landscape urbanism. One of its primary theoreticians, Charles Waldheim, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Design, traces its roots to Frederick Law Olmsted. In his book \u201cLandscape as Urbanism,\u201d Waldheim notes that Olmsted was one of the earliest figures to call himself a landscape architect (though it was a term that Olmsted considered inadequate), and that he was full of visions for integrating landscape and urban life. But Olmsted\u2019s Central Park, for example, is a classic instance of placing nature in opposition to the city: it\u2019s meant to be a balm, an oasis; in rocky, deliberately overgrown sections like the Ramble it mimics the wilderness a city must exorcise and destroy.The landscape urbanist, by contrast, sees the decline of the industrial city as prompting a variety of opportunities for naturalism. In cities dominated by service economies, Waldheim argues, landscape urbanism can clean up the industrial economy by reintegrating it with the natural world. In so doing, it creates entirely new urban experiences: The High Line makes it possible to saunter in the air, among apartments and offices, at a much slower pace than at street level. As James Corner, a designer of the High Line, once wrote, \u201cThe visitor becomes as much a performer as viewer, more deeply engaged in participating in the theatricality of urban life \u2014 the promenade as elevated catwalk, urban stage and social condenser.\u201d The experience is nonetheless limited and directed, a kind of soft coercion. You aren\u2019t encouraged to linger on the High Line: with its crush of tourists, it\u2019s more a Manhattan-themed ride than a park.The new parks aren\u2019t just oases, then; they emphasize the intertwining of landscape and industry. It\u2019s no coincidence that landscape urbanists are beguiled by Detroit, a crumbling monument to what is sometimes called Fordism \u2014 after Henry Ford\u2019s mass-production-mass-consumption model \u2014 a paradise of dereliction reclaimed by nature. A \u201cformerly urban\u201d space, in the terminology of Waldheim and his peers, it offers little for traditional architecture but everything for an urbanist trained to see value in rescuing the decaying built environment. Detroit, for a landscape urbanist, is a symbol for processes taking place in cities everywhere: once-bustling ports shrunk by the advent of the shipping container, hulking buildings abandoned as low-wage economies replace high-wage ones. In the Qianhai area of Shenzhen, China, Corner designed a new district that reclaims industrial land, repurposing the tributaries of several channels recently used for drainage as \u201cwaterfront.\u201dSimilarly, defunct rail lines are sometimes meant not to be repurposed but to be re-embraced. Both the Atlanta BeltLine and Chicago\u2019s Bloomingdale Trail take transportation infrastructure and turn it into newer transportation infrastructure. The BeltLine connects disparate neighborhoods by bike (and soon, streetcar) in a city that is a byword for sprawl, while the Bloomingdale Trail becomes a raised express lane for cyclists and walkers. Klyde Warren \u2014 a well used if anodyne public park, filled routinely with yoga classes \u2014 connects Dallas\u2019s Uptown and Downtown neighborhoods, previously walled off by the freeway. It\u2019s now become possible, as I discovered, to walk through a generous portion of Dallas, something unimaginable just a few years ago. It\u2019s post-post-industrial planning \u2014 trying to make whole the freeway-carved cities that date from an era when car-centric planning was in vogue.Yet for all its power to bring communities together, repurposing freeways and old industry can go hand in hand with gentrification, increasing inequality and displacement. The effect has been profound in formerly down-at-heel spots along Atlanta\u2019s 22-mile BeltLine, where old industrial sites have been converted into new market-rate and luxury housing. Philadelphia\u2019s Rail Park is already being promoted by local landlords as a selling point for new housing in the surrounding Callowhill neighborhood (a section is currently being rebranded as the Spring Arts District). In both instances, it\u2019s not that the parks created demand where none existed but that they drove, or will drive, already ongoing development. The High Line did not suddenly draw attention to an otherwise unknown Meatpacking District (though it certainly drove interest in Hudson Yards). Still, even boosters concede that these projects have the potential to displace longtime residents. Ryan Gravel, whose master\u2019s thesis in city planning and architecture became the basis for the BeltLine, eventually resigned from the board of the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership. Gravel wanted more focus on and subsidies for affordable housing.It\u2019s instructive to imagine what this model would look like applied to transit. Would it be legitimate to have a Friends of the New York City Subway that raises millions of dollars in private funding in order to retrofit a section of subway line \u2014 which, newly cleaned up and rat-free, would spur development in the surrounding area \u2014 and then receive more in taxpayer dollars than any other subway line? Why not privatize everything?We haven\u2019t gotten there yet. Parks still subsist largely on public funds. But places like Central Park and Bryant Park look better than they did in the 1970s in part because they get a significant boost from partnerships and private fund-raising. The High Line is perhaps now the greatest outdoor corporate event space in New York City. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx have a tougher time. What is so attractive about the parks, in other words, is also what\u2019s wrong with them. The new public parks give form to cities misshapen by abandoned industry, but threaten to bring into being a novel form of inequality in cities already rife with it. They exude the priorities of a new Gilded Age, even as they cover up the eyesores of an old one. \u2666Nikil Saval is an editor at n+1 and the author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\u201dProduced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Burkina Faso, Rebuilding With a Local Touch", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported bySpotlightThe architect Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 was born in a poor village in Burkina Faso where there was no school, no electricity and no access to clean drinking water. His father, the village chief, decided that his son should be the first in the family to learn how to read and write, so he sent him at age 7 to live with an uncle in a distant city, where he sat with 150 other students in an unventilated classroom in 110-degree heat. During his free time, like many of his peers, Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 had to work, spending hours fixing crudely built homes, which were in a perpetual state of disrepair. \u201cIn my heart, I felt even then that I wanted to build things better one day, so that kids like me would be free to learn,\u201d he said.Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 won a scholarship to study in Germany and worked his way into architecture school at the Technical University of Berlin. For his first student project, in 2001, he raised $50,000 to build an elementary school in his native village of Gando. He enlisted the help of local villagers, drawing blueprints for them in the sand. He dug up red clay and compressed it into bricks.Recently, Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 has been devising ways of rebuilding the parliament building in Burkina Faso\u2019s capital of Ouagadougou, which was set on fire during the country\u2019s 2014 uprising. In the following edited interview, Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 explains how his style of community architecture can play a part in preventing further violent clashes while also giving people the tools to improve their lives.Q. One of the key ideas behind your work is that you\u2019re not importing architecture to Africa or relying on foreign companies or NGOs. Instead, you try to empower local people to build from existing materials, techniques, traditions. Q. You are involved in the effort to rebuild Burkina Faso\u2019s parliament building, and there have been reports that you\u2019re discouraging the government from constructing a Western-style official building. What do you see in its place?Q. Do you think turning an official building into a public space is a political statement?Q. Almost immediately after starting your architecture studies, you came back to your native village and started building a school. What made you return so quickly?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, He Thought Trump Would Win. No, He Didn\u2019t Use Hard Data.", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe story of the 2016 election is one of a stunning defeat, not just for Hillary Clinton, but also for the pollsters, pundits and data-driven journalists who overwhelmingly predicted her victory.The model, developed in 1981 with the Russian mathematical geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok and elaborated in the book \u201cPredicting the Next President: The Keys to the White House 2016,\u201d is simple on the surface. It disregards complex formulas in favor of 13 true-or-false statements measuring the underlying force that Dr. Lichtman, based on analyses of elections from 1860 through 1980, believes really matters: the strength of the incumbent party.The \u201ckeys\u201d include statements like \u201cAfter the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections\u201d; \u201cThe economy is not in recession\u201d; and \u201cThe incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.\u201dSix or more false keys \u201cpredict upheaval,\u201d Dr. Lichtman said on Wednesday.Not really. Henry Clay said I\u2019d rather be right than be president. I don\u2019t exactly feel that way. But the thing I like most about being right is that it puts some pressure on conventional punditry, which I think is really a pernicious influence on our nation.Punditry has no scientific basis but simply reacts to the latest polls, which miss the fundamentals of an election and what really drives our politics.Even the pundits are calling the election a stunning defeat for polling itself. Is the success of your model also a victory for historical scholarship over so-called quant-driven political science?You developed your model in 1981, in collaboration with the Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, who was perhaps the world\u2019s leading expert on predicting earthquakes. Did you seek him out specifically because of that part of his work?Everything we know about elections we\u2019ve stolen from geophysics anyway \u2014 we talk about tremors of change, volcanic elections. What our model looks at isn\u2019t Republicans versus Democrats, liberals versus conservatives, or one personality versus another, but the underlying stability of the incumbent party.The conventional wisdom is that Trump has shattered the norms of American politics. Does the fact that his victory conforms to patterns going back to 1860 suggest otherwise?This year I did issue a qualification of my model for the first time. I said that in Donald Trump, we may have a candidate who is so outside the bounds of history that he could break the patterns of history. This should be a change election, but maybe Trump was too much of a change?I do think we saw those two effects coming into play here. On the one hand, Donald Trump won the Electoral College. But on the other hand, the popular vote is basically a tie. That reflects a fascinating confluence of these two forces: the force of history and the force of the history-breaker. [In 2000, Dr. Lichtman predicted that Al Gore, who won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote, would defeat George W. Bush.]Your focus on the incumbent party cuts sharply against the narrative of this year\u2019s election, which emphasized the supposed implosion of the Republican Party, or at least its leadership. Was all that attention to the state of the party totally misplaced?But contrary to all the pundits, Donald Trump won not because of Donald Trump and his campaign, but despite them. Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t to blame for this loss. The Democrats are already a shattered party. They hold nothing. They would further undermine themselves and pulverize themselves if they blamed Hillary Clinton for this loss. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She won the three debates. But she was up against a bigger force.So much of the commentary on Trump by your fellow historians concerned analogies: Is Trump a new Hitler? Mussolini? George Wallace? Do you see any use in that kind of historical comparison?I don\u2019t talk like that. I think that\u2019s superficial. He\u2019s none of those, but he may be a danger unto himself. Or he might not be. I hope not. He has certainly stirred up the worst elements in America. Whoever thought the Ku Klux Klan would endorse a major-party candidate?Is there anything about the actual voting results that did surprise you? Maybe that Trump won more of the Hispanic vote than you might have expected, but I don\u2019t really want to analyze that. [The bigger picture] is that the outcome is utterly inexplicable, based on conventional analysis. Some of the pollsters are good friends, and good people, but during the next election, I hope we send them to a very nice Pacific Island for a very nice vacation.Advertisement"}

By the time he got to the front, Junaid Ahmed said, the bank had run out of new bills.Milan Odedara, a software engineer in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, said he, too, had to stand in line, but he felt it was worth it. \u201cAt least for some years, black money holders will live in fear for what\u2019s coming next for them,\u201d he wrote.\u201cI run an ad agency, and my clients have stopped all work. There is an air of uncertainty and desperation. I had to pull my staff away from other important work in order to make them stand in queues day in and day out, just to be able to get some cash to manage day-to-day activities.\u201d\u201cMost of my transactions are online or using my debit card, so in terms of that, there\u2019s been little change. Dealing with street vendors for vegetables, fish, meat, however, is a whole different story. We now have to buy online where prices are far higher and quality is not necessarily better.\u201d\u201cThis move was a rude shock to those who were comfortably sitting on their pile of black money.\u201d\u201cPaying for essentials has become a nightmare.\u201d\u201cMy husband\u2019s parents are both above the age of 60 and do not own credit or debit cards. They withdraw large sums of money at a time and use them for household expenses so as to limit the multiple trips to the bank. They both are not physically able to even stand in a queue, but they did it.\u201d\u201cWe cannot buy things from nearby shops anymore because they don\u2019t have bills of higher denomination. So we head to malls or supermarket where we can pay using credit card and debit cards. Small businesses have taken a hit.\u201d\u201cWe at least are able to manage some emergencies by making payments online, but to think of the plight of all the farmers, laborers and workers is highly disturbing.\u201d\u201cFor my parents, it was bit of a discomfort. My father had to take one full day off from his work to deposit and exchange old bills that he had. Same goes for my grandparents. Local vegetable vendors stopped setting up stalls as they don\u2019t have cash to buy from farmers. Even though they have new bills of 2,000 rupees, they can\u2019t use them unless the other person has enough cash to return the change.\u201d\u201cPersonally, my family has not been affected much. Yet. We managed to deposit the 15,000 or so we had in cash into our local post-office account, as the bank queue had already grown large.\u201cWe live in a rural area, with a small town about four miles away where everyone goes to do most of their weekly shopping. As of now, the shopkeepers are still accepting the old 500 notes as a favor, and we have done most of our shopping either through those or on credit.\u201cThe problems probably start coming some time later, though. As we near the deadline of Dec. 30, shops will stop accepting the old notes.\u201d\u201cMy cash usage has always been minimal. I was barely affected. My parents who live in a smaller city faced very few problems. The lines outside banks disappeared within a couple of days and things are back to normal. Most small shops have started accepting digital wallets or credit cards.\u201d\u201cI am not a very big fan of Mr. Modi, but I totally support this move. As Indian citizens, we see everyday how corruption cripples our nation.\u201d\u201cThe main goal of this move is to bring the shadow economy inside the mainstream economy. India needs to expand its gross domestic product to lift people out of poverty. The shadow economy doesn\u2019t yield taxes but any transaction done online leaves an audit trail, and it becomes impossible to hide illicit wealth. India is moving to the future where payments will be made online. I agree with Prime Minister Modi, and this move is such a decisive act of leadership, considering all the political risks and economic variables. I voted him in to take tough decisions, and he is doing just that.\u201d\u201cThe cost of doing illegal business will increase.\u201d\u201cWhile I agree with the motive behind the move, I really question whether the government was prepared to implement the new scheme. The government seems to be changing the policy every day, which feels like there\u2019re making it up as they go along. Better preparation would have made this so much easier. The worst affected are those who don\u2019t even have bank accounts, making it so much harder to change their notes.\u201d\u201cNo money to get day-to-day groceries, hardly any grocer has electrical payment methods.\u201cWhy are we middle-class people bearing this burden? We are not keeping stashes of money under our bed. No planning, bad planning.\u201d\u201cI deposited all my old notes into my account at a private bank and then withdrew an amount for meeting my daily cash expenses. The process was relatively hassle-free and quick.\u201cThe move seems unlikely to change the practice of relying on cash. The systems and sources that give rise to untaxed wealth remain the same as before. Once the immediate cash liquidity situation is resolved, things will revert to the earlier state, in due course. Ultimately, it is the people who are used to corruption and tax avoidance. Scrapping notes will not change citizens\u2019 basic tendencies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Moment of Great Peril\u2019: Foreign Observers on Trump\u2019s Success", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byEditorial writers and opinion columnists around the world have reacted to Donald J. Trump\u2019s election as the 45th president of the United States. Below is a sampling of their views.The victory of Donald Trump confirms some lessons that everybody already knew \u2026 but which nobody wanted to understand.The first is that disgust has become the principal engine of elections. Forget policy proposals: People are voting for personalities, not for candidates; for likability, not ideology; to reject someone, not out of conviction.The third and perhaps most serious is that this disgust is easily exploitable through populism: telling people what they want to hear; polarizing the world into good guys and bad guys; making campaigns into reality shows; and pushing with such insistence the button of false patriotism.If the United States were a banana republic, the outcome of this election would be damaging only for its unfortunate inhabitants. But this nation provides international security and global economic stability. One false step by the government of the United States could drag the rest of the world into turmoil that only benefits those who are careless or enemies of Western values. These are not signs of optimism. Since brazen lying was Trump\u2019s main electoral weapon, it\u2019s hard to know if he\u2019s being honest when he promises to govern for all Americans. What is clear is that he didn\u2019t present any credentials for occupying the world\u2019s most important political position, aside from his distinguished handling of demagogic degeneracy. God save America!The world waits nervously to see if Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are as incendiary as his words. The shift to a more positive tone since the election result is a first step. But this remains a moment of great peril. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, coming after the Brexit referendum vote in Britain, looks like another grievous blow to the liberal international order. Mr. Trump must decide, by his actions and words, whether he intends to contribute to the great unraveling, at incalculable cost to the West.Donald Trump\u2019s election is an earthquake, a game changer for Western democracy. Like the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11, this event marks the beginning of a new world where only one thing is certain: in this new place, everything that was once thought impossible, or unrealistic, is now conceivable. Each country is different, but the anger common in every one is rooted in a broad fear of globalization that focuses on two themes: immigration control and income inequality. The British cast their Brexit votes with those in mind. Trump predicted his victory would be a \u201cBrexit times 10.\u201d He was right. And this is also a way of saying that Europe is not protected from the seismic shift that has just shaken Washington to the core. \u2026Unfortunately for her, Hillary Clinton embodied perfectly the quintessence of the American political elite. Rightly or wrongly, her image reflected the status quo \u2014 despite her having the most solid and achievable program. There are many lessons to be learned from this election. Traditional political parties must take heed. So must the media and the pollsters, who for the most part, did not predict this outcome and no longer know how to gauge public opinion. These lessons are all the more vital because those who represent the voices of protest anger, whether it be Trump or his European clones, have no idea how to solve these complex problems. They sell illusions, and Trump is the master illusionist. They live off simplistic arguments which threaten our democracies. From Paris, Trump\u2019s victory coming after Brexit is another prescient warning. In this new postelection world, everything is possible. The prospect that we in France are still unable to look at in the eye looms: the rise to power of the far right.America is a revolutionary nation where populism asserted itself in 1829 with the election of Andrew Jackson; it\u2019s a phenomenon to be respected even by those who do not share in it. More so because it is something that affects us closely, being very similar to the discontent of the European middle class that generated \u201cBrexit\u201d and that nurtures a heterogeneous galaxy of protest movements from France, to Germany, to our country.Trump has presented pro-Putin elites with a hope (largely irrational) that this force majeur \u2014 and that\u2019s how Trump\u2019s sudden victory can be viewed \u2014 will break the unequivocal anti-Russian trend... Even if that hope won\u2019t materialize (and chances are high that it won\u2019t), Trump\u2019s victory is perceived by Russian elites as a tactical advantage. Trump is a synonym of uncertainty and ambiguity, of the old logical and axiological constructions being demolished, of a moderate, however temporary, demoralization of the American political class and of Washington\u2019s allies. Even if the Kremlin supports Trump, it\u2019s far from placing a bet on Trump as such. This is a game with an aim to cause internal chaos in the most problematic foreign policy partner of Russia ... Trump\u2019s election is also a moral and psychological victory for Putin by which he gains a very strong case about the crisis of traditional Western democracy and its institutions, about peoples\u2019 fatigue from politicians who \u201cgrew detached from reality,\u201d about the civilizational crisis of the West where citizens have found a way to voice their protest by electing \u201cfreaks.\u201dAhmad Abdel-Tawab, columnist for the state-run Egyptian newspaper Al-AhramMuch will be said about the strange victory of Donald Trump \u2014 despite the suspicious consensus of the largest American newspapers and televisions, which predicted his defeat. The press sought to destroy him with vicious, organized campaigns, accusing him of being inexperienced and perverted, selfish and aggressive, etc. Alongside them, opinion polls that claimed to follow scientific methods claimed he would lose, putting forward numbers and percentages showing him to be the loser.That itself needs extensive study. It questions assumptions about the active role of advertising in political races, and the role of direct communication between the people whom Trump relied on until he achieved his unexpected win \u2014 which he achieved with an overwhelming majority. \u2026We must now consider the positive points on which we can cooperate \u2014 especially his clear statements to fight terrorism and particularly his promise to eliminate the Islamic State. \u2026An Islamophobe is bad for India, not least because Islam is one of India\u2019s faiths, practiced by 15 percent of its people: Anyone who seeks to harm Muslims seeks to harm 150 million Indians. A Sinophobe is bad for India because China is a pillar of the global economy, of which this country is now a part. A man who harbors racist views about one set of brown people \u2014 Latin Americans, say \u2014 is unlikely to think well of others.But perhaps most important, Trump is bad for India because he is bad for his own country, and the well-being of the U.S. is now closely connected to our own. There is every indication that his leadership will harm American interests, at home and abroad. Even the attempt to keep some of his more outlandish promises \u2014 to build a wall along the border with Mexico; to tear up defense treaties with NATO, Japan and Korea; to reverse policies designed to forestall climate change \u2014 will weaken the U.S., just when India\u2019s ties to it are at their strongest.Some people have called this a \u201cpolitical uprising,\u201d or an American \u201cCultural Revolution.\u201d Although these descriptions may be far-fetched, they do capture something of the current ideological and political spirit of America. Although Trump\u2019s name has long become familiar worldwide, the United States and the world were never mentally prepared for him to become U.S. president. \u2026 Therefore his victory will first of all bring a powerful emotional shock. His election has left people with a feeling of their frameworks being smashed and foundations shaking. \u2026Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be one of the areas of greatest uncertainty. The direction of Sino-U.S. and Russian-U.S. relations will affect international relations in their entirety. ... There might be more of an element of bargaining in Sino-U.S. relations, and arguments over some key interests will sharpen, but Trump\u2019s interest in a new kind of Sino-U.S. great power relationship should be greater than Obama\u2019s, who was heavily influenced by Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign-policy thinking.Editorial in the Japanese daily Asahi ShimbunThere is no doubt that the global leadership of the United States will come into question with the emergence of a president who openly puts a priority on the interests of an inward-looking United States. If Mr. Trump seriously desires to recover the strong America he called for during his election campaign, we hope he will rebuild trust and return to American values once again.Now we know. For 20 years, Australians have been happy to assume that America had the strength and resolve to remain the world\u2019s leading power. In particular, our leaders have assured us that we can rely on America\u2019s power and judgment to manage China\u2019s rise, to keep Asia stable and Australia safe. But now we know that America is not the country we thought it was.Americans themselves will of course be in deep shock at this outcome, and it may take some time for the shape of Donald Trump\u2019s new America to become clear. But we can be pretty sure that the old image of America\u2019s role in the world, so confidently asserted by the policy elites on both sides of the U.S. political divide, has been smashed by American voters. They have elected as president a man who does not believe in the vision of American leadership on which Australia has for so long relied. \u2026The reality is that while American political leaders and policy intellectuals have talked incessantly about America\u2019s unchallengeable power and unshakable resolve, its voters and taxpayers \u2014 and the social-economic classes that provide most of the soldiers \u2014 have seen money and often lives wasted in a long series of policy failures. Who can wonder that an electorate already angry about economic stagnation and poor services turn their backs on all this.Reporting was contributed by Aurelien Breeden and Beno\u00eet Morenne from Paris; Christopher Buckley from Beijing; Sewell Chan from London; Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea; Diaa Hadid from Cairo; Michelle Innis from Sydney, Australia; Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City; Oleg Matsnev from Moscow; Nida Najar from New Delhi; Gaia Pianigiani from Rome; Motoko Rich from Tokyo; and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Traumatized Brain That Helped Heal a Broken Heart", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byTiesI knew it would be bad; the only question was how bad.After waiting outside a surgical ward at Jersey City Medical Center for what seemed like an eternity, the neurosurgeon emerged, introduced herself and explained that blood clots were forming in my husband\u2019s brain, a result of multiple fractures to his skull. Even after an extensive operation, internal swelling and pressure on his brain were building to levels \u201cinconsistent with life,\u201d the doctor explained. To survive the night, he needed another operation.Less than 24 hours earlier, on Dec. 13, 2014, Steve \u2014 my husband and the father of our two young children \u2014 left our Brooklyn apartment for a networking trip in Atlantic City with four colleagues. Throughout the day, he sent me text updates, including a goofy selfie intended to amuse our daughter, then 3 years old.Around 6 a.m., I received a call from two of the colleagues who had been with him in Atlantic City. Steve had been in an accident, they said, and I should call the emergency room. They had been with him all day, but couldn\u2019t explain what happened to him.After that second brain surgery, his neurosurgeon, Dr. Lauren Schwartz, returned to tell me she had to remove significant chunks of Steve\u2019s frontal lobe and temporal lobe \u2014 and that he might not be able to speak or function normally ever again.Even if he managed to emerge from the medically induced coma with his faculties intact, Steve had a long and arduous road ahead, most likely measured in years, with no guarantee that he would return to his former self.Many victims of a brain trauma become overwhelmed by anger, depression and frustration about the slow pace of their recovery and the memory of who they used to be. The severity of Steve\u2019s trauma \u2014 and the apparent violence that caused it \u2014 were tailor-made triggers for those emotions.But after Steve\u2019s initial surgeries, I became increasingly confident about his chances for a successful recovery. \u201cIf I know one absolute truth about my husband, it is that he rises above and exceeds expectations,\u201d I wrote in an email to Dr. Schwartz.In retrospect, a reflexive coping mechanism may have been kicking in \u2014 any reasonable analysis should have drastically lowered my expectations. But I believed I had reason for optimism.Steve\u2019s brain was engineered to move forward. As a gifted mathematician, he saw the world as a series of equations to be solved. And like an elite athlete, he didn\u2019t handicap goals with unhelpful emotions.Steve had been wiring his brain at an early age, partly out of necessity. Raised in a house beset by mental illness, he had to learn to protect himself from harmful emotions and focus on goals. It served him well academically, as he skipped a grade in middle school and went to college at 16. It was a risky social and emotional step for someone so young, but he graduated with honors and was recruited by Goldman Sachs as a programmer.I have always been drawn to his self-deprecating wit and his Olympic reasoning abilities. In an argument, Steve could keep his head while others lost theirs.I didn\u2019t always appreciate his economy of emotion. In 2008, when our first child, Sophia, was stillborn at 39 weeks and four days, I carried around her memory, nearly crippled by the weight of the loss.Steve appeared set on moving forward from the very beginning. In the delivery room, I asked Steve to hold Sophia, which he did, but he quickly returned her to the bassinet, seemingly signaling his intent to move on. Over time, my anguish turned to resentment over how he could forge ahead, focus on his work and not share my pain.For years, even when we went on to have two healthy children, I still felt compelled to carry the emotional weight of Sophia\u2019s memory. But after Steve\u2019s horrific injuries, I knew I had to try to learn to do for my husband what I had been unable do for myself: keep my brain from dwelling on tragedy.Almost two years later, I can still allow myself to become furious about what happened to my husband, still an unsolved mystery. I want to know what happened and who was responsible and have the perpetrators admit their guilt. A part of me wants to linger daily on the unknowns.But Steve inspired me to follow his lead, as I witnessed his unrelenting drive to return to his former self \u2014 and his refusal to be consumed by what happened to him and why.One afternoon, a few days after he awoke from his coma, Steve received a visit from a former colleague he had not seen in more than a decade. Still suffering post-traumatic amnesia, Steve couldn\u2019t speak coherently or remember my name. But when his colleague entered the room, Steve\u2019s eyes widened. He wiggled upright and offered a handshake. It was a moment I celebrated for days.Weeks later, with parts of his speech returning, Steve made another leap when he gestured for a pen and notepad. He wanted to jot down the conversations he was having with the nursing staff. Jagged lines were all he could manage, but he remained unbowed, asking me to transcribe the conversations regarding his recovery plan.As the pace of Steve\u2019s progress accelerated \u2014 in words and movements \u2014 I became consumed with planning for the next steps in his recovery, making arrangements for his rehabilitation, staging our apartment for his return. Looking backward was a luxury I could not afford.When Steve finally came home in early March, every daily event \u2014 going to the grocery store, walking the kids to school, reading the news, listening to our favorite pop songs \u2014 became a learning opportunity, a chance to regain words and memories that had been temporarily lost.At dinner, the kids played word games with Steve, each taking turns to contribute to a category. One evening, when the topic was zoo animals, Steve couldn\u2019t locate the word lion. Instead of expressing frustration or embarrassment, he described its color, sound and habitat. When our daughter blurted the answer, Steve\u2019s face lit up. \u201cYes, you got it!\u201d he shouted, slyly giving the game a new dimension.We were witnessing Steve do what was second nature to him: finding the path forward.Researchers still have a lot to learn about what causes some victims to swiftly recover from brain traumas and others to stall. Steve\u2019s doctors marvel that he is doing so well. His single-minded determination may have helped.Within 12 months of his ill-fated trip to Atlantic City, Steve had secured a job as a business analyst with an international bank. Without any visible scars or speech impairments today, he doesn\u2019t show any signs of brain trauma.Indeed, even with portions of his brain gone, he has somehow retained his intelligence and career skills, his ability to be a loving husband and father, and the core elements of his identity that let his lifelong habit of looking forward shine through.He\u2019s taught me that true tragedy is letting misfortune rob you of the life and love you have. It\u2019s a lesson I try to keep in my head as nourishment for my heart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Los Angeles Auto Show, an Industry Ponders Its Digital Future", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byWheelsLOS ANGELES \u2014 For decades, the car business has been about style, performance, image and fuel efficiency. But suddenly, the industry is in a technological and sociological upheaval that may force automobiles \u2014 and the companies that make them \u2014 to change more in the next five years than they have in the last 50.That was evident in this week\u2019s AutoMobility LA conference, an event held by the organizers of the Los Angeles Auto Show, which will continue over the next two weeks.AutoMobility is an apt name, because much of the innovation seems to involve making the car ever more like a giant smartphone on wheels. But social mobility is a factor, too, as carmakers confront the surging popularity of ride-hailing services, which means fewer people see a need to own a car, while the push toward autonomous vehicles portends a time when many cars will not need people to drive them.Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon that would enable the South Korean automaker\u2019s cars to be remotely started, and the heater or air-conditioner to be turned on, by speaking to an Amazon Echo device inside the home. It was only the latest in a series of car-related apps that Amazon has introduced through Echo and the Alexa personal assistant. Other apps include one that enables Alexa to hail Uber rides.Uber, of course, and other ride-hailing services like Lyft, are potentially big disrupters of the automakers\u2019 conventional business model of selling cars to individual consumers. And new variants are coming along, including See Jane Go, which had a booth at the conference. The company addresses a concern of many women by recruiting only female drivers and accepting only female passengers.Mark F. Fields, Ford Motor\u2019s chief executive, spoke here of the opportunities he saw in selling vehicles to the ride-sharing industry, including, eventually, ones that would drive themselves. But optimism requires the car industry to reimagine itself. Instead of the worldwide automobile industry thinking of itself as the $2.3 trillion business it is now, Mr. Fields said, it should see itself as part of the much bigger global transportation industry.BMW has its own car-sharing venture, ReachNow, which operates in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and will soon be in Brooklyn. It allows members to drive a BMW or Mini vehicle for 41 cents a minute of operation.ReachNow\u2019s chief executive, Steve Banfield, in an interview here, compared the concept to Netflix, the video service that has helped render ownership of DVDs superfluous. That might seem like a threat to BMW\u2019s business of selling cars, but Mr. Banfield described it as more of a get-acquainted marketing approach.Some ReachNow members sign up simply for extended test drives of BMW cars like the electric i3, Mr. Banfield said. And younger members who cannot afford a vehicle early in their careers can become familiar with BMW\u2019s products, making them more likely to become buyers once their salaries catch up with their tastes, he said.For people who do own cars but who would not mind some help paying for them, there are mobile-app services like Turo, which enable car owners to rent out their cars. By renting their vehicles for nine days each month, owners could probably cover their entire car payments and maybe even turn a profit, David Stewart, Turo\u2019s chief business officer, said in a presentation here.Turo is good news for automakers, Mr. Stewart said, because it might help someone wary of owning a vehicle to afford to buy one, or to move up to a more luxurious model as the rental income made it affordable.But the question of who does or does not own a car now might one day seem a quaint distinction when cars start driving themselves. And when that time comes, the companies with the biggest identity crises may be ones like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that have persuaded the public to spend big money on the thrill of taking the wheel.Detlev von Platen, executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, views it as an evolution.\u201cOur cars will always be about the driving experience because that\u2019s what we sell \u2014 experiences,\u201d Mr. von Platen said. \u201cBut we must provide options for our owners, and self-driving technologies that can be activated when desired must be considered.\u201dAnd a self-driving Porsche might be more than a robotic tram. Imagine experiencing the throttle, braking and steering inputs of a professional driver on a racetrack. That could be programmed into the car, said Oliver Blume, Porsche\u2019s chief executive.Porsche might also experiment with new types of sales or leasing options to cultivate loyalty. Mr. von Platen said the company might consider a \u201cflex lease,\u201d under which someone leasing a two-seat 718 Cayman would gain access to a Cayenne S.U.V. for seven days a year, which could be handy for when five seats are needed.The other big technology topic was electric vehicles, which all carmakers have been pursuing as a way to address concerns about the climate, as well as government-mandated rules and targets for lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency.Jaguar announced its I-Pace all-electric S.U.V., a concept car that the company said would be available in 2018.And yet the election of Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic who is widely expected to scale back automotive emission and fuel-efficiency regulations, could alter the industry\u2019s planning for environmentally friendlier cars. The possible relaxation of those regulations was an undercurrent here.And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, recently wrote to the Trump transition team urging a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d to the industry.Mr. Blume of Porsche said his company would stay on its current technology track, even if fuel-economy and emissions standards were relaxed.\u201cWhen we think of new technology, we don\u2019t concern ourselves with political changes,\u201d Mr. Blume said. \u201cWe think electrification is a technology of the future, and we have a responsibility to the environment.\u201dThat debate simply reinforces a characteristic that was fully apparent at AutoMobility LA: The automotive business is not just about moving vehicles; it\u2019s about moving targets.An article on the Automobiles page on Friday 18 about the heavy technology focus of the Los Angeles Auto Show misstated the name of the personal assistant in the Amazon Echo. It is Alexa, not Alexis. The article also gave an incorrect title for Detlev von Platen, who commented on autonomous driving technology. He is executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, not president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Across China, Walmart Faces Labor Unrest as Authorities Stand Aside", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 In a one-man war room in his apartment, a laid-off Walmart employee named Wang Shishu was tapping out a message on his phone to a group of workers and plotting his next move.Over the past few months, Mr. Wang, 56, has helped organize a national movement in China against Walmart. Labor strikes have hit stores in the south simultaneously. There have been boycotts in the northeast. And here in Shenzhen, where Walmart opened its first outlet in China two decades ago, employees have filed a lawsuit demanding back pay.\u201cWe want a snowball effect,\u201d he said in the booming baritone of a street preacher. \u201cWe want everybody to know what to do next.\u201dBut activism against Walmart\u2019s more than 400 stores in China in recent months has followed a different pattern: workers in several cities agitating against the same company, bypassing official unions controlled by the Communist Party and using social media to coordinate their actions \u2014 while the authorities largely stand aside.Across China, Walmart employees have raised their fists at protests, chanting, \u201cWorkers, stand up!\u201d They have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervor, invoking the struggles of Mao Zedong against foreign imperialists. They have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and \u201cunion puppets.\u201dIn doing so, the Chinese work force of the world\u2019s largest retail chain has put the ruling Communist Party in an uncomfortable position, publicly testing its Marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labor activism.Ever since the Solidarity trade union helped topple Communist rule in Poland, Beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labor movement, suppressing efforts by workers to organize across industries or localities.But the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of Walmart, whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted.Mr. Wang, a former customer service representative whom Walmart has fired twice, spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country, often as late as 2 a.m.\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is inhumane,\u201d he said. \u201cI want Walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be.\u201dEli Friedman, a labor scholar at Cornell University, said the Walmart movement was \u201cprobably the most substantive example of sustained, cross-workplace, independent worker organizing we\u2019ve ever seen in China\u2019s private sector.\u201dThe government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash, or about acting on behalf of a prominent American company against Chinese workers at a time when nationalism in China is rising.But by doing little or nothing, it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere, especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across China. Already, workers at Neutrogena stores and China Unicom, a state-owned telecom operator, have used similar tactics, while avoiding serious punishment.\u201cWe can only expect that online organizing will continue to break down local barriers,\u201d said Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group based in Hong Kong.The retail sector in particular has become a hotbed of worker activism. The government wants to shift growth from manufacturing to service industries, but many new jobs at restaurants, hotels and stores are low-paying or part-time.From July through September, there were 124 strikes and protests at service-sector firms, about double the number last year, outpacing episodes in manufacturing for the first time since at least 2011, according to China Labour Bulletin.Chinese law requires businesses to establish labor unions, but they are almost always controlled by management, and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism. In the face of labor strife, some businesses have offered back pay, bonuses and other benefits to workers.But others, concerned that labor activism could force costly concessions, have resorted to tougher tactics, retaliating against those who help organize protests. At Walmart, some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises, reassigned, or in some cases fired, according to interviews with more than a dozen employees.At one store in Zhongshan, west of Shenzhen, a labor activist said a supervisor photographed her in the bathroom as retribution for speaking out. She asked not to be identified for fear of further antagonizing her bosses.Much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that Walmart put in place this summer as a way, the company said, of giving workers more flexibility. Workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts, and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system.Walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules. Rebecca Lui, a spokeswoman, said that the vast majority of its work force supported the new system, and that employees were free to keep their old schedules.\u201cOur associates are our most valuable asset,\u201d she said in a statement.Zhai Xiuhua, a former greeter at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, said she was fired in September after leading a fight against the new scheduling system.\u201cI told them, \u2018Even if you put a knife to my neck, I\u2019ll never agree,\u2019\u201d she recalled at her home, where her uniform and identification badge \u2014 No. 14470 \u2014 still hang on the wall. Ms. Zhai, worried about medical bills, says she now hopes to find work in her hometown in the southwestern province of Sichuan.But union branches at many Walmart stores are under the thumb of store managers, and higher-level union officials appear torn about how to respond to complaints from workers like Ms. Zhai.While union officials here in Guangdong Province have criticized Walmart for not seeking governmental approval for the new scheduling system, they have not taken more forceful action or helped mobilize workers.Labor activists at Walmart have cited the ideals of President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party\u2019s history of protecting workers, and experts said they appeared to be benefiting from a belief among some officials that the influence of foreign companies such as Walmart should be curtailed.\u201cIf the Chinese authorities try to suppress the workers on behalf of Walmart,\u201d said Wang Jiangsong, a Chinese labor scholar, \u201cit will hurt the country\u2019s image.\u201dWhen Walmart opened its first store in China in 1996, workers rushed to snap up jobs that paid more than those at Chinese competitors.Walmart has struggled to keep up with the fast-changing tastes of Chinese consumers and tried to re-energize its business by making investments in online retailers.But the continuing labor unrest poses a potential hurdle.Ms. You said her bosses now harassed her daily because she spoke out, and she has received a diagnosis of anxiety and depression.She spends most of her nonworking hours rummaging through a mess of worker manifestoes, union laws and pay slips in her tiny apartment, hoping to find a new line of attack against Walmart.\u201cI\u2019m on the verge of collapsing,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019ll last.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Election Hints at a European Shift Toward Russia", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterSince the end of World War II, European leaders have maintained their ever-growing alliance as a bulwark against Russian power. Through decades of ups and downs in Russian-European relations, in periods of estrangement or reconciliation, their balance of power has kept the continent stable.But a growing movement within Europe that includes Mr. Fillon, along with others of a more populist bent, is pushing a new policy: instead of standing up to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, stand with him.Mr. Fillon has called for lifting sanctions on Russia and for partnering with Moscow in an effort to curtail immigration and terrorism. He is friendly with Mr. Putin. If pollsters are right and Mr. Fillon wins the French presidency in the spring, he could join several rising European politicians and newly elected leaders who are like-minded.Their movement, scholars stress, is driven by forces far more formidable than any elected leader: the populist upsurge that is remaking the Continent and, simultaneously, the impersonal but overwhelming pressures of international power balancing.These changes, along with the impending British withdrawal from the European Union and the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States, foretell a \u201cdramatic shift\u201d in the half-century of Western unity against Russia, said James Goldgeier, a political scientist and the dean of American University\u2019s School of International Service in Washington.\u201cAll the trend lines right now point away from a tough approach to Russian aggression and point toward more accommodation of the Russian notion that they have a privileged sphere of influence,\u201d he said.It is unclear how far into Europe that sphere of Russian influence might extend, or the consequences for nations that would come under it after escaping Soviet domination only a generation ago. But those are questions of degree; Mr. Fillon\u2019s primary victory suggests that the shift has already begun.Though Mr. Fillon would reverse his country\u2019s hard line on Russia, he would not be the first French leader to reach out to Moscow \u2014 Charles de Gaulle, the president from 1959 to 1969, also did this \u2014 and could not, on his own, upend European unity.More important, he would not be alone. Mr. Trump has promised cooperation with Russia and threatened to diminish the United States\u2019 role in NATO. Several East European countries have elected leaders who advocate reconciling with Moscow.In Western Europe, politics seems poised to move in Mr. Fillon\u2019s direction. Mainstream parties, forced to acknowledge that they cannot contain the far right, are instead working to co-opt it.Mr. Fillon illustrates this trend well. Unlike the French far right, he wishes to maintain his country\u2019s membership in the European Union. But, indulging Europe\u2019s populist wave, he has promised to curtail immigration sharply, promote conservative social values, impose \u201cstrict administrative control\u201d over Islam and bring security against terrorism.Benjamin Haddad, a French analyst at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank based in Washington, said that such policies point, in ways that might not be obvious to Americans, toward another agenda item of the European far right: partnering with Mr. Putin.\u201cAll over Europe, Putinism has emerged as an ideological alternative to globalism, the E.U., etc.,\u201d Mr. Haddad said, with Mr. Putin seen as \u201ca bulwark for conservative values \u2014 a strongman against gay marriage, immigration, Islam.\u201dMr. Haddad added, \u201cIt\u2019s largely a domestic phenomenon, rather than the reflection of a strategic debate over the relationship with Moscow.\u201dMr. Fillon\u2019s warmth toward Mr. Putin is apparently heartfelt, and it predated this election. What changed is French voters, who increasingly desire hard-line policies and signs of strength that they perceive Mr. Putin as representing.Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr. Haddad pointed out, won the French presidency in 2007 by running as a pragmatic pro-American conservative, but this year he ran as a pro-Russian populist. While Mr. Sarkozy lost the center-right primary this month, Mr. Fillon carried that same message to success.In some ways, Mr. Fillon is particular to France, where nationalist politicians since de Gaulle have long asserted French independence from the United States and Britain by reaching out to Russia. But similar trends are playing out in several European countries, along their own particular national lines.In Germany, for instance, center-left leaders are pushing to abandon their country\u2019s role in leading European efforts to counter Russia. Instead, they advocate reverting to the Cold War-era policy of Ostpolitik, in which West Germany sought a neutral balancing role between East and West.Often, West European politicians do not see themselves as explicitly calling for aligning with Moscow, but rather for abandoning the costly mission to counter Russia\u2019s aggression against faraway eastern states at a moment when they have more immediate concerns.West European leaders see themselves as fighting an increasingly untenable two-front war: a southern front against immigration and terrorism and an eastern front against Russia.Voters, particularly those on the right, have long seen southern issues \u2014 terrorism and immigration \u2014 as more important. Their threats to install far-right governments that would dismantle the European project entirely are increasingly credible.European political establishments, unable to resist such sentiments forever, may feel they have to give up on the east to focus on the south.The international context is starker.Russia is growing in power and aggression just as the Western order\u2019s two strongest powers \u2014 the United States and Britain \u2014 are threatening to step away.In the cold-eyed view of international relations scholars, who tend to measure history in epochs rather than election cycles, what Mr. Fillon says or believes is almost irrelevant. Europe\u2019s balance of power is rapidly shifting east, pulling nations like France with it.Russia is far weaker than the United States, and its wheezing, energy-dependent economy is half the size of France\u2019s or Britain\u2019s. But it still commands one of the world\u2019s largest militaries and its largest nuclear arsenal. Its 2014 annexation of Crimea showed Mr. Putin\u2019s willingness to use that military in Europe.Balance-of-power theory states that, when a country like Russia rises, the other states in that region have three choices. They can counter by escalating against the rising power. They can flip sides to join the rising power. Or they can accommodate the rising power, allowing it a greater stake in the region.In the past few years, Europe had confidently chosen the first option, meeting Russia\u2019s aggression with sanctions and eastward military deployments meant to show Russia that the status quo order would remain.To the degree that is already changing, European states seem to be eyeing the third option: to accommodate Russia\u2019s rise, indulging enough of Moscow\u2019s demands to restore stability.Within Europe, the old order has been led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who sees herself as defending the European project but is increasingly challenged by wavering allies and skeptical populations, including many Germans.\u201cMerkel can\u2019t do it by herself. Germany doesn\u2019t have that ability,\u201d Mr. Goldgeier said. If she wishes to remain in office, she may have to give on something, and Europe\u2019s hard-line on Russia could be it.As soon as one country breaks from the united front against Russia, Mr. Goldgeier said, \u201ceach European country will look to cut its own deal with the Russians.\u201dThat could mean granting Russia concessions in Syria, lifting the European Union sanctions that were meant to force an end to the continuing war in eastern Ukraine, or tolerating greater Russian influence in Eastern Europe.It is impossible to predict where these trend lines lead, not because they are in doubt but because they foretell such extreme changes in the European order that their consequences vary too widely to pin down.Mr. Goldgeier, though, said his immediate concern was for the former Soviet republics that are not members of the European Union or NATO and would most likely be first to come under expanding Russian influence.\u201cFor the people of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, these trend lines are quite tragic,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes for U.K. Trade Deal With India Hit a Snag: Immigration", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 It was supposed to be an auspicious moment: Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain traveling to India to prepare the ground for what could be the country\u2019s first trade deal after it leaves the European Union, and show that Britain can thrive outside the bloc.But Mrs. May had barely hit the ground when her aspiration to forge closer ties with one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies began to falter over immigration, the same thorny and emotive issue that helped propel Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.Mrs. May\u2019s three-day visit, which began on Sunday, had been billed as a first test of Britain\u2019s ability to forge new and mutually advantageous trade deals with countries around the world, a way to demonstrate its ability to prosper outside the European single market. But while India is notoriously difficult to please in trade matters, the rocky reception was not an ideal way to start her first trip to India as prime minister.Specifically, India is complaining about student visas, including a requirement that foreign students from outside the European Union must find a job four months after they finish their studies or face deportation.Speaking at a technology conference on Monday in New Delhi, India\u2019s capital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned that education and mobility across borders for young Indians would help define India\u2019s relationship with Britain.Indian business leaders have also called on Britain to slash the cost of a two-year visa to Britain from about $409 to $108, which is the rate that applies to Chinese citizens.But Mrs. May, under pressure at home to reduce immigration, has resisted calls to liberalize the visa system. The policy has had a chilling effect with student visas issued to Indians falling to 11,864 in 2015, from 68,238 in 2010, according to official figures.But supporters of exiting the union, a move known as Brexit, made emotional appeals to limit immigration a central part of their campaign. That has circumscribed Mrs. May\u2019s room for maneuver as she seeks to court countries like India that regard easing the mobility of their citizens as a necessary condition for attaining access to their expanding markets.Mrs. May has insisted that Britain\u2019s visa system is still attracting talented students and workers to the country. \u201cWe have a visa system for countries outside the European Union which ensures that the brightest and the best are able to come to the United Kingdom,\u201d she said on Monday. \u201cThe figures show that we issued more work visas to India than, I think, the U.S., Australia, Canada and China put together.\u201dHe also said the vote posed a challenge for some of the 800 Indian businesses operating in Britain, which viewed the country as a gateway to the bloc.Allie Renison, the leader of trade policy at the Institute of Directors, a business federation, said Mrs. May needed to understand that labor mobility and visas were essential for a service-based economy like Britain\u2019s.\u201cA case in point is higher education, one of Britain\u2019s most successful exports, where applications from Indian students are significantly down in recent years,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Europe, Is Uber a Transportation Service or a Digital Platform?", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byThese heated battles will culminate on Tuesday in arguments before the European Court of Justice, the region\u2019s highest court, which will most likely determine how Uber can operate across the European Union, one of the company\u2019s largest international markets.Such rapid growth has often pitted Uber against traditional taxi services and local labor unions, which have accused the company of disregarding working standards and transportation rules.\u201cWe will fight against Uber in Germany and across Europe,\u201d said Hermann Waldner, the head of a taxi dispatch center in Berlin. \u201cWe will try to do what we can to defend ourselves through the law.\u201dFor Uber and its rivals in Europe, the court case represents a watershed moment for how ride-booking companies will be able to operate in the region.The hearing relates to a standoff between Uber and a Spanish taxi association, which filed legal proceedings in 2014, claiming unfair competition.In July 2015, a judge in Barcelona referred the case to the European Court of Justice, asking the Luxembourg-based court to determine whether Uber should be treated as a transportation service or merely as a digital platform.If the court decides that Uber is a transportation service, the company will have to obey Europe\u2019s often onerous labor and safety rules, and comply with rules that apply to traditional taxi associations. Though Uber already fulfills such requirements in many European countries, the ruling could hamper its expansion plans.But if the judges rule that Uber is an \u201cinformation society service,\u201d or an online platform that merely matches independent drivers with potential passengers, then the company will have greater scope to offer low-cost products like UberPop and other services that have been banned in many parts of Europe.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Asociaci\u00f3n Profesional \u00c9lite Taxi, the Spanish group that brought the case, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.A ruling is not expected before March at the earliest. The judges may decide to consider Uber a transportation service, an online platform, or a combination of the two, further complicating the legal standoff.Other European taxi associations are keeping a close eye on the outcome, which will apply across the 28-member bloc.While Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, had targeted China for major expansion, the company settled for a minority stake in a combined Chinese operation with Didi Chuxing that is valued at roughly $35 billion.As Uber has grown beyond San Francisco, where it was founded in 2009, it has become embroiled in a number of legal disputes around the world that have challenged its business model and some of its working practices.Other sharing-economy businesses like Airbnb, the vacation rental site, have also been targeted for legal action, particularly in Europe, where traditional hotels have viewed such competition with skepticism.Uber\u2019s European legal woes have often set governments against one another, as countries have taken opposing views on how the company should operate.But in other countries, notably France and Germany, national politicians have favored rules that have either banned some of Uber\u2019s services or required the company to operate within existing transportation rules.Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Will a Trump Presidency Mean for New York Real Estate?", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported by360 ViewTwo months ago, Pierre E. Debbas, a partner at the boutique law firm Romer Debbas, was representing a couple buying a Manhattan condominium who wanted the option to back out of the deal if Donald J. Trump won the election. After Mr. Debbas explained that no seller would agree to such a contingency, they signed the contract and took their chances.Other buyers and sellers have been skittish, too. By the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s upset victory, nerves were downright frayed, with buyers canceling viewings and delaying contracts, saying they needed to reassess, according to brokers, lawyers and developers.But even a few days can make a difference. By the end of the week, potential buyers were rescheduling appointments they had canceled on Wednesday, Mr. Kliegerman said. Others who had spent the summer cautiously eyeing apartments were finally signing contracts, relieved that the election was over. \u201cThe phone has been ringing a lot this week,\u201d Mr. Debbas said. \u201cPeople are realizing that the world\u2019s not ending.\u201dAnd as for the clients who wanted a way out of their contract if Mr. Trump won, they are \u201cgoing to proceed despite the election,\u201d he said.A Trump victory will likely improve the fortunes of some New Yorkers. Proposed tax breaks aimed at the wealthiest Americans could reinvigorate a flagging luxury housing market, looser government regulations could benefit business and infrastructure improvements could spur job growth.Affordable housing advocates, however, worry that the most vulnerable Americans could suffer under policies that could be hostile to housing subsidies and fair housing rules. It\u2019s also unclear what effect the policies of the new administration might have on foreign buyers. While Russians might feel welcome, given the admiration Mr. Trump has expressed toward that country\u2019s president, protectionist policies and rhetoric could have a chilling effect on investors from China and Arab nations.Predicting what might come in the years ahead is a little like reading tea leaves. Here are some of the postelection thoughts percolating in the real estate community.Mr. Trump promises to not only cut taxes and regulations, but also to invest in infrastructure and jobs, a potential boon for business. \u201cOnce you start creating jobs, development follows,\u201d Mr. Rudin said.Wealthy Americans can expect deep tax cuts from the Trump administration, \u201cand they buy luxury apartments,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Such a shopping spree could reduce the glut of luxury apartments languishing on the market, but other changes to the housing market are on the horizon.If Mr. Trump dismantles the Dodd-Frank financial reforms enacted after the subprime mortgage crisis, home buyers could find it easier to get a mortgage.

His Chinese clients, though, expressed concern about the prospect of a protectionist American administration. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what it\u2019s going to look like a year from now,\u201d Mr. Mermelstein said.Mr. Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and barring Muslims could harm the housing market, too, if foreigners no longer see the United States as a welcoming destination. \u201cThe housing market relies on housing formation,\u201d said Mr. McLaughlin of Trulia. \u201cAnd a portion of that relies on new immigrants.\u201dDevelopers, however, are confident that foreign investors will continue to see the New York market as a safe haven. \u201cI have not seen or heard any nervousness or skittishness from foreign buyers,\u201d said Ms. Liebman of Corcoran.But if investors no longer see the United States as a safe bet, they might sink their money elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s not about economic factors, it\u2019s about safety,\u201d Mr. Kliegerman of Halstead said. \u201cIf they see civil disobedience, fine; if they see civil unrest, those buyers will pull back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Renewable Energy, Brexit Spurs Mixed Prospects", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byWhen Mark Meyrick sat down with a developer to review plans for two solar farms the company he works for is building in Wales and southwestern England, one number jumped out at him. With the value of the pound sliding since Britons voted to leave the European Union, the cost of the imported solar panels Good Energy must buy has risen.That extra expense is likely to hit the plants\u2019 profitability, so the company is hurrying its purchases out of fear that Britain\u2019s currency may grow weaker still. \u201cIf we just sit here and wait, and the pound falls another seven or 10 cents, which I think it easily could do, that project probably wouldn\u2019t be viable,\u201d said Mr. Meyrick, Good Energy\u2019s trading director.Like firms in other sectors of the British economy, renewable energy companies are waiting nervously to see how the country\u2019s departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, will affect them. In their case, the answer will be key to determining whether Britain meets its commitments to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.\u201cThe problem with Brexit is that because it creates another 2\u00bd-years-plus of uncertainty, the danger is that it just damages investor confidence further,\u201d said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an advocacy group. \u201cOne of the consequences could be that things simply don\u2019t get built that we need to get built, or that they\u2019re more expensive.\u201dThose concerns eased somewhat a few weeks later, when Parliament approved a new carbon reduction plan. And in September, Mrs. May said Britain would ratify the Paris climate deal by the end of the year and continue to \u201cplay our part in the international effort against climate change.\u201dMany clean-power advocates now say folding climate issues into the more powerful Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy may prove a wise move, allowing for better coordination of policy.But while the business department includes strong advocates of climate action, they are \u201cgoing to have to shout very loud around the cabinet table to be heard,\u201d said Robin Teverson, chairman of the House of Lords\u2019 E.U. Energy and Environment Subcommittee, which is preparing a report on Brexit and the environment.With complex Brexit negotiations likely to consume a great deal of Mrs. May\u2019s time and political capital for years to come, \u201cI don\u2019t see the climate side and renewable energy being particularly high on the government\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Mr. Teverson, of the opposition Liberal Democrats.Many of Britain\u2019s environmental rules are underpinned by European targets and accords, and are enforceable by European Union judges, so their fate in post-Brexit Britain remains unclear. Antiregulatory sentiment and a desire for freedom from Brussels\u2019s authority were key themes of the Leave campaign.Mr. Meyrick said it was \u201cencouraging, or not discouraging,\u201d that Mrs. May did not seem to plan on backing away from climate and clean energy commitments.Even the rough outlines of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union are likely to remain unclear for some time. Mrs. May has said Britain would officially notify Brussels by the end of March 2017 of its intention to depart, setting the clock on two years of negotiations.Some in the industry say Brexit may bring benefits for clean energy. A weak pound makes electricity more expensive, because it pushes up the cost of the imported natural gas often used to generate it. That allows companies selling solar and wind power to charge higher prices too, increasing revenue.Low interest rates make it cheaper for those companies to borrow, and the higher inflation Brexit may cause will raise income from an inflation-linked system that sets the price of some renewable power purchases, said Michael Bonte-Friedheim, chief executive of NextEnergy Capital, which manages the NextEnergy Solar Fund.\u201cAll of that put together makes the solar and renewable energy sector more attractive for public-market investors,\u201d he said.For manufacturers building renewable power equipment in Britain, the weak pound makes their products less costly when sold abroad. Potentially offsetting that benefit, though, is the possibility that European tariffs on British imports may replace the free trade that came with E.U. membership, depending on the exit terms Mrs. May strikes.\u201cWe\u2019re in a position where the market is still completely unclear as to what happens, not only as to the ramifications, but also to the timings,\u201d said Nick Boyle, chief executive of Lightsource Renewable Energy, a solar power company.There is little clarity, as well, on a number of bureaucratic and technical questions that are important to the industry.Among them are the rules governing installation and operation of planned undersea power connections that would expand transmission of electricity between Britain and the Continent. Mr. Froggatt said building new interconnections still made sense, both financially and because they make renewable power systems more reliable by allowing consumers to get electricity from afar when the sun went in or the wind slowed close to home.\u201cI would assume these projects will go ahead,\u201d but delays are possible, he said.Another worry is funding from the European Investment Bank, an important lender to renewable energy infrastructure projects. While the bank is able to lend to projects in non-European Union nations, Britain could lose its influence there as an outsider.And with ripples of discontent with Brussels spreading beyond Britain, the bloc may be distracted from its own efforts to increase renewables and combat climate change.\u201cIf European institutions and pro-European governments see that they\u2019re fighting for the survival of what Europe means, then it gets much more difficult to do things like energy on a detailed basis,\u201d said Mr. Black.Advertisement"}

French commentators had largely written off Mr. Fillon, pointing out that Mr. Sarkozy appeared to have seduced the party\u2019s hard-right voters, who were worried about immigration and Islam, and that Mr. Jupp\u00e9 seemed to appeal to the party\u2019s more centrist voters, seeking a more inclusive approach. A week ago, most were confidently predicting a Jupp\u00e9-Sarkozy runoff.But in the past week, Mr. Fillon advanced in the polls, having positioned himself between the integrationist message of Mr. Jupp\u00e9 and the tougher positions of Mr. Sarkozy. On Sunday night, French television commentators expressed astonishment that the longtime favorite, Mr. Jupp\u00e9, had suddenly become a challenger with tough odds.Those themes are likely to dominate electioneering here. For the next week, Mr. Fillon and Mr. Jupp\u00e9 will be seeking Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s voters. Mr. Fillon has promised to add 16,000 prison cells, create a special antiterrorism judicial unit, crack down harshly on anybody who maintains any relation with the Islamic State, and strip the French citizenship of those who embark on jihad.The themes are a natural fit for Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s voters, and as he conceded on Sunday night, Mr. Sarkozy said he would vote for Mr. Fillon \u2014 a man who had expressed disdain for his former patron during the campaign. But the two have a similar outlook on the world, and in particular a more conciliatory approach than Mr. Jupp\u00e9 to the Russia led by Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Fillon has called for a Western coalition with Mr. Putin, the Russian president, to fight ISIS.Mr. Jupp\u00e9 has criticized Mr. Fillon\u2019s economic program as far too harsh, and unworkable. He seems certain to hammer that theme in the seven days remaining in the primary campaign.

{"Headline": "Egypt Floats Currency, Appeasing I.M.F. at Risk of Enraging Poor", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 Egypt\u2019s central bank on Thursday said it would soon allow the country\u2019s currency to trade freely, part of a broader effort to save a free-falling economy and combat an increasingly prevalent black market for American dollars.The move will help Egypt secure much-needed funds to shore up its economy. Egypt is trying to push through major economic changes to secure a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.But Egypt\u2019s central bank risks sparking further social unrest, since it decided to devalue the currency by nearly 50 percent ahead of its float, an effort to guide the level at which it should eventually trade. The sharp drop in the value of the Egyptian pound further erodes savings and pushes up the prices of basic goods and services, a destabilizing force among the poor people who make up the bulk of Egypt\u2019s 91 million residents.In its decision, the central bank appeared to distance itself from Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has faced criticism for his handling of the economy.Tarek Amer, the head of the central bank, said the Egyptian pound would be allowed to trade freely beginning on Sunday.\u201cIt is going to take us around one and a half years to see changes\u201d in the economy as a result of the decision, Mr. Amer said at a news conference. \u201cWe are just fixing the foundations.\u201dTo deal with the problem, Egyptian authorities have tightly controlled the purchase of dollars for months. Egyptians traveling overseas saw their withdrawals limited, and airport authorities were on high alert for travelers suspected of transporting cash out of the country.The restrictions drove middle-class Egyptians to the black market to buy dollars, fearing their savings would otherwise lose all their value.While the Egyptian pound was officially trading at 8.8 to the dollar before Thursday\u2019s announcement, it fell at one point to 19 against the dollar on the black market. The central bank on Thursday devalued the pound to 13 against the dollar ahead of Sunday\u2019s float.Officials are concerned about the impact of the sudden devaluation on Egypt\u2019s poor, which could be worsened by a requirement that the authorities peel back energy subsidies, another condition of the I.M.F. loan.A series of subsidized staples \u2014 like bread, sugar, rice and cooking oil \u2014 could all rise in price. With inflation already at a seven-year high, combined with the psychological effect of millions of Egyptians waking up to find their salaries and savings have officially plummeted in value, the government is fearful of unrest.\u201cThere is so much anger here,\u201d said Refaat Hussein, a tax collector and an independent labor union leader who makes about 4,000 pounds a month. \u201cThe people will take to the streets.\u201d\u201cThis is only going to get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can buy now. The little guy is always the one who pays for these decisions. The pound is nothing to the rich.\u201dThe central bank\u2019s move was welcomed by many economists and business groups.They argue that not only will a freely floating, weaker currency help curb black market foreign exchange, it will also support Egypt's export and tourism sectors by making the country\u2019s goods and services cheaper to outsiders. In addition, Egyptians overseas, who appeared to be holding off sending money home because of the pound\u2019s artificial strength, could resume.Perhaps to inspire investor confidence, the bank vowed in its statement that it \u201cwould not allow the bodies that supervise it to disrupt the application of this new system.\u201d The statement appeared to be a strangely defiant reference to Mr. Sisi, who is the central bank\u2019s direct authority.Advertisement"}

Business groups worry that parts of the law \u2014 such as required security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications, and mandatory in-country data storage \u2014 will make foreign operations more expensive or lock them out altogether. Individual users will have to register their real names to use messaging services in China.He added that by creating such restrictions, China risked isolating itself technologically from the rest of the world.But in many ways, the regulations are not likely to have a major impact on much about how business is done. Most of the rules are already in effect, but not codified. Other parts are vague enough that the government will determine their meaning on the fly.The law, however, is an important statement from Beijing on how the internet should be run: with tighter controls over companies and better tracking of individual citizens.Calling it a \u201cbasic law,\u201d Chen Jihong, a partner at the Zhong Lun law firm in Beijing, said the rules were set up to deal with the growing number of legal issues regarding the Chinese internet and to seek to strike a balance between privacy and security.\u201cThe law only stipulates principles; it would take follow-up laws or interpretations to specify the standards,\u201d he said.Human Rights Watch said on Monday that it was concerned about several aspects of the law, including that it calls for real-name registration for users of Chinese instant messaging services.The final law did soften a few elements. In particular, a second draft of the law said foreign businesses did not need to keep all of their data inside China \u2014 just important business data collected within China or about Chinese consumers.For years the government has been working to ensure that people\u2019s real names are linked to their online activities. Beijing has also long restricted many types of online content, from pornography to political discussion.Last year China passed a national security law that called for technology that supports crucial sectors of the economy and government to be \u201csecure and controllable.\u201d Industry groups say that language means companies can be forced to allow third-party access to their networks, provide encryption keys or hand over source code.After the state news media announced the law\u2019s passage, comments on Chinese news and social media sites were largely censored.On one news app run by the internet company Tencent, some users applauded the law as a way for China to crack down on internet fraudsters and the less savory parts of the web. Others wondered what the cost of that security would be.\u201cI hope this won\u2019t be a law that does more to limit freedom of speech,\u201d wrote one user under the screen name Leisa Wenzhou.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art Market\u2019s Reaction to Trump? Sales This Week Offer First Test", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byAt Rockefeller Center on Sunday, milling outside Christie\u2019s sales rooms \u2014 where private clients sipped mimosas as they took in one of Monet\u2019s grainstacks \u2014 people in the art world sounded guardedly optimistic about how the auctions will perform this week, after a period of uncertainty exacerbated by the contentious American presidential election, Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June and China\u2019s slowing economy.\u201cThere has been a lot of insecurity and it\u2019s hard to say exactly what will happen,\u201d said Jay Gorney, a collector, curator and former dealer, predicting that \u201cgood things will do extremely well.\u201dThe sales of Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art that start Monday offer the first test of how the art market will react to a Trump presidency and whether it will continue a softening trend that, for the past year, has had potential sellers reluctant to consign their best works.The result is that each of the three major auction houses \u2014 Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips \u2014 are entering this week\u2019s sales with fewer trophies of more than $20 million than they have had in the recent past. Over all, the estimated sales in postwar and contemporary art are half what they were last year. The evening auctions of postwar and contemporary art at the three houses, for example, are expected to draw about $536 million, compared with $1.2 billion for the same auctions in November 2015.Art auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.\u201cThey gathered the best material they could with a lot of sellers cautious and not willing to commit,\u201d said Neal Meltzer, an art adviser. \u201cSupply is the issue more than demand.\u201dIn the days before the sales, collectors, art advisers and auction specialists were pointing to encouraging signs, citing the postelection stock market highs, the post-\u201cBrexit\u201d London sales in June and Sotheby\u2019s London auction of David Bowie\u2019s art collection last week, which had a sell-through rate of 100 percent and set new top prices for 59 artists.Moreover, many collectors are sanguine about the effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, both in the United States and around the world. \u201cI feel great,\u201d said the real estate developer Arnie Rosenshein. \u201cI was for Donald Trump.\u201dYet history suggests that single events rarely affect sales, art experts say. \u201cThe market has been pretty impervious to just about every event with the exception of the global meltdown of 2008,\u201d said Robert Manley, who recently became Phillips\u2019s new co-head of 20th century & contemporary art after 16 years at Christie\u2019s.Donald B. Marron, a financier and longtime collector, said he expected the auctions to be largely business as usual. \u201cClearly this is a surprise and in one sense makes everybody cautious until they see how everything works,\u201d Mr. Marron said. \u201cOn the other hand, if you want to judge by the markets, less regulation is seen as positive. My guess is, it will be like most auction seasons: good pictures will do well.\u201dDespite the challenging timing of the sales, the auction houses have managed to squeak out a few prizes. Sotheby\u2019s secured Edvard Munch\u2019s 1902 painting, \u201cThe Girls on the Bridge,\u201d one of only two in private hands with this subject matter that is expected to sell in Monday night\u2019s Impressionism and Modern auction for more than $50 million. It is one of only three works in the sale with a guarantee \u2014 a pledged minimum price; the others are a Picasso and a van Gogh.The auction house also secured the collection of Steven and Ann Ames, New York arts patrons, for its Contemporary sale Thursday evening \u2014 albeit with the help of a $100 million guarantee. It includes two colorful paintings by Gerhard Richter (one from 1986 and one from 1988), each estimated at $20 million to $30 million.Christie\u2019s\u2019 highlights include a 1977 Willem de Kooning work, \u201cUntitled XXV,\u201d one of the artist\u2019s large \u201cpastoral\u201d paintings, which is expected to sell for around $40 million on Tuesday night, at its Postwar and Contemporary sale. On Wednesday night, Christie\u2019s Impressionist and Modern star lots include the Monet grainstack from 1891, which is expected to sell for more than $45 million, and a 1961 example of Jean Dubuffet\u2019s Paris Circus series, estimated at $15 million to $20 million.Earlier the same night, Phillips has Mr. Richter\u2019s \u201cD\u00fcsenjager,\u201d estimated at $25 million to $35 million, part of a small group of warplane pictures created between 1963 and 1964. (Paul Allen is the seller.)After Sunday\u2019s brunch preview at Christie\u2019s, not everyone came away impressed. \u201cThe estimates are 40 percent lower than last year,\u201d said Jacques Seguin, a Swiss collector. \u201cThe electricity is not there.\u201dAs for the auction houses, they say they learned from last year, when they priced estimates too high, and they are hopeful that the certainty of the election\u2019s outcome could make some buyers more confident about bidding.\u201cSome people are very happy with this result and will feel richer and more inclined to buy art, and some people will feel destabilized by the unknown and still more inclined to buy art,\u201d said Simon Shaw, Sotheby\u2019s worldwide co-head of Impressionist and Modern art. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of demand out there.\u201dSo much demand, auction houses say, that in many cases sellers \u2014 including the undisclosed consignor of the de Kooning at Christie\u2019s, for example \u2014 have declined guarantees.\u201cThey\u2019re not in need of selling,\u201d said Brett Gorvy, Christie\u2019s worldwide chairman for postwar and contemporary art. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have the painting back\u201d if it doesn\u2019t sell.Given a shortage of masterpieces, auction houses have been forced to get creative.Phillips is selling Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s \u201cNudes in Mirror\u201d (1994), which was slashed by a deranged woman in 2005 while on exhibition in Vienna. Typically, an auction house would play down that kind of damage to a painting. Instead, Phillips has produced a separate section of the catalog detailing its history.\u201cIt may not add to the value but it adds to the story,\u201d Mr. Manley, of Phillips, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out on Nov. 16 what the market thinks.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about how the first major art auctions after the presidential election may signal the market\u2019s reaction to the result referred incorrectly to the sale of guaranteed works. External financiers typically receive part of the buyers\u2019 fees; it is not the sellers who receive part of the fees. And while the profit can at times be minimal for auction houses, it is also not unusual for them to make a substantial profit on guarantees.Advertisement"}

The referendum he proposed was meant to do that by streamlining a political system that has had more than 60 governments come and go over 70 years.The main reform on the ballot would sharply reduce the role of the Senate, the upper house of Parliament. That, alongside a new law that would give considerable power to the party that wins a plurality in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, was envisioned as a way to make it far easier for Mr. Renzi\u2019s government to get needed reforms passed.But referendums, as the British learned, have a way of taking their own direction, and what seemed like a sure \u201cyes\u201d now seems more likely to be a \u201cno\u201d on the wave of anti-establishment voting \u2014 an ironic reaction in this case, since Mr. Renzi\u2019s reforms were meant to upend that very establishment.A victory for Mr. Renzi\u2019s reforms, however, would also pose a serious risk in the long term. There is no question that the equal powers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have sometimes contributed to legislative deadlock, but there is little evidence that this is the chief reason for the dearth of reform, or for the revolving-door governments. The main explanation lies in the nature of Italy\u2019s fragmented politics and resistance to change, and the constitutional amendment wouldn\u2019t alter that. It would, however, enhance the government\u2019s authority to a degree unseen in Italian politics since World War II.Italy\u2019s unique bicameral system was designed to put an extra check on executive powers in a country once led by Benito Mussolini and more recently by Silvio Berlusconi. Lifting it might make it easier for Mr. Renzi to enact reforms, but also for a different leader to achieve far less savory goals. The Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, a former comedian who wants to hold a referendum on dropping the euro, is not far behind Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party in the polls.Mr. Renzi cannot undo his unwise push for a referendum, a political shortcut that too often ends up biting its originator. But he can mitigate some of the potential fallout by declaring that he will stay in office for a while no matter what the outcome. That would calm the markets and Italy\u2019s neighbors and help smooth transition to the reality the referendum ushers in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Damascus Diary: A Syrian City Filled With Life, and Hints of Brutal Death", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byThere is always a rush of tension and excitement driving into Damascus, a city inhabited for thousands of years, where cultures and influences have mixed and accumulated like coral on a reef.When we drive from Beirut, Lebanon, into Damascus, we take the highway past President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s hilltop palace. Rebel-held suburbs are visible, sometimes smoking from government airstrikes or shelling. Also nearby is an air base where detained opponents of the government sometimes disappear without a trace. Then we enter the capital on the Mezze Highway, a broad avenue of apartment buildings, government offices, cafes and cellphone shops.Suddenly, we are in the heart of the city.At the base of the Umayyad Mosque, one of the most beautiful sites in the Old City, couples and families hang out, feed pigeons and pose for a man who\u2019s been using the same Polaroid camera for decades. The Roman-era walls of the mosque once housed a pagan temple, then a cathedral, and its courtyard remains one of the most peaceful spaces I\u2019ve seen.Inside, children play on a polished marble floor that reflects the sky; women sit, murmuring their news; gilded murals and stained glass catch the sunset. But sometimes the crescendo of unseen warplanes bores into the quiet.At the Sheraton Damascus Hotel, lavish weddings and, in warm weather, afternoons lounging by the pool have continued throughout the war, but fewer and fewer can partake.Government employees, their salaries gutted by inflation and currency crashes, have slipped from the middle class into poverty, forcing many young people to postpone weddings they can\u2019t afford. And with men ensconced in the army and militias \u2014 or in exile to avoid the draft \u2014 there is a shortage of grooms.Downtown Damascus feels busy and alive, with people boarding vans and buses to get to work as in any other city. But the heavy traffic is partly a result of the security checkpoints that have proliferated.We were forbidden to photograph checkpoints during our 12-day stay in Syria, but they are ubiquitous. Our government-required minder alternately castigated, teased and charmed the soldiers and militiamen to speed our passage. But the checkpoints are more than a nuisance for many Syrians, who can be forced to pay bribes, or they can be detained or seized and sent off to army service.Mount Qasioun towers above the city as always. But the cafes near the top, once a popular date spot, are closed. Artillery guns atop the mountain have been the backbeat of the war, the strange spectacle of a capital shelling its own suburbs, and sometimes being shelled back.The simple act of changing money underscores how the economy has crashed with the costs of war, the destruction of manufacturing and the flight of capital as wealthy Syrians flee or send assets abroad.For $600, we got a four-inch brick of Syrian pounds at the Lebanese border.The value of the pound against the dollar is a tenth of prewar levels. So restaurant tabs are paid in sheafs of bills but seem ridiculously cheap compared with past visits. At Naranj, the fanciest restaurant in the Old City, a lavish spread of traditional Syrian food around the marble fountains and mosaics came to the equivalent of about $10 per person.Sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe, meant to punish the government for human rights abuses, leave most Syrians unable to use credit cards or open international bank accounts. Even industries intended to be exempt, like pharmaceuticals, are sometimes hampered by international banks\u2019 caution against running afoul of the sanctions.Taxi and bus drivers have always seen themselves as impresarios in Damascus: playing Arabic classics and Western pop music, making coffee in little electric pots while weaving through traffic, setting up romantic lights they flick on at night for an instant party atmosphere.But one cabby I met was a moonlighting soldier, trying to supplement a salary whose shrinking value could not support his family. He was still stuck in the army several years past the normal two-year requirement.At a central roundabout, two contrasting ads side by side show the dual nature of life in the capital.On the right, a recruitment poster sponsored by a women\u2019s group declares: \u201cOur army means all of us. Join the armed forces.\u201d On the left, a clinic offers a weight-loss treatment that promises \u201closing one kilogram after each session,\u201d as well as \u201chair removal and bleaching without pain.\u201dThe Old City of Damascus is its most beautiful, famous section, with pedestrian streets, alleys overhung with vines and centuries-old houses built around courtyards.No tourist museum, it is a thriving set of interlocking neighborhoods reflecting the city\u2019s cultural and religious diversity, where a shop selling classic Syrian crafts and antiques might be next door to ones selling toothpaste and detergents, or lingerie and sweatsuits.But many of those shops have closed, or remain open only for their owners to keep company drinking coffee and playing backgammon with neighboring merchants. Militiamen from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, or Syrians they have helped train, keep watch on the streets.Some shop owners whisper that they feel as if they are under occupation or grumble that they were forced to paint the Syrian flag on their doors. Others want to leave Syria but can\u2019t afford it because all their wealth is tied up in inventory \u2014 silver, tiles, brass, silk brocade, mosaic woodwork \u2014 they cannot sell. Rebel shells still occasionally crash down, killing people at random.The Tiki Bar, on the Saturday before Halloween, had a bartender using his laptop to act as a D.J., as costumed patrons drank and smoked.I noticed only later, watching a video taken at the bar, that the man next to me was, startlingly, dressed as a Nazi. There was a swastika on his armband.The stunning shrine of Sayeda Rokaya, a figure revered by Shiites, is encrusted with layers of decoration: Why choose between blue ceramic tiles, Iranian-style cut-glass sparkle and voluminous chandeliers when you can have them all?There is a sense of community at the shrine among women who bring ailing children to try to absorb its blessing, and wipe dolls and garments against its grille. They beat their chests in lamentation. Many are pilgrims from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon, countries with militias supporting the Syrian Army, an intervention that has deeply divided Syrians.The privations of war intrude here, as everywhere. The electricity goes off, a result of the daily power cuts imposed across Damascus because of fuel shortages. The chants continue even when the loudspeaker cuts off. Then the lights come back on, along with the amplified prayers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roy Cooper Holds Thin Lead Over Gov. Pat McCrory in North Carolina", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byYet many here are now predicting that the contentious law, which catalyzed a national debate over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, is unlikely to be repealed even if Mr. Cooper becomes governor.Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican seeking his second term, has refused to concede until thousands of mail-in and provisional ballots are counted by elections boards in each of the state\u2019s 100 counties. That process is set to conclude on Nov. 18. Mr. McCrory was widely criticized for having signed the law.\u201cThey\u2019re going to feel empowered that their agenda is working, so it\u2019s going to be very hard to imagine them taking up H.B. 2 to overturn it or modify it,\u201d Mr. Moore said of Republicans on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t see them chomping at the bit or singing kumbaya to change it.\u201dRepublican leaders of the state legislature could not be reached for comment.Mr. Cooper, North Carolina\u2019s attorney general, declared victory early Wednesday morning, when tallies from the state\u2019s 2,704 precincts showed him leading by just less than 5,000 votes.For now, the only thing certain about the outcome is that lawyers from both sides will be closely monitoring the county boards as they determine which of the more than 50,000 provisional ballots should be deemed legitimate.Mr. McCrory\u2019s campaign announced on Wednesday that it was establishing a legal-defense fund in preparation for an \u201congoing legal battle\u201d over the vote tally.\u201cNo one knows for sure the outcome of the election, and tens of thousands of ballots remain outstanding and not yet counted,\u201d Jason Torchinsky, the fund\u2019s chief lawyer, said in a statement.Chris LaCivita, the McCrory campaign\u2019s strategist, said in a separate statement that the campaign also had \u201cgrave concerns over potential irregularities\u201d regarding 90,000 votes in Durham County.Still, a number of political observers here said that Mr. Cooper had the better chance of winning. Mail-in absentee voters traditionally tend to be Republicans, while voters who file provisional ballots tend to be Democrats. And though the exact number of mail-in ballots was not yet known, they were expected to be outnumbered by provisional ballots.\u201cI would not be surprised that Cooper keeps the lead, or has some extra cushion built into it\u201d at the conclusion of the vote-counting process, said J. Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C. If either man is trailing by fewer than 10,000 votes after Nov. 18, he may demand a recount.Whether Mr. Cooper wins or not, his showing was exceptional, given the shellacking other Democrats received on Tuesday, both in North Carolina and nationally. The outcry over H.B. 2 was widely considered to be one of the main reasons for his success.The law, signed by Mr. McCrory in March, prohibits local governments from passing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and it requires that people in government buildings use the restrooms that correspond with their gender at birth.Mr. McCrory has argued that the law was necessary to ensure privacy, and others said it would protect innocent people from sexual predators. Gay rights advocates saw the bathroom provision as an attack on transgender people.As part of the backlash against the law, planned job expansions, concerts and major sporting events have been canceled. During the campaign, Mr. Cooper argued that Mr. McCrory had harmed the state\u2019s reputation and economy by signing the bill.It was a message that was embraced even by some Trump supporters, and it was a likely reason Mr. Cooper and Mr. Trump found success in some of the same parts of North Carolina.One was coastal New Hanover County, home to the city of Wilmington. The area has seen a dip in its once-flourishing film industry recently, a likely result of the legislature\u2019s decision not to renew a state tax credit for film, television and commercial production.But there is also a suspicion in Wilmington that Hollywood has grown leery of North Carolina because of H.B. 2. Jason Rosin, a business agent with Local 491 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union representing film workers in Wilmington, said that some of his members were motivated to vote for Mr. Cooper out of concerns about H.B. 2\u2019s effect on the industry \u2014 even as they voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cI believe that in the Cooper race, they voted for their economic self-interest,\u201d Mr. Rosin said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Boomers\u2019 Sunset, Election Reawakens an Old Divide", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byThey came of age in the 1960s and \u201970s, in the traumatic aftermath of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They fought and protested a war together, argued over Nixon and Kissinger together, laughed at Archie Bunker together. As children, they practiced air-raid drills; as adults, they cheered the fall of the Berlin Wall.In the 1990s, they saw one of their own become president, watching him gain glory as one of the most gifted politicians of his time, but also infamy as one of its most self-indulgent \u2014 a poster child for the Me Generation.They are of course the baby boomers, the collective offspring of the most fertile period in American history. At 75 million strong, they have been the most dominant force in American life for three decades, and one of its most maligned. Enlightened but self-centered, introspective but reckless, they are known among the cohorts that followed them \u2014 and even to some boomers themselves \u2014 as the generation that failed to live up to its lofty ideals, but still held fast to its sense of superiority.If Bill Clinton was their white-haired id, Hillary Clinton is their superego in a pantsuit. A second Clinton presidency could represent a last hurrah for the baby boomers. But it could also offer a shot at a kind of generational redemption.\u201cThere is a kind of do-over quality to it,\u201d said Landon Y. Jones, the author of the 1980 book \u201cGreat Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation.\u201d \u201cThis is their last chance to get it right.\u201dA shared history binds the boomers \u2014 as do, broadly speaking, some shared traits. Their parents suffered through the Depression and World War II before rearing them in the most prosperous society the world had ever seen. Inevitably, perhaps, they were guided by two polestars: responsibility and entitlement.Those dueling impulses powered the rise of both Clintons: one impulse galvanizing supporters who deeply admired their commitment to public service, the other galling critics who saw them as playing by their own rules.\u201cThere\u2019s this tremendous idealism with the Clintons \u2014 actually living social change, embodying social change,\u201d said Gil Troy, the author of \u201cThe Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s\u201d and a history professor at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cBut also, at the end of day, not just having this will to power, but also being so convinced of their own self-righteousness that they improvise a new set of morality and ethics.\u201dLike her husband\u2019s, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political odyssey began in earnest when she volunteered for George McGovern\u2019s youth-powered 1972 presidential bid, one that ended in a lopsided, welcome-to-adulthood takedown of \u201960s idealism at the hands of President Richard M. Nixon and his \u201csilent majority.\u201d It was there, in the trenches, that the Clintons \u2014 still in their mid-20s, and not yet married \u2014 began to assemble the network of trusted friends that continues to surround them.Twenty years later, at 46, Bill Clinton became the third-youngest president ever elected. At 69, Hillary Clinton would be the second-oldest. In many respects, her journey has become her generation\u2019s journey \u2014 from protester to parent and now grandparent, from earnest idealist to battle-hardened realist.They would be bookends on their cohort, one seizing the national stage on behalf of their generation in its prime, the other, who now qualifies for Medicare, vying to lead it into its dotage.Of course, the presidential election has featured not one but two members of the generation born between 1946 and 1964. And just as the Clintons grew out of the campus left, Donald J. Trump traces his political following, if not his own formation, to that generation\u2019s Nixon voters: those who did not protest, or even attend college; who preferred Elvis to the Beatles, Sinatra to Santana, the familiar to the foreign, order to upheaval. (Though at this point, what was once the counterculture has become the culture: Mr. Trump has been known to play the Rolling Stones at events.)The most enduring boomer icons, however, sprang not from a Hollywood script but from Yale Law School and the Arkansas Statehouse. Standing under the balloons at Madison Square Garden in 1992 \u2014 with Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d blaring \u2014 the Clintons sent a clear message to their peers: Yesterday\u2019s gone. Our time is now.And also, maybe, now.Not much remains of the we-can-change-the-world optimism that swept in with the new administration in 1993, and maybe with good reason. The great accomplishments of Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidency \u2014 peace and its anticipated dividends, a surging economy, shrinking budget deficits \u2014 were washed away. As some boomers sent their kids to college, others sent their sons and daughters off to fight in a seemingly permanent conflict halfway around the globe. If elected, Mrs. Clinton would inherit the Islamic State, an ever-widening income gap, partisan gridlock and a populace so polarized and full of loathing that it seems to be segregating. Her husband had it easy by comparison.It\u2019s no fun getting old.Not that Mrs. Clinton is complaining. She has embraced her longevity, beginning a recent rally in Pueblo, Colo., with a callback to her last visit there. \u201cI know there are a lot of really young people here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut was anybody here back in 1992?\u201dCheers shot up from some of the gathering\u2019s elders.In 2008, Barack Obama, though born at the tail end of the generation in 1961, consciously styled himself as younger, saying that Americans were tired of \u201cthe psychodrama of the baby boom generation,\u201d that they hungered for \u201ca different kind of politics.\u201dNo doubt. And yet in many ways, the 2016 election has served as a rematch between two boomer factions: one candidate promising a 1950s-flavored throwback to an idealized postwar America at its most muscular, the other sounding the familiar liberal call to tear down whatever societal barriers still stand.Mrs. Clinton is a long way from the 1969 commencement speaker who told her Wellesley classmates that the challenge for their generation was to \u201cpractice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.\u201d She is now more likely to warn of the perils of overpromising. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more of that,\u201d she says.But the battles of the \u201960s are never far from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mind. Even a September speech to students at Temple University in Philadelphia featured a reference to her struggles during the Vietnam War.\u201cI think at this point in history, it\u2019s crucial that we have someone who understands the long view,\u201d said the actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who was born in 1958 and has been campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI think we\u2019re a nation in trouble.\u201dThey remain a powerful voting bloc. Though millennials are now the most populous living generation, they lack the boomers\u2019 electoral punch. According to the Pew Research Center, fewer than half of eligible millennial voters said they voted in 2012. Turnout among boomers was nearly 70 percent.This is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s demographic sweet spot. Her stump speeches are liberally salted with mentions of her grandchildren; her platform includes opposing efforts to cut Social Security benefits and raise the retirement age.And a volunteer army of boomer celebrities, some of whom have known the Clintons since the 1990s, are working on her behalf, including the actress Mary Steenburgen and her husband, Ted Danson. Another is Rob Reiner, who played the lefty student Michael Stivic on \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and says he feels that the bigotry sent up on that sitcom has flared back up with a vengeance. \u201cWe are living in \u2018All in the Family\u2019 right now,\u201d Mr. Reiner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a daily reality show that stars Donald Trump as Archie Bunker.\u201dIf those old characters were still around, Archie would probably be blaming Michael for everything from free trade to illegal immigration to the country\u2019s sky-high divorce rate. And Michael would be taking credit for gay marriage, a black president and Bob Dylan\u2019s Nobel Prize.For all the steep challenges that await, if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she will at least have the chance to pursue a new set of progressive causes. To address and amend aspects of her husband\u2019s political legacy. And to reshape America\u2019s image of a generation and the couple that has come to embody it.Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Bullies Hong Kong", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialHong Kong is governed under the Basic Law, a charter negotiated by China and Britain before the 1997 handover. It ensured Hong Kong its freedoms, including an independent judiciary. It also gives China\u2019s Parliament the right to interpret the law, but until Monday, Beijing had not issued its own interpretation of any clause in the Basic Law without being asked for an interpretation by the Hong Kong government or judiciary. In this case, it intervened to say that office holders must \u201csincerely and solemnly\u201d take loyalty oaths.Beijing\u2019s unilateral move was a heavy-handed attempt to silence democratic voices. And it raised new questions about China\u2019s willingness to reinterpret agreements for its own benefit.In the past two decades, China has often tolerated activities in Hong Kong that it would not allow on the more restricted mainland. Even so, Chinese authorities have limited Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. In 2014 and 2015, negotiations over an electoral reform package deeply divided Hong Kong, provoking 79 days of protests. The reforms allowed Hong Kong residents to vote directly for their chief executive, the territory\u2019s highest-ranking official, but Beijing refused to give up the power to vet candidates.China cannot afford to erode that credibility, especially when its own economy is struggling. Nor can China afford to stoke further unrest, which makes Hong Kong less attractive for investment and sends an ominous signal to Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers a renegade province. Activists like Ms. Yau and Mr. Leung are choosing to defend the rule of law; they merit strong international support.On Tuesday, more than 1,000 lawyers marched silently through Hong Kong to condemn China and support the pro-independence lawmakers. Britain and the United States, which 20 years ago promised to hold Beijing to account, must do better than issuing mild statements urging China not to undermine confidence in the city\u2019s autonomy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byThis is my last column until after the election, so I\u2019d like to address the people least likely to read it: Donald Trump voters. Who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column, and they\u2019ll accidentally peruse it! Desperate times call for desperate measures.While I\u2019ve opposed the Trump candidacy from the start, I\u2019ve never disparaged Trump voters. Some are friends and neighbors; they\u2019re all fellow Americans. We should take their concerns seriously. But we should also demand that they be serious, that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates.Yes, Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader \u2014 but in the way so many presidents were. We know her flaws: She has a weakness for secrecy, occasionally fudges truths, has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women. But she is not indecent, and that is an important distinction. And she\u2019s studious, has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously.Trump is not only a flawed politician, he\u2019s an indecent human being. He\u2019s boasted of assaulting women \u2014 prompting 11 to come forward to testify that he did just that to them; his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they weren\u2019t pretty enough.He\u2019s created a university that was charged with defrauding its students. He\u2019s been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties. He\u2019s stiffed countless vendors, from piano sellers to major contractors. He\u2019s refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that he\u2019s paid no federal taxes for years, is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesn\u2019t give like he says to charity.He\u2019s compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his \u201csacrifice\u201d of building tall buildings. He\u2019s vowed, if elected, to prosecute his campaign rival.We have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidate.At the same time, Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth. Harlan Coben\u2019s debate-night tweet last month had it right: \u201cOn Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read.\u201dI understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just \u201cshake things up.\u201d When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to, you can open new futures. But when you shake things up, guided by one-liners and no moral compass, you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigo.But there is an even more important reason Trump supporters, particularly less-educated white males, should be wary of his bluster: His policies won\u2019t help them. Trump promises to bring their jobs back. But most of their jobs didn\u2019t go to a Mexican. They went to a microchip.No one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines, but I can assure you it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s way \u2014 build walls, restrict trade, give huge tax cuts to the rich. The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call \u201cSTEMpathy jobs \u2014 jobs that blend STEM skills (science, technology, engineering, math) with human empathy. We don\u2019t know what many of them will look like yet.The smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible \u2014 to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt; create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning, because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge; make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences; make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the world\u2019s most imaginative risk-takers; and strengthen our safety nets, because this era will leave more people behind.This is the only true path to American greatness in the 21st century. Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. \u201cWhat do we have to lose\u201d by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is: everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences.While Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course. And however great her flaws, she is still in the zone of human decency. Trump is not.We can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump. I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters, my fellow Americans, will see that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Social Media Disconnecting Us From the Big Picture?", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Donald Trump could be elected president, but I was. I live in Brooklyn and work in Manhattan, two of the most liberal places in the country. But even online, I wasn\u2019t seeing many signs of support for him. How did that blindness occur? Social media is my portal into the rest of the world \u2014 my periscope into the communities next to my community, into how the rest of the world thinks and feels. And it completely failed me.In hindsight, that failure makes sense. I\u2019ve spent nearly 10 years coaching Facebook \u2014 and Instagram and Twitter \u2014 on what kinds of news and photos I don\u2019t want to see, and they all behaved accordingly. Each time I liked an article, or clicked on a link, or hid another, the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought I wanted to see. That meant I didn\u2019t realize that most of my family members, who live in rural Virginia, were voicing their support for Trump online, and I didn\u2019t see any of the pro-Trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election. I never saw a Trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds, and the only Election Day selfies I saw were of people declaring their support for Hillary Clinton.To be clear, I\u2019m not blaming the algorithms for what I assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview. They did exactly what I told them to do, blocking out racist, misogynist and anti-immigrant comments, hiding anyone who didn\u2019t support Black Lives Matter, all with such deftness that I had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election. But considering that more than 40 percent of our country\u2019s population consumes news on Facebook, finding alternative perspectives shouldn\u2019t have been that hard. I knew about Eli Pariser\u2019s theory on filter bubbles, or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see, and even so, I still chose to let algorithms shape how I perceive the world. Everything I could want to see is available at my fingertips, and yet I didn\u2019t look.In April, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network. Facebook, he said, has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet. \u201cThe internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community, and we are all better off for it.\u201dBut that\u2019s not what has happened. Zuckerberg\u2019s idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site. On Facebook, the political divide has only been entrenched further. It\u2019s the BuzzFeed dress debate, only for our entire lives: We are two countries, one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold. The internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another. But they are rapidly disappearing.Most social media \u2014 like Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it, but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness, a Gal\u00e1pagos of sorts, where culture thrived untouched. They included Vine (whose closure was announced in October) and Snapchat, and even Tumblr, which were homes for marginalized ideas, theories and lifestyles.The video-sharing app Vine was the first place I got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own, including those of the Middle East. I was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them: prospering, aware. A young woman living in Saudi Arabia who goes by the name Amy Roko used Vine to show clips of herself living her life \u2014 her version of normalcy \u2014 at the mall, goofing off at home. In her most viral video, she stares into the camera, her face covered in a niqab, save for her perfectly outlined eyes. \u201c[expletive] called me ugly,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI said, [expletive] where?\u201d The emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath. I was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own.Vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community. But Vine links could be shared independent of the network, and people did so with abandon, meaning that Vines appeared scattershot around the web, defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds. They could land on your screen via text message, direct message, email.Roko\u2019s Vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black American named Brionna London, who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty. You can draw a straight line from brown women in Saudi Arabia to black women in America, a marvel unto itself, a window into the way the internet flattens space and time \u2014 a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides. At Vine\u2019s peak, it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of times, and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities: that, say, black kids in New Orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in Florida. (At the very least, they shared a similar humor and taste in music, which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as well.)And yet Twitter, which owns Vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers, could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature (which reportedly costs millions a month to maintain) afloat. Following news about Twitter\u2019s decision to close the service, there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing Vine\u2019s remains. But it\u2019s most likely too late to salvage the community there.In its earlier days, Snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange. The app had an incredible series on \u201ccity life\u201d that gave users direct windows into different worlds. People submitted short video diaries about life in their cities, which the company compiled into a single video, viewable by anyone using the app. I remember feeling delighted watching people in Istanbul and S\u00e3o Paulo showing off their routines and customs. But the company is now prioritizing \u201clive stories,\u201d which feature more mainstream events like the Super Bowl and music festivals. The effect is still fascinating, but less intimate. Snapchat seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar.The future of Tumblr, the blogging platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender theory, critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the internet, is the most uncertain. Yahoo, its parent company, succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by Verizon, raising questions about the future of its properties.What we\u2019re seeing with Snapchat, Tumblr and Vine reflects a larger shift in the social-media economy. User-generated content, by and large, is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies investors, and as a result, most social-media companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams. One of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging. Semiprivate messaging applications \u2014 group text threads and applications like WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook) and Slack \u2014 have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for conversation, a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks. New features are introduced daily, it seems, to make messaging with your friends more \u201cfun.\u201d The latest version of the iPhone\u2019s software includes the ability to make messages \u201cexplode\u201d with confetti. WhatsApp now offers the ability to tag people in messages, as you might tag them in a photograph online. These changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications overseas, which used similar features to attract and retain customers. (Line, a Japanese company that built an addictive messaging app with 220 million monthly users worldwide, had one of the biggest initial public offerings \u2014 $1.1 billion \u2014 earlier this year.) These new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter together, by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large.What happens when we would rather look inward? I have found something of an answer in a short story called \u201cThe Great Silence,\u201d by Ted Chiang, about humankind\u2019s search for signs of alien life. The story is narrated by a parrot in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. \u201cTheir desire to make a connection is so strong that they\u2019ve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe,\u201d the creature begins. \u201cBut I and my fellow parrots are right here. Why aren\u2019t they interested in listening to our voices?\u201d The paradox is not to be missed: We are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with. The story ends on a somber note. \u201cHuman activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction,\u201d the narrator explains. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it maliciously. They just weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201dChiang\u2019s lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment. Social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with people; instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we don\u2019t agree with. But if we can\u2019t pay attention to one another, we might as well not live on the same planet at all.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel\u2019s Anti-Ideology", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 She\u2019s running again. Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced that she will once again lead her party, the center-right Christian Democrats, in Germany\u2019s national election next September. If the party wins, she will capture a fourth term, running a country increasingly rived by populism and xenophobia.But in starting the battle, she has also, in a way, called it off. Hillary Clinton made her campaign about defending America against the evils of populism and retrograde nationalism; Ms. Merkel will pretend there is no such war. As her campaign, just a week old, has already made clear, she will do everything she can to avoid standing against ideologies, or for them. And this might be a very smart move.After the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States, commentators and policy makers in Germany have been busy creating oversize word-paintings of the European electoral struggles to come. In those \u201c\u00d6lschinken\u201d (an untranslatable German word for kitschy oil paintings), the German national election is portrayed as part of the Great War of our times, the next battle between liberal cosmopolitanism and nationalism, along with the elections in Austria, France and the Netherlands. While there is truth in this apocalyptic vision, the more dramatic the play of light, the worse things will get for liberal politics.It\u2019s easy to say that voters are angry; in reality, they\u2019re tired. They\u2019re tired of the orthodoxy that globalization \u2014 and with it mass migration, wage flight and deindustrialization \u2014 is inevitable. What scared Germans the most during the crazy summer and autumn of 2015, when 10,000 refugees arrived every day and towns were rushing to transform school gyms into temporary housing, was the feeling of loss of control, and the message from their leaders that anything less than mute acceptance was tantamount to racism.As in the United States, populist politicians have emerged, proposing their own versions of Mr. Trump\u2019s wall \u2014 even though, in today\u2019s Europe, those ideas are still more fanciful. Ms. Merkel\u2019s brilliance is to see a third way \u2014 to dispose of ideologies on both sides and to shoot for a pragmatic compromise.That means, for example, developing meaningful migration laws and social benefits and training programs for Germans who lose their job to laborers in Romania or Bangladesh; a more active European foreign policy to prevent or contain future crises; and transparent free-trade agreements.Such a reconciliation will also mean dropping the language of the battle. In 2015, Germans were quick to trade in their post-Hitler hair shirts for moral superiority. Progressive policy makers and commentators have lacked the compassion to see any other side than their own and have allowed the far right to portray doing the humanitarian thing as an unaffordable, elite project.Even now, after Brexit and Mr. Trump, commentators are heaping praise (and expectations) on Ms. Merkel as the last strong leader of the liberal West against the forces of darkness.Her campaign strategy, then, seems to be to tamp down that sort of talk, without rejecting her commitment to liberal values. In a speech last week at the Bundestag, she ran through an annoyingly comprehensive list of things this country needs to address, from education to budget consolidation, only to slip in a clear, but pragmatic, commitment to globalization and to Germany\u2019s taking responsibility in the world: \u201cI say, we have to go for collective efforts, for multilateralism. We have to try to shape globalization along with others. That\u2019s what I\u2019m advocating.\u201dHer strong stance for accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees was laudable, but it hurt her politically. Once the epitome of the broad post-ideological German consensus, Ms. Merkel quickly became Germany\u2019s most polarizing figure. After the wave of sexual assaults on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne and other cities, attributed to recent migrants, her popularity dropped sharply, with only 46 percent of the voters saying they hoped she would run again.Time, and a slowdown in migration, seem to have buoyed her prospects; last week, 64 percent of voters polled said they were glad she had decided to go for a fourth term. But now she will face attacks from the far right, and she will need to show voters that their favor is warranted.It won\u2019t be easy. Europe is turning on itself; political and economic crises could break out in Italy, Britain and France. She will need to be creative in her policy responses, a quality she is not exactly known for.And yet who if not she, so skilled at compromise, the anti-drama queen, could reunite Germany? And which country, if not Germany, the home of the social market economy, could be a better place to develop a blueprint for social progressivism, for a restrained, pragmatic way of embracing globalization?Liberal progressive politics will survive the populist resurgence only if liberal progressives give up their claim to moral superiority and elitist policy making. The election of 2017 is about reconciling Germany with globalization, and marrying progressive politics to conservative positions. It\u2019s about calling off the Great War. It might prove the only way of winning it.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel\u2019s Bet on Donald Trump Pays Off", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor at odds with much of Silicon Valley, will have President Trump\u2019s ear on tech issues.He won\u2019t be moving to Washington, Mr. Thiel made clear in an interview Wednesday afternoon. He is unlikely to have a formal role. He has no desire to fulfill his youthful dream of joining the United States Supreme Court.But he will have a voice.\u201cA page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to help the president in any way I can.\u201dBut now that Mr. Thiel\u2019s bet on Mr. Trump has paid off, he seems to be in a position to reap some rewards.Mr. Thiel said that he never doubted the Republican candidate would triumph despite predictions from pollsters and the news media.\u201cHis odds were very badly underestimated,\u201d Mr. Thiel said of Mr. Trump. \u201cTrump voters were not being captured by the polls. A lot of the dynamics were very similar to the Brexit vote in the U.K.,\u201d which also took many commentators by surprise.Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, Mr. Thiel said, forgot the motto that Bill Clinton had won the presidency with in 1992: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d\u201cSomehow the Clintons did not remember,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a blind spot.\u201d Mr. Thiel said that against Senator Bernie Sanders, who competed against Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, it \u201cwould have been much tougher for Trump to win, and a healthier race for the country. It would have been two candidates who agreed about the country\u2019s stagnation but had very different policy prescriptions.\u201dOne of the supposed rules of American presidential politics is that the candidates must be upbeat \u2014 a decree ever since Ronald Reagan trounced Walter Mondale in 1984 with the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s morning again in America.\u201dMr. Thiel said he sensed this year that the rule would not hold.\u201cI\u2019ve thought for quite a long time that the happy clappy Panglossian Republican politics that we had over the last few decades was deeply out of touch,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, a more pessimistic candidate would do better, because they would resonate with these broad economic realities.\u201dEven as Mr. Thiel\u2019s bet on Mr. Trump was proved right, many in Silicon Valley\u2019s tech industry on Wednesday reacted negatively to the presidential victor. Some venture capitalists floated the idea of a California secession.The investor said Silicon Valley was not completely opposed to Mr. Trump; there was also some secret support.\u201cI was having dinner last week with a high-profile venture capitalist and he said, \u2018I\u2019m voting for Trump but I have to lie and tell everyone I\u2019m voting for Gary Johnson,\u2019\u201d the third-party candidate, said Mr. Thiel. \u201cHe was stunningly matter-of-fact about it.\u201dNow, he said, it\u2019s \u201call hands on deck.\u201d That includes the technology community.\u201cIt\u2019s important for it to be able to work with the rest of the country and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it would be crazy to simply spend four years issuing denunciatory tweets on Twitter. For a day or two, that\u2019s fine. But I hope Silicon Valley will be more productive than that.\u201dThe enormous wealth created by the tech industry has not been widely shared. It\u2019s a problem the community needs to reflect on and address, the investor said.Mr. Thiel, whose net worth of nearly $3 billion partly derives from being the first outside investor in Facebook and being a cofounder of the electronics payments company PayPal, has a history of making contrarian bets.Before Mr. Trump, the investor backed other outsiders: Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, during the 2016 primaries. None of those bets paid off.Mr. Thiel said he not only spoke out for Mr. Trump and gave him money, but voted for him in a state \u2014 California \u2014 where the candidate was bound to lose.\u201cI did vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t always vote, but I thought you might ask, so I did.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: A New Porsche Cayman, and Still a Driver\u2019s Dream", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byDrivenPorsche is adamant that it doesn\u2019t sell transportation; it\u2019s in the experience business. The automotive industry practically invented the hype machine, but Porsche has turned it into an art. The teenage memory of my first ride in a Porsche (a 911 Turbo, no less) is up there with my wedding day.This is something my wife does not need to know.The least expensive way to get into a new Porsche is the midengine 718 Cayman (the number also rides on its convertible sibling, the Boxster). This new prefix is a number with history. The 718 began as a midengine racecar built from 1957 to 1962 and driven by legends like Stirling Moss and Dan Gurney.The 2017 Cayman is not just last year\u2019s model with a new badge and a restyled caboose. Nearly every body panel is different. The chassis has been retuned. And more important, there is a new family of engines tucked behind the driver\u2019s seat.Gone are the naturally aspirated flat-6 engines. In their place are two turbocharged flat 4-cylinder engines. The high-performance S model tested gets a 2.5-liter producing 350 horsepower (up by 25 from last year) and 309 pound-feet of torque (a bump of 36). Standard Caymans and Boxsters have 2-liter engines, with 300 horsepower and 280 pound-feet. It essentially offers the same power as last year\u2019s S model.The 6-speed manual has a forged feel with precision action. Good? Oh, yes. But the 7-speed dual-clutch PDK automatic at $3,200 is a wonder of engineering. More than an automatic, it\u2019s so adept at foreseeing a driver\u2019s intentions, I question if the Germans have mastered telepathy.The turbo 4s are quicker than the departing 6s. The 0-to-60 dash is done in 4.4 seconds with the manual S and 4.2 with the PDK. The 2-liter Cayman is just half a second slower.But those are numbers. The Cayman is an emotional machine. A precision mechanical soundtrack swells from behind the seats, where the engine sits. The electric power steering, which replaced the precise hydraulic-assisted steering for 2014, maintains superb road feel. An optional torque vectoring system pulses the inside rear brake caliper in tandem with the rear differential for more stability.This is less a car, more a drug.Weight distribution and fuel economy remain much the same. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the manual transmission S models at 20 city and 26 highway on premium fuel.What\u2019s not to love here? Sound, perhaps. The higher sonic note of the 6 is a Porsche experience the faithful can\u2019t forget. The turbos have a lower baritone. Personally, I\u2019m a fan of the new car. Order the Sport Exhaust System ($2,890) and a button provides extra snort, the kind your neighbors won\u2019t appreciate.The ride quality is firm but livable. It\u2019s adjustable, too, with the optional $1,790 Active Suspension Management system. There is a hint of throttle lag at launch, and it\u2019s best to keep revs up a smidgen to stay in the broad flat torque range.The Cayman\u2019s cabin gets a new dashboard, but only the well acquainted will notice. A new touch-screen interface that is consistent and snappy eliminates a blizzard of buttons from the center console. The door handles and trim look cast, not molded or extruded. And it wouldn\u2019t be a Porsche without the world\u2019s most over-engineered cup holders, which spring balletlike from the passenger side dash.Two pieces of luggage can be stowed in the rear trunk and a couple more can drop into the front trunk, or \u201cfrunk,\u201d easily. Practical? Yes, as much as a two-seat midengine sports car can be. Try that in an Alfa Romeo 4C and you will fail. Miserably.The best things in life may be free, but a 718 will cost you. A base Cayman starts at $54,950. A nicely equipped car averages $70,000. My S model tester was about $82,000. Other midengine cars can be twice the price. Chances are, driving the 718 will provide the same amount of grins, and memories.Advertisement"}

But it has helped establish conditions for ordinary Cubans to have greater autonomy in a society long run as a police state. It has also enabled Cuban-Americans to play a larger role in shaping the nation\u2019s future, primarily by providing capital for the island\u2019s nascent private sector. While the Cuban government and the Obama White House continue to have profound disagreements on issues such as human rights, the two governments have established a robust bilateral agenda that includes cooperation on environmental policy, maritime issues, migration, organized crime and responses to pandemics. These hard-won diplomatic achievements have benefited both sides.If Mr. Trump\u2019s Cuba policy matches his latest rhetoric, cooperation is likely to wane. That would only embolden hard-liners in the Cuban regime who are leery of mending ties with the United States and are committed to maintaining Cuba as a repressive socialist bulwark. In Mr. Trump, they may find the ideal foil to stoke nationalism among Cubans who are fiercely protective of their nation\u2019s sovereignty and right to self-determination.More than five decades of Cold War isolation never led to greater freedoms for Cubans. The Castro government has long justified its stifling controls on its citizens and its centrally planned economy by portraying Cuba as a nation under siege.Alternatively, Mr. Trump could build on Mr. Obama\u2019s approach by pressing lawmakers to do away with the senseless embargo. Once that happened, the American government would be better positioned to keep promoting freedom of expression, free enterprise and democratic governance, while making it clear that the future of Cuba must be decided by Cubans.Advertisement"}

Fighting, he said \u2014 in defense or offense \u2014 seems inevitable.\u201cThis country has elected a president who, during the campaign, demonstrated outright misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, nationalism, racism and authoritarian tendencies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have to challenge what we believe is wrong.\u201dMr. Murray, the city\u2019s first openly gay mayor, said he believed Mr. Trump, based on his comments as a candidate, could also aim to \u201ctrim back\u201d gains that places like Seattle have made in gay rights.\u201cLet me tell you, this city is committed that we will not lose the things that we have gained, the rings that we wear on our fingers,\u201d the mayor said.Not every result was so liberal. Californians voted to keep the death penalty, and some inland counties clearly supported the Trump candidacy. Still, one reason Mr. Trump\u2019s populist revolt bypassed the West is that the economic landscape did not reflect decades of decay and job losses.Yes, there are areas of anger and strain, from the high-desert ranches of eastern Oregon to coal towns in northwestern Colorado to strawberry farms in the Central Valley of California to steel towns struggling to reinvent themselves.But there are also new solar and wind farms, no-vacancy tourist towns and cities from Denver to San Jose, Calif., to Seattle that are buzzing with businesses, construction cranes and swarms of new residents.\u201cPlaces like Colorado, we have a robust economy,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents the Denver area. \u201cWhat you see in the West is the development of a new economy that they\u2019re not seeing the Midwest and the South.\u201dOver all, Colorado sided narrowly with the Democrats on Tuesday, but the state embraced liberal ballot measures like a rise in minimum wage and a law allowing medical assistance in dying for terminally ill people. Voters rejected a single-payer health care system, however.Like states across the nation, California is unsure to what extent Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to slash government programs such as the Affordable Care Act will be carried out. Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco and for decades a major player in state Democratic Party politics, said he did not believe California would be singled out for its support of Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a Trump jihad on California,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not so much into policy. He\u2019s into saying what he thinks people want to hear.\u201dKevin de Le\u00f3n, Senate president pro tem of California, said that his staff was not taking any chances and had begun a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of all federal programs that had an impact on California, and that it was looking at the impact that \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d would have. Kamala Harris, California\u2019s newly elected senator and a Democrat, said on Thursday that she would fight to protect immigrants and push back against Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed policies.Some mayors in the West vowed to push ahead with plans to protect salmon, to limit greenhouse gases, to feed undocumented immigrants and to outlaw discrimination against gay and transgender residents.\u201cOur agenda here in Colorado, our agenda here in Denver, does not change,\u201d said Michael B. Hancock, the mayor of Denver. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to design policies that are more inclusive. States like Colorado, cities like Denver, are ahead of the curve. We\u2019re trying to forge a future where we say, \u2018How do we not leave people behind?\u2019\u201dOther West Coast political leaders said they did not necessarily envision a war with the Trump administration and its allies but more a kind of competition for hearts and minds. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was elected to her first term in Congress on Tuesday representing part of Seattle, said that whispers of what might be called West Coast values \u2014 particularly a higher minimum wage \u2014 found echoes on Tuesday in states like Arizona that also voted for Mr. Trump.West Coast states, she said, should look for those allies and cultivate them.Voters in Colorado, Maine and Washington State also voted to raise their minimum wages.\u201cI absolutely believe that we can pull people toward this model,\u201d said Ms. Jayapal, the first Indian-American woman to serve in Congress. \u201cI think we are showing how to do things \u2014 we passed gun control legislation for the second time in three years on the ballot. We passed a statewide minimum-wage increase, the highest in the country.\u201dOn Thursday, as Mr. Trump visited the White House for the first time as president-elect, city officials in Portland, Ore., and environmental activists met to discuss a restriction on export terminals for coal, oil and other fossil fuels.\u201cRegardless of whether we have climate deniers in charge at the national government, it doesn\u2019t change the facts,\u201d said Mayor Charlie Hales of Portland. He said he was \u201cheartsick\u201d over the election, calling it a \u201cnational catastrophe.\u201d\u201cRivers flood. Droughts persist. We don\u2019t have the luxury of living in an ideological bubble on this,\u201d he said.The Obama years had given Portland a close partner in Washington. That relationship could be upended if Mr. Trump follows through on promises to cut off all federal funding for cities deemed to be \u201csanctuary cities\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Federal money flows to everything from rail lines to crime fighting to school lunch programs for poor children.\u201cWe\u2019ve built a better place, and the world is beating a path to our door,\u201d Mr. Hales said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how to feed people with or without the federal government\u2019s help.\u201dIn other liberal towns across the West, students joined protests against Mr. Trump, chanting what has now become a familiar motto, \u201cNot Our President.\u201d In Portland, some of the protests turned violent on Thursday night.In Boulder, Colo., Mrs. Clinton had a bigger win than Mr. Obama four years earlier. High school students streamed out of classes on Wednesday afternoon there to protest the election results, as they have in a several secondary schools across the West.On the pedestrian Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Heidi Ames, 41, kept a lonely vigil with a sign that said, \u201cTrump Is Not My President.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of shocked and depressed people right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to show other liberal people I\u2019m doing something. I\u2019m not just talking on Facebook.\u201dOn the day after the election, Mr. de Le\u00f3n, of the California Senate, sent out a statement written with a colleague in the Legislature that said the victory of Mr. Trump made them feel like \u201cstrangers in a foreign land.\u201dIn an interview on Thursday, Mr. de Le\u00f3n said he felt a mix of disillusionment and defiance.\u201cCalifornia has long set an example for other states to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to allow one election to reverse generations of progress.\u201dThomas Fuller reported from San Francisco, Jack Healy from Denver, and Kirk Johnson from Seattle.Advertisement"}

The town\u2019s mood is as ugly as the weather. The 15th Amendment has just been ratified, granting the vote to all qualified men \u201cwithout regard to race or color,\u201d and the air is full of dank mutterings. The Indian wars smolder on and federal troops remain in Texas, enforcing a ban on side arms. Capt. Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a septuagenarian widower, former soldier and printer, travels around North Texas entertaining grim little audiences with newspaper readings about these troubling times, leavened with tales of the world\u2019s \u201cdistant magic,\u201d from erupting volcanoes to \u201celectromagnetic disturbances in the ether.\u201dDespite trafficking in wonders, the captain\u2019s own life strikes him as \u201cthin and sour,\u201d and it only looks to be getting worse when he\u2019s introduced to an expressionless little girl, referred to by her escort as \u201cthat maniac,\u201d who needs to be returned to relatives outside San Antonio, a wildly hazardous 400-mile journey.Ten-year-old Johanna Leonberger was 6 when the Kiowa took her captive after murdering her parents and little sister. In the aftermath, she became Cicada, daughter of Turning Water and Three Spotted, and Kiowa to the soul \u2014 until she was traded to an Army agent for \u201c15 Hudson\u2019s Bay four-stripe blankets and a set of silver dinnerware.\u201d Now twice orphaned, she has forgotten the English language and everything about her earlier life.\u201cThe child seems artificial as well as malign,\u201d the captain observes at his first sight of Johanna, huddled under a blanket. Nevertheless, he agrees to transport her for \u201ca Spanish coin of eight escudos in 22-karat gold.\u201d With it, he buys a wagon painted with the legend \u201cCurative Waters East Mineral Springs Texas\u201d in gold letters and packs it with supplies. The town whores obligingly strip Johanna of her deerskin shift decorated with elk teeth, give her a bath (she has lice) and cram her into worsted stockings, undergarments and a dress, a process that requires two hours and ruins the establishment\u2019s wallpaper. And off the captain and Johanna go.As one might expect, the old man is tough but the little girl is tougher; their road is hard and their enemies bad; they forge a kinship based on mutual respect as they contend with ambushes, shootouts, brawls, perilous river crossings and good-hearted widow ladies. At every turn, this story square-dances with clich\u00e9, and at every turn it\u2019s thrilling. Jiles, a poet as well as a novelist, has recognized that the best stories are the known ones, as long as they\u2019re told entrancingly and grow ever stranger as they roll on through familiar territory.Mostly she manages this small miracle by keeping her story quietly ironic and exquisitely particular. Lest one should hope for Johanna\u2019s return to the Kiowa, as she painfully desires, it\u2019s made clear that, threatened with losing their rations and being hunted down by the cavalry, they no longer want her. Wisely, Jiles reveals Johanna\u2019s deep attachment to her former life only through what persists of it: \u201cLike all people who do not wear shoes her big toes pointed straight ahead.\u201d Both the place and the period are rendered with precise economy, and the characters communicate their concerns mostly through what they keep an eye on.Guns, for one thing, which the captain, who has lived through three wars, knows as intimately as \u201chis inks and his papers.\u201d When accosted by a company of United States Army infantrymen on horseback, he notes that they carry \u201csquareback Navy Colt five-shot revolvers that looked as big as pork hams in their holsters.\u201d He can distinguish a revolver from a rifle shot by sound, though during one astonishing gun battle it\u2019s Johanna who provides an ingenious solution when he runs out of ammunition. But chiefly the captain tries to keep an eye on Johanna as she struggles to adjust to her new life, shown most vividly through her rediscovery of English. \u201cKep-dun,\u201d she calls him. \u201cChohenna,\u201d she learns to call herself. Along with so much else, she has permanently lost her \u201cR\u201ds \u2014 the Kiowa language has no R \u2014 and so \u201chungry\u201d is \u201chungli,\u201d horse is \u201choas.\u201d Like all returned captives, Johanna will be \u201cnever quite one thing or another,\u201d a reality reflected in her speech. She\u2019s \u201cbeen through two creations,\u201d as one character puts it, leaving her forever alien.The \u201ccurative\u201d aspect of Johanna\u2019s relationship with the captain is signaled from the first pages by that wagon. The real surprise in this fable-like story is the gorgeousness of their journey, from Spanish Fort along the flooded Red River, where a stormy sky is filled with \u201cblinding neurons of fire,\u201d to \u201cthe red and pink granite\u201d mountains north of Llano. In a world where live oak leaves fall \u201clike pennies\u201d and teams of oxen move in \u201ca ponderous waltz,\u201d everything is news. And at scarcely 200 pages, this exhilarating novel, a finalist for this year\u2019s National Book Award, travels through its marvelous terrain so quickly that one is shocked, almost stricken, to reach the end. So do what I did: Read it again.Suzanne Berne\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cThe Dogs of Littlefield.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Jacob Zuma of South Africa Faces Leadership Challenge", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Weakened by scandals and electoral losses in August, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa faced a challenge to his leadership for the first time at a meeting on Monday of top officials of the governing African National Congress.Officials of the A.N.C.\u2019s national executive committee, including three members of Mr. Zuma\u2019s cabinet, introduced a motion over the weekend that urged Mr. Zuma to step down, according to South Africa\u2019s news media. They said that Mr. Zuma\u2019s tainted leadership would harm the party in future voting, especially in national elections scheduled for 2019.Committee members met Monday evening, but there were no announcements of any action taken. Analysts had said it was unlikely that the president\u2019s critics would succeed in pushing for a vote of no confidence. Mr. Zuma is believed to still have strong support within the 104-member committee, which includes many loyalists appointed by him over his seven years in office.Still, even what might amount to a minor rebellion in the A.N.C.\u2019s top leadership appeared to have caught the party by surprise over the weekend. It also deepened divisions with the cabinet and the party as Mr. Zuma\u2019s government grapples with a poor economy, an unemployment rate of 27 percent and a possible downgrade of South Africa\u2019s national debt by credit agencies worried about poor governance.\u201cThis is leaving Zuma more weakened and more exposed because now you have it on record that the members of the A.N.C.\u2019s N.E.C. were discussing a topic that was the elephant in the room,\u201d Ralph Mathekga, a political analyst, said, referring to the executive committee.Mr. Zuma had been facing intensifying criticism of his leadership from within his own party. But until now, the criticism had come mostly from the lower ranks and from retired A.N.C. luminaries.Some active party leaders have distanced themselves from Mr. Zuma since the A.N.C. lost major cities, including Johannesburg and Pretoria, in local elections in August. The electoral results were the worst for the party since it took power after the end of apartheid in 1994.Mr. Zuma has been embroiled in one scandal after another since taking office in 2009. Last month, the public protector\u2019s office, a group charged with investigating official corruption and misconduct, recommended that Mr. Zuma\u2019s administration be officially investigated for corruption.If Mr. Zuma serves out his second and final term, set to end in 2019, the next three years will most likely be filled with legal battles over Mr. Zuma\u2019s possible misconduct, leaving the A.N.C. in a poor position heading into national elections.The party is expected to choose its next leader toward the end of next year. One of the top two contenders, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former government minister and the chairwoman of the African Union Commission, is strongly supported by the A.N.C.\u2019s rural branches, as well as its women\u2019s and youth leagues, which are also among Mr. Zuma\u2019s fiercest backers. Ms. Dlamini-Zuma was married for 16 years to Mr. Zuma, with whom she has four children.Her rival, Cyril Ramaphosa, the current deputy president and a prominent businessman, is backed by the party\u2019s urban branches and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation\u2019s biggest trade union federation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In California, a Bastion of Red Waits for Trump to Nudge This Blue State", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byBAKERSFIELD, Calif. \u2014 Sandra Eudy has considered leaving for Texas. Tina Larson finds it hard to envision retiring here, with the state\u2019s high taxes eating into her savings. And Greg Surgener would leave, if not for family obligations.Republicans are something of an endangered species in California, where Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and all statewide elected offices. For the first time since the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, even Orange County, long viewed as the cradle of the Republican Party in California, voted for Hillary Clinton.But not here.\u201cWe\u2019re our own state here,\u201d Ms. Eudy, 60, said over a breakfast of sausage and eggs at the 24th Street Cafe one recent morning. Ms. Eudy, the owner of an insulation company in town, said the state gives employees too many rights and leaves business owners without control.\u201cThey think of us as the expendables,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being sick and tired. But now that we have our own president, maybe things will finally start to change.\u201dKern County was hardly the only part of the state to vote for Mr. Trump, who won much of the Central Valley. And several less populous counties in the northeast are more strongly Republican \u2014 73 percent of voters in Lassen County chose Mr. Trump, for instance, as did 66 percent in Shasta County.In the days since the election, Republicans here have celebrated, as they have in those other places. They have also found themselves hoping that their party\u2019s control over the federal government will have a decisive impact on the state\u2019s policies.They have their hearts set on lower taxes and fewer environmental regulations, along with a stronger immigration system that will still let in guest workers for the agricultural fields here.With a population of about 375,000, Bakersfield is ringed by farms and oil fields, two major engines of the region\u2019s economy. Voters here routinely complain about the ways the state\u2019s water conservation laws have hurt local farmers, arguing that regulators should do more to send water through California\u2019s vast aqueduct system rather than funneling it thought the Sacramento Delta to protect endangered smelt there.For three generations, Larry Starrh\u2019s family has operated a small farm in Kern County, which now grows almonds and pistachios. He, too, resents the state\u2019s water regulations for farmers, and hopes Mr. Trump will work with the Republican-controlled Congress to overturn some of the rules and get more water pumped to the Central Valley.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge void and disconnect here between the big cities and the country in this state; they look at us as some sort of tumbleweed in between Sacramento and Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Starrh said. He pointed to the recent statewide ban on plastic bags as an example of government overreach, something he hopes will lessen with Mr. Trump in power.\u201cThe politicians here think the answer to all your problems is more laws, but I spend more time now going to meetings about regulations than actually farming,\u201d Mr. Starrh said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help me build jobs or feed my family, and it\u2019s not a way to stay in business.\u201dRepublicans make up roughly 38 percent of all registered voters in Kern County, while Democrats account for 36 percent. (Most others are independent.) But Republicans control both the Bakersfield City Council and the county\u2019s Board of Supervisors. The city is also home to Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader who has represented the area in Congress for a decade.Many Republicans here are confident that Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Trump will help chip away at some state policies, such as environmental regulations, the Affordable Care Act and the overwhelmingly welcoming attitude toward immigrants.Mr. Surgener, 42, runs a small oil and chemical company and said he hoped Mr. Trump would raise tariffs on oil from outside the country. More than that, he said, he hopes for relief on some of the state\u2019s rules against fracking.\u201cPeople in the cities don\u2019t have a realistic view of how we make everything out here,\u201d he said over drinks at a local bar one recent evening. \u201cThey want cheap oil, but they make it impossible to get it out of the ground. They want cheap food, but they don\u2019t want the pesticides.\u201dHe has considered selling his business and moving elsewhere, but, recently divorced, he cannot leave his children. And, he added, he views the state\u2019s diversity as a major selling point.Latinos here account for roughly 45 percent of the population, and many Republicans say they have mixed feelings over Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration plans.While they favor deporting anyone with a criminal record, they are eager to keep those who work in the fields picking crops, arguing that few people are willing to take those jobs.Jesse Rojas, 23, works in labor relations during the week, but hosts a Saturday morning radio call-in show in Spanish and supported Mr. Trump when the program began more than a year ago.\u201cAt first people wanted to crucify me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I keep saying this is about jobs. All anyone wants here is good jobs, and the state makes that harder and harder to do.\u201dMr. Rojas said he wants to see welfare programs cut, something he is hopeful Mr. Trump will do.Darrell Feil, who runs an industrial weed abatement business here, said he hopes Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will make it easier to run a business in the state. \u201cFinally we have someone who believes in less government and fewer regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been hurting us for years here. Every day I have to pray that we have more work so I don\u2019t have to lay off any of my guys.\u201dPerhaps nobody has been more elated in the last week than Dean Haddock, the chairman of the county\u2019s Republican Party who runs a family counseling practice.\u201cWe know people are going to be watching us, and we\u2019re thrilled about that,\u201d Mr. Haddock said in an interview in his office. \u201cI haven\u2019t given up on California yet. People who were afraid to call themselves a Republican are coming back out of the closet.\u201dBut not everyone shares his optimism.\u201cWhenever I think about retirement, I can\u2019t imagine staying here,\u201d said Ms. Larson, 53, a marketing professional who lives in nearby Tehachapi.Like many others in the region, her family came to the area from Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. But now she worries whether her children and grandchildren will stay in the state as the cost of living increases and taxes continue to climb. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that we\u2019re separated from the rest of the state\u2019s liberal agenda, but I worry every day that my children and grandchildren won\u2019t be able to find jobs,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders: Where the Democrats Go From Here", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMillions of Americans registered a protest vote on Tuesday, expressing their fierce opposition to an economic and political system that puts wealthy and corporate interests over their own. I strongly supported Hillary Clinton, campaigned hard on her behalf, and believed she was the right choice on Election Day. But Donald J. Trump won the White House because his campaign rhetoric successfully tapped into a very real and justified anger, an anger that many traditional Democrats feel.I am saddened, but not surprised, by the outcome. It is no shock to me that millions of people who voted for Mr. Trump did so because they are sick and tired of the economic, political and media status quo.Working families watch as politicians get campaign financial support from billionaires and corporate interests \u2014 and then ignore the needs of ordinary Americans. Over the last 30 years, too many Americans were sold out by their corporate bosses. They work longer hours for lower wages as they see decent paying jobs go to China, Mexico or some other low-wage country. They are tired of having chief executives make 300 times what they do, while 52 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. Many of their once beautiful rural towns have depopulated, their downtown stores are shuttered, and their kids are leaving home because there are no jobs \u2014 all while corporations suck the wealth out of their communities and stuff them into offshore accounts.Working Americans can\u2019t afford decent, quality child care for their children. They can\u2019t send their kids to college, and they have nothing in the bank as they head into retirement. In many parts of the country they can\u2019t find affordable housing, and they find the cost of health insurance much too high. Too many families exist in despair as drugs, alcohol and suicide cut life short for a growing number of people.President-elect Trump is right: The American people want change. But what kind of change will he be offering them? Will he have the courage to stand up to the most powerful people in this country who are responsible for the economic pain that so many working families feel, or will he turn the anger of the majority against minorities, immigrants, the poor and the helpless?Will he have the courage to stand up to Wall Street, work to break up the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial institutions and demand that big banks invest in small businesses and create jobs in rural America and inner cities? Or, will he appoint another Wall Street banker to run the Treasury Department and continue business as usual? Will he, as he promised during the campaign, really take on the pharmaceutical industry and lower the price of prescription drugs?I am deeply distressed to hear stories of Americans being intimidated and harassed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and I hear the cries of families who are living in fear of being torn apart. We have come too far as a country in combating discrimination. We are not going back. Rest assured, there is no compromise on racism, bigotry, xenophobia and sexism. We will fight it in all its forms, whenever and wherever it re-emerges.I will keep an open mind to see what ideas Mr. Trump offers and when and how we can work together. Having lost the nationwide popular vote, however, he would do well to heed the views of progressives. If the president-elect is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families, I\u2019m going to present some very real opportunities for him to earn my support.Let\u2019s rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of well-paying jobs. Let\u2019s raise the minimum wage to a living wage, help students afford to go to college, provide paid family and medical leave and expand Social Security. Let\u2019s reform an economic system that enables billionaires like Mr. Trump not to pay a nickel in federal income taxes. And most important, let\u2019s end the ability of wealthy campaign contributors to buy elections.In the coming days, I will also provide a series of reforms to reinvigorate the Democratic Party. I believe strongly that the party must break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor. We must open the doors of the party to welcome in the idealism and energy of young people and all Americans who are fighting for economic, social, racial and environmental justice. We must have the courage to take on the greed and power of Wall Street, the drug companies, the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry.When my presidential campaign came to an end, I pledged to my supporters that the political revolution would continue. And now, more than ever, that must happen. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world.

{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau and the Sludge of Canadian Mining Companies", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMONTREAL \u2014 \u201cCanada is back,\u201d says Justin Trudeau, the charismatic and bilingual prime minister of Canada, at international gatherings, seeking to showcase the imprint he wants to put on Canadian foreign policy in contrast to that of his predecessor, Stephen Harper. The prime minister has used very precise terms in his speeches: justice, environmental care, democracy and human rights. He even dared to invoke some of them during his official visit to China in September, although the Chinese did not applaud him for it.Trudeaumania moves forward with specific steps, a fresh style and velvety words. But Mr. Trudeau has been silent when it comes to one key issue for Latin Americans, an issue that has soiled Canada\u2019s image with thick layers of sludge: the reprehensible behavior of mining companies in the region. Mr. Harper enthusiastically promoted Canadian participation in extractive industries beyond its borders, and in the last few years, between 50 percent and 70 percent of mining projects in Latin America have been carried out by Canadian companies.In April, Mr. Trudeau received a letter from more than 180 nongovernmental organizations in Latin America and elsewhere requesting that he regulate the behavior of Canadian mining companies abroad. Although Mr. Harper established a Corporate Social Responsibility Counselor in 2009, the office solely focuses on technicalities and on facilitating dialogue between companies and affected communities. Liberals deemed the initiative insufficient, but now in power, they still rely on it, and to this date, there has been no official answer to the letter sent to Mr. Trudeau.During a recent visit to Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, St\u00e9phane Dion, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s foreign affairs minister, said that the Canadian government wanted its companies to operate according to the same standards inside and outside Canada. However, there\u2019s been no information on how it will achieve this goal.Canadian companies are not the only ones at fault. The long list of Latin American problems contributing to this situation is well known: deficient judiciary systems, rampant bribery, an urge to create employment in spite of social, economic and environmental costs.Nonetheless, the Canadian government is also responsible. Investigations by media and watchdog organizations find that Canadian authorities have vigorously backed Canadian mining companies abroad without having all the information that would guarantee the companies respect for human and environmental rights. Moreover, Canada is insisting that change is here, that the sun has come out after so many dark years of Mr. Harper\u2019s administration.Mr. Trudeau is not the first politician to face such problems. As we know, matching words to deeds is proof of great political standing. Mr. Trudeau will do well to adhere to the principles that shape his worldview.Recommendations in the reports to address the problems include a Canadian monitoring office that would have real power, the possibility of ensuring effective access to justice before Canadian institutions, allowing legal actions in Canada by individuals or groups harmed abroad to obtain justice and reparation, and an end to government sponsorship of companies involved in human rights violations.By intervening, Mr. Trudeau would defend justice, environmental care, democracy and human rights. He has the opportunity to win permanent recognition from the millions who have welcomed his commitment to global issues. To do otherwise would be a colossal disappointment.Jaime Porras Ferreyra is a writer and a consultant in international affairs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Donald Trump-Led Trip Back to the Gold-Plated \u201980s", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byInside WealthThe American wealthy are about to enjoy a giant back-to-the-1980s party, hosted by the new billionaire in chief, Donald J. Trump.From his gold-plated penthouse to his trickle-down tax cuts and his Reaganesque slogans, President-elect Trump is bringing back the \u201980s prosperity gospel. His approach to wealth harks back to the days of \u201cDynasty,\u201d DeLoreans and deficits, when the rich were admired and a former actor-turned-president restored America\u2019s optimism and global muscle.The wealthy are already partying like it\u2019s 1989. If Mr. Trump makes good on his tax cut promises, billions are expected to go back into their pockets. The stock market is reaching record highs, and sales of Picassos and Warhols are resurgent. All that is missing now is Robin Leach\u2019s \u201cChampagne wishes and caviar dreams.\u201d And Mr. Leach is optimistic.\u201cIn the next four years, it will be O.K. to be rich again,\u201d said Mr. Leach, whose hit TV show \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\u201d helped define \u201980s aspirations. \u201cThe cars will get bigger, the houses will be more luxurious, and it will be O.K. to wear jewelry and gowns again.\u201dOf course, times have changed since Gordon Gekko said that \u201cgreed, for lack of a better word, is good.\u201d In a post-Thomas Piketty world where even traditional Republicans warn about the wealth gap and the effects of globalization and technology, Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201980s blueprint may prove as outdated as shoulder pads and the Cold War. His rewards for those at the top are likely to make inequality even wider and could draw criticism from the populist voters who helped elect him.Still, Mr. Trump remains a creature of the decade that made him famous. Take his tax plan. He has proposed cutting the top rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent, cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, trimming the capital gains tax and eliminating the estate tax. These would be the largest tax cuts for the wealthy since the Reagan reductions of 1986.According to the Tax Policy Center, the after-tax incomes of middle-class and lower-income taxpayers would grow less than 2 percent under the Trump plan. The incomes of the top 1 percent of earners, by contrast, would soar about 14 percent.Put another way, nearly half of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent \u2014 recalling Reagan\u2019s trickle-down theory: Money at the top will flow down to those at the bottom.\u201cThe question is: In this economy, will that actually happen?\u201d said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Mr. Trump, of course, has invited the Reagan comparisons, borrowing Reagan\u2019s 1980 slogan \u201cLet\u2019s make America great again.\u201d And like Reagan, his combination of tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending by government could lead to higher deficits.Yet for now, Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is ushering in an \u201980s-like euphoria among the rich. Since the election, stocks have reached record highs. Strong art sales this month at Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips brought in a total of more than $1 billion. Christie\u2019s sold a de Kooning for $66.3 million (well over its estimate of $40 million) and a favorite of \u201980s collectors, a Monet, for $81.4 million.High-end real estate, which was in a slump, is also poised for growth now that a real estate developer will be in the White House.Sales of luxury goods are rising, after a slowdown in China and less conspicuous consumption put a damper on them last year. An executive with Net-a-Porter, the high-end fashion company, cited Mr. Trump\u2019s wife in the 1980s \u2014 Ivana \u2014 as a \u201ckey inspiration\u201d for some of the fall fashion lines, which emphasize \u201chard-edged, power-shoulder jackets,\u201d bouffant hair and bright lipstick.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s celebratory election dinner was an \u201980s throwback moment. Rather than heading to Maialino, Le Bernardin or any of the current power restaurants, Mr. Trump and his family opted for the \u201c21\u201d Club, a favorite haunt of the celebrities and power brokers in the 1970s and \u201980s. As he told the wealthy crowd at the restaurant, \u201cWe\u2019ll get your taxes down. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump is reluctant to give up his ultimate homage to the \u201980s: his apartment. The three-story penthouse in Trump Tower is filled with gold, marble, Greek gods painted on the ceiling and pillows embroidered with the Trump family \u201ccoat of arms.\u201d For a man who once said, \u201cPart of the beauty of me is that I am very rich,\u201d it is no wonder he is having second thoughts about leaving his Versailles in the sky for public housing on Pennsylvania Avenue.Mr. Trump\u2019s flash and dazzle stand in stark contrast to the new culture of wealth. In the \u201980s, success meant excess, bigger was better, and wealth was meant for display. Today\u2019s wealth culture, by contrast, is all about staying under the radar \u2014 jeans and sneakers instead of suits, whitewall minimalism rather than gold, and a Tesla in the garage, not a Rolls. They prefer the attention of signing the Giving Pledge to buying a megayacht.The question is whether Mr. Trump, leading by example, will make wealth glamorous again \u2014 and bring back the days of Champagne wishes and caviar dreams.\u201cThe funny thing is, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t even drink Champagne or any alcohol,\u201d Mr. Leach said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t eat caviar.\u201dROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Appraisal: Leonard Cohen, Master of Meanings and Incantatory Verse", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byMr. Cohen was aware, always, of every option.In his concerts, Mr. Cohen played the venerable sage, dapper in his suits and precisely angled hats. He was also sly and avuncular, making droll, deadpan comments in his sepulchral voice. He had aged to match the perspective he had brought to his lyrics since the late 1960s: a long view that stretched back to biblical and psychological archetypes and envisioned myth and history \u2014 and the mind-twisting economy of Zen koans \u2014 far more often than the everyday. Perhaps because he was already in his 30s when he set aside novels and poetry for songwriting, he was a grown-up from the start.Mr. Cohen was a monumentally painstaking songwriter who described, in interviews, a process of endless writing and rewriting for his lyrics. By his accounts, he tinkered with some of his songs for years on end. That meticulousness was obvious in the songs he did release, which he did in no great hurry: 14 studio albums in 49 years.Bob Dylan\u2019s semi-free associations were sometimes a too-obvious influence, particularly on Mr. Cohen\u2019s early-1970s albums, but the Cohen trademark was the knife-edged paradox, the finely balanced lyrics that can be deliberately heard (and read) in contradictory ways: reverence or blasphemy, affection or animosity, reportage or mockery, tragedy or comedy.Then, because political battles are not always physically felt, the song\u2019s catalog of betrayals veers toward the personal:\u201cEverybody knows that you\u2019ve been faithful/Ah, give or take a night or two.\u201dMr. Cohen had to cope with the limitations of his vocal cords. That\u2019s why his first exposure, with songs like the infidelity-friendship-intimacy conundrums of \u201cFamous Blue Raincoat,\u201d came via the prettier voices of singers like Judy Collins. In Mr. Cohen\u2019s early years he was a low tenor, decent enough technically and smart enough as a melody writer to keep his songs where he could sing them. On his debut album, \u201cSongs of Leonard Cohen,\u201d the producer John Simon gave Mr. Cohen exactly as much counterpoint as he needed, although Mr. Cohen complained, in a 1967 interview with The Village Voice, \u201cThey tried to make my songs into music.\u201d Later, as his voice plummeted down to a near-monotone bass register, he used the voices of women \u2014 as angels, consorts, muses, ghosts \u2014 to provide melodies around him.Yet it\u2019s inevitable that Mr. Cohen will be remembered above all for his lyrics. They are terse and acrobatic, scriptural and bawdy, vividly descriptive and enduringly ambiguous, never far from either a riddle or a punch line. \u201cThere is a crack in everything/That\u2019s how the light gets in,\u201d he advised in \u201cAnthem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Enthusiasm for Trump in Poland Is Tempered by Distrust of Putin", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byWARSAW \u2014 Europe\u2019s right-wing populists have scrambled to outdo one another in celebrating Donald J. Trump as an American president who shares many of their nationalistic, anti-immigrant attitudes. Less thrilled are the hard-liners in Poland. And the problem is Vladimir V. Putin.Even as the government may share many of Mr. Putin\u2019s conservative attitudes and nationalist impulses, Polish leaders are restrained by a deep, almost visceral distrust of him. Memories of Russian domination during the Soviet era are still raw here, and Poland has been one of the most hawkish members of the European Union on taking a hard line toward Mr. Putin.The Polish predicament is yet another reminder of how thoroughly the Trump victory has scrambled the geopolitics of Europe. His campaign remarks undercutting NATO, and suggesting that the United States could possibly walk away from the trans-Atlantic alliance, alarmed leaders in the Baltics and in Poland \u2014 even after Mr. Trump softened his remarks.Most of all, Poland and the rest of Europe will now wait and see whether the victory of Mr. Trump, who apparently has an affinity for Mr. Putin, is an opportunity for Europe, or an existential threat. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, who had already made friendly gestures toward Moscow, sees opportunity. Many Poles still see risks.\u201cWhat Poland can do is keep increasing its military capabilities, keep a low profile and just wait for Putin to show his true colors,\u201d said Jerzy Targalski, a right-wing political analyst and historian who supports the governing Law and Justice Party. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t take too long.\u201dFor now, Polish leaders have a dual-track strategy to praise Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a continuation of their own victories, focus on areas of agreement with the new American president and play down, as much as possible, disagreements over things like how to deal with Moscow.Poland\u2019s prime minister, Beata Szydlo, joined other right-wing leaders in declaring Mr. Trump\u2019s victory a validation of the rise of a more nationalistic and muscular form of government with a strong executive and resurgent patriotism.\u201cA certain era in world politics ends, an era when politics focused on elites and dealing with issues of the elites,\u201d she said. \u201cDemocracy won despite the liberal propaganda.\u201dBut at the same time, Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, was quick to add that his country still expected the United States to abide by its NATO commitments and to proceed with plans to deploy NATO troops, including thousands of Americans, this spring along the European Union\u2019s eastern flank.Poland and the Baltic States, geographically closer to Moscow, have insisted on maintaining pressure. On Thursday, Lithuania\u2019s Parliament voted almost unanimously \u2014 with just one abstention \u2014 to maintain economic sanctions as punishment for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and aggression in eastern Ukraine, for instance. On Friday, key European leaders, along with President Obama, pledged to renew those sanctions.But other, more Putin-friendly leaders have indicated they might agree to end the sanctions. Presidents who were elected just this month in Bulgaria and Moldova had talked during their campaigns about doing just that, while political leaders and analysts in Poland and elsewhere expect Mr. Trump to move quickly to negotiate a new \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Mr. Putin.They suspect Mr. Putin also wants to move swiftly, not only to end the sanctions that are squeezing his country\u2019s economy but also, perhaps, to head off that planned spring deployment of NATO troops.Polish officials have preferred to express confidence that, despite the troubling signs, the new president in the end will abide by America\u2019s NATO and European Union commitments.\u201cI think we can be confident that U.S. policy toward Poland and thus also our relations will not deteriorate, that at least they will not become weaker,\u201d Mr. Duda said after a brief phone conversation with Mr. Trump this past week. \u201cAnd maybe we will be able to strengthen them even further.\u201dPolish leaders have focused on the more welcome statements Mr. Trump has made, like his promise to try to change rules that force Poles to get visas to visit the United States, long a sore point. And they have steadfastly defended Mr. Trump from criticism in more liberal corners of Europe.As a result, the right-wing government \u2014 which has chafed under international criticism that its moves to marginalize the country\u2019s constitutional court amounted to an undemocratic attack on the rule of law \u2014 hopes that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory will create an atmosphere in which it can resolve that crisis more to Warsaw\u2019s liking.\u201cThe problem is not that there is a perception that Poland is under immediate threat from Russia,\u201d said Marek Menkiszak, head of the Russian section at the Center for Eastern Studies in Warsaw, an independent but government-funded research group. \u201cThe problem is rather this uncertainty caused by the mixed signals that have come out of the Trump team.\u201dAnd the candidate himself alternated between telling Poland that America would stand behind its ally and making comments about NATO having, perhaps, outlived its usefulness.Optimists point out that pretty much every recent American president went into office hoping to refresh relations with Moscow, only to see those efforts stall.\u201cGeorge W. Bush and Obama also announced a policy of rapprochement with Russia,\u201d said Peter Kreko, the director of the Political Capital Institute, a research group in Budapest. \u201cBut in the end, none of them succeeded.\u201dPolish officials and analysts agree, saying they hope to cement strong relations with the Trump administration \u2014 stressing shared concerns like immigration and national sovereignty \u2014 and hope Mr. Trump does not surrender too much, in the short term, in his desire for a deal with Mr. Putin.\u201cYou can\u2019t make a deal with Russia and then expect it to keep the terms of the agreement,\u201d said Mr. Targalski, the political analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s never a real partnership with Russia. It will take everything the U.S. is willing to offer, and then just keep on testing the new administration\u2019s patience.\u201dThe underlying hope, Polish officials and analysts say, is that the Donald J. Trump of the campaign \u2014 praising Mr. Putin, belittling NATO, bashing trade treaties \u2014 will be different from the Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office. Any weakening of the trans-Atlantic alliance would have a huge impact on Poland and the region, they say.\u201cBeing in this part of Europe, you depend on alliances,\u201d said Marcin Zaborowski, the executive vice president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, who leads its Warsaw office. \u201cWithout alliances, we would become the Europe of the 1930s, which did not end too well.\u201dReporting was contributed by Joanna Berendt from Warsaw, Balint Bardi from Budapest and Richard Martyn-Hemphill from Vilnius, Lithuania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Erie Went Red: The Economy Sank, and Trump Rose", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byERIE, Pa. \u2014 Sean D. Wiley recalled the moment it hit him, hard, that the people he had known all of his life and represented in the Pennsylvania State Senate were abandoning his Democratic Party.Union workers at the General Electric plant just east of here, which makes locomotives, told Mr. Wiley that they would vote for Donald J. Trump. Once Erie County\u2019s largest employer, the plant has shed thousands of $34-an-hour workers and moved production to a nonunion factory in Texas.In their desperation to hang onto jobs, General Electric\u2019s workers embraced Mr. Trump even though his pledge to tear up trade deals to rebuild American manufacturing would seem to have little to do with their own situation, with jobs moving to another state.Mr. Wiley, who lost his Senate seat in Harrisburg, the state capital, on Election Day, said he had warned voters \u201cad nauseam\u201d during the campaign that Republicans in the legislature would pass an anti-union, \u201cright-to-work\u201d law, but it was to no avail.\u201cWe have allowed the Republican Party to be the party of working families,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a sad misrepresentation of where we have been in the past.\u201dElection night maps of Pennsylvania for decades included a bright blue crescent in the upper left corner. It was Erie County, a Democratic stronghold with an industrial economy that President Obama won by 16 percentage points in 2012. But Mr. Trump flipped the county, winning by two points as he carried Pennsylvania, one of the Rust Belt dominoes whose white working-class voters came out in droves for him.\u201cMy views have realigned,\u201d said Chris Trott, 26, a small-business owner who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago, but for Mr. Trump this time. \u201cThe world has changed a lot.\u201dThe population of the city of Erie recently slid below 100,000 for the first time in nearly a century. About 10 percent of its residents are refugees, resettled with the help of local agencies and injecting new blood as the economy shifts from industry to small businesses. Still, after General Electric laid off 1,500 people this year, anxiety spiked along with the jump in unemployment, which rose to 6.4 percent from 4.5 percent.In August, more than 10,000 people filled the Erie Insurance Arena to hear Mr. Trump hammer the twin themes he effectively drove all year: that trade deals have hollowed out the United States\u2019 industrial core, and that undocumented immigrants and refugees threaten the nation\u2019s safety.Democrats here lost the messaging war about jobs; about Mr. Obama\u2019s achievements, including the Affordable Care Act, which covers 600,000 Pennsylvanians; and, especially, about Hillary Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness and her connection to the working-class Americans President Bill Clinton once viscerally inspired.\u201cErie has historically loved the Clintons,\u201d said State Representative Ryan A. Bizzarro, a Democrat who won re-election from a suburban district in the county.He was shocked by what he heard knocking on doors while campaigning this year.\u201cEvery door I\u2019d go to they\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t like Donald Trump, but I don\u2019t like Hillary,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Bizzarro, 30, a scion of a local family that owns car dealerships and includes the retired prizefighter Lou Bizzarro, who once fought Roberto Duran.\u201cThese were Democrats I was trying to get to support her,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said they didn\u2019t like her, and one of the main reasons was they felt she was not truthful. The Trump campaign effectively was able to make an issue of her supposedly being dishonest.\u201dThe fierceness of the contest here stunned people, as an old order crumbled amid angry outbursts. Signs for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were repeatedly vandalized. One Trump sign on West 38th Street was wrapped in barbed-wire coils.Lou Aliota said a large Trump/Pence sign that he erected in his yard was hit with a paintball gun and with eggs. He replaced it with a sign 15 feet high.\u201cI am ecstatic right now,\u201d Mr. Aliota, a retired pharmacist and school board member, said on Thursday. \u201cIn the next four years, you\u2019re going to see an America that is strong. That is going be a beautiful thing.\u201dOn another neighborhood street, a driver swerved onto the front lawn of the home of Betty and Gerald Hoffman to mow down their Clinton sign.\u201cI\u2019m scared to death of Trump,\u201d Ms. Hoffman said, coming to the door from watching C-SPAN, on which she said a woman was in tears over potentially losing her coverage if the health care law is repealed.Ms. Hoffman fears that a more conservative Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade. In the 1960s, she said, she was hospitalized when one of the twin fetuses she was carrying died in utero. She was told she would not live if the other were not aborted, but the Catholic hospital in which she was bedridden for 11 days refused. Her husband was told to call their three children to her bedside to say goodbye, but a doctor eventually performed the abortion, saving her life, she said. \u201cI think a woman should control her own body,\u201d she said.Mr. Trump energized plenty of hard-core supporters in Erie County. But others who voted for him said they did not much like him and had cast their votes reluctantly. Their ambivalence suggests they could turn against Mr. Trump if he does not deliver quickly on his promises.\u201cI agonized over this decision,\u201d said Mark Miller, 53, who voted for Mr. Trump but faulted the president-elect\u2019s \u201cinability to think before he speaks.\u201dHe parted ways with Mr. Trump over his call to bar refugees and deport undocumented immigrants en masse. \u201cI\u2019d like to see these people integrated into the system,\u201d said Mr. Miller, who owns a John Deere dealership. \u201cA lot of them are good, hard-working people.\u201d They live in Erie\u2019s old residential blocks of modest bungalow-style homes, and they buy chain saws and lawn mowers from Mr. Miller.Local officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s dire warnings about refugees during his visit here (\u201cTake a look at what\u2019s happening,\u201d the candidate said) hit a nerve in rural parts of the county where voters, mostly white, have less exposure to the newcomers from Nepal, Bhutan, Bosnia and, yes, Iraq and Syria.In the borough of Wesleyville, nearby the enormous General Electric locomotive plant, Jennie and Jack Chilcott, retirees, were sharing a booth at Russ\u2019 Dinor, a homey eatery that adopts the local spelling of \u201cdiner.\u201d Both are Democrats who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago.\u201cI voted for Trump because I didn\u2019t like the Democrat,\u201d said Ms. Chilcott, who retired from General Electric after 40 years. \u201cThe lies. Benghazi. The email. I just waited for her to get up there and justify everything, and she just beat around the bush about it.\u201dMr. Chilcott told his wife: \u201cShe actually did apologize. I still think she thought she was above the law.\u201dMr. Chilcott, who wore an Army veteran\u2019s cap, chose Mr. Trump \u201cfor a change,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I voted for Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought he was going to do something. He didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dMr. Chilcott was laid off after 32 years when Erie City Iron Works shut its doors in 1995, one of numerous plant closings that had more to do with the city\u2019s aging, inefficient industry than global trade deals.\u201cI was 49 and had to start all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked for half the wages and no vacation.\u201dHe said he was \u201cshocked\u201d that Mr. Trump won. He attributes it to blue-collar voters like himself, working and retired, who fear for their economic security.But he echoed the caveat a number of Republican officials uttered this year about Mr. Trump, suggesting his support from Democrats in traditional blue counties is provisional.\u201cWe didn\u2019t support him,\u201d Mr. Chilcott said. \u201cWe did vote for him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why U.K. Is Struggling to Find the Path to \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byThe document identified tensions between enthusiasts for British withdrawal, including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and those fighting to preserve closer economic ties to the bloc, such as the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The enthusiasts believe Britain has to make a clean break with the European Union, while the more cautious types want to preserve Britain\u2019s access to the European market by maintaining membership in the customs union or the single market, or perhaps some combination of the two.As Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s self-imposed deadline of March for starting negotiations on withdrawal with the European Union draws closer, this clash is emerging as the primary sticking point. But it is proving remarkably difficult to resolve.Both the customs union and the single market eliminate tariffs between member states. The customs union sets tariffs with non-European nations, so members share a common trade policy with the rest of the world. The single market removes non-tariff trade barriers, too, for instance by maintaining common product standards. Unlike most free trade deals, the single market also covers some services, which are crucial for Britain, with its big financial sector.For example, without Britain\u2019s single market membership, banks based in London (including foreign-owned ones) could not offer many services to clients in Continental nations.Norway has considerable (but not unlimited) access to the single market without being part of the European Union, or its customs union, through membership in the European Economic Area. The downside is that Norway has no vote in making rules it must follow.A maze of rules and regulations aimed at leveling the playing field and harmonizing product standards infuriates British euroskeptics and helped fuel the campaign to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.To secure full single market membership, Britain would most likely have to contribute to the European Union budget, accept the free movement of workers from the rest of the bloc, and accept rulings from the European Court of Justice or a similar body such as the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) court. That would be a tough sell to hardened supporters of Brexit in Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party.It might be. Not all members belong to the European Union; Turkey, for example, is not a European Union member but is in the customs union. Britain would be able to trade freely in goods within the union, which would free it of the burden and inefficiency of checking the origins of all the products coming to and from the bloc. But Britain would have to comply with some European Union regulations. Quitting the customs union could mean significant new tariffs, for example for British-based automakers. Consequently, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is reported to want to retain customs union membership.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.As little as possible. Accused of lacking a strategy, it refuses to give a running commentary, saying that would weaken its negotiating position. But British officials had not prepared for Brexit before the referendum and are having to examine its impact on every sector of the economy \u2014 a huge exercise. In doing so, they appear to be uncovering more questions than answers.In October, she stressed the importance of regaining control of immigration policy and of freeing Britain from the European Court of Justice \u2014 comments that suggested she was aligning herself with the proponents of a clean break. That set off a precipitous decline in the pound.But she has since tread more cautiously, saying that Britain does not face a \u201cbinary\u201d choice between maintaining a formal relationship with the European Union \u2014 either in the customs union or the single market, or some combination of the two \u2014 or a complete divorce. That implies that she wants some kind of hybrid settlement. This might mean leaving, then opting back into parts of Europe\u2019s economic arrangements, for example those that help finance and the auto industry, while offering some budget contributions in exchange.European nations are not so sure. To many it sounds like a variant of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statement that, as far as the European Union is concerned, he is pro having his cake and pro eating it. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, responded to that by inviting Mr. Johnson to undertake an experiment: \u201cBuy a cake, eat it, and see if it is still there on the plate.\u201dBritain\u2019s decision to quit the European Union was fundamentally a political one, rather than economic, so it is logical to assume that politics will shape the negotiating position of its partners, too.Many European nations will resist any agreement with Britain that undermines the bloc\u2019s fundamental principles, particularly the movement of labor, or its basic economic structures. The fear is that this would prompt other countries to copy the British, which could be the beginning of the end of the entire postwar European drive to greater integration. Though Britain is a big market, the rest of the European Union collectively is bigger, and therefore the survival of the single market of the 27 is more important to most nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Feature of the College Tour: First-Class Campus Hotels", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byIt was one of many campuses they toured on their college road trips, where the local accommodations were seldom more than utilitarian. They stayed at the Inn at Oberlin, a 70-room hotel owned by the small liberal arts college and one of the few options in town for overnight guests.\u201cIt was kind of outdated and tattered around the edges,\u2019\u2019 recalled Christian\u2019s father, Gary A. Bolles. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the process,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you expect when you\u2019re looking at colleges.\u201dOr at least it used to be. Oberlin, like many other colleges and universities around the country, has decided that campus guest quarters, instead of perfunctory, can become pampering places that help promote the institution\u2019s brand and image.\u201cIt was just a complete surprise to find such world-class accommodations,\u201d Mr. Bolles said. \u201cThe college obviously put tremendous thought into every detail, from the booking, to the front desk, to the food in the restaurant.\u201d\u201cIt ties into the boutique hotel movement,\u2019\u2019 Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThe economy has something to do with it. And the psychographics of guests has a lot to do with it.\u201dThose guests include not only parents and high school seniors but also visiting alumni, lecturers and artists, as well as sports teams and fans who buy tickets to watch those sports teams.Graduate plans to have 20 hotels near colleges or universities by 2019.Smart, in business since 2010, has opened three \u2014 near the University of Chicago, Duke University in Durham, N.C., and Emory University in Atlanta \u2014 with six others on the way.And as the number of college hotels increases, so does their quality. Witness the Hotel at Oberlin.Even guests who might be oblivious to the hotel\u2019s solar, geothermal and radiant cooling and heating systems might have trouble overlooking amenities that chain hotels would not think to offer for rooms starting at $129 a night.\u201cOne of the objectives we had going into this was communicating Oberlin\u2019s core values,\u201d said Dr. Frandsen, who put the cost of the mixed-use project that includes the hotel as well as new retail and office space at $35 million. \u201cSo if we didn\u2019t pick out the soap dishes and the picture frames, we did make a conscious decision to work with people who understood that sustainability is something we value here at Oberlin, and a big part of our story.\u201dLike other colleges that have ventured into the hospitality industry, Oberlin may be less concerned about the hotel\u2019s profitability than with the image it projects.\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of schools realizing that a hotel is a useful amenity in terms of providing a comfortable place for stakeholders and particularly alumni,\u2019\u2019 said Matthew Arrants, Pinnacle Advisory Group\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cYou want your alumni to come back so you can continue ties with them.\u201dSara Masterson, vice president of hotel management at the Olympia Companies, said her company has made a specialty of running college hotels in recent years, as the niche has developed.\u201cWe know what the college\u2019s brand represents and the fabric of their story,\u201d Ms. Masterson said. \u201cColleges have figured out that a hotel can serve as the front door and the back door for prospective students.\u201dWhether any of this will necessarily sway college-scouting families is another matter.Doug Robinson, a father of four in Basking Ridge, N.J., says he has stayed at more than 30 hotels while visiting college campuses in the last 18 months \u2014 first with a son who is now a freshman at Duke and more recently with a daughter who is a high school senior.\u201cI know the consistency,\u201d he said of the chain. \u201cPlus, they\u2019re sometimes massively cheaper.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jay W. Forrester Dies at 98; a Pioneer in Computer Models", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byJay W. Forrester, an electrical engineer whose insights into both computing and organizations more than 60 years ago gave rise to a field of computer modeling that examines the behavior of things as specific as a corporation and as broad as global growth, died on Wednesday at his home in Concord, Mass. He was 98.The cause was complications of prostate cancer, his son Nathan said.System dynamics, he once wrote, \u201cuses computer simulation to take the knowledge we already have about details in the world around us and to show why our social and physical systems behave the way they do.\u201dIt is now included in many business school curriculums, and simulation modeling has been adopted by other disciplines.\u201cSimulations of dynamic systems are now indispensable throughout the physical and social sciences,\u201d said John Sterman, the Jay W. Forrester professor of management at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \u201cNot just in management, but also, for example, in astrophysics, biology, chemistry and climate change.\u201dProfessor Forrester expanded his approach in the late 1960s to consider social problems, including urban decay. In his 1971 book \u201cWorld Dynamics,\u201d he developed global modeling, which examines population growth and industrialization in a world with finite resources.\u201cJay developed the first model that treated interactions of population, the economy, natural resources, food and pollution in the context of the world as a whole,\u201d Professor Sterman said in an interview. \u201cThe work was counterintuitive and controversial, and it launched the field of global modeling.\u201dProfessor Forrester also made significant contributions to engineering and computer science.In the 1940s, he worked on servomechanisms, which use feedback loops to maintain stability in devices like gun turrets and automobile cruise-control systems. He was also one of the inventors of magnetic core memory, an efficient form of computer memory that dominated the computer industry for more than two decades.System dynamics came to him shortly after he joined the faculty of the Sloan School, when he took on a project for General Electric. The company was grappling with big fluctuations in stock levels and work force numbers at an appliance plant in Kentucky.Professor Forrester\u2019s breakthrough came after he interviewed plant managers. He discovered that the fluctuations had been caused not by external factors, as the managers thought, but by a dynamic system of internal factors that included policies for inventory control and hiring. He then developed computer simulations of the G.E. case, planting the seeds for the field of system dynamics.His training as an engineer was pivotal to his insights into industrial processes.\u201cHere you have a man who starts as an electrical engineer, so he understands current flowing down wires and charge accumulating in capacitors,\u201d said David C. Lane, who teaches system dynamics at the Henley School of Business at the University of Reading in England. \u201cThen he moves into servomechanisms and feedback control.\u201cThen he makes this remarkable imaginative leap,\u201d Professor Lane continued, \u201cwhich is that those ideas are a way of threading together parts of a system, all connected by feedback loops. And once you start thinking like that, you\u2019ve created an entirely new way of thinking.\u201dJay Wright Forrester was born on July 14, 1918, on his family\u2019s cattle ranch, 18 miles from the nearest town, Anselmo, Neb. His parents, both of them teachers as well as ranchers, were among the first homesteaders in the area.In an interview for this obituary in 2011, Professor Forrester said that living on an isolated ranch had made him practical-minded by necessity. He brought electricity to the ranch by building a 12-volt wind generator while he was still in high school.\u201cI was generally inclined to the mechanical and electrical things,\u201d he said, \u201cand since there was no one to fix things, you did it yourself.\u201dHe took up the study of electrical engineering at the University of Nebraska after turning down a scholarship to enter its agricultural college. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever really warmed up to taking care of cattle in a Nebraska blizzard,\u201d Professor Forrester said.The laboratory did much of its work for the military during World War II, developing servomechanisms for controlling radar antennas and gun mounts.In late 1943, Professor Forrester developed a servomechanism device that would control a radar antenna for intercepting aircraft. He accompanied the device aboard the carrier Lexington and spent a month at sea as a civilian as it helped scan the horizon for torpedo bombers.After the war, while in charge of the Digital Computer Division at M.I.T.\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory, Professor Forrester embarked on the Whirlwind project, the first complete real-time computing system.The technology greatly increased computer memory capacity and remained the memory technology of choice until the early 1970s, when Intel Corporation began selling silicon-based solid-state dynamic random access memory, which could store more information in less space \u2014 and more quickly.Professor Forrester abandoned digital computing in 1956, in part because he believed that the major innovations in the field had been made.\u201cI still stand by that,\u201d he said in the 2011 interview. \u201cMore happened in percentage improvements in digital computers from 1946, when they didn\u2019t exist, to 1956, when they came into the modern era. I might not have envisioned how much smaller and faster they\u2019d be, but the fundamental logic hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dHis wife, the former Susan Swett, whom he married in 1946, died in 2010. Besides his son Nathan, he is survived by a daughter, Judith Forrester; another son, Ned; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.In the seven decades he was at M.I.T., Professor Forrester retained an engineer\u2019s curiosity about how things work, and occasionally voiced dismay that his students were not always so inclined.He recalled in 2011 that he once asked students in an engineering class if they understood how the feedback mechanism in a toilet\u2019s water tank maintained the water level.\u201cI asked them, \u2018How many of you have ever taken the lid off a toilet tank to see how it works?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cNone of them had.

{"Headline": "Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s Business Ties Viewed as Red Flag for Secretary of State Job", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rudolph W. Giuliani, facing a flood of questions about whether his business dealings should disqualify him from being named President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s secretary of state, on Tuesday defended his lucrative 15 years in the private sector as a credential for the job.\u201cI have friends all over the world,\u201d Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, said in an interview. \u201cThis is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world.\u201dAs secretary of state, Mr. Giuliani, a loyal, often ferocious backer of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, would make fighting Islamist terrorism the centerpiece of the incoming administration\u2019s foreign policy. He vaulted to national prominence because of his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and he still views foreign policy through the prism of that day.But Mr. Giuliani\u2019s business ties are a major red flag. He built a lucrative consulting and speechmaking career after leaving City Hall. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar and the Canadian company that is building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for her speeches to Goldman Sachs, as well as for contributions Qatar made to the Clinton Foundation, which he claimed betrayed her commitment to women\u2019s and gay rights because of Qatar\u2019s poor record on both.This week, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Mr. Giuliani\u2019s fitness for the job, pointing to his list of paid speeches, his work for foreign governments and his support for the Iraq war. Mr. Trump has long claimed erroneously that he opposed the war.\u201cIt is worrisome, some of the ties to foreign governments, because that was a big complaint about many of us with Hillary Clinton and her ties and the money she received from foreign governments,\u201d Mr. Paul told CNN on Tuesday.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.\u201cMy ties to them are very open,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cWe worked very hard to get them delisted \u2014 by Hillary Clinton, by the way.\u201dAnother Giuliani client, the energy company TransCanada, applied to build the Keystone XL pipeline in the United States, and was rejected last year by President Obama after a recommendation by Secretary of State John Kerry. If it decided to apply again for permission and Mr. Giuliani ended up at the State Department, the application would land on his desk.Mr. Giuliani did not address that issue directly in the interview, saying only that his firm had offered security advice to TransCanada, when it had a partnership to build a natural-gas facility on Long Island Sound. The proposal was turned down.\u201cI\u2019ve done no work on the pipeline,\u201d he said.But it is the lesser-known names that may draw the most scrutiny.TriGlobal\u2019s advisory board includes Ara Abramyan, listed on the company\u2019s website as a \u201cvery close Advisor to the Russian Government\u2019s inner circle including the President and the Prime Minister.\u201d The company\u2019s founding partners are Andrey Drobyshev, who claims to have strong relations with regional and municipal governments in Russia, and Vitaly Pruss, whose website profile says that he has focused on \u201cinternational image development and PR for Russian & Ukrainian companies\u201d and that from 2008 to 2011, he worked \u201cclosely with Giuliani Partners LLC.\u201dJeffrey Berman, one of TriGlobal\u2019s managing partners, is also vice president of Berman Enterprises, a family-run company that worked with Giuliani Partners in 2008 to form a commercial and residential real estate investment vehicle called the Berman Opportunity Fund. Its purpose was to target foreign investors looking to take advantage of the weak dollar through real estate investments in New York and Washington.Some of the parts of the government that Mr. Trump promised to dismantle if he was elected.Few public details are available about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in the real estate venture, and Mr. Berman did not return a call for comment. But some of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s work for TriGlobal, which has offices in Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine, is featured on the company\u2019s website.In 2004, for instance, the company arranged to have Mr. Giuliani come to Moscow to meet with the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, as well as other prominent Russian politicians and business executives. That year, Mr. Giuliani visited Magnitogorsk, Russia, \u201cfor a series of meetings with Viktor Rashnikov,\u201d a Russian billionaire who is the chairman of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.While Mr. Trump has vowed to bring back jobs in the United States steel industry, Russia has complained about American tariffs on steel that hurt companies like Mr. Rashnikov\u2019s. TriGlobal also arranged for Mr. Giuliani to meet with executives from the Russian steel company in the next year in New York, where they dined at the St. Regis hotel at an event attended by Bill Clinton.James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s consulting work over the last 15 years should disqualify him from taking the secretary of state job.\u201cIt creates an immediate conflict of interest with leaders of nations that he has worked with,\u201d Mr. Thurber said. \u201cPeople asked about Hillary Clinton and donations to Clinton Foundation. It is very different than being paid directly by foreign countries to represent them.\u201dMr. Giuliani, in the Tuesday interview, acknowledged that he did not view the world exactly as Mr. Trump does. He said he regarded Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has praised, as \u201ca guy who is pushing us very hard,\u201d adding: \u201cI think he needs to be pushed back. I wouldn\u2019t want to put Russia in the category of enemy \u2014 yet.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump is not going to pick anyone who agrees with him 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.He said, however, that he could not think of any disagreements with Mr. Trump\u2019s closest foreign policy adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who shares Mr. Giuliani\u2019s belief that Islamist militancy poses an existential threat. If General Flynn becomes Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, the Trump administration will almost certainly revive George W. Bush\u2019s global war on terrorism.\u201cIn my case, it might have some extra emotion because of Sept. 11,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.In one respect, experts said, Mr. Trump would be different from Mr. Bush. While Mr. Bush thought a lack of freedom caused jihadist terrorism to spread, Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani believe the fault lies in Islam itself.\u201cIt is a sea change, and it really changes the terms of the discussion about what to do about it,\u201d said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cThe ISIS Apocalypse.\u201dMark Landler and Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Jo Becker from New York.

{"Headline": "Drug Giant Faced a Reckoning as China Took Aim at Bribery", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byChina RulesSHANGHAI \u2014 Peter Humphrey was in the bathroom of his Shanghai apartment when the police kicked the door off its hinges and knocked him to the ground. Nearly two dozen officers stormed his home. They confiscated files, laptops and hard drives related to his work as a corporate investigator.Mr. Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, were taken to Building 803, a notoriously bleak criminal investigation center normally reserved for human smugglers, drug traffickers and political activists. Sleep-deprived and hungry, he was transferred later that day to a detention house, placed in a cage and strapped to an iron chair. Outside, three officers sat on a podium and demanded answers.Mr. Humphrey knew the reason for the harsh interrogation. He and Ms. Yu had been working for GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceutical maker under investigation in China for fraud and bribery.The Glaxo case, which resulted in record penalties of nearly $500 million and a string of guilty pleas by executives, upended the power dynamic in China, unveiling an increasingly assertive government determined to tighten its grip over multinationals. In the three years since the arrests, the Chinese government, under President Xi Jinping, has unleashed the full force of the country\u2019s authoritarian system, as part of a broader agenda of economic nationalism.Driven by the quest for profits, many multinationals pushed the limits in China, lulled into a sense of complacency by lax officials who eagerly welcomed overseas money. Glaxo took it to the extreme, allowing corruption to fester.When bribery accusations surfaced, the company followed the old playbook, missing the seismic changes reshaping the Chinese market. Rather than fess up, Glaxo tried to play down the issues and discredit its accusers \u2014 figuring officials wouldn\u2019t pay attention.Along the way, there were bribes of iPads, a mysterious sex tape and the corporate investigator, who gave his operations secret code names. The company\u2019s missteps are laid bare in emails, confidential corporate documents and other evidence obtained by The New York Times, as well as in interviews with dozens of executives, regulators and lawyers involved in the case.The crackdown has prompted a complete rethinking for Glaxo \u2014 and for much of the pharmaceutical industry. To appease the government, drug makers have promised to lower prices and overhaul sales practices.\u201cFor a long time, there\u2019d been this policy of going easy on foreign enterprises,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, a longtime legal adviser to Western companies. \u201cThe government didn\u2019t want to cause embarrassment or give outsiders the impression that China is plagued with corruption. But they\u2019re not thinking like that anymore.\u201dThe Glaxo case was fueled by missed clues, poor communication and a willful avoidance of the facts. For more than a year, the drug maker brushed aside repeated warnings from a whistle-blower about systemic fraud and corruption in its China operations.The company\u2019s internal controls were not robust enough to prevent the fraud, or even to find it. Internally, the whistle-blower allegations were dismissed as a \u201csmear campaign,\u201d according to a confidential company report obtained by The Times.Glaxo just wanted to make its problems go away. It offered bribes to regulators. It retaliated against the suspected whistle-blower. It hired Mr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu to dig into the woman\u2019s background, family and government ties, as a way to discredit her. And Glaxo may even have gone after the wrong person, documents and emails obtained by The Times suggest.None of it mattered. The allegations were true.Prosecutors charged the global drug giant with giving kickbacks to doctors and hospital workers who prescribed its medicines. In 2014 Glaxo paid a nearly $500 million fine, at the time the largest ever in China for a multinational. Five senior executives in China pleaded guilty, including the head of Glaxo\u2019s Chinese operations, a British national, in a rare prosecution of a Western executive. With Glaxo embroiled in scandal, sales plummeted in China, the company\u2019s fastest-growing market.Glaxo has declined multiple requests for comment, referring instead to earlier statements. Glaxo \u201cfully accepts the facts and evidence of the investigation, and the verdict of the Chinese judicial authorities,\u201d one statement read. \u201cGSK P.L.C. sincerely apologizes to the Chinese patients, doctors and hospitals, and to the Chinese government and the Chinese people.\u201dMr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu, both in their late 50s at the time of their arrests, were punished too. The couple spent two years in prison for illegally obtaining government records on individuals.Mr. Humphrey was crowded into a cell with a dozen other inmates. There were no beds or other furniture, just an open toilet and a neon light overhead. During his incarceration, Mr. Humphrey said, he suffered back pain, a hernia and a prostate problem that was later diagnosed as cancer.\u201cI was in a state of complete shock and breakdown,\u201d said Mr. Humphrey, who was released along with his wife in July 2015. \u201cI was physically broken down and mentally blown away. I didn\u2019t sleep for 45 days.\u201dAn anonymous 5,200-word email in January 2013 to the Glaxo board laid out a detailed map to a fraud in the Chinese operations.Written in perfect English, the email was organized like a corporate memo. Under the header \u201cConference Trip Vacations for Doctors,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote that medical professionals received all-expenses-paid trips under the guise of attending international conferences. The company covered the costs of airline tickets and hotel rooms, and handed out cash for meals and sightseeing excursions.In a section labeled \u201cGSK Falsified Its Books and Records to Conceal Its Illegal Marketing Practices in China,\u201d the email explained how Glaxo was pitching drugs for unapproved uses. As an example, the whistle-blower said the drug Lamictal had been aggressively promoted as a treatment for bipolar disorder, even though it had been approved in China only for epilepsy.Glaxo \u201calmost killed one patient by illegally marketing its drug Lamictal,\u201d said the email, which was obtained by The Times. \u201cGSK China bought the patient\u2019s silence for $9,000.\u201dThe email was one of nearly two dozen that the whistle-blower sent over the course of 17 months to Chinese regulators, Glaxo executives and the company\u2019s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers.When the authorities pressed Glaxo, the company was dismissive. It failed to properly investigate the allegations. It didn\u2019t beef up its internal controls. And it didn\u2019t change its marketing practices.The decision was calculated. In the decades since China began opening its economy, most multinationals had avoided scrutiny over bribery. China needed overseas companies to help develop its economy, by setting up manufacturing operations and creating jobs. The authorities were reluctant to jeopardize investment, so they took a softer approach to enforcement.When companies did run into trouble, fines were tiny. The rare cases tended to be colored by politics. Seven years ago, the Chinese authorities detained executives from the global mining giant Rio Tinto on suspicion of stealing state secrets. The charges were eventually downgraded to bribery and theft of commercial secrets, and the company avoided punishment.By the time Glaxo\u2019s fraud bubbled to the surface, China had changed.Over the last decade, China has emerged as an economic powerhouse, but it took off even more as the rest of the world slowed after the financial crisis. That gave China the upper hand with overseas companies, which were increasingly dependent on profits from the country\u2019s growing consumer base.The economic might coincided with the Communist Party\u2019s increasingly nationalistic stance. The authorities in China, already undertaking a severe crackdown on Chinese companies, wanted to show that, like American regulators, they could also penalize and sanction global companies.And it was no secret that big drug makers were violating the law in China.Years earlier, the consulting firm Deloitte warned about rampant corruption in China\u2019s pharmaceutical market. As Deloitte found, doctors and health care workers were poorly compensated, so they could easily be induced to write more prescriptions with offers of cash, gifts, vacations and other benefits. Big drug makers, eager for growth, willingly obliged.\u201cThe remarkable thing is that China is a more hospitable environment to this type of corruption, because it\u2019s a market where doctors and hospitals are heavily reliant on drug sales,\u201d said Dali Yang, who teaches at the University of Chicago and has studied the industry. \u201cThey were like fish swimming in water.\u201dAmerican investigators had punished several major drug companies for such behavior abroad. In 2012, Eli Lilly agreed to pay $29 million, and Pfizer $45 million, to settle allegations that included employees\u2019 bribing doctors in China. In settling the cases, neither company admitted or denied the allegations.That summer, Glaxo agreed to pay $3 billion in fines and pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States for marketing antidepressants for unapproved uses, failing to report safety data on a diabetes drug and paying kickbacks. The case was built off tips from several whistle-blowers.After that, Glaxo\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Witty, pledged, \u201cWe\u2019re determined this is never going to happen again.\u201dBut it did \u2014 in China.In early 2013, Glaxo realized it couldn\u2019t ignore the problems. The authorities were asking questions. The whistle-blower continued to send emails.So the company tried another common gambit in China: bribing officials.The company set up a special \u201ccrisis management\u201d team in China and began offering money and gifts to regulators.That strategy had worked in the past. A company, often using a middleman, would try to soothe officials and regulators, offering gifts and favors.One government agency had received multiple emails from the whistle-blower, and Glaxo targeted multiple branches of the agency, according to state media reports. One executive tried to cozy up to a Shanghai investigator with an iPad and a dinner totaling $1,200, another Glaxo employee said in a statement to the police. When that executive asked for money to bribe the Beijing branch, Mark Reilly, the head of the company\u2019s Chinese operations, gave the \u201cgo ahead.\u201dAnother executive with Glaxo\u2019s Chinese operations bribed regulators to focus on \u201cunequal competition,\u201d rather than a more punitive investigation into \u201ccommercial bribery.\u201d The goal, that executive admitted in a statement, was to limit any potential fine to about $50,000. It didn\u2019t work.As pressure mounted, the case took a bizarre turn, setting Glaxo on a collision course with the government.In March 2013, Glaxo\u2019s chief executive and five other senior executives in the company\u2019s London headquarters received an anonymous email with a media file. In it, a grainy video showed Mr. Reilly, the executive in China, engaged in a sexual act with a young Chinese woman.The attached email alleged that Mr. Reilly, a British national who had helped manage the company\u2019s China operation for four years, was complicit in a bribery scheme tied to a travel agency called China Comfort Travel, or C.C.T. According to the email, Glaxo funneled money through the travel agency to pay off doctors. The travel agency also supplied Mr. Reilly with women, as a way to secure that business.\u201cIn order to acquire more business, C.C.T. bribed Mark Reilly, the general manager of GSK (China) with sex,\u201d the email said. \u201cMark Reilly accepted this bribery and made C.C.T. get the maximized benefits in return.\u201dGlaxo later discovered that the video had been shot clandestinely, in the bedroom of Mr. Reilly\u2019s apartment in Shanghai. Analysts working for the company said it had been edited to disguise the location.Glaxo executives in London were shocked. They deemed the video a serious breach of privacy, involving a possible break-in at the home of a senior executive in China. Mr. Reilly moved to a more secure residence.Like many global companies, Glaxo has a code of conduct that encourages employees to report fraud or wrongdoing without fear of retaliation by the company. In many countries, including China, the rights of whistle-blowers are protected by law.Glaxo didn\u2019t seem to care.By the time the video surfaced, Glaxo already had its suspicions about the identity of the whistle-blower. Months earlier, the company had fired Vivian Shi, a 47-year-old executive handling government affairs in Glaxo\u2019s Shanghai office. The official reason for Ms. Shi\u2019s firing was falsifying travel expenses. In fact, she was dismissed because the company believed she was the whistle-blower, according to confidential corporate documents obtained by The Times.Ms. Shi did not return multiple calls for comment.After receiving the video, Glaxo took more aggressive action, seeking to discredit Ms. Shi, who had already left the company.At that point, in the spring of 2013, the company turned to Mr. Humphrey, the investigator. He ran ChinaWhys, a small risk consultancy firm that advised global companies like Dell and Dow Chemical.His firm was engaged in what he called \u201cdiscreet investigations,\u201d helping multinationals cope with difficult situations like counterfeiting and embezzlement. Short in stature, with a shock of white hair, Mr. Humphrey portrayed himself as a kind of modern-day Sherlock Holmes.\u201cHe likes a good adventure and likes solving cases,\u201d said his friend Stuart Lindley, who runs a financial services company in China. \u201cBut he was definitely aware that some of that stuff was risky.\u201dIn April 2013, Mr. Reilly met with Mr. Humphrey at Glaxo\u2019s glass office tower near People\u2019s Square in central Shanghai. According to meeting notes obtained by The Times, they discussed the emails, the sex video and Ms. Shi, the suspected whistle-blower. Mr. Reilly told the investigator that she held a grudge against Glaxo.At the meeting, Mr. Reilly asked the investigator to look into the break-in at his apartment. But he made clear that he also wanted to assess what power and influence Ms. Shi might have with the government.Legal experts say Mr. Reilly should not have been put in charge.\u201cThe executive so accused has an obvious conflict of interest in overseeing such an investigation,\u201d said John Coates, a Harvard Law School professor. \u201cEven if the executive were entirely innocent of the whistle-blower\u2019s charge, giving that same executive the role of investigating the whistle-blower smacks of retaliation.\u201dEfforts to reach Mr. Reilly, who has since left the company, were unsuccessful.Using the code name Project Scorpion, Mr. Humphrey and his staff spent the next six weeks working undercover, gathering evidence. They visited Lanson Place, the upscale apartment complex where Mr. Reilly lived when the sex tape was made. They created a dossier on the suspected whistle-blower, searching for motives and ties to high-ranking officials or regulators. They interviewed former co-workers, scrutinized her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and scoured the web for information about her father, a former health official.Glaxo may have crossed a line in this regard, putting the company more sharply in the government\u2019s sights.As part of the investigation, Mr. Humphrey turned to a Chinese detective to acquire a copy of Ms. Shi\u2019s household registration record, or hukou. The official document contained information about her husband and daughter. The authorities had warned private detectives about acquiring confidential government documents.\u201cThis type of household information is supposed to be private,\u201d said John Huang, a former government official who is now managing partner at McDermott, Will & Emery in Shanghai. \u201cBut people were buying and selling it.\u201dGlaxo got little payoff from the investigation.On June 6, 2013, Mr. Humphrey delivered a 39-page report to Glaxo that said Ms. Shi was probably the whistle-blower and even had a \u201ctrack record of staging similar attacks\u201d at a previous job. But the report included no evidence linking her to the emails or the sex video, according to a draft obtained by The Times.Glaxo\u2019s strategy of bribery and discrediting ultimately failed.With the Chinese government in the midst of a crackdown on corruption, the police carried out a series of raids on June 27, 2013. They seized files and laptops from multiple Glaxo offices and interrogated dozens of employees. In Shanghai, four senior executives were detained. Investigators also raided the offices of several travel agencies that had worked closely with Glaxo, including China Comfort Travel.A week later, the police stormed Mr. Humphrey\u2019s apartment in Shanghai. He and his wife were charged with violating privacy laws.Mr. Humphrey declined to comment on the specifics of the Glaxo case. His son defended his work, saying Glaxo engaged him \u201cunder false pretenses.\u201d \u201cMy father is an honorable and law-abiding man,\u201d said the son, Harvard Humphrey.When prosecutors announced the case against Glaxo in July 2013, several weeks after arrests began, their allegations closely mirrored those of the whistle-blower. They described an elaborate scheme to bribe doctors and workers at government-owned hospitals using cash that had been funneled through a network of 700 travel agencies and consulting firms.\u201cIt\u2019s like a criminal organization: There\u2019s always a boss, and in this case GSK is the boss,\u201d said Gao Feng, one of the lead investigators.Glaxo said little about the developments until July 15, when several high-ranking executives confessed from prison on state-run television. After that, the company capitulated, issuing a blanket statement for its misdeeds: \u201cThese allegations are shameful and we regret this has occurred.\u201dDressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Mr. Reilly, the Glaxo executive, was led in handcuffs into a small courtroom in the city of Changsha, in central China, in September 2014. With security guards behind him, he stood alongside four other senior Glaxo executives as a judge read the charges.\u201cThe defendant company GSKCI is guilty of bribing nongovernment personnel and will be fined 3 billion yuan,\u201d the judge, Wu Jixiang, said sternly, referring to Glaxo\u2019s Chinese name. The company and the executives, having confessed, were given relatively light sentences, the court said.Mark Reilly was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to be expelled from China.After handing down that sentence, the judge turned to Mr. Reilly.\u201cDo you obey the court\u2019s verdict? Do you appeal?\u201d he asked.Mr. Reilly said that he would not challenge the verdict. Because he was swiftly deported, he will not serve prison time in China.Glaxo is still trying to clean up the mess.In China, Glaxo has promised to overhaul its operations and has put in place stricter compliance procedures. The company has changed the way its sales force is compensated and has eliminated the use of outside travel agencies.Glaxo has also tightened oversight of expenses and cash advances, areas central to the case. Employees must now send in photographs of the guests and food, to verify that the meetings took place.And in August 2015, Glaxo tried to make amends by rehiring Ms. Shi, an acknowledgment that the company had erred in firing an employee suspected of being a whistle-blower.But the decision also hinted at a more troubling admission \u2014 that Glaxo had targeted the wrong person. There are indications that Ms. Shi was not the whistle-blower, and that there may have been more than one person.The emails sent to regulators were written in fluent English and came mostly from a Gmail account. The email with the sex video came from a local Chinese account and was written in poor English. The only similarity was the anonymity.The Times sent emails to both accounts and got a response from just one, the person who had written the detailed emails to the Chinese authorities and Glaxo. \u201cYou have reached who you are looking for,\u201d the person replied.In a series of exchanges, the author denied being Ms. Shi, acting in concert with her or sending the video. The person said Glaxo had erroneously blamed Ms. Shi for the emails and never found the actual whistle-blower.The Times was unable to verify the identity of the person, who described working in Shanghai but declined to come forward for fear of retribution.\u201cI didn\u2019t reveal to GSK personnel that I was the whistle-blower because doing so would have placed me in potential physical jeopardy,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote in an email to The Times. \u201cYou understand that criminals \u2014 you know that they were convicted later in Chinese courts \u2014 were in charge of GSK China at that time, and I truly believe that they would have harmed me in some fashion had they discovered my identity. \u201dAn article on Wednesday about a crackdown on corruption in China that ensnared the drug maker GlaxoSmithKline referred incompletely to charges faced by the mining company Rio Tinto seven years ago, when China took a softer approach to enforcement. They were downgraded to bribery and theft of commercial secrets, not bribery alone.Advertisement"}

An hour later, the response had changed: \u201cPressing the worry button now.\u201d I got off work at midnight, and listened to the radio as I drove home. It was by then Nov. 9, and the election was coming to an end. But it didn\u2019t hit me until I saw my mom.When I got home, she was awake and watching the television, her face paralyzed by distress. I realized we were in trouble.I have lived in the United States as long as I can remember, but I am undocumented, Mexican by birth. My parents came to the United States because my father was in danger. He served in the Mexican military, but was scapegoated for leaked information and could have been killed. My parents decided to leave for California in 1997, and a year later, my sister and I, ages 5 and 2, joined them.My parents scraped by selling tamales in the streets of Los Angeles, and my sister and I grew up as Californians. But there was always a huge difference between us and many of our classmates. After my sister graduated, she returned to Mexico because she couldn\u2019t see a future here, blocked from pursuing higher education and a job. Her absence has been extremely painful for my family. We haven\u2019t seen her in five years.Still in high school, I thought I would have to follow her, but the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order issued by President Obama in 2012 changed my life. It allowed me to work provisionally in the United States and even qualify for college scholarships. Most important, I was protected from deportation. Around the same time, progressive states like California began to implement laws that provided access to higher education and employment. I started to dream about stability, about a secure life in the United States.But then a gang member threatened my father, and my parents had no choice but to move or risk being killed. They left for Indiana, where my aunt lives, and she helped them start over again. I decided to stay in California where there was more opportunity for undocumented people, so I said goodbye.I fell into a routine of working and going to high school. I was making enough to make ends meet, thanks to a kind landlord who kept my rent cheap. But I couldn\u2019t keep my grades up while I was working more than 40 hours a week. Finally, after four years apart from my family, I joined them in Indiana.Things started looking up: I found a well-paying job at a convenience store chain and started to attend Ivy Tech Community College, where I became the vice president of the student government. I noticed an immense difference because of being closer to my family. I was doing better. I got my own car and raised my grades to a 3.5 G.P.A.Now, with Donald Trump soon to be president, I\u2019m uncertain of any protection for what my family has built, let alone for the future of so many families like ours. His election legitimizes discrimination against, and the dehumanization of, the entire undocumented community. I\u2019m worried about my work permit. I worry about violence and the deportation of my parents and myself. I worry that my two younger siblings \u2014 both U.S. citizens \u2014 will be separated from my parents.But a Republican-run House, Senate and executive branch, and a Supreme Court that may soon have a conservative majority, may approve similar anti-immigration laws that will make conditions in the United States unbearable for many families. I fear that all the hard-won progress to create a friendly country for immigrants will be destroyed, and the federal government will forgo any initiatives to establish a path to citizenship.I am trying to remain hopeful. The next four years will be difficult for many groups \u2014 not just undocumented immigrants but also women, black and L.G.B.T. communities, and Muslims. We can coalesce around one another. Progress is made by resisting, and pushing back, by holding on to hope and building resilience. Immigrants are here to stay. So we will wait for Mr. Trump\u2019s next move, hold our lawmakers accountable and fight back.Miguel Molina is a student at Ivy Tech Community College.Advertisement"}

They want to stem overuse of the earth\u2019s resources. And they feel compelled to put pressure on companies that violate workers\u2019 rights.That explains why Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing has become so popular in the past couple of years. Wealthy investors are flocking to financial products that take into account the ethics, social responsibility, corporate governance and environmental records of the companies they invest in.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge increasing interest in responsible investing,\u201d said Janine Guilliot, director of capital markets policy and outreach for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a San Francisco organization working to develop ways companies can report their sustainability efforts. ESG investing is growing as more investors adopt the philosophy that investments should not only create value, but also reflect their values. Just as some consumers may avoid shopping at companies with large carbon footprints or poor workplace safety records, investors are harnessing their power to influence positive changes when picking their portfolios.And while there once was a fear that ESG investing could be a costly decision, investors now see growing evidence that they don\u2019t have to sacrifice good returns for good deeds. On the contrary, according to a 2015 analysis by the University of Oxford and Arabesque Asset Management, 80 percent of academic studies found that the stocks of companies with \u201cgood sustainability practices\u201d do better than other stocks.Investors are demanding companies prove they can do more than deliver big returns.

{"Headline": "Why Japan\u2019s Economy Posted Surprisingly Strong Growth", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Japanese economic growth accelerated strongly in the third quarter. Japan has the world\u2019s third-largest economy, but it has been struggling to lift a lackluster growth rate and escape the trap of deflation \u2014 sagging consumer prices associated with weak output and declining living standards. So what went right last quarter? And will it last?Japanese gross domestic product increased by 2.2 percent in annualized terms in the three months through September, the Cabinet Office said in a preliminary estimate. That counts as rip-roaring growth in normally sluggish Japan. The country has averaged less than 1 percent over the last two decades. The growth rate more than doubled compared with the second quarter and was more than twice as high as the average forecast by economists.Foreigners. Exports accounted for by far the largest share of the increased output, according to the Cabinet Office data. They surged 8.1 percent in annualized terms, while other important parts of the economy barely budged. Domestic consumer spending, the biggest component of G.D.P., rose just 0.2 percent. Business investment ticked up by a meager 0.1 percent. By contrast, a rosier economic picture overseas helped exporters: The American economy grew robustly in the quarter, while a slowdown in China appears to have eased. A weaker yen probably helped, too. The Japanese currency had been gaining strength this year \u2014 bad news for companies selling in dollars or euros \u2014 but it has eased off again since August.Government spending took a back seat last quarter. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has introduced a number of stimulus programs during his nearly four years in office, but the latest one \u2014 announced in September and worth 28 trillion yen, or about $260 billion, over several years, according to government calculations \u2014 will not kick in until next year, and public investment actually declined last quarter. More broadly, Japanese officials have started to re-examine a stimulus strategy that has relied heavily on the central bank. The bank\u2019s ultraloose monetary policy has kept borrowing costs down, but so far that has not translated into much new spending by consumers or businesses.Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist views have alarmed Japanese government officials and business leaders. On the campaign trail, he often lashed out at Japan as a country where the United States gets \u201ckilled on trade,\u201d though he saved specific threats to retaliate by increasing tariffs for Mexico and China. Mr. Trump also accused Japan of keeping the yen artificially cheap, which could make it awkward for Japan to take financial steps that might be seen as influencing the currency market. On the upside, Mr. Trump has promised to spend big on infrastructure in the United States. If he follows through, that could lift the American economy \u2014 and by extension, demand for Japanese and other foreign goods. That is why Japan\u2019s stock market has risen since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Earth Isn\u2019t Doomed Yet. The Climate Could Survive Trump Policies.", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs the battle to contain global warming now lost?During the campaign, the president-elect of the world\u2019s second largest polluter claimed that climate change is a hoax, threatened to drop the Paris accord, committed to kill the Clean Power Plan at the center of President Obama\u2019s emissions reduction strategy, and promised a new dawn for the fossil fuel industry.Don\u2019t give up just yet. True, international diplomacy will become more difficult as China and India weigh their own energy policy commitments in the light of the possibility that the United States will walk away from its promises. But President Trump\u2019s climate policy \u2014 or his lack of one \u2014 could work out in surprising ways.It\u2019s certainly possible that a Trump administration will drop the Clean Power Plan and renege on the Paris accord. But as long as it keeps the nation\u2019s nuclear power plants online, continues tax incentives for wind and solar energy and stays out of the way of the shale energy revolution, Ms. Lovering and Mr. Nordhaus write, \u201cthe U.S. might outperform the commitments that the Obama administration made in Paris.\u201dFor all his promises to bring back coal jobs in Appalachia, Mr. Trump might be drawn in a different direction by his own objectives of promoting natural gas and achieving energy independence. If he gives those goals high priority, he could well end up pursuing policies that would ultimately lower carbon emissions.Striking a meaningful deal on climate has proved an elusive goal. The first try, in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, committed advanced nations to reduce emissions between 1990 and 2010. But they actually achieved more in terms of reducing dependency on fossil fuels in the decade before the agreement than in the decade after.If the Kyoto target survived, it was only because of other forces: First, the collapse of the Soviet bloc wiped out a lot of European carbon emissions along with the decrepit Eastern European industrial base; then the global downturn that started in 2008 reduced carbon emissions along with economic growth.Even the most aggressive proposals by the Obama administration probably packed less punch than supporters believe. President Obama\u2019s original cap-and-trade bill, which was blocked in the Senate in 2009, proposed emissions limits that were higher than what emissions have turned out to be. The steep decline was driven not just by the recession and slow recovery, but also by the wholesale move by the power sector over the last decade from coal to less polluting natural gas.As Robert Stavins of Harvard University put it, \u201cThe most important factor in terms of carbon emissions in the United States is the price of natural gas.\u201dAnd for all the hand-wringing over the future of the Clean Power Plan, its demise might not even make that much of a difference. The shift from coal to gas will continue to happen anyway.Of course, President Trump could do much more than simply stopping the Clean Power Plan, especially if he had eight years to work with. But why would he do that?This is not to say that the world could survive forever an American administration that doesn\u2019t believe in climate change and does nothing to contain it.According to the International Energy Agency, the commitments made in Paris will cap the growth of greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2040 to 13 percent. The 450 p.p.m. target requires them to fall by 43 percent. Getting there will require rich countries like the United States to help finance much of the transition for poor countries. The role of global diplomacy will rise.\u201cIt will be a big deal that will affect economic growth and jobs,\u201d said David Victor of the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cWe need a strategy to assure countries that their economic competitors are undertaking similar types of policies.\u201dFor this to work, the United States, as the dominant economic player, must play ball. Simply pursuing energy independence will not go far enough.In four years, the United States might have an administration that is less hostile to the concept of climate change. In any case, the rationale for policies to support low- and no-carbon energy sources will be even stronger then than it is today.\u201cIf a Trump administration lasts only four years, the process could maybe absorb that,\u201d said Oliver Geden, head of research at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.The bomb is ticking, but the world still has some time.An earlier version of a picture caption misstated where voters favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton 4 to 1.

The students, who were considering an English-language program beginning in January as a precursor to fall enrollment, have still not submitted their documents, he said.Officials at Ohio State University said it was too early to tell whether the election result would affect international applications, adding that there had been an increase so far this year, although most were received before Election Day.International education experts first raised concerns in May about the election of Mr. Trump, when a study was presented at a meeting of Nafsa: Association of International Educators indicating that a Trump presidency could dissuade international students from coming to the United States.The study, by Intead and FPP EDU Media, two companies specializing in international student recruitment for colleges, found that 60 percent of international prospective students would be less likely to attend a college in the United States if Mr. Trump were elected. \u201cWe were really surprised, if not shocked, by the results,\u201d said Benjamin Waxman, the chief executive of Intead.More recently, international education experts who have been in China and India \u2014 the two biggest feeder countries to American colleges \u2014 also said they were seeing postelection jitters.Andrew Chen, the chief development officer at WholeRen, an international education consulting company in Pittsburgh, returned to the United States this week from China, where, he said, colleges in other countries were trying to capitalize on fears over Mr. Trump.\u201cMany organizations and programs are starting to use this to promote education in the U.K., Australia and Singapore,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThese competitors paint the U.S. as not safe. Now, with Trump, they\u2019re saying it\u2019s going to be unfriendly.\u201dBut Mr. Chen said he believed the fears of international students were unfounded. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like refugees from the Middle East, and he said for all Muslims he wanted to do a background check,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cAnd also people from Mexico. He doesn\u2019t like those people.\u201dMr. Chen added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he ever said he doesn\u2019t like international students who pay tuition to study in the U.S.\u201dRahul Choudaha, an international education consultant in New Jersey, has been traveling for the past week in India, where he said there was a palpable worry among students and their parents.\u201cThey are not seeing the United States as a safe destination,\u201d said Mr. Choudaha, a founder of interEdge, a company that helps international students. \u201cThey\u2019re changing the destination to Australia or Singapore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an anti-immigrant tone,\u201d he added. \u201cJust stylistically, he seems to be a very different person than people thought would be taking leadership in America.\u201dAs she prepared her applications to prestigious American universities, Naina Lavakare, a senior at the British School in New Delhi, developed a Plan B.\u201cIt was a family joke,\u201d said Ms. Lavakare\u2019s mother, Jyoti Pande. \u201cYou can apply anywhere you want. However, if it\u2019s Trump in the White House, we\u2019re not sure we want to send you to the U.S.\u201dMs. Lavakare, 17, has adjusted her college aspirations. While she still has several American colleges on her list \u2014 in New York, California and Rhode Island \u2014 she dropped universities in \u201cred states\u201d to focus on colleges in Britain and Canada, her mother said, because she was concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant talk.Ms. Lavakare and her friends, Ms. Pande said, \u201cview Trump as a bigot and a misogynist.\u201d She added, \u201cI think that is what is freaking them out more than anything else.\u201dNida Najar reported from New Delhi, and Stephanie Saul from New York.

{"Headline": "Clinton Forwarded Daughter Email Chain Most Likely About Climate Talks", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Clinton forwarded a chain of emails in 2009 to her daughter, Chelsea, that included information, most likely about climate talks, that the State Department later declared to be classified, according to a new batch of emails released on Friday.The email chain was among thousands of messages that the F.B.I. uncovered as part of its yearlong investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information on the private email server she used while secretary of state.The State Department had previously released parts of the chain \u2014 which involved senior members of the White House, Treasury Department and State Department \u2014 with the information entirely redacted. The disclosure on Friday appeared to be the first to show that Mrs. Clinton had forwarded information of a delicate nature to her daughter, who had an email address on her server under a pseudonym.The chain released on Friday began with an email, dated Dec. 19, 2009, with the subject line \u201cUpdate,\u201d from Michael B. Froman, then a deputy for economic affairs on the National Security Council. It was not marked classified at the time and was sent on the government\u2019s unclassified networks.Like information in more than 2,000 other emails that have been made public, two of the notes in the chain were \u201cupgraded\u201d by the State Department \u2014 on the grounds that they contained information classified at the lowest level, \u201cconfidential\u201d \u2014 when they were released last October. The newest link in the chain was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s forwarding of the note to her daughter, who used an email address under the name Diane Reynolds. \u201cSee below,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote.Even if the information was not classified at the time, it would be unusual for an exchange among senior officials to be forwarded to someone outside the government, even a close relative. Steven Aftergood, an expert on secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said it was difficult to say whether it was inappropriate without knowing the information contained in the chain.A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, Brian Fallon, responded to questions about the email chain with a statement noting only that the State Department had changed the classification of the information when it was prepared for release last year.The forwarded chain was among 431 emails sent either to or from Mrs. Clinton, totaling more than 1,500 pages, that the State Department released over two days this week. A federal court ordered the State Department to produce the new emails \u2014 many of which are duplicates of previously released emails \u2014 on a rolling basis both before and after the election.A majority of the new emails reflected routine scheduling matters, but others offered granular and occasionally interesting details of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state. Ms. Abedin\u2019s husband factored into an exchange in 2010, in which she discussed sending a \u201csecure\u201d phone via FedEx to Mrs. Clinton or finding another solution. \u201cMaybe one of Anthony\u2019s trusted staff could deliver secure phone,\u201d Mrs. Clinton suggested.After that email was released on Thursday, the State Department issued a statement saying that a phone configured to handle secure communications could in some circumstances be sent by courier or through commercial delivery companies.Michael Short of the Republican National Committee said in a statement that the hundreds of emails now deemed to have classified information were \u201ca stark reminder\u201d of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201creckless conduct that jeopardized our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts.\u201dMark Landler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Powering Australia\u2019s Economic Surge", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 If you were designing a nation from scratch, it would look something like Australia. A Eurasian people, boring politicians, and an economy that virtually runs itself.Australia, uniquely, has avoided every major shock of modern globalization. Its economy mostly kept growing through the Asian financial crisis in the late-1990s, the tech crash at the turn of the millennium and the global financial crisis of 2008.While other wealthy nations struggle to define their purpose, Australia has unlocked the secret to its next wave of prosperity. The key is the very thing that intimidates the United States, Britain and most of Europe: large-scale immigration.Led by students from India and young professionals from China, new arrivals have managed to extend Australia\u2019s winning streak for longer than any policy maker imagined.It has been 25 years since the last recession in Australia. This growth period can be divided into three distinct phases.The first phase, from 1991 to the end of the decade, was hard-earned. It was driven by the surge in productivity from the economic reforms of the 1980s and early 1990s but left many people behind. The second phase, from 2003 to 2008, didn\u2019t require as much effort. China set off the greatest mining boom in modern Australian history, and income flowed freely. But this proved to be a short phase in the long-growth period. It ended with the financial crisis.Before the market-based reforms of the mid-1980s, Australia was one of the most regulated economies in the world, and the inflexibility of the system made it vulnerable to global setbacks. A collapse in Australian export prices would herald a deep recession.History didn\u2019t repeat itself at the end of this mining boom because the open economy was able to quickly tap a new source of growth through immigration. The reforms \u2014 initiated by the Labor governments of former prime ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating \u2014 gave up political control of the Australian dollar, interest rates and wages and removed the tariff wall. They were balanced with universal health care and a high minimum wage.Subsequent conservative and Labor governments then adapted the program to immigration policy \u2014 and this explains the third phase of Australia\u2019s remarkable 25-year run of growth. Since 2001, governments have largely let the market decide whom to bring into the country.They did this by declaring a preference for skilled immigration over family reunion when granting permanent settlement. Twenty years ago, only 30 percent of immigrants were skilled. Today they account for 70 percent of a much larger number. A second group of immigrants was recruited through temporary visas: students, holiday makers and workers on short-term contracts. Australia now has about 750,000 people on temporary work visas, according to my research, accounting for 7 percent of the nation\u2019s work force.Both doors, for permanent and temporary immigrants, remained open throughout the financial crisis. Around half of the 190,000 permanent settlers in Australia each year are from the existing pool of temporary-visa holders.The economist Bob Gregory calculates that almost all of the additional full-time jobs created since 2008 have gone to overseas-born workers. Many of those immigrants are in the professional work force, including accountants, architects, computer programmers, doctors and scientific researchers.The surge in immigration has allowed Australia to continue to climb the income ladder when most other rich nations have been losing ground. In 2001, Australia was the 15th largest economy in the world. Today it is 13th.In doubling the number of immigrants it receives each year, the country has transformed its ethnic face, from predominantly white to Eurasian. Fifteen years ago, migrants accounted for 23 percent of the total population, with Europeans the dominant group at 6 percent. Today, the overseas-born are 28 percent of the total population, with those from Asia accounting for more than 10 percent. No other nation looks like Australia today.Beneath this national snapshot is another remarkable story. One of the fastest growing groups in Australia is Americans.The United States rarely loses more people to another country than it receives. It is a destination for migrants, not a source. But over the past 15 years, the American population in Australia has almost doubled, from just over 50,000 to more than 100,000, while the Australian population in the United States increased by around 15,000 to 95,000.The Americans are coming to Australia for much the same reasons as the Chinese, Indians and Europeans: well-paid jobs and a high quality of life. And they are being recruited in the same way: They start with a short-term posting and then decide to become Australians.Mainstream politicians have played their part by resisting whatever temptation there might have been to demonize the new arrivals for electoral gain. There has been little public backlash against immigrants. Donald J. Trump and Theresa May, the British prime minister, should take note.The catch has been that national and state governments were too slow to expand the infrastructure to cater to the growing population. The political system had grown complacent during the windfall years of the mining boom. Budget surpluses were returned to voters as handouts, instead of reinvested in transportation, schools and hospitals. When the mining boom ended, the federal budget tumbled into deficit. Now, the cost of correcting those earlier errors is much higher than it should have been. The property market is also inflated, and it may yet bring down the entire economy.Nevertheless, these are problems of growth that most rich nations would kill for.Australia\u2019s immigration policy has one major flaw: its treatment of asylum seekers, who are either turned back at sea or intercepted and transported to an offshore detention center. The policy has been ruthlessly effective at stopping the boats, but it is also undeniably cruel.The country\u2019s political leaders believe a tough refugee policy is a precondition for an open immigration policy. They could not have doubled the immigration flow without securing the border, they claim. While the message may resonate locally, it compromises Australia\u2019s ability to act as a role model for openness.That\u2019s unfortunate because we have a valuable lesson to share with the world: Immigration fosters resilience.George Megalogenis is an author and commentator.

{"Headline": "Has a Start-Up Found the Secret to Farming the Elusive Truffle?", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byNAPA, Calif. \u2014 Gig the truffle dog zigzags with her nose to the ground among hundreds of oak and filbert trees. Her goal is to sniff out the Perigord truffle, a fungus so prized by chefs it is called the diamond in the kitchen.This is a training run: Gig is looking for \u2014 and eventually finds \u2014 a bit of truffle planted by her owner, Alyson Hart, at the behest of the vineyard\u2019s owner, Robert Sinskey. Soon, Mr. Sinskey hopes, the English shepherd will be searching for the real underground McCoy.Mr. Sinskey is a winemaker who is branching out into a new field: truffle growing. It can be a challenging business. Truffles, which grow underground among the roots of certain trees, are famously difficult to domesticate, and then require trained animals like Gig to find them by scent. Once unearthed, they lose flavor quickly.Yet they foster deep devotion. Black Perigords can sell for anywhere from $600 to $1,200 a pound, depending on the season. Only white truffles, which have eluded domestication entirely, are more prized and expensive.There are some large Perigord farms in Europe, New Zealand and Australia, but things haven\u2019t gone quite as well in the United States. A few years ago, a successful truffi\u00e8re (truffle farm) in Tennessee was badly damaged by a filbert-tree blight. Since the 1970s, millions of dollars have been invested, and lost, by people who have tried to cultivate high-end truffles in America.Mr. Sinskey, who has planted 588 trees that he hopes will eventually bear fragrant and valuable black truffles, watched Gig work. He acknowledged the risk of his plan: \u201cIt\u2019s more the romance right now.\u201dFive years ago, Mr. Sinskey became a client of the American Truffle Company, which sells trees that have been inoculated with the truffle fungus. The company is the brainchild of Robert Chang, a former Yahoo executive, and Paul Thomas, a British mycologist (a biologist who studies fungi).Their idea is to expand the range of the truffle in North America using a proprietary new technique, developed by Dr. Thomas, for inoculating the roots of trees to more reliably grow the fungus. Dr. Thomas declined to describe his method, but said that it had been successful in other foreign markets, including Macedonia, England and Wales.In the United States, the company has lined up a few prominent grower-partners over the last several years, including top regional vineyards like the Robert Sinskey Vineyards, Peju Province and the Rocca Family Vineyards.Another early adopter here is Paul Otellini, who retired as chief executive of Intel a couple of years ago. He and his wife, Sandy, are partners with the American Truffle Company and planted 1,500 to 2,000 nut and oak trees in 2011. \u201cThe demand seems very solid,\u201d Mr. Otellini said.The company has also planted orchards in Sonoma and in North Carolina, Alabama, and Ontario. This winter, farms in Kentucky and New Jersey will plant trees. But the company has focused much of its efforts on Napa Valley, with its constellation of high-end vineyard owners, chefs and other foodies.One of the largest Perigord producers in the world is the Truffle and Wine Company, in the fertile valley of Manjimup in Western Australia. The company produces about seven tons of highly acclaimed winter truffles a year. It\u2019s a model for what Mr. Chang, 45, and Dr. Thomas, 35, hope to achieve in Napa: a farm that grows a combination of wine grapes and truffles.Each acre of truffle orchard can produce 30 to 50 pounds or more of Perigords and can earn seven times or more what an acre of wine grapes does. But it takes a minimum of five years for truffles to begin emerging after the trees are planted, and seven to 11 years to achieve peak production.Truffles are fungi that process nutrients for trees in exchange for sugars secreted by the roots. They start out covering the roots as a glove covers fingers, and send threads into the soil that form larger masses that become truffles. Perigord truffles \u2014 black, knobby and redolent \u2014 are found a few inches underground and can range from as small as marbles to as large as softballs. Also called black truffles or winter truffles, they sell for top dollar at the peak of the season, wintertime, when the flavor is richest.Only the white Alba truffle, which grows wild in Italy and has so far defied domestication, fetches more \u2014 up to $2,000 to $3,000 a pound. In 2014, a four-pound-plus white truffle sold at a Sotheby\u2019s auction for more than $61,000 for its unusual size as well as its flavor. Another high-end variety, Burgundy truffles, bring $300 to $600 a pound, but trees produce two or three times as many of them. The prized black truffles once grew only in the Perigord region of France. But France figured out how to domesticate them 40 years ago. Now most French Perigords are farmed and are no longer gathered wild.As a child, Dr. Thomas loved foraging for nuts and berries at his Manchester, England, home, and was particularly entranced by fungus. \u201cMushrooms are so bizarre \u2014 they appear for a few days, and then they\u2019re gone \u2014 and it quite fascinated me,\u201d he said. He learned about truffles while studying the methods that plants use to send messages to one another, called signaling. Mycorrhizae (the technical name for the fungi) assist in plant-to-plant communication. \u201cIt was like James Cameron\u2019s \u2018Avatar,\u2019 here on Earth,\u201d he said, referring to the sci-fi movie.\u201cThese plants are talking to each other, sharing information and sharing resources through these fungus connections,\u201d Dr. Thomas said. \u201cI became obsessed.\u201dWhile working on his Ph.D. in 1996, Dr. Thomas sought out Perigord truffles for study, ordering them from an orchard in France. When he opened the package, it \u201cflooded the whole house with aroma and it flavored everything, even my roommate\u2019s orange juice,\u201d he recalled.But their outsize value also intrigued him, too, he said. \u201cI thought, if I had my own orchard, I could sell them\u201d \u2014 and then use those truffle riches to research whatever he wanted to.Dr. Thomas says he has developed a way to inoculate very young seedlings with the truffle-producing fungus. He began offering the treated trees to landowners who agreed to fund his work. \u201cThey gave me all the cash I needed upfront to produce these trees,\u201d he said. The trees in England are now producing truffles in small commercial amounts.Mr. Chang first worked for Silicon Graphics designing microprocessors. Later he went to work at Yahoo, where he headed a global product marketing group. In 2003, while in Munich on a business fellowship, he first tasted the wafer-thin slices of a Perigord truffle. \u201cI had tagliatelle tossed in butter with fresh-shaved truffles,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it. I got hooked. I put my M.B.A. hat on and said, \u2018This stuff is addictive and it\u2019s expensive \u2014 I wonder if you can grow it?\u2019\u201dHe started a global search for someone who knew how to reliably farm truffles. \u201cThere was only one guy I could find who had incredible science,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cPaul Thomas.\u201d They met at a pub in Leicester Square in London and hit it off. In 2007, the two formed the American Truffle Company as a 50-50 partnership in the United States.Some nurseries in the United States and elsewhere sell mycorrhizae-inoculated trees to growers. The two men have taken a different approach by entering into a partnership with growers that provides them expertise in return for a cut of any future profit. This also allows them to collect data from their various partners, ideally improving their methods for everyone. This model sets them apart from other nurseries, they say.Prospective truffi\u00e8re clients of the company must first determine if their property fits climatic requirements. While burgundy truffles, a summer type, can grow almost anywhere in the United States, Perigords, which grow into the winter, must be in places where the ground doesn\u2019t freeze at critical times.If the climate and other conditions are right, Mr. Chang offers a partnership contract to the landowner. Not counting land, planting an American Truffle Company orchard costs $17,000 to $25,000 for the first acre. The per acre cost declines after that because of economies of scale.The company installs a weather station and moisture sensor in the orchard to monitor conditions online. It advises the owner and contractors on the optimal tree density and orientation and the right balance of soil nutrients and pH, and on how to install a drip irrigation system. For these services and others, the company takes about a third of the profits.In the United States, the company ships the trees from its lab near Portland, Ore., where Mr. Chang inoculates the seedlings. As the trees grow, the company offers advice on pruning and controlling weeds and grass.When the truffles are ready to be harvested, the company says it will arrange for truffle dogs to find them, then transport them to buyers.The fragrance and flavor of truffles begin to decline rapidly once unearthed, even when the fungi are iced and shipped in plastic foam containers. A truffle a few hours or a day old is a far different culinary experience from one that is four days or a week old, an observation backed by gas chromatography. This is where the American Truffle Company sees an advantage in locally sourced Perigords. It also plans to deliver truffles to customers quickly.No truffles have been produced in any of the Napa orchards so far, but Dr. Thomas has checked the roots with a microscope and has found the presence of mycorrhizae.Another person rooting for homegrown truffles in Napa is Ken Frank. As the owner and chef of La Toque, a one-star Michelin restaurant, Mr. Frank has cooked with truffles for decades, and said, \u201cYou need to find a place where the truffle can express itself.\u201dIt is hard to overstate the importance of freshness, he said. \u201cPeople go on vacation to Italy to eat truffles because that\u2019s where they grow and are fresh. To have truffles 15 minutes away would be a game changer.\u201d Mr. Frank uses 200 pounds of truffles a year.Mr. Frank currently buys his winter truffles from the Truffle and Wine Company in Australia. In 2014, that company sold 700 pounds of black truffles to the United States and 11,000 pounds globally.That said, the experiences of Tom Michaels in Tennessee offer a cautionary tale. He is also a mycologist and was the first person to grow Perigord truffles in the United States, in 2007, an undertaking that he says is more art than science. He once produced 200 pounds on about 10 acres, but is now down to 40 pounds after a filbert blight wiped out 85 percent of his hazelnut trees.Has the American Truffle Company figured it out? \u201cIt remains to be seen how well their system will work,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cThe frustrating thing about the truffle is we still don\u2019t know the basic conditions.\u201dGrowing truffles, Mr. Michaels added, \u201cis not for the fainthearted.\u201dAn article last Sunday about an effort to farm truffles in North America misspelled the term for the fungal relationships that assist in plant-to-plant communication, enabling truffles to grow. They are mycorrhizae, not mychorrizae.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Minneapolis Fed Chief Proposes Eliminating \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Banks", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byWall Street banks are still too big to fail, and the hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations created in the eight years since the crisis are not adequate protection against another financial shock, says Neel Kashkari of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.Mr. Kashkari, a Republican who has run the Minneapolis Fed for about a year, delivered an unusually blunt and sweeping indictment of financial regulation in a speech before the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday.Comparing banking to the nuclear power industry, Mr. Kashkari said regulators needed to take even more drastic steps to bolster capital levels at the big banks because the risk of another financial calamity outweighed the costs of increased regulation.If it had come even a few weeks ago, Mr. Kashkari\u2019s proposal might have been seen as a provocative but ultimately fruitless idea \u2014 the stuff that makes for a lively discussion of financial regulation over coffee and scrambled eggs in a wood-paneled, Upper East Side club, but one that goes nowhere in the real world.But Mr. Kashkari is introducing his idea in a political abyss of postelection Washington, where even the most hard-wired banking lobbyists admit they have little idea what policies President-elect Donald J. Trump will ultimately adopt.Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul of banking regulation but has provided few details on what regulations would replace it.\u201cEveryone is waiting and watching to see what he meant,\u201d said Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, in an interview on Wednesday.Republicans blame the law \u2014 which created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, among other measures \u2014 for restricting lending and for hampering economic growth.But at the same time, the Republican Party platform calls for breaking up the large banks by restoring the New Deal-era Glass-Steagall Act, which required a separation of investment from commercial banking.Such a breakup has not happened naturally since the financial crisis. While some big banks have gotten smaller, a great deal of lending and market-making activity is still concentrated in hands of a few Wall Street banks. And with that continued concentration comes risk of another bailout, he said.By Mr. Kashkari\u2019s calculation, the financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government banking bailout to only 67 percent from 84 percent before the crisis.His proposal would reduce that risk to 9 percent, he said, by requiring banks to hold much more capital than the current levels.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to have a false sense of security that we have solved too-big-to-fail,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said during the breakfast discussion on Wednesday.In reaching his conclusion about the chances of future banking collapses, Mr. Kashkari analyzed data from the International Monetary Fund on previous banking crises, bailouts and capitalization levels of different banking systems. He acknowledged that this was an \u201cimperfect science.\u201dMany in the banking industry dismissed the plan as a nonstarter.\u201cFor those looking to accelerate economic growth and job creation, tripling bank capital levels \u2014 already double from pre-crisis levels \u2014 will make it much harder to meet those goals,\u201d Laena Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Financial Services Forum, a trade group, said in a statement about Mr. Kashkari\u2019s proposal.Later on Wednesday in Washington, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican from Texas who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he had been in \u201cfairly constant dialogue\u201d with the team handing the president-elect transition about his plan to overhaul Dodd-Frank.Mr. Hensarling\u2019s so-called Choice Act would revamp the oversight of the consumer protection agency and impose harder penalties on bankers who break the law.Republicans say the bill would free lending from onerous and arbitrary rules and would spur economic growth \u2014 something that appears to be an overarching goal for the president-elect.On the surface, then, Mr. Kashkari\u2019s plan would seem to be a tough sell to the coming Trump administration. He calculates that requiring banks to boost their capital to truly safe levels would carry steep economic costs.\u201cThe added safety isn\u2019t free,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said.The total cost of Mr. Kashkari\u2019s plan would equal 41 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 though much lower than the economic costs of a financial crisis.At the very least, Mr. Kashkari said his plan was a straightforward attempt at measuring whether the financial legislation has made the banking system safer. And his conclusion is simple: It is not quite safe enough, despite assurances from the industry and its regulators that the banking system has never been better capitalized.Specifically, he said the plan would require mega banks with $250 billion or more in assets to issue common equity of 23.5 percent, up from 13 percent required under current rules. He would also not allow them to count long-term debt as part of that cushion because he said history showed it was not a foolproof buffer to losses.A former Goldman Sachs banker who ran for governor in California in 2014, Mr. Kashkari said he had not been contacted by the Trump transition team about his plan.Mr. Kashkari is known for grabbing the spotlight with unusual ideas \u2014 he spent time on the streets of Fresno posing as a homeless person during his run for governor.He said that Congress and the Obama administration were not willing to truly end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d because they feared that the economy was too unstable in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.During the mortgage crisis, banks like Citigroup and Bank of America needed billions of dollars of rescue money from taxpayers because they did not have enough capital to cover enormous losses. At the time, Mr. Kashkari was working in the Treasury Department and was an architect of that bailout, helping to develop the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.Mr. Kashkari said he traced some of the nation\u2019s current political anger and polarization to how the government responded to the financial crisis \u2014 which allowed large banks to survive while thousands of Americans struggled to keep their homes and find new jobs.\u201cThe bailouts violated a core belief that has been handed down from generation to generation in our society that if you take a risk you bear the rewards and consequences of that risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to tear that up during the crisis because the biggest banks were going to fail and bring down the U.S. economy. And when you violate the core beliefs of society it does lead to anger and a feeling that this wasn\u2019t fair.\u201dVictoria Finkle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indian Vendors See Empty Stores and Blame a Rupee Ban", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis is like curse of God on us,\u201d said Gian Prakash Gupta, 60, a soft-spoken paper wholesaler who was crammed into a closet-size office this week with two other men, three hanging statues of Hindu gods and stacks of broadsheet paper.The power was out, despite the garlands of electric wire that hung over streets too narrow for cars, and Mr. Gupta lamented, \u201cWe do not know how to use computers, how to do online transactions, how to use card-swiping machines.\u201dThe Modi administration hopes the measure will reduce the vast quantities of untaxed cash that Indians are accustomed to storing away, increasing tax revenues and giving the economy a lift by driving more of the cash into banking, where it can be lent to business to spur growth.But the success of the audacious gamble depends on traders like Mr. Gupta changing their way of doing business, which has traditionally relied mostly on cash. So far, they say, they have no idea how to make the transition from dealing in cash, and without the banned notes, their business has almost completely dried up.Unless Mr. Modi\u2019s government is able to get the informal sector back on its feet, India\u2019s growth will be slowed sharply next year, economists say, counteracting the gains he sought to achieve from the currency ban. While it is still too early to pronounce victory or defeat, the early results are not encouraging.In addition to the traders, retail and real estate industries have been hard hit. With the winter wheat crop in peril, the government was forced to allow farmers to use the old 500-rupee notes to buy seed.Fitch Ratings, in a note Tuesday reaffirming its negative rating on the Indian banking industry in 2017, said the currency ban \u201chas created a cash crunch, and seems to be holding back economic activity.\u201d The longer the disruption continues, the greater the impact on economic growth, Fitch said, adding that it was already revising downward its forecasts to reflect a weak last quarter of the calendar year.The Modi government, which held off printing most of the new notes to avoid news of the ban slipping out prematurely, is now racing to provide enough new currency to replace the old notes. But on Monday, only about 10 percent of the value of the banned notes had been replaced, Reserve Bank of India figures indicate.Every day since the ban, Mr. Gupta and his fellow traders have been showing up for work in stores devoid of customers hoping something will change. These are the people who supported Mr. Modi in the last election, those who run small businesses and make up the heart and soul of the B.J.P.Last week, members of the Paper Merchant Association huddled behind closed doors to decide how to respond. But even before the meeting started, the office holders of the association were under stress. They did not have enough cash even to pay 2,000 rupees, about $30, for tea and snacks for the 40 members who were coming.Once the meeting got underway, they argued for an hour and a half about how to respond to the cash ban.\u201cNo point in going on strike and closing the market,\u201d said one. \u201cFrom now onwards, we will not be able to do any hanky-panky.\u201d\u201cWe have to correct ourselves,\u201d one member could be heard saying. \u201cWe need to stop dealing in cash.\u201dThe problem for many is they do not know how to do without cash. In the Chawri Bazar, generations of traders have bought and sold paper, from wedding cards to calendars to packing material, mostly in cash. Their customers paid cash, and they used it to pay their suppliers and workers.They paid little in taxes, helping keep costs down in never-ending price wars in which they made razor-thin profits that rarely exceeded a few percentage points. It was impossible for anyone who even briefly contemplated paying their fair share of taxes to compete.Now, the cash in their safes \u2014 the millions of rupees just collected from customers or on its way to suppliers \u2014 has been stranded, its fate uncertain. As the government struggles to keep up with the demand for new notes, it has put in place strict regulations on how much currency each business can withdraw. Fifty thousand rupees can be taken out a week, about $730, from business accounts.\u201cWhat do I do with that little money?\u201d asked Gopal Goel, who owns Durga Marketing, a wholesale retailer in packaging paper, as well as a paper mill in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir.\u201cThis is insulting and humiliating,\u201d Mr. Goel said. \u201cAre we thieves?\u201dRaj Kumar Bindal, 65, whose father started the family\u2019s paper trading business 50 years ago, used to sell three truckloads of paper each week, he says, but now sales are zero. He says he has canceled all of his orders from the paper mill.\u201cHow this will be corrected, only God knows,\u201d he said. He is not sure how long he can retain his 25 employees, he said.Perhaps the most despondent trader was Ramanuj Pandey, 66, the manager at Dharmson, which is stocked floor to ceiling with diaries and calendars for 2017. If he fails to sell them by January, they will be useless.By lunchtime on Friday, he had served only two customers, not even 10 percent of normal traffic. \u201cUntil money flows again, this market will be without customers,\u201d he said.Gian Prakash Gupta, the president of the paper association, said he and his fellow traders did not know what to do. Even if he wanted to do business without cash, he does not know how to use a computer. He could hire someone who is computer literate, he said, but he was not sure he could squeeze another person into his office, in which broadsheet paper was stacked high.He doubts it will be possible to develop a new business model to move traders to a cashless society in which they pay credit card company commissions, because his business operates on such a small profit margin, he said.\u201cMr. Modi has taken this gamble,\u201d he said, and nobody knows how it will turn out. But one thing is certain, he said: It has put \u201cIndian industry in crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Trump Save Their Jobs? They\u2019re Counting on It", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 By the time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time in 108 years this month, Paul Roell was already asleep. He did not stay up to see Barack Obama win the presidency in 2008, or watch in 2000 as the margin of votes separating George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida shrank to the vanishing point.After all, he has to clock in daily at 5:30 a.m. at the soon-to-be-shuttered Carrier factory here, where he has worked 17 years.But shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, when the networks projected that Donald J. Trump would be the next president of the United States, Mr. Roell was wide awake. His wife, Stephanie, was up, too, and they exchanged high fives in the wee hours.In fact, Mr. Roell was so keyed up, he did not sleep at all that night and headed straight to the plant before sunrise, bleary-eyed but euphoric. \u201cI don\u2019t watch sports, but this was my World Series,\u201d he said.It is precisely this level of enthusiasm, from Mr. Roell and millions of like-minded Americans, that pollsters and the campaign of Hillary Clinton did not appreciate, even though it was vividly on display in February after a video went viral showing furious Carrier workers here learning from management that their jobs would be going abroad.Carrier\u2019s decision to move the factory to Monterrey, Mexico, will eliminate 1,400 jobs by 2019. Mr. Trump quickly made the factory Exhibit A in his argument against the trade policies of Republicans and Democrats alike.He cited Carrier again and again on the campaign trail, threatening to phone executives at the company and its parent, United Technologies, and to hit them with 35 percent tariffs on any furnaces and air-conditioners they imported from Mexico. To the cheers of his supporters, he predicted at rallies that Carrier would call him up as president and say, \u201cSir, we\u2019ve decided to stay in the United States.\u201dNow his supporters expect action. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t pass that tariff, I will vote the other way next time,\u201d warned Nicole Hargrove, who has worked at Carrier for a decade and a half and is not certain what she will do if and when her job goes to Mexico.Carrier isn\u2019t changing its plans. On Friday in a written statement, the company said, \u201cWe are making every effort to ease the transition for our Carrier colleagues in Indiana.\u201d The company pointed out that it will finance four-year retraining and educational programs for employees and provide financial help.For Mr. Trump, now comes the hard part. In interviews in recent days and in March, Trump voters here made clear that if he does not follow through on his promises, they are prepared to turn on him, just as they are seemingly punishing Democrats today for not delivering the hope and change voters sought from President Obama after he won as an outsider in 2008.And while Mr. Roell is a conservative, Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk about Carrier, the economy and the future of American manufacturing jobs also appealed to moderates like Darrell Presley, a steelworker in rural Crawfordsville, Ind., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. \u201cHe was for change, and said he would take care of the middle class, but he didn\u2019t live up to those expectations,\u201d Mr. Presley said. \u201cI feel like the American people are at the point where they\u2019ve had it, and this was the last chance.\u201dLast Tuesday, blue-collar workers across the industrial heartland hearkened to Mr. Trump\u2019s call, putting states never thought to be in serious play, like Wisconsin and Michigan, in his win column.As president, however, Mr. Trump will face a tough balance. Tariffs and trade wars stand to hurt American workers who make products that are exported to Mexico or China. Few voters will be happy paying more for imported goods.And regardless of who is in the Oval Office, manufacturers are seeing relentless pressure, from investors and rival companies, to automate, replacing workers with machines that do not break down or require health benefits and pension plans. Wall Street hedge fund managers are demanding steadily rising earnings from Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies, even as growth remains sluggish worldwide.The Carrier plant here is plenty profitable. But moving to Monterrey, where workers earn in a day what they make here in an hour, will increase profits faster.Mr. Roell, who earns about $55,000 a year with overtime as a team leader making furnaces, has few illusions about the gulf separating him from Mr. Trump, or the global headwinds that American factory workers face. \u201cHis father was a millionaire, he\u2019s a billionaire,\u201d Mr. Roell said, sitting at Sully\u2019s Bar & Grill on Thursday night opposite the factory with fellow Carrier workers. \u201cHis son Barron\u2019s allowance is probably more than my salary.\u201dNor does he underestimate the profound economic threat to the 1,400 workers at the factory, where layoffs are expected to begin next summer and continue in waves until it closes in 2019. Mr. Roell was promoted to team leader in March.The mood in the factory has worsened since. Senior engineers travel from Indianapolis to Monterrey to supervise the shifting of production lines to Carrier\u2019s factory there, workers and union officials said. Mexican engineers, in turn, have been coming here, measuring and assessing the machines they will operate south of the border, unless, of course, Mr. Trump can deliver on his promise.\u201cIt\u2019s demoralizing when you see them taking pictures,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you are getting divorced but you are still living with your wife and her new boyfriend is coming over.\u201dFor workers like Mr. Roell, 36, who started at Carrier just weeks after receiving his high school diploma and never returned to school, the problem is not a shortage of jobs in the area. Instead, it is a drought of jobs that pay anywhere near the $23.83 an hour he makes at Carrier, let alone enough to give him a toehold in the middle class.When he drives to work each day before dawn, Mr. Roell passes warehouse after warehouse of giants like Walmart and Kohl\u2019s with \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d signs outside promising jobs within. The problem is that they typically pay $13 to $15 an hour.\u201cI guess I could work two full-time shifts a day,\u201d he joked.The situation confronting Mr. Roell and other blue-collar Carrier workers is not simply one anecdote from the region some people call the Rust Belt. It is part of a broad predicament for non-college-educated workers borne out by Census Bureau data. And it explains why even in Indiana, a state with a lower rate of unemployment than the national average, and a strong rebound from the recession in many ways, the economic and political frustration is palpable.Since 2010, the private sector in Indiana has added roughly 300,000 jobs, bringing the unemployment rate from a high of 10.9 percent in January 2010 (nearly a percentage point above the national average) to 4.5 percent now (nearly half a percentage point below the national unemployment rate).But nearly all that growth occurred in the service sector \u2014 hotel and food-service jobs, or health care technicians, or workers in the warehouses Mr. Roell drives past \u2014 which added more than 220,000 positions for a total of 1.9 million today. While manufacturers added 85,569 jobs since the sector bottomed out at 434,919 in January 2010, factory employment in Indiana over all remains significantly below where it was before the Great Recession.And service jobs do not come close to paying what manufacturing jobs do. According to the Census Bureau, the typical service sector position in Indiana paid $39,338 in 2015, compared with $59,029 for a manufacturing position.The cross-generational drop-off can be stark, and it scars families. Within Local 1999 of the United Steelworkers union, which includes workers at Carrier and other local industrial employers, members typically start at $17 an hour, according to Chuck Jones, Local 1999\u2019s president. For comparison, his 21-year-old granddaughter Haley Duncan is about to finish college and take a job in health care that pays $14.50 an hour.Ms. Duncan and her older brother, Drake, were tempted by factory work. But Mr. Jones and their parents told them to forget it and stay in school because, while manufacturing might pay more, its future is becoming more precarious. The Rexnord bearing factory here \u2014 where Mr. Jones started working fresh out of high school in 1969 and where his stepson works now \u2014 last month said it might follow Carrier to Mexico and eliminate at least 300 jobs.Can Mr. Trump, with his promises to bring these jobs back and his calls to retaliate against chief executives if they do not listen, stem the tide?Broader economic trends suggest Mr. Trump will face an uphill struggle even if he does follow through on his threat to pressure Carrier\u2019s executives or hit the company with steep tariffs. What is more, while the bully pulpit of the president is something corporate chieftains fear, Rexnord\u2019s plan to pull up stakes even after the Carrier situation suggests businesses will not bow to the threat of bad P.R.And even if Congress and the White House agree on a plan to increase manufacturing, tax credits for research and new investments, for example, or financing apprenticeships as European countries do, automation will continue to claim jobs.\u201cI\u2019m pretty skeptical Trump\u2019s policies will reverse this process,\u201d said John Van Reenen, a professor of economics at M.I.T. who studies how technology and innovation affect profits and wages at companies. \u201cThese are fundamental forces that have more to do with technology than trade.\u201dIn particular, he said, across developed economies more national income is going to capital, that is, owners and shareholders, rather than labor. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in many countries with different political systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a winner-take-all world.\u201dEven Robin Maynard, a Carrier team leader who enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump, acknowledges that even a phone call from the Oval Office to the company\u2019s executive suite might not be enough to save his job. \u201cHopefully, he can do something for us,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s out of the C.E.O\u2019s hands. It\u2019s in the hands of the shareholders.\u201dIn this age of 401(k) investment plans and individual retirement accounts, these shareholders are, in a real sense, all of us. But for the Carrier workers in Indianapolis and millions of other blue-collar workers, no matter how they voted, nuances like that do not matter so much now. Just the hope that Mr. Trump will try to reverse the long decline in their neighborhoods, their living standards and even their longevity is an emotional balm.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like blacks. He doesn\u2019t like Hispanics. He doesn\u2019t like disabled people,\u201d said Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins, who, like roughly half the Carrier factory workers, is African-American. \u201cHe\u2019s not presidential material. But my husband and I weren\u2019t mad or upset when he won. I know blacks who voted for him, and I want to give him a chance.\u201dSome blue-collar neighborhoods that supported Mr. Trump have been portrayed as monocultures, the opposite of supposedly more diverse, cosmopolitan cities that favored Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate. That caricature does not hold up here.At least half of the workers on Carrier\u2019s assembly line are women. And dozens of Burmese immigrants have gone to work at the factory in recent years, part of an influx of nearly 15,000 refugees from Myanmar into Indianapolis since 2001.\u201cIt can be hard to communicate, but they work very hard,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cThey don\u2019t complain, and I love their work ethic.\u201dAnd the neighborhoods around Carrier\u2019s factory are considerably more diverse than many wealthy New York and San Francisco suburbs, where Democrats dominate.Down the road from the Carrier factory, past the railroad tracks and a few patches of farmland that remain in Indianapolis, the tidy neighborhood of split-level and ranch houses where Cecil Link Jr. lives has changed in recent years. A worker at a plastics factory nearby, Mr. Link noted that a Hispanic family recently moved in next door, and he said he was pleased that blacks and whites now socialize in ways almost unimaginable decades ago.\u201cIt pains me to see this country divided by race,\u201d Mr. Link said. Nevertheless, he voted for Mr. Trump.The last time he voted in a presidential election was 1992, when he cast his ballot for Bill Clinton. But this time, he said, he registered explicitly to vote for Mr. Trump. \u201cI was tired of corruption and lies in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted a nonpolitician like Trump.\u201dMr. Presley, the 59-year-old white Crawfordsville steelworker who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump in 2016, was even more emphatic that racial resentment or ethnic bigotry was not behind his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cI grew up on the West Side of Indianapolis in a racist environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I went to a high school that was 57 percent black, and I played football with a lot of black guys and we became close friends. I learned not to be racist.\u201dInstead of bias, what animates these voters, whatever their race or political orientation, is a profound distrust and resentment of wealthier, educated Americans, a group they say lacks a connection to them and does not care about their economic situation. And to them, Mrs. Clinton seemed at least as elite as Mr. Trump, if not more so.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bring myself to vote for him, but both candidates are evil,\u201d said Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins, who reluctantly voted for Mrs. Clinton, but has never forgiven her for her remarks about \u201csuperpredators\u201d in the 1990s, or the mandatory prison sentencing guidelines Mr. Clinton signed into law as president.\u201cHillary hasn\u2019t sweated a day in her life, unless it was losing a tough case as a lawyer,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cWe wanted to take America in a different direction. I\u2019m just hoping Trump will do what he says.\u201dCan the Democratic Party recapture these voters if Mr. Trump does not deliver? Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, among the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, contends it can, if Democrats follow his lead in appealing to working-class concerns and opposing free trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact with Asian nations that President Obama supported.Of course these, too, are Mr. Trump\u2019s positions.Mr. Presley readily acknowledges that Mr. Trump is a billionaire with an Ivy League education.\u201cBut he gets that the country is in bad shape.\u201d Mr. Presley said. \u201cSure, he made some mistakes and sometimes he went a little overboard, but the guys I work with related to it. If we spoke in public, we\u2019d make mistakes too.\u201dTo them, it\u2019s not only the country that\u2019s in bad shape. So are the institutions that once provided structure to working-class life in America. Many Carrier workers are regular churchgoers, but Ms. Hargrove said she was deeply troubled by how priests abused children, or how the police shot suspects even though their arms were raised in the air.\u201cThings are chaotic,\u201d she said.The distrust is evident even within the Steelworkers union, another institution that once provided a support system for workers. Mr. Roell is leery of area leaders like Mr. Jones of Local 1999, who had battles of his own with the union\u2019s top officials over their support for Mrs. Clinton.A fierce supporter of Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Jones and Local 1999 did not make an endorsement in the general election. \u201cI held my nose and voted for her,\u201d he said between drags on a Marlboro at the local\u2019s union hall. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust her a bit. I told people she would flip on trade deals after she was elected.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m as left-wing as you can find, and I thought Trump was full of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody is tired of the same old politicians. It could have been Captain Kangaroo and he might have won.\u201dAs for the candidate who did win, Mr. Trump, the union leader said he was waiting for him to make that phone call to Carrier. \u201cHe\u2019s got time. He doesn\u2019t take the oath of office until Jan. 20,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cTrump made Carrier the poster child and said he would hold Carrier accountable. Well, we\u2019re going to hold him to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Privileged Immigrant", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byOpinionBecause it\u2019s what I knew. Or thought I knew. On long car rides, against the drone of NPR, my parents told me stories of their pasts, and of pasts that reached further back than their own, of stingy uncles and Kerala riverboats and letters written from sanitariums.They told me so many stories, so many times, that the facts of their lives became the facts of mine: mine to pick at my convenience, mine to trample with invention.From somewhere in this field of fact and fiction, I\u2019d plucked the story of my mom and dad, newly married, arriving at Kennedy Airport with only $12 in cash between them.\u201cWe had $16,\u201d my mom said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Indian government let us take out.\u201d In 1965, $16 was worth about $120 now \u2014 not a huge sum, but more than paupers\u2019 crumbs. Also, my dad had a friend with a car waiting at the airport. And a furnished apartment. And a job as a medical intern at an Albany hospital.Now my parents live in the Berkeley hills with an edge-of-the-world view of the San Francisco Bay. They have a timeshare in Lake Tahoe. My mom ran a pediatrics practice, my dad a urology practice. They raised three children. Hard work, economy, wise investment, humility: the values of the great immigrant equation.In the wake of the election of Donald J. Trump, as I read about an increase in abuse against immigrants and the appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, formerly of the anti-immigrant Breitbart News, as a senior adviser, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about my family\u2019s immigrant story. There\u2019s something luxuriant in my mishandling of the facts. It speaks to the security of knowing that yes, my parents came to this country with very little, but the details don\u2019t matter, not when they\u2019ve come so far.Indian immigrants have done well for themselves, but their success doesn\u2019t spring from some inherent well of virtue. Nor should it be used as a cudgel against other immigrant groups. We didn\u2019t succeed because we\u2019re better, we succeeded because we had a path.\u201cThey took my gardener!\u201d My neighbor waved me down one morning a few months ago. \u201cMy gardener hasn\u2019t shown up for three weeks,\u201d she panted. \u201cHe was so dependable! They\u2019ve probably sent him away, you know? Picked him up? But what can you do?\u201dShe gazed at my sidewalk planter, ripe now with succulents. \u201cBut who\u2019s your little man? The one who does your yard?\u201dOur little man? My neighbor was talking about Mario, the man who created our garden after I myself had installed a collection of expensive plants and, through assiduous research and care, killed them.Mario planted a new m\u00e9lange. He also painted our rooms, laid carpet, built a storage shed and fixed most everything we found ourselves breaking. But he hadn\u2019t been to our home in over two years. He\u2019d gotten a job at a warehouse \u2014 better work than the day-labor circuit.Mario told me that it took him two tries to cross the border. The first time, he was caught and forced to turn back. The second time, he was kidnapped by smugglers and held in a hotel room for ransom until someone could pay his way out.Then he managed to secure a ride through the border. He traveled in the trunk, folded like an ironing board against two other people, one of whom, Mario once told us with a laugh loosened by time, had recently stepped in dog excrement.The last time Mario worked for us, he painted our breakfast room. I\u2019d chosen a color called limesicle for the walls, minced onion for the trim. An ominous combination.I asked Mario how his daughters were \u2014 one was in high school back in Mexico, the other in college. He hadn\u2019t seen them in person in 10 years.My parents went through similar droughts of contact with their families. In the days before Skype or FaceTime, when people interfaced by faded blue aerogramme, they went for years seeing nobody they loved, except for each other and their children.As of 1960, five years before my parents arrived, there were only about 12,000 Indian immigrants in the United States. Lifelong friendships formed in grocery stores. \u201cMy dad looked through the entire phone book and called every person with an Indian name,\u201d a friend once told me.Recently, I asked my dad about his first years here. He was part of the first wave of foreign medical graduates \u2014 F.M.G.s \u2014 recruited to serve America\u2019s growing hospital network. Between 1965 and 1974, a total of 75,000 foreign physicians would migrate to the States.\u201cSo, um, did you face any discrimination when you started your training? In the hospital?\u201dHe shrugged. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was the system.\u201d\u201cThe system?\u201d\u201cThe system in the hospital. The hours we worked, the jobs they gave us. It discriminated against foreign medical graduates. Is that what you mean?\u201dFrankly, no. I\u2019d imagined gangs of tall white surgeons, cool and cruel in their green scrubs, elbowing past my short brown dad. \u201cSo there was nothing \u2026 personal?\u201d\u201cPersonal? We didn\u2019t have time for personal.\u201dForeign medical graduates spent grueling hours doing the scut work of hospitals. But they had this: the legal right to live and work in the United States.When people talk about Indians in America, they talk about success. How, they muse, has a relatively new immigrant group managed to find its way to the final rounds of spelling bees, to the Ivy League, to Silicon Valley, where 16 percent of start-ups are co-founded by Indians?From this vantage point, the impulse among Indian immigrants and their children, when faced with the plight of the undocumented, underpaid and downtrodden, is to shake our heads and sigh. Poor them, lucky us. The well intentioned call this empathy.Here\u2019s the problem with empathy: It lets us feel good about ourselves. Empathy allows me to shut out a founding truth of success. My American life is held aloft by Mario\u2019s American life, by the lives and labor of workers who process poultry for my aunt\u2019s fiery curries and pick strawberries for my summer salads; by domestic workers who watch our children, who keep our neighborhoods beautiful and our property values high. My immigrant family\u2019s comfort is built, in part, on the hard work of other immigrants.Not all Indians are documented tech workers and doctors. Not all Mexicans are undocumented laborers. This isn\u2019t about Indians and Mexicans, but about the documented and undocumented, and the gulf of privilege that lies between them. This privilege builds on itself, from visa application to employment to finance to homeownership to education to the next generation.Once, during his first year of training, my dad fainted from exhaustion. When he came to, he still had a job, he still had a visa.Eventually he moved on to a residency, a fellowship, his own practice. The journey was backbreaking, but he could take each step knowing that the earth beneath him would not fall away.The last time I saw Mario, he was walking down busy Shattuck Avenue. I pulled over and asked if he needed a ride. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he called back and waved and went on walking, each step an act of faith.Shanthi Sekaran teaches creative writing at California College of the Arts and is the author of the forthcoming novel \u201cLucky Boy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hostels and Shared Hotel Rooms Take Root in America", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayHostels, budget havens of the post-college European travel circuit, traditionally offer bare-bones bunks in communal dormitories. Now for those whose tastes have graduated beyond the backpacking years but whose finances have not, a new breed of hybrid hostel sprouting up on this side of the Atlantic bundles better design, lively bars and restaurants and even some private rooms, all still nicely priced.\u201cThe hostel industry is trying to refashion itself to appeal to a wider range of travelers,\u201d said Douglas Quinby, the vice president of Phocuswright, a travel industry research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s almost moving to a boutique and independent lodging space by offering a distinctive experience that is still within reach of price-sensitive travelers.\u201dMost of those travelers are millennials \u2014 70 percent globally, according to Phocuswright. This travel-loving generation is fueling the expansion of hostels, bargain hotel brands like Tru by Hilton and shared accommodations like Airbnb.But unlike whole home or apartment rentals, the new hostels make social interaction central to the stay, particularly through food and drink but also concerts, art exhibits and shared work spaces.The newer breed of American hostels \u2014 the stylish few found in major cities, as represented by the following \u2014 aims at a broader demographic of travelers who share at least one thing: thrift.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like the term \u2018hostel\u2019 as much as a large portion of Freehand rooms are regular hotel rooms,\u201d said Andrew Zobler, the founder and chief executive of Sydell Group, which owns Freehand.In Chicago, for example, the Freehand offers accommodations ranging from a duplex penthouse with two bedrooms to shared quads with bunk beds, each with a privacy curtain (from about $25 a bed). The more resortlike Miami property has a pool. Both operate Broken Shaker cocktail bars. A New York Freehand is expected to open in late 2017 with a similar blend of private and shared rooms.\u201cThe primary audience for the shared product are people on a budget but who appreciate high-quality design, good food, a good bar, but see the room for sleeping and don\u2019t want to spend a lot for sleeping,\u201d Mr. Zobler said.In addition to younger solos and duos, that audience has included bottom-line-minded entrepreneurs, friends traveling together and families.\u201cKids love the bunk beds and it\u2019s really economical, and you have the great Broken Shaker bar in the lobby,\u201d Mr. Zobler said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that at a chain hotel.\u201dGenerator is known for encouraging guests to hang out in-house with a variety of programming including music, art shows and lectures, as well as dining and drinking options.\u201cWe refer to our guests as the seeker seeking experience and social interaction, from art, music and culture to meeting people,\u201d said Fredrik Korallus, the chief executive of Generator. \u201cThere is no age divide. We get empty nesters, boomers, families, students, youth. It\u2019s a real m\u00e9lange of people out for social connection.\u201dWhile Generator started in London in 1997 as a more traditional dorm-style hostel, it has added private rooms over the last five years. At the Miami site, which will house a pool and three restaurants and bars, private rooms will sleep up to four and are designed for families or groups of friends traveling together; rates to be determined.\u201cMillennial consumers are growing up and migrating from shared to private experiences,\u201d Mr. Korallus said. \u201cThe bed is the least important thing we sell.\u201dThe company already runs a hostel, Downtown Beds, in Mexico City, but plans to make the Hollander more social-media-centric by offering guests what it calls the Social Stay, the opportunity to link Instagram accounts to a reservation through which fellow roommates can get to know one another other before check-in.\u201cThis is a generation about social media that lives constantly in a visual world and we want to bring them to a physical world, which is a Social Stay,\u201d said Carlos Couturier, a founder of Grupo Habita.Beds in shared rooms will start at $45 a night (private rooms from $165). The property will be a neighbor of a more upscale hotel from the group, the Robey, also set to open late this month.Two queen beds and one twin bunk bed furnish each of the 350-square-foot rooms, accommodating up to five travelers at rates starting at $69 each a night.\u201cThe bunk-bed rooms are quite popular for group travel, such as birthdays, bachelorette and bachelor parties, family reunions and quick weekend getaways with friends,\u201d wrote Bob Morse, the president of hospitality for Caesars Entertainment, in an email.While the quarters might be tight, nearby diversions abound, including an open-air mall with the High Roller Ferris wheel and the concert venue and bowling alley Brooklyn Bowl.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Price We Pay for an Ad-Powered Internet", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.We don\u2019t usually think of Timothy Leary as a consumer advocate, but in his zealous promotion of LSD, the iconoclastic 1960s psychologist was searching for what today we would call an ad blocker \u2014 though his tiny tabs relied more on messing with our sensory receptors than dropping code on our mobile phones.In his new book \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d Tim Wu reminds us that Leary pushed acid in the pursuit of \u201ca complete attentional revolution\u201d in which his followers would reject the growing external stimuli of commercial media in favor of an inward, spiritual journey.It\u2019s more than a bit ironic, then, that Leary felt compelled to resort to a classic marketing trick, the jingle, to press his case. His \u201cTurn on, tune in, drop out\u201d was so catchy that, though failing to smash the attention economy, it was ultimately complicit in contributing to it, showing up in a campaign for Squirt, a grapefruit-flavored soda: \u201cTurn on to flavor, tune in to sparkle, and drop out of the cola rut.\u201dThis gets at the heart of the compelling thesis of \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d namely that the age of mass media and mass marketing is characterized by an arms race between those who seek to capture the valuable commodity of our attention and capitalize on it for gain and those who resist this harvesting of time either through drugs; regulation; or most effectively, collective boredom, distraction and indifference. Wu\u2019s argument is that each boom in commercial media in some way went too far and provoked an either minor or major revolt, pushing the advertising industry to adopt more sophisticated or extreme methods to monetize our time.Drawing a line from the snake oil salesmen of the early 20th century, through the birth, rise and decline of broadcast to the \u201cattention plantation\u201d of Facebook, Wu\u2019s history also illustrates the cyclical resistance movements against advertising. First came the unscrupulous false advertising, then the corrective of investigative journalism; first the tidal bore of broadcast television, then the corrective of the remote control; first the era of spam, then the development of filters and blockers.The book is studded with sharp illustrations of those who have tried to stop the encroachment of advertising on our lives, and usually failed. In the 1930s, for example, Rexford Tugwell, an economist and member of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, sought to introduce far stricter legislation on drug advertising, which would have barred pharmaceutical and cigarette industries from making false claims about their products. The pressure brought by manufacturers on broadcasters to resist the proposed legislation saw both Tugwell\u2019s recommendations watered down and Tugwell himself smeared as a Communist. Newspapers and radio barely covered the controversy, in part, Wu writes, as a response to pressure from advertisers.This struggle has only become more relevant today. Many media companies, including The New York Times, are now almost entirely dependent on the ability to build and sustain a business model that captures people\u2019s time and resells it to advertisers, or provides something so valuable to individuals that they will pay for the journalism, programming or experience they receive. If you walk the floor of a modern newsroom, you will most likely see journalists staring at real-time charts flickering with numbers, and dials telling editors where readers are spending every second of their time. If you have got this far in the review, then I and Tim Wu are doing well \u2014 around 55\u202fpercent of readers, on average, will have stopped after 15 seconds.There is little sign of this trend slowing, only accelerating. Facebook and Google represent the largest and most successful advertising-funded businesses in history. They are busy developing technologies that track not only our attention but also every aspect of our online behavior and, in Facebook\u2019s case, synthesizing it with what is known as our \u201csocial graph.\u201d That graph is the circle of colleagues, acquaintances, families and friends we connect with online and determines as a result what type of advertising and even what type of news or other content we see. We are largely unaware of how the hidden tracking technologies operate and are complicit in how much we surrender.From his historical perspective, Wu can see that often a moment such as this one, in which our eyeballs are so thoroughly monopolized, is followed by resistance. But his concern is that we have not individually or collectively paid enough attention to the commercialization of every part of our lives: \u201cOur society has been woefully negligent about what in other contexts we would call the rules of zoning, the regulation of commercial activity where we live, figuratively and literally. It is a question that goes to the heart of how we value what used to be called our private lives.\u201dClearly not a fan of the selfie stick or the culture of \u201cmicrofame,\u201d Wu sees a tendency to self-aggrandize online, turning us all into miniature attention merchants. As the man who coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and a skilled thinker about the importance of an open web, Wu is nevertheless largely disappointed about where the internet has taken us. In a chapter titled \u201cThe Web Hits Bottom\u201d he describes in some detail the business model of the new-media company BuzzFeed and the quest for \u201cvirality.\u201d Wu is steadfastly skeptical, seeing \u201clittle to admire\u201d online. Though he briefly describes \u201cbright spots\u201d like Wikipedia and Reddit and name-checks online legacy media that he grudgingly admits have improved their offerings, he sees them as being \u201cengulfed by the vast areas of darkness, the lands of the cajoling listicles and the celebrity nonstories, engineered for no purpose but to keep a public mindlessly clicking and sharing away.\u201dWhat his thesis doesn\u2019t allow for is the possibility that despite his skepticism, we may have become rather deft in developing our own spam filters and that while the \u201copen web\u201d has in fact delivered a lot of cats falling over, it has also given us access to more knowledge than ever before and more engaging forms of information. It has done this in part because of the possibility of advertising revenue, not despite it. As for his dismissiveness about our \u201cselfie\u201d culture, he never considers the opportunities that the internet has opened up for women, minorities and those outside the mainstream media\u2019s boundaries of acceptability to take control of their own image.For Someone uniquely skilled at advocating a stronger regulatory climate, Wu\u2019s ultimate point is surprisingly low-tech: \u201cIf we desire a future that avoids the enslavement of the propaganda state as well as the narcosis of the consumer and celebrity culture, we must first acknowledge the preciousness of our attention and resolve not to part with it as cheaply or unthinkingly as we so often have.\u201d It might be an idealistic aspiration, but it is a timely one.What Wu achieved with his first book, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d was to demystify the recent history of the ownership and governance of our communications systems, from telecom companies to the web, while identifying how open systems over time became compromised and closed. In \u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d he applies the same thesis of a business cycle to explain the development of the advertising market and the ways in which it has adapted to avoid our natural inclination to ignore it. Despite the book\u2019s occasional finger-wagging, Wu dramatizes this push and pull to great effect.When Vance Packard wrote \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders,\u201d the revelatory 1957 book about advertising\u2019s hidden psychological manipulations, he did so just as the mass media stood at a turning point. He did not stop the march of commercial television, but he provided a powerful critical framework through which to think about it. Wu has written a \u201cHidden Persuaders\u201d for the 21st century, just as we stand squarely on the threshold of a post-broadcast world where the algorithmic nano-targeting of electronic media knows our desires and impulses before we know them ourselves.Emily Bell is the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: \u2018Pinky and the Brain\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationDuring an interview I did with Conan O\u2019Brien a while back, we drifted onto the topic of rules: when it was prudent, as a creative person, to flout conventions, and when it made sense to obey them. As O\u2019Brien saw it, only ever flouting, without a healthy dose of obeying, was unsustainable and, on balance, unfunny. To illustrate, he told me a story, one that didn\u2019t make it into the piece I wrote but stuck with me nonetheless: A well-known comedian with a raucous persona, interested in developing his own talk show, once sought O\u2019Brien\u2019s advice. \u201cHe showed me a prototype of what it would be: He comes out, he runs through the audience, he\u2019s never in one place. He\u2019s everywhere, he\u2019s nowhere, he\u2019s wearing different clothes, spray-painting on the walls \u2014 total anarchy,\u201d O\u2019Brien recalled. \u201cAnd I said, O.K., here\u2019s my take: You\u2019re a brilliantly funny person, but you need to be constrained, because when you break those constraints, it\u2019s enormously satisfying.\u201dThe constraints in a late-night talk show \u2014 a hidebound format that O\u2019Brien sabotages almost as fervently as he reveres it \u2014 are the desk, the almost-unbudging camera, the sidekick and the suit-and-tie wardrobe. But this principle holds firm, O\u2019Brien believed, across the arts. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing I love about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d he said. \u201cThree chords.\u201d\u201cPinky and the Brain,\u201d a cartoon that aired for half of the 1990s, is a three-chord kind of show, as bound by formal constraints as they come. Before spinning off into its own half-hour slot, the series began life as the best thing about \u201cAnimaniacs,\u201d an exuberantly unhinged variety cartoon executive-produced by Steven Spielberg and packed with non-sequitur punch lines, meta-level laughs and so many showbiz in-jokes that you could forget this was a show nominally made for kids. \u201cPinky and the Brain\u201d stood out for its ingenuity and extreme economy. The show has only two recurring characters to speak of \u2014 the talking lab mice of the title \u2014 and precisely one plot, set into motion in the opening moments of each installment with the same 23 words: \u201cGee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?\u201d \u201cThe same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world.\u201dThat the mice will deploy some scheme for world domination is the lone narrative motor, and that their failure is guaranteed provides not only the inevitable third-act kicker but also the condition of the show\u2019s continued existence: a reset button that returns the mice to the lab to plot again. The pair is at once idiosyncratic and archetypal, in a vaudevillian kind of way. Brain is a hyperintelligent, short-tempered straight man voiced by a guy doing a stentorian Orson Welles impression; Pinky is daffy and sweet and speaks in an over-the-top Cockney accent.They are given no back story beyond a stray line in the theme song (\u201cTheir genes have been spliced\u201d), and they learn no lessons by episode\u2019s end. Characterization takes the form, instead, of kid-friendly, broken-record repetition. In every episode, while unveiling the plan at hand, Brain will ask Pinky, \u201cAre you pondering what I\u2019m pondering?\u201d \u2014 a question so ritualized that fans refer to it by \u201cAYPWIP\u201d \u2014 to which Pinky will offer a reliably outr\u00e9 response. \u201cI think so, Brain, but I can\u2019t memorize a whole opera in Yiddish.\u201d \u201cI think so, Brain, but Pete Rose? I mean, can we trust him?\u201d \u201cI think so, but Kevin Costner with an English accent?\u201dThe AYPWIP captured, in microcosm, the show\u2019s prevailing dynamic: an endlessly redeployable equation into which the writers could feed increasingly crazy variables. Nowhere was this more palpable than in Brain\u2019s preposterously elaborate plans. In one episode, he endeavors to create his own country, seeking billions of dollars in foreign aid, in order to construct an enormous clothes dryer that will generate world-crippling static cling. In another, he and Pinky masquerade as formerly extinct species in Pittsburgh, exploiting environmental protections to commandeer the steel industry and manufacture a series of giant \u201cmagic eye\u201d billboards over the nation\u2019s highways, transfixing drivers and creating a never-ending rush hour.Such Rube Goldbergian absurdity often gave way to satire. Popular culture was a frequent target: Brain\u2019s schemes included creating a hit country song, a romance novel, an inspirational sports movie and, in one of many self-reflexive moments, a beloved children\u2019s-show duo, all in the name of reducing the global population to a state of drooling pliability. Considered in this light, the show\u2019s slavishly repetitive structure stood as its own sly self-critique. Encountering all of this in a piece of ostensible children\u2019s entertainment was, and remains, revelatory.One way to describe art bound tight by rigid constraints is \u201cformulaic.\u201d But while we typically use this word as a slight, \u201cPinky and the Brain\u201d shows that extreme adherence to formula can spark wild bouts of experimentation, invention and \u2014 almost paradoxically, given the atmosphere of overwhelming familiarity \u2014 hallucinatory surprise. If it weren\u2019t for the show\u2019s ironclad narrative tethers, after all, its abundant flights of fancy would feel precariously overleveraged, inconsequentially unmoored \u2014 merely and manically \u201crandom,\u201d like the friend telling you all about his crazy dream, or the amateur improv troupe in which everyone wants to be Will Ferrell at all times. Breaking the rules in comedy, as in art at large, is important, but it can become a cheap fetish, too. Sometimes it\u2019s following them that takes real genius.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Doctor Shortage? Let\u2019s Take a Closer Look", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byThe New Health CareMany people have to wait too long to see a doctor. And it could get worse. If, as many people believe, we have a shortage of doctors in the United States, then it follows that we can fix this only by training and hiring more physicians.As with almost everything in our health care system, though, it\u2019s complicated. Some people think there\u2019s no shortage at all \u2014 just a poor distribution of the doctors we have.The United States had 2.56 doctors per 1,000 people, which is more than Canada (2.46), Poland (2.24), South Korea and Mexico (both 2.17). But we were way behind countries like Austria (4.99), Norway (4.31), Sweden (4.12), Germany and Switzerland (both 4.04).What no one seems to be debating is that we have a shortage of services. We could fix that by increasing the number of physicians, either by training more or allowing more to immigrate into the country. We could fix that by improving the ratios at which physicians enter specialties or primary care, through changes in training slots or in how we pay physicians. We could fix that by making the health care system more efficient, by distributing the resources we have more effectively, or by increasing our willingness to use midlevel practitioners through changes in regulations or licensing.None of these approaches are easy, and all would most likely require governments to act. As the next administration takes power, choosing at least one of these paths seems necessary to improve access in the health care system.An earlier version of this article rendered the name of a health care group incorrectly. It is the Association of American Medical Colleges, not the American Association of Medical Colleges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zcash, a Harder-to-Trace Virtual Currency, Generates Price Frenzy", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported bySpeculators are snapping up a new virtual currency known as Zcash that was designed by university academics and built to be all but untraceable.Investors were paying over $1,000 for a single unit of Zcash on Monday, a few days after the currency was first brought online.The company behind Zcash, led by a developer named Zooko Wilcox, has the support of privacy activists and computer scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has already secured $3 million in backing from a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists who are involved in the virtual currency industry.Zcash\u2019s developers say they have used advanced cryptography to create a virtual currency that can be sent around the world essentially without a trace, unlike Bitcoin.While Bitcoin was initially described as an anonymous currency, its transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be tracked and traced by law enforcement. Each Bitcoin user has an address, made up of letters and numbers, and the authorities are often able to link an address to a real person using sophisticated data analysis.In contrast, Zcash uses a method developed by a team of cryptographers working at M.I.T. and in Israel \u2014 known as zk-Snark \u2014 that allows transactions to be confirmed by the network without anyone recording the Zcash addresses involved in the transactions. Users can opt out of this privacy function.The privacy features of Zcash could make it harder for the currency to win support from regulators and bankers.Investigators have used Bitcoin\u2019s ledger, known as the blockchain, to track down some people selling drugs for Bitcoins on black market websites.Most projects in the virtual currency area, though, have been pushing in directions that would make it easier to integrate with the existing financial system.Jonathan Levin, a founder of Chainalysis, a start-up that helps banks and regulators track activity on blockchains, said that the authorities had become comfortable with virtual currencies because they had been able to trace transactions in cases of criminal activity.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite difficult for Zcash in its opaqueness to show that, no, it is not all bad stuff going on,\u201d he said.But Mr. Wilcox has the help of a former top New York state financial regulator and a former federal prosecutor to help ease the concerns of government officials. Mr. Wilcox is hosting an open virtual meeting later this month with law enforcement officials from across the country to explain the project.Mr. Wilcox and the programmers who created Zcash say that they developed the currency not to facilitate illegal activity but to provide a degree of privacy for people who do not want their financial transactions visible to the world.\u201cThe basic story is that we have been gradually losing our privacy in a whole bunch of ways that people don\u2019t appreciate,\u201d said Matthew Green, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins who began developing Zcash with some of his graduate students in 2013. \u201cThis brings back a little bit of that privacy that computers have taken away from us. This technology gives us a defense against something that until now we have been defenseless against.\u201dMr. Wilcox said that existing virtual currencies have been unattractive to businesses because their transaction details are exposed to competitors, creating a business need for a more private virtual currency.\u201cAll of the conversations I\u2019ve had with businesses, banks, regulators and law enforcement have been about the need for data security for commercial applications,\u201d he said.Zcash is modeled closely on Bitcoin. The currency will be released slowly to computers that help support the network underlying the currency. New Zcash units will be distributed to users until there are 21 million of them in the world. Initially Zcash units are being released slowly \u2014 as of Monday, only about 1,500 were out in the world, helping to feed the speculative frenzy around the currency.The concepts behind Zcash were developed by Mr. Green and other academics, but the project is being run by a for-profit Delaware corporation, Zcash Electric Coin Company, which is led by Mr. Wilcox. The corporation, developers and early investors will be compensated by what amounts to a 10 percent charge on all the new Zcash generated by users during the first four years of operation. Some of these coins will also be directed to a nonprofit Zcash foundation.There have already been several efforts beyond Zcash to correct for the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin users run their coins through so-called tumblers that can obscure the origin of transactions.Another relatively new virtual currency, Monero, came with anonymity built into the system. Earlier this year it was seized upon by speculators who pushed up the value of Monero significantly before the price fell back down. Unlike Zcash, Monero can already be used for purchases on black market websites.Mr. Green, the Zcash developer, said that some people may look to the currency for illegal purposes. But he believes that ultimately the privacy it provides will secure its importance to the mainstream economy.\u201cYou are going around on the Bitcoin blockchain leaving a trail of everything you do, which will last forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of Zcash is you don\u2019t have to go to special lengths to achieve privacy \u2014 privacy is baked into the system.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She grew up in the presidential residence as a daughter of South Korea\u2019s longest-ruling dictator, Park Chung-hee. After her mother died in a 1974 assassination attempt against her father, Ms. Park became the country\u2019s de facto first lady. She later was a lawmaker for 15 years, crafting an image as a deft politician while helping to build a conservative party with national security and economic growth as its core message. She became the country\u2019s first female president in 2013.Ms. Park\u2019s personal history and image as a corruption-free conservative have been her main political assets. But that image quickly faded in September when the news media began looking at her longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil. Ms. Choi is accused of using her connection to the president to extort money, advance her own daughter\u2019s career and influence government policy.The relationship between Ms. Park and Ms. Choi apparently began after the death of Ms. Park\u2019s mother. Ms. Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, reportedly approached the young Ms. Park with the claim that he could make contact with her dead mother. Mr. Choi, a shadowy cult leader, died in 1994, but the connection between Ms. Choi and Ms. Park deepened over the decades.South Koreans are hardly na\u00efve about the failings of politicians.

Ms. Park, though, had always appeared above the fray, which is one reason, along with Ms. Choi\u2019s shady family background, she has fallen so hard, so quickly.Before this scandal, Ms. Park had cultivated an aura of rectitude. While she owns a multimillion-dollar house in the wealthy Gangnam area of Seoul, she astutely opened it to reporters to demonstrate a frugal lifestyle. She never married and is estranged from her siblings \u2014 both signs that close relatives couldn\u2019t take advantage of her power. With her supporters declaring her \u201cmarried to the nation,\u201d Ms. Park cut a figure beyond reproach.She has also been skillful at reminding South Koreans of her lineage. Ms. Park\u2019s old-fashioned hairdo and dress are reminiscent of those of her mother, who is remembered as a graceful and modest first lady. The legacy of her father, associated with South Korea\u2019s modernization, lent Ms. Park credibility as someone who could jolt the country\u2019s flagging economy. She ran for office on a pledge of \u201ceconomic democratization,\u201d vowing to correct South Korea\u2019s brutally fast development, set forth by her father, with a warm, maternal touch.Now South Koreans are wondering if Ms. Park \u2014 once nicknamed the \u201cqueen of elections\u201d for her uncanny ability to pull off victories \u2014 was not a political genius after all, and might not even have controlled her own affairs and government. As an editorial in the conservative daily Donga Ilbo asked, \u201cWas this a Choi Soon-sil, not Park Geun-hye, administration?\u201dNow an object of national ridicule, Ms. Park has paralyzed the political process. The National Assembly is debating its response to the scandal instead of setting next year\u2019s budget. Ms. Park\u2019s conservative allies are defecting to save their own political careers. The rock-solid support she always enjoyed among voters over 60 has crumbled. One recent poll put her approval rating at 5 percent.Ms. Park\u2019s gestures come too late. The tide turned against her when Chosun Ilbo, the nation\u2019s largest daily, featured in its Chinese-lesson column on Oct. 25 the word for \u201cresignation.\u201d That word and another, meaning \u201cimpeachment,\u201d became the top trending terms on South Korea\u2019s two major search portals. Even her emotional apology came across as having a touch of self-interest: she blamed herself for poor judgment, but acknowledged no criminal wrongdoing on her own part. It only added fuel to the people\u2019s fury.Ms. Park has consistently emphasized the importance of self-sacrifice for the nation. If she is to live by her own words, she should resign. Ms. Park has become an obstacle to the progress of the nation she has repeatedly claimed to love.Se-Woong Koo is the managing editor of the online magazine Korea Expos\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Broadens Its Business With Tours and Travel Experiences", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Airbnb used to let you just book room rentals. Now you can also use Airbnb to reserve dance parties in Havana, historical tours in Cape Town and stargazing outings in Los Angeles.Trips is starting with 500 experiences that can last a few hours or span days. They are created and provided by locals in the 12 cities where the service is initially being offered.Trips helps travelers \u201cimmerse in a local community,\u201d Brian Chesky, the chief executive and co-founder of Airbnb, said at the company\u2019s annual conference for hosts and the press.The new service helps Airbnb create an additional revenue source as it faces some challenges with its main business of matching travelers with hosts who want to rent out their homes for short stays. While the eight-year-old company lists nearly three million short-term rentals in more than 34,000 cities around the world, short-term rentals are illegal in some cities and have run into regulatory gray areas in others.To appease local legislators, Airbnb hosts, using tools supplied by the company, have started collecting local hotel taxes, which the company remits to local governments. That essentially turns those homeowners and renters into small-business owners. Some residential leases expressly prohibit running a commercial enterprise out of a home, and tenants who do so could face eviction.J.C. Rodriguez, an artist in Miami who offers a two-day experience called Behind the Art, helps visitors meet with local artists in their studios and create their own pieces. He said he currently keeps the $150 fee he charges per person, which covers a meal and art supplies, but Airbnb will soon take a 20 percent cut of that income.\u201cHosts for the trips are people who are already immersed in the experience they\u2019re creating,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t training. We show people around the way we\u2019d show a friend.\u201dMr. Rodriguez, 37, said he had to apply to host a trip on Airbnb. The thrust of the application process was to create an experience that a tourist would not normally have access to.In addition to Trips and restaurant reservations, users will be able to rent cars through Airbnb, book flights and other services. They will also be able to add perks such as grocery delivery to their short-term rentals.An article on Friday about an expansion of services offered by Airbnb referred imprecisely to the collection of local hotel taxes by Airbnb hosts. The hosts collect the taxes and turn the revenue over to Airbnb, which remits the taxes to local governments; Airbnb does not collect the taxes directly.Advertisement"}

The hope of the major airlines is to keep those price-conscious customers from fleeing to the budget airlines, without cannibalizing the higher-priced options elsewhere in the cabin.Until recent years, the budget airlines didn\u2019t jostle much with the major airlines for customers, Mr. Kaplan said. The fares were much lower at the budget airlines, which saw themselves as part of a totally different marketplace. But as fuel prices decreased along with ticket prices, the major and budget airlines began bumping into each other more, he said.Now, it\u2019s not so clear where travelers will find the cheapest fares.On average, budget passengers can still expect to pay less, even accounting for fees, Mr. Kaplan said. The major airlines are likely to selectively match or approach the price of budget airlines for certain flights, he said.In other cases, there\u2019s not much budget airlines can do. An American Airlines ticket from Washington to Chicago recently cost Mr. Kaplan $128, which would be hard for an airline like Spirit to undercut. And the larger airlines can lean on their other advantages, like reliability, rewards programs and a larger network, Mr. Kaplan said.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing Spirit can do to save me hundreds of dollars when it\u2019s 128 bucks on American,\u201d he said.Still, giving up carry-on luggage is a new ask of customers at the major airlines. Though a personal item would still be allowed, it\u2019s not uncommon for passengers to load all of their belongings into a carry-on bag, hoping to avoid checked-baggage fees or the possibility of luggage being lost in transit.At least one group was happy about the change: flight attendants. Too many bags in the cabin leads to injuries, slower boarding times and passenger altercations, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in a statement.\u201cUnited\u2019s move to encourage fewer carry-on bags, similar to practices at Frontier and Spirit, will create a safer cabin for passengers and crew,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Danger of Going Soft on Russia", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byEditorialJust when relations between Russia and the West are at their most precarious point since the Cold War, Mr. Trump has been Russia\u2019s defender and the beneficiary of Moscow\u2019s efforts to influence the presidential campaign. At times he has seemed almost intoxicated by the Russian president, praising Mr. Putin\u2019s firmness and insisting that the two could resolve any differences if they met. Meanwhile, he has shown little concern that Russia poses a major strategic challenge.Few experts believe that Russia wants war with the West, but many worry that Mr. Putin\u2019s aggressive behavior as he tries to revive Russian greatness (thus masking problems at home) could result in the kind of dangerous miscalculations that often lead to armed conflict.Despite this behavior, despite the obvious need for the next president to be alert to Mr. Putin\u2019s mischief and to be willing to resist it, Mr. Trump has so far been Mr. Putin\u2019s apologist.The deteriorating relationship between Moscow and Washington is a long way from what was envisioned when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and there were high hopes that Russia would become a democracy integrated with the West. In 2009, Mr. Obama authorized Hillary Clinton, his first secretary of state, to \u201creset\u201d relations, aiming to foster cooperation.The two sides worked together on an arms control treaty and the Iran nuclear deal, but on the whole the reset failed, largely because of Mr. Putin. Restoring Russia to power and to a central role in world affairs turned out to be more important to Mr. Putin, and the Russians, than peaceful or profitable ties with the West. His foreign policy is a fairly consistent continuation of Soviet policy \u2014 preventing Western encirclement by moving into Ukraine; fighting proxy battles to support Russian interests, as in Syria; and challenging American power wherever possible.Mr. Obama was slow to recognize Mr. Putin\u2019s revanchist mission, as were other Western leaders. Now that the threat is obvious, America and its allies cannot afford for Mr. Trump to make the same mistake. What\u2019s needed is a pragmatic review of American-Russian relations that includes, at a minimum, a reaffirmation of America\u2019s commitment to NATO, which Mr. Trump disparaged during the campaign, and to European democracy. Mr. Putin is working to undermine both.In many ways, Mr. Putin appears strong, but he is playing a weak hand, as Russia\u2019s oil-dependent economy shrinks, its population ages and the country remains mired in costly military operations in Syria and Ukraine. He needs to have no doubt that the United States and its allies will defend their principles and values even as they remain open to cooperation when the interests of the two sides overlap. That is the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s surprise election victory should bring some welcome relief to banks. A Republican Party in control of Congress also usually appeals to the financial markets.The president-elect\u2019s erratic positions on other important issues, however, could turn those short-term gains into long-term pain.A commitment to spending on American roads and bridges, reinforced in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory speech, is also a good sign for Wall Street. A repeal or significant reform of Dodd-Frank, President Obama\u2019s 2010 law reining in banks after the financial crisis, is more likely, too, and may help the bottom line of financial institutions. The next Treasury secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and head of supervision at the Federal Reserve also could be friendlier to the industry.Higher interest rates would be an additional benefit, and Mr. Trump has supported the idea. A one percentage-point increase could add billions of dollars to the top line of the biggest American lenders within a year and act as yet another stimulus to the trading desks of banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.Mr. Trump\u2019s inconsistency over financial policy and regulation could cancel out those gains, though. This year, he spoke in favor of low rates, for example. If he names a replacement for the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, uncertainty would abound.America\u2019s banks would be better placed than their European peers. Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist leanings imply that foreign banks with big United States operations, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, might face even more punitive oversight than now, for example.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clarence M. Ditlow III, Auto Safety Crusader, Dies at 72", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byClarence M. Ditlow III, widely regarded as America\u2019s foremost advocate for automotive safety, who championed seatbelts, airbags, electronics to avert crashes and campaigns to force the recall of millions of dangerously flawed motor vehicles, died Thursday night in Washington. He was 72.His death, at George Washington University Hospital, was caused by cancer, said Daniel Becker, a friend and associate.With a budget of less than half the cost of one G.M. Super Bowl commercial, Mr. Ditlow took on auto industry giants in lawsuits that tightened standards for ignition systems, airbags and fuel efficiency; lobbied government agencies to ban driving while texting or using cellphones; and achieved \u201clemon laws\u201d in all 50 states that made it easier for buyers to return defective vehicles.\u201cHe was the nightmare of the misbehaving auto industry and the dream of safety-conscious motorists,\u201d Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and Mr. Ditlow\u2019s mentor, said in an interview in October. \u201cHe was also honest, ethical and self-effacing.\u201dAn engineer and lawyer, Mr. Ditlow collaborated with Mr. Nader on \u201cThe Lemon Book\u201d (1980), on \u201cThe Lemon Book: Auto Rights\u201d (1990) and on many safety articles. He also wrote about the tendency of some vehicles to roll over, to jump from Park into Reverse gear and to power off with a loss of all controls and airbags while being driven.Mr. Ditlow never achieved the fame of Mr. Nader, whose landmark book, \u201cUnsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile\u201d (1965), accused car manufacturers of hiding defects at the cost of untold lives. The book also prompted Congress to create what became the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to enforce safety standards and supervise recalls.But Mr. Ditlow carried to fruition many of the initiatives that Mr. Nader began after he and Consumers Union jointly founded the Center for Auto Safety in 1970. Mr. Ditlow, who became the center\u2019s executive director in 1976, was instrumental, for example, in long campaigns to require that all motor vehicles have seatbelts and airbags.Over four decades, Mr. Ditlow badgered the traffic safety administration for more stringent standards, saying its leaders were often political appointees reluctant to move against the powerful auto industry.He also became the industry\u2019s fiercest critic, issuing scathing reports on defective vehicles and related problems ranging from child car-seat flaws to dangerously designed engine mounts. He testified at scores of congressional hearings on safety and warranty issues, consumer protection, air pollution and fuel economy, and he pushed for myriad recalls.There were 51 million vehicle recalls in the United States in 2015, including millions for defective Takata airbags. In 2014, 2.6 million G.M. cars were recalled worldwide for a deadly ignition-switch defect; in 2013, 1.6 million Jeeps for exploding gas tanks; in 2009 and 2010, more than 10 million Toyotas for sudden acceleration. In the 1970s, 1.5 million Ford Pintos \u2014 half of all those produced \u2014 were recalled for fuel-tank fires in rear-end collisions.In addition to millions of other recalls in the 1980s and \u201990s, Mr. Ditlow and his organization achieved lemon laws in all 50 states to protect consumers. Over the last 25 years, he also served on the boards of Consumers Union, the environmental group Friends of the Earth and the Canadian highway and the auto safety organization Automobile Protection Association.He often sought data under the Freedom of Information laws and sometimes found shocking unintended revelations. In 1978, he discovered a secret internal memo that raised questions about the safety of Firestone 500 steel-belted radial tires sold in the \u201970s. A dozen deaths resulted from blowouts caused by tires that overheated. He pressed the issue, and 15 million tires were recalled.Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, called Mr. Ditlow \u201cthe \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019 for auto safety when it came to investigating and identifying faulty vehicle systems.\u201dShe added, \u201cHe was a trusted ally, and his veracity made him an indispensable resource to the safety and consumer communities, elected officials, government agencies, the media and the public.\u201dClarence Mintzer Ditlow III was born on Jan. 26, 1944, one of three children of Clarence Mintzer Ditlow Jr. and the former Myrtice Lamb, and grew up in Camp Hill, Pa. His father was a service manager at a Chevrolet dealership in Harrisburg, Pa. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania in 1965. After working for five years as a patent examiner in the United States Patent Office, he received a juris doctorate from Georgetown University in 1970 and a master\u2019s degree in law at Harvard in 1971.Drawn by Mr. Nader\u2019s crusading for consumers, Mr. Ditlow, in the late \u201960s, joined what the press called \u201cNader\u2019s Raiders,\u201d young volunteers who investigated the Federal Trade Commission and in their reports found it to be \u201cpassive\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201dA formal study by the American Bar Association then led to an overhaul that emphasized more aggressive consumer protections and antitrust enforcement.Later, Mr. Ditlow joined another Nader spinoff, the Public Interest Research Group, which lobbied for consumer protections, environmental regulations and other progressive goals. He was a lawyer for the group until 1976, when, at Mr. Nader\u2019s behest, he took over the Center for Auto Safety.Mr. Ditlow, who lived in Washington, is survived by his wife, Marilyn J. Herman, and a sister.\u201cIn its zeal to advance driverless vehicles, N.H.T.S.A. has forgotten its mission is to ensure safety, not promote gee-whiz vehicle technology to increase sales,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is an inherent conflict of interest for any agency to both promote and regulate technology. N.H.T.S.A.\u2019s deference to industry initiatives in lieu of safety standards represents an abdication of regulatory responsibilities that is unprecedented in the history of the agency.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated several statistics. The total number of vehicle recalls in the United States in 2015 was 51 million, not 60 million. The number of General Motors cars recalled worldwide in 2014 for an ignition-switch defect was 2.6 million, not 1.4 million. And the number of Jeeps recalled in 2013 for exploding gas tanks was 1.6 million, not two million.Advertisement"}

But in the economic swoon today, getting by as an investor, says one wealthy Russian in the capital, means thinking small.\u201cIn the past two years, Russia has changed quite a bit,\u201d said Aleksei A. Kozlov, a partner in a private equity firm. \u201cBefore we invested in simple things like stocks and large company debt, but we changed strategy because the risk just wasn\u2019t justified.\u201d\u201cThe business climate is extraordinarily murky, and the judicial system is poor,\u201d Mr. Kozlov said. But opportunity exists in untapped potential in the creative and educated population, particularly in Moscow.\u201cWe invest in medium businesses that would be very difficult to take away from the owners, and that are in demand,\u201d he said. A favorite category is private medical clinics, which are booming given cuts to state medical services. Because the doctor talent pool is the heart of the company, it cannot easily be seized, reducing risk.Mining for minds, and not for minerals, has been paying off, Mr. Kozlov said. Despite Russia\u2019s woes, a space exists for private investors.Mr. Kozlov\u2019s private equity firm typically steps in to replace bank loans, taking from 25 percent to 49 percent of shares in a closed stock company in exchange.\u201cA lot of companies have defaulted because of the currency drop, the sanctions or counter-sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the businessmen are good at what they do, but they are weak in financing,\u201d which is where he sees his firm\u2019s role. The firm, which has about $25 million invested in small and medium-size businesses, rarely puts more than $1 million into any one company.\u201cWe don\u2019t have companies with a lot of capital \u2014 land, machines, tools, or anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all risk, all hard to sell.\u201dMr. Kozlov, 42, is married to a prominent political activist, Olga Romanova. Like many businessmen, he failed once spectacularly, before bouncing back \u2014 with a Russian twist.\u201cI had a corporate dispute with my partner, who was a member of the Senate,\u201d and well-connected with prosecutors, he explained. At issue was ownership of a factory outside Moscow that was making artificial leather. In 2008, Mr. Kozlov was arrested on fraud charges he said were trumped up.When his legal problems were finally resolved, Ms. Romanova suggested the couple leave Russia. \u201cMy wife said, \u2018You are exonerated, but it\u2019s better to leave. Get out.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kozlov, though, said he knew no other place to go, felt he could still do business in his hometown, still had friends, and in any case, \u201cMoscow is the city I love most in the world.\u201cYou need to fight to the end,\u201d he said of this experience. Paying bribes is a shortcut for the wealthy in Russia, he said, but also a trap. With persistence, it\u2019s possible to run a transparent business, he said. \u201cThe chances are it will be all right.\u201d\u201cWe have been through more than one crisis\u201d in Russia, and times of crisis are always the best for investing, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a time to start. Some parts of the economy fall, other parts rise. It never happens that everything falls at once.\u201d\u201cWhat worries me is the political situation and foreign policy, the conflict that is happening between Russia and a lot of other countries.\u201d He worries that potential buyers of his shares in the small companies may not show up when he wants to exit.On weekends, Mr. Kozlov dedicates time to his wife\u2019s charity, saying he is giving back for the support shown to him during his roughly three-and-a-half years in jail. The government\u2019s business ombudsman estimates more than 100,000 small-business men are in jail in Russia. The charity, among other things, brings clothes and food to jails to pass along to incarcerated businessmen.Another weekend ritual for Mr. Kozlov, as for so many other Russian businessmen, is to visit the Sanduny steam baths, an opulent, Greco-Roman themed bathhouse with a deep history in the Russian capital as a mixing place for the well-to-do.Here, wearing sheets or nothing at all, Russia\u2019s financial and governmental elite let the week\u2019s worries seep away. And sometimes, deals can be cut in the more relaxed atmosphere that could not happen in suits in an office, Mr. Kozlov said.\u201cI go with a group of friends and discuss business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good atmosphere. It\u2019s totally relaxed. And there\u2019re no cellphones bothering us. We go early in the morning, when there aren\u2019t so many people. And we get the pleasure of the steam, and of our company.

Two minutes later, the Argentine woman behind the counter gave him a thumbs up.\u201cIt\u2019s like this everywhere,\u201d said Mr. Jones, 48. \u201cI haven\u2019t paid for a cab since the election.\u201d\u201cYou tell your kids, \u2018Don\u2019t be a bigot,\u2019\u201d he said on camera. \u201cYou tell your kids, \u2018Do your homework and be prepared.\u2019 And then you have this outcome, and you have people putting children to bed tonight. And they\u2019re afraid of breakfast. They\u2019re afraid of, how do I explain this to my children?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say it was a star-making moment,\u201d said Mr. Jones\u2019s friend Ava DuVernay, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker. She quickly added that she had held him in that regard for quite some time, given his three-decade career in civil rights activism, his best-selling books on progressive issues and the considerable time he has spent on the lecture circuit.Growing up in Jackson, Tenn., Mr. Jones knew from an early age he would wind up doing a version of what he is doing now. His parents were educators who taught him about the importance of hard work and social justice.\u201cIn their view, excellence was a weapon against bigotry,\u201d said Mr. Jones, who worked on a student newspaper at the University of Tennessee at Martin before going to Yale Law School.Right after Mr. Jones won a Reebok Human Rights Award in 1998, he spoke at the University of California, Berkeley, and met a law school student named Jana Carter, who ultimately became his wife. (They have two sons, 12 and 8, and live in Los Angeles. Mr. Jones asked that his children\u2019s names not be published.)But suing the police and staging protests took their toll. So did defending those who were released from prison but had no real opportunities for rehabilitation or employment. By 2002, Mr. Jones was seriously burned out.\u201cI went to counseling, meditation groups, did every kind of self-improvement course you could imagine,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cTony Robbins, Landmark Forum, Hoffman Institute. I was like Frankenstein, experimenting on myself.\u201dWith former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s green movement picking up steam, Mr. Jones soon had an epiphany: Why not try to bring together the fights against pollution and poverty, training nonviolent offenders to work in eco-friendly construction, doing things like installing solar panels. He saw it as an ideal form of manual labor, since it couldn\u2019t be outsourced to other countries.The honeymoon was short-lived.As the Drudge Report began linking to the stories and right-wing radio had a field day, it became clear that he had become a liability to the White House and he resigned.Another dark period followed (\u201dan emotional black hole,\u201d as Mr. Jones described it), but he was able to rebuild his reputation.In July 2010, 911truth.org removed his name from a list of those who support its mission, after reviewing its records and failing to find evidence that Mr. Jones had signed the original petition. Then came a visiting professorship at Princeton University and a friendship with Prince, with whom he played table tennis, discussed black history (and was admonished by to stop swearing). And in 2012, CNN hired Mr. Jones to appear on a new iteration of \u201cCrossfire\u201d with Newt Gingrich, Stephanie Cutter and S. E. Cupp.\u201cThe show did not last, but we loved Van\u2019s voice,\u201d said Jeff Zucker, the network\u2019s president, who kept him on afterward as a commentator.They struck up a correspondence and went to breakfast in downtown Los Angeles, where Ms. DuVernay explained that she was working on a documentary about the criminal justice system for Netflix and wanted him to be a part of it.He said yes and referred Ms. DuVernay to Mr. Gingrich, who despite being on the opposite side of the aisle, is now his good friend, and talks in the film about the disparity in sentencing guidelines for white users of powder cocaine and black users of crack cocaine.Central to his progressive mission is finding common ground with right wingers, even as he disagrees with them on matters big and small.\u201cHe makes the conversation better every time he\u2019s a part of it,\u201d said Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor. \u201cHe\u2019s not an ideologue who\u2019s regurgitating talking points. He\u2019s incredibly thoughtful.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a ritual Rock \u2019em Sock \u2019em Robots quality to TV news, where everyone is supposed to come bludgeon the other person with their talking points,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cAnd over the course of the last 18 months, I\u2019ve fallen out of love with that. I think the truth is messy.\u201dThat segues neatly to Mr. Jones\u2019s new web series for CNN, called \u2014 what else? \u2014 \u201cThe Messy Truth.\u201dSeveral thanked Mr. Jones at the end for really listening to them and asked him to pose for pictures. The symbolism of this black man surrounded by a phalanx of star-struck white Trump supporters was hard to miss. (A televised special of \u201cThe Messy Truth\u201d will air on CNN Dec. 6)Consequently, Mr. Jones didn\u2019t want people to infer from his election-night comments that he thinks all of President-elect Trump\u2019s supporters are bigots. At the same time, he thought it was essential not to brush aside the role of racism in Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent.\u201cIf you only focus on the toxic crap, you\u2019re not being fair to the Trump voters,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cBut if you deny all the toxic crap, you\u2019re not being fair to the rest of Americans.\u201dThere is little denying that Mr. Jones is popular among his colleagues at CNN, particularly after watching him last Thursday evening on a rooftop set overlooking the Capitol for a special taping of \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d\u201cWe need more voices like his,\u201d Mr. Khan said.\u201cI think she\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mr. Jones said.If there was anything disappointing about the evening, it was that Mr. Jones\u2019s other on-camera nemesis \u2014 Jeffrey Lord, a staunch Trump defender and former aide to Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp \u2014 wasn\u2019t there for one of their ferocious but friendly altercations.\u201cHow can you not like Jeffrey?\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s adorable. He\u2019s like a Fraggle.\u201dThen he paused. \u201cIf a Fraggle had a tendency towards terrible revisionist history.\u201d\u201cWhich is exactly how I feel about him,\u201d said Mr. Lord, speaking later by phone. \u201cI think Van\u2019s a terrific person and a great friend.

{"Headline": "The Contradiction at the Heart of Donald Trump\u2019s Economic Policy", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsCampaign promises are easy. Governing is hard.It is a truism that Donald J. Trump and his team will soon learn. And a fascinating example has emerged since the election, courtesy of global currency markets. It is a study in the kind of complex trade-offs that Mr. Trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the Oval Office.A centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was the United States\u2019 trade deficits. He pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in American manufacturing.He has also pledged tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. That set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years. That, in turn, is driving the value of the dollar higher. Since Election Day, the dollar is up 3.6 percent against an index of six other major currencies. The value of the Mexican peso has fallen 11 percent against the dollar, a remarkable swing for the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner.You don\u2019t need to be an economist to see what that means: A pricier dollar makes it harder for American manufacturers to compete overseas; it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations elsewhere; and it will, all else being equal, tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower.This is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for American manufacturers and other exporters (though those that ship their goods to Mexico will feel the brunt of it). There was a bigger rise in the dollar in 2014 and 2015 that damaged export sectors even more.But let\u2019s imagine that Mr. Trump follows through on the policy mix he\u2019s hinted at so far: a combination of loose fiscal policy (think more spending on defense and infrastructure, and tax cuts) and tighter monetary policy (the Federal Reserve raising interest rates faster than had seemed likely before the election). At that point, the dollar could move decisively higher, creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other.As a rule of thumb, said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a 10 percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit (a broader concept than trade deficit, but closely related) by 1 to 1.5 percent of G.D.P. in the ensuing two to three years.In that case, Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to eliminate the $500 billion United States trade deficit would have just become $180 billion to $270 billion harder.This is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time. The Oval Office debate might go something like this: The commerce secretary complains, \u201cMr. President, this strong dollar is just killing our manufacturers; they can\u2019t compete with this kind of appreciation.\u201d The Treasury secretary, who is in charge of the currency, responds, \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary evil, Mr. President; our economy is booming so much that global investors just can\u2019t get enough of United States assets.\u201dWhen there are these kinds of disputes, the president has to decide. And when a president tries to find a solution that answers both concerns, there are always complex ripples. For example, \u201clet\u2019s appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates\u201d might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export sector, but would mean an increase in inflation \u2014 which will make both the bond market and many retired Americans living on fixed incomes unhappy.None of this is to say that these tensions are unsolvable, or that Mr. Trump won\u2019t overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions. But he will almost certainly find out that \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a slogan, not an answer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Potential Conflicts Around the Globe for Trump, the Businessman President", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byAfter the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the president-elect\u2019s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio\u2019s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including Trump-branded resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio\u2019s son Robbie Antonio said.Mr. Antonio\u2019s combination of jobs \u2014 he is a business partner with Mr. Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the president-elect \u2014 is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table.Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America\u2019s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite.The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What\u2019s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.\u201cI\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it.\u201dIn a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings.\u201cVetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,\u201d she said.But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies.\u201cThis will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,\u201d Mr. Kramer said.Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president\u2019s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president?Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team.\u201cI mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s listen and not prejudge,\u201d said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI want to see what he does as president.\u201dNation Under Pressure, Ventures Under ScrutinyThe Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds \u2014 Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State \u2014 put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra.Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil\u2019s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries.But Brazil\u2019s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades.The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic.The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of \u201chighly suspicious\u201d potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. \u201cIt is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,\u201d Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October.In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies.In a statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.Alan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company \u2014 given that it does not own the hotel \u2014 and \u201chas no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.\u201dEven if Brazil\u2019s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent.\u201cBrazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that\u2019s about all they can do,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.\u201dPotential Pitfalls in Dual RolesOn the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing.In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state\u2019s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization\u2019s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed.The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump\u2019s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were \u201crequesting a concession that could not be given.\u201dBy the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after.\u201cHe thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,\u201d Mr. Chavan said.\u201cThe notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,\u201d Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. \u201cThe Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.\u201dThis example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians \u2014 officially or unofficially \u2014 to push projects through the bureaucracy.Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats \u201cwhose main goal in life is to attract rent,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India.In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs.It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official.Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans.Top officials might \u201cthink in some way the U.S. president will help them,\u201d and \u201ccan put in a friendly word with the banks\u201d to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure.\u201cIf the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will think the president is meeting them.\u201dAnother pitfall is that Donald Trump\u2019s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits.Mr. Trump\u2019s partner in the Trump Tower Mumbai is the Lodha Group, founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 currently the governing party in Parliament \u2014 in Maharashtra State. The Lodha Group has already negotiated with the United States government; it announced a landmark purchase of a property, known as the Washington House, on tony Altamount Road, from the American government for 3.75 billion rupees, almost $70 million.His partner in an office complex in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, is IREO, whose managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the brother-in-law of a Bharatiya Janata member of Parliament, Sudhanshu Mittal. Mr. Mittal, in an interview, has denied having any connection with the real estate company.\u201cBasically this is the globalization of lobbying across countries, which then tries to establish monopoly over real estate,\u201d Mr. Hegde said in an interview. He added that he was already calling for an independent parliamentary investigation of such maneuvers, including Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India.\u201cEstablishing monopoly at the cost of small players by business connections to Mr. Trump is very worrisome,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not at all healthy for a democracy.\u201dMixing Business, Politics and IslamMr. Trump\u2019s business interests in Turkey are emblematic of two weighty contradictions for a businessman turned politician.As a candidate, Mr. Trump railed against moving American jobs overseas and promised to do something about it. As a businessman, he invested in a partnership with a furniture company here, making luxury furniture in the firm\u2019s factory in western Anatolia and selling it in the United States and worldwide \u2014 a partnership that apparently remains active.Mr. Trump the candidate inveighed against Muslims and threatened at least a temporary ban on their entering the United States. Mr. Trump the businessman has in recent years had some of his biggest expansions overseas, including in Muslim countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even Azerbaijan.Turkey\u2019s leader, Mr. Erdogan, visited Trump Towers Istanbul \u2014 one holds luxury apartments and one office space, with a shopping mall connecting the two \u2014 after their completion in 2012, with Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump appearing as part of the celebration the next day.But the presidential campaign demonstrated how the goals of his business and politics ventures can come into direct conflict, particularly once Mr. Trump in December proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, implying that all Muslims might pose a terrorist threat.\u201cWe regret and condemn Trump\u2019s discriminatory remarks,\u201d Bulent Kural, the manager of the Trump Towers Mall, wrote in an email to a reporter at the time, as he announced that the mall was considering removing Mr. Trump\u2019s name. \u201cSuch statements bear no value and are products of a mind that does not understand Islam, a peace religion, at all. Our reaction has been directly expressed to the Trump family. We are reviewing the legal dimension of our relation with the Trump brand.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s next move helped re-establish his standing. After a failed coup in Turkey in July, he defended Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown on dissidents, saying in an interview with The Times that the United States has to \u201cfix our own mess\u201d before trying to alter the behavior of other nations.In between his two remarks \u2014 one infuriating the president of Turkey, the other comforting him \u2014 the calls for the renaming of the Trump Towers Mall ended. But much more is at stake in relations between the United States and Turkey than a shopping mall and two skyscrapers.The recent postelection telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan suggests that business and political roles will continue to be mixed.According to a Turkish journalist, Amberin Zaman, writing in the independent online news outlet Diken, Mr. Trump told the Turkish leader that he and his daughter \u2014 who participated in the call \u2014 admired both Mr. Erdogan and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, Mr. Trump\u2019s business associate in the towers, whom he called \u201ca close friend.\u201dMs. Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said no government officials had disputed her account of the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m of the opinion they were quite happy for this to be published,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump declined to comment about the call.\u201cIt makes me wonder if the Trump administration will use the power of the state to help political or business allies and hurt political adversaries and business rivals,\u201d she said.What Stance Toward Duterte?President Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign has led to the summary deaths of thousands of suspected criminals at the hands of police and vigilantes since he took office June 30. The killing has been condemned by human rights activists \u2014 and the Obama administration.The question now, former State Department officials say, is just what kind of a stand the Trump administration will take as Mr. Trump and his family balance their personal and financial ties with foreign policy demands.Mr. Duterte has made clear that he does not appreciate American meddling in his country\u2019s domestic affairs.\u201cI am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,\u201d Mr. Duterte told reporters in early September, before a scheduled meeting in Laos with Mr. Obama that never took place. \u201cI do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody.\u201dMr. Duterte handpicked Mr. Antonio as his intermediary with the United States, said his press secretary, Ernesto Abella, because of his business success, his previous experience as a special envoy to China and the Philippine president\u2019s \u201cdeep intuition about people.\u201d The appointment will be advantageous for the Philippines, Mr. Abella added, because Mr. Trump already knows Mr. Antonio.Even before Mr. Trump has been sworn in, Mr. Antonio flew to New York and visited Trump Tower, where he met with Mr. Trump\u2019s children, who are executives at the Trump Organization \u2014 which oversees the president-elect\u2019s real estate ventures. This was a business trip, not a diplomatic one, Robbie Antonio, Mr. Antonio\u2019s son and the managing director of the family business, said in an interview.The $150 million tower \u2014 one of the tallest in the Philippines \u2014 is on the gritty side of Makati about two blocks from Manila\u2019s most notorious red-light district, where it is common to see prostitutes soliciting business and people sleeping on sidewalks. Completion, originally scheduled for this year, is now expected in 2017. About 240 of the 260 units have been sold, said Kristina Garcia, the director for investor relations.In the interview at the celebration in Manila on Thursday evening, Robbie Antonio said he had little doubt of his father\u2019s priorities: He will put the Philippines\u2019 interests above those of his company. \u201cIt is for the good of the country now,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we already have is a blurring of the lines between official and business activities,\u201d Mr. Fuchs said. \u201cThe biggest gray area may not be a President Trump himself advocating for favors for the Trump Organization. It\u2019s the diplomats and career officers who will feel the need to perhaps not do things that will harm the Trump Organization\u2019s interests. It is seriously disturbing.\u201dOver a Tiny Snail, Big ConcernsThe vertigo angustior snail is only two millimeters long. But it punches above its weight.The endangered little snail has helped stall Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to build a sea wall to protect the coastline along his Trump International Golf Links course on the west coast of Ireland, in County Clare.Environmentalists, as well as surfers, list a host of concerns about the proposed wall, particularly its potential impact on sand dunes. Along with the snails, a patch of the dunes near the course is protected by European Union rules. But Mr. Trump\u2019s organization has said the golf resort development might be dead in the water without the sea wall, and many locals welcome the business and the jobs it brings.The battle is likely to be decided next year in front of a national planning board, in the weeks or months after Mr. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, several people said.The planning board was overhauled in the 1980s to insulate it from political meddling, and it now has the confidence of environmentalists. But there is little precedent for the Trump situation, which could involve a public hearing.\u201cThey can be long, they can be lively, and a lot of things could be aired,\u201d said Sean O\u2019Leary, the executive director of the Irish Planning Institute, which represents the majority of the country\u2019s professional planners.He noted that the national planning board had considered a development proposed by a politician before, but that was a holiday home that the Irish president wanted to build.\u201cThe scale is slightly different,\u201d he said.Local officials have said the Trump Organization needs to resubmit its application by the end of the year. In a statement, the Trump Organization said it was \u201cconsidering all potential coastal protection options at present\u201d and would be in contact with the local authority before Christmas. The snail, the statement said, \u201cis thriving on the site.\u201d\u201cIts only material threat is that presented by coastal erosion,\u201d it added.Tony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Mr. Trump had once called him because Mr. Lowes\u2019s group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Mr. Trump\u2019s Irish course on environmental grounds.\u201cHe certainly hates wind farms, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mr. Lowes said about the call.His group decided against working with Mr. Trump, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall.\u201cThe dune system will not be able to develop naturally,\u201d Mr. Lowes said. \u201cIt will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die.\u201d He added, \u201cThe whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that.\u201dThe Irish government has zealously courted Mr. Trump. When he visited the course in 2014, he was greeted on the airport tarmac in Shannon with a red carpet, a harpist, a violinist and a singer whose voice cut through the runway clamor.A Transition and a Business PlanMr. Trump\u2019s family appears to have been preparing for the transition to the Oval Office and ways to capitalize on it both in the United States and around the globe.The applications offer a glimpse of where the Trumps may intend to focus their business endeavors. Last month, representatives of the Trump Organization in Indonesia, where Mr. Trump has been pursuing two hotel deals, filed trademark registrations for use of the Trump name in connection with hotel management. Similar filings have been made in Mexico, Canada and the European Union.As he prepares for the presidency, Mr. Trump has made at least one concession so far, he said in the interview with The Times this past week.\u201cIn theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business,\u201d Mr. Trump said, before later adding, \u201cbut I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that\u2019s happening right now.\u201dRichard C.

{"Headline": "A Merger Lawyer Sounds Off on the Short-Term Quest for Profits", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byMartin Lipton, a founding partner of the New York law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, specializes in advising major corporations on mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Lipton, 85, has been instrumental in shaping corporate deal making for decades; he is particularly well known for his efforts to bolster management defenses against hostile takeovers. Mr. Lipton, who set up the firm in 1965 with fellow graduates of New York University School of Law, continues to practice law and speak out against what he sees as the damage that the short-term drive for earnings has done to the economy.  In an interview, he discusses the current merger landscape as well as his work to promote alternatives to what he calls \u201cshort-termism.\u201dWhat trends are you seeing among your clients, in terms of what they are seeking in a transaction?Companies are seeking mergers that do not dilute earnings, as well as mergers that will be viewed as natural extensions of product or of geographic markets \u2014 and, in addition, mergers to maintain position in consolidating industries. With the mergers and acquisitions market having a turbulent and uncertain year so far, what are the dynamics that you\u2019ve observed?The significant influences have been mergers to accommodate and adjust to the impact of new technologies \u2014 such as the Oracle acquisition of NetSuite \u2014 mergers to achieve top-line growth that is otherwise not obtainable in a slow and low-growth economy \u2014 such as Sherwin Williams\u2019s acquisition of Valspar \u2014 and mergers to obtain cost synergies and mergers in response to activist pressures, such as the Dupont merger with Dow Chemical. The primary cause of agreed big mergers falling through has been failing to pass the federal antitrust barriers.Has \u201cBrexit\u201d had any effect on the merger market that you\u2019ve noticed?I have not witnessed any substantial current impact. There has been, however, considerable speculation as to the future impact. But it\u2019s really too early to know.What is your wish list for the coming administration on the legal and regulatory fronts?I strongly support \u2014 and advise \u2014 the Aspen Institute\u2019s American Prosperity Project, which is a nonpartisan framework for long-term investment. Key objectives are tax reform, restoring the country\u2019s infrastructure, discouraging short-termism, encouraging company investment in research and development, long-term capital projects, employee training and pricing carbon to simplify regulation, stimulate investment and raise revenue. In addition, it calls for affordable higher education, making job training available to all and fixing the defects in the Affordable Care Act.In boardrooms, academia and on Wall Street, there is a lot of debate over short-term versus long-term stock prices and what constitutes \u201cfiduciary responsibility\u201d for board members. Is it simply a matter of rewarding investors, who may have a different time frame and focus in mind, compared with the broader societal and political demands that companies and executives consider employees, customers and others in their decisions? The vast majority of funds invested in equities reflect the direct or indirect savings of employees for retirement and the funds of foundations, endowments and families looking for long-term appreciation and future growth in dividends. Institutional investors, asset managers and the companies in which they invest should all recognize a fiduciary duty to manage and invest to achieve sustainable long-term growth in value. There is a raging debate today over the duty of the corporate board of directors. I believe it is to encourage long-term investment for the benefit of the economy, not just the shareholders.You have prepared a road map for the World Economic Forum\u2019s International Business Council called \u201cThe New Paradigm,\u201d in which you talk about the pitfalls of short-termism on societal prosperity. Was there a particular legal case or situation that galvanized your involvement?Short-termism and inadequate public and private investment are major factors in creating the inequality that is plaguing the United States and much of the world today. Knowing of my efforts to fight short-term thinking and strategies and fight attacks by activist hedge funds, the International Business Council invited me to talk about these issues at its August 2015 meeting. Following that, I was asked to help create a paradigm for corporate governance that could be considered at this year\u2019s meeting. I did, and the road map was approved by the council last August.What are the key points for boardrooms, chief executives, investors and governments?A key point is having long-term strategies that are developed by a company with the participation, understanding and approval of the board of directors and are communicated to investors and the public. Other important points are engagement between companies and investors, transparency with respect to companies\u2019 strategies and financial statements; mutual company and investor support for environmental, social and governance issues; and corporate social responsibility. Also, another key point is commitment to long-term investment by companies and commitment to encouraging and protecting those investments by investors.The paper points to the importance of long-term sustainability of corporations and suggests that focus has been lost. Why did that happen, and how important is it that it be restored?It is of the utmost importance. Interest in it waned because of short-term thinking and efforts by activist hedge funds to force short-term actions on companies, both those that are targeted as well as others. Companies began to adopt short-term strategies defensively in an attempt to avoid being targeted by such efforts. That needs to be changed.At your firm, what are you doing to address the issues of gender equality, pay gaps and minority hiring? Are there lessons you have learned that can be applied more broadly?My firm has lock-step compensation for all attorneys, male or female, so that all, from the same year of joining the firm, have the exact same compensation. We think that it is a major factor in the success of our firm. So, too, is our liberal bonus program for all employees. In addition, we have very active minority recruitment and hiring efforts. We offer summer internships for minority law school students and some high school students to encourage those who are interested in becoming attorneys.Advertisement"}

As for Mrs. Clinton, he said, she wants to make clear that she is not ignoring the plight of people who are struggling.More than seven years after the recession ended, employment gains have been remarkably steady, finally leading to a noticeable rise in earnings. Consumers are confident enough to open their wallets and spend. Gas is cheap, home prices are bouncing back and interest rates are low.Since 2010, 15 million jobs have been created. With unemployment below 3 percent in some metropolitan areas like Denver and Madison, Wis., many employers now complain about a shortage of qualified workers.The combination of turnover rates and higher wages suggests that workers, particularly those equipped with higher education and advanced skills, are more willing to take a risk and quit a current job in search of a better one.Many Wall Street analysts said the positive economic news would make it even more likely that policy makers at the Federal Reserve would increase the benchmark interest rate before the end of the year.Still, the financial crisis and the slow-but-unspectacular expansion have left visible scars. Overall economic growth has remained modest. Despite recent improvements, the recovery has failed to deliver to many Americans the sense of job security and steady advancement that traditionally girds the middle class.The type of jobs created is one reason. \u201cWhere we are creating jobs is in service areas, which are not as productive as manufacturing, and lower paying,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201dBy contrast, many areas that swerved heavily Republican four years ago were more likely to rely on traditional blue-collar industries like manufacturing, agriculture and trade.While the health care, financial and business and professional service sectors kept chugging forward, 53,000 manufacturing and nearly 11,000 mining jobs have disappeared in the last year.The rise of temporary gigs and unpredictable work schedules have also contributed to the sense of instability.Corners of the labor market remain in the shadows, as people who could potentially work instead sit at home, so discouraged about their prospects that they rarely bother to look. Overall participation in the labor force has been dragging below 63 percent, down from over 66 percent before the recession. Scraping by on disability payments or help from family, some in this group, including former factory workers, might be lured back \u2014 but only by the right job at the right wage.For older workers and those who have been unemployed for months or years, age discrimination or outdated skills have shut down routes back to work.Yawning inequality continues to divide the ultrawealthy and everyone else.\u201cA sense of struggle and a belief that things are not going to change and this is the new normal has fueled a lot of the angst in this politically charged environment,\u201d Mr. Rozell of George Mason University said.While noting the startling disconnect between the data and the campaign rhetoric, Mr. Rozell said many in the middle-class had been genuinely squeezed. \u201cThis is not merely a perception but a reality,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they\u2019re either running in place or falling a little bit more behind.\u201dBut for all the challenges, there are clear signs that the job market has markedly improved and that the economy is continuing to advance.\u201cThe main message from the payroll report: Jobs are being created and earnings are going up,\u201d Mr. Reinhart of Standish Mellon said. But it is also a report that \u201cgoes right down the middle of the fairway,\u201d he said, which means \u201cyou can spin it either way.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Strange New Land\u2019: America in a Time of Trump", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWhile Donald J. Trump has been vague about his position on many issues, he has been explicit about several that would fundamentally change America\u2019s direction.If his campaign promises become reality \u2014 and it is not clear how many he will actually pursue \u2014 the Affordable Care Act could be repealed with the help of a Republican-dominated House and Senate whose leadership had virtually given up hope of recapturing the White House. Mr. Trump said he would replace the act with something better, but he never offered a plan.The Supreme Court would veer right \u2013 perhaps eventually far to the right of where it was before Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death created a vacancy that Mr. Trump will now fill, and there is the prospect of several more openings during his tenure. The wall he promised along the Mexican border would be built, and the prospect of immigration reform may be buried beneath it.The torture of terrorism suspects, something that President Obama explicitly banned, would return \u2014 interrogation techniques the current C.I.A. director recently said his officers would never return to.Although Mr. Trump will not be able to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, he can legally ignore its provisions, in keeping with his questioning of the existence of man-made climate change. He could proceed with what he once called a ban on Muslims\u2019 entering the country, but later amended \u2013 after being accused of racism \u2013 to a ban on visitors from a list of troubled nations, almost all of which are Muslim-majority.He would pull back the troops that the United States has stationed around the world to keep the peace \u2013 unless America is paid for the protection. He would tell NATO that the United States will live up to its post-World War II security commitments only if other nations first pay their fair share. He repeatedly dismissed the idea that those forward deployments are in America\u2019s own interests, that they prevent Chinese or Russian adventurism and keep open the trade routes for American goods.As the president-elect, Mr. Trump will soon be briefed on how to use America\u2019s nuclear codes \u2013 the codes Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama said he could never be trusted to hold. And within the first year of his presidency, it should become clear whether Mr. Trump meant it when he said that he was comfortable with the thought that Japan and South Korea, both signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, might abandon its longtime commitment and build weapons of their own.If the United States \u201ckeeps on its path, its current path of weakness, they\u2019re going to want to have that anyway, with or without me discussing it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Perhaps the most unpredictable matter is how Mr. Trump will deal with Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, whom he has repeatedly praised in terms that shocked even his own party. Would he lift the sanctions over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea \u2013 a move that Mr. Trump seemed to suggest was justified \u2013 and its harassment of Ukraine? Would he back off from the Obama administration\u2019s decision to bolster the American military presence off Russia\u2019s borders?There has been a growing bipartisan consensus in the foreign policy and intelligence leadership that Russia must be both constrained and contained, its harassment of the new members of NATO halted, its cyberattacks deterred. But Mr. Trump never once argued for Russian containment \u2013 once a staple of his party\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 and repeatedly argued that he, and he alone, could negotiate with authoritarians like Mr. Putin.\u201cMy administration,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwill work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS, and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And that includes Russia.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Putin seemed to return that sentiment, sensing his opportunity and saying he looked forward to restoring \u201cfully fledged\u201d relations with the United States.Mr. Trump dismissed Russia\u2019s human rights violations, its jailing of journalists and political opponents, its rigged elections. He would measure the country, he said, solely by its willingness to chip into American projects.\u201cIf they want to join us by knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very imperfect world, and you can\u2019t always choose your friends. But you can never fail to recognize your enemies.\u201dMr. Trump has been consistent in some areas. Since the late 1980s, he has nurtured a set of preoccupations, chiefly that America\u2019s allies \u2013 Japan and Saudi Arabia among them \u2013 are ripping America off. He maintained that position even as Japan faded from the scene as a major world power and as Saudi Arabia emerged as one of America\u2019s most critical allies in a region of the world where Mr. Trump sees little reason for the United States to remain.The mystery is how much of that kind of talk arises from deeply held beliefs, and how much is an opening bid by the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\u201cHe sees himself as a dealer, a negotiator who knows that you get nowhere unless you threaten,\u201d said Graham Allison, a longtime Harvard professor who has begun a new project in \u201capplied history,\u201d taking lessons from past moments to inform America\u2019s current strategic choices.Indeed, the world is about to discover whether the most outlandish promises Mr. Trump made in his campaign about rethinking the international order \u2013 thoughts that often seemed at best off the cuff \u2013 are about to become reality.The Trump vision, in fact, is an America unbound by a half-century of trade deals, free to pursue a nationalistic approach in which success is measured not by the quality of its alliances but the economic return on its transactions. \u201cWe will not be ripped off anymore,\u201d he said in the interview in March. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be friendly with everybody, but we\u2019re not going to be taken advantage of by anybody.\u201dHe bristled at the suggestion that his wall-building, trade-deal-canceling views would take America back to an era of isolationism, arguing that he was simply freeing the United States from the binds of international rules that are not in the nation\u2019s interests.\u201cNot isolationist, but I am America first,\u201d he said when he was asked whether his own policies had echoes of the movement by the same name championed by Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s.\u201cI like the expression,\u201d he said of \u201cAmerica first.\u201d From that moment on, he began using it at his rallies, and it became the stuff of bumper stickers and chants.He is also unabashedly business first, and that extends to his tax proposals, which also leave the markets deeply uncertain.Starting with the day he descended the long escalator in Trump Tower in June 2015 to begin a quest almost no one thought would succeed, Mr. Trump laid out an agenda of tax cuts \u2013 modest for families, and sharp for businesses \u2013 that he argued would be the stimulus a sluggish economy needs.But he also paired those cuts with a major plan to rebuild America\u2019s dilapidated airports and collapsing bridges, with $137 billion in federal tax credits as an incentive for private industry to spend upward of a trillion more. While privatization is hardly a new idea, Mr. Trump has described an approach few have ever tried before \u2013 and it is far from clear how it would work. Presumably, users of that infrastructure would ultimately pay for it, in tolls and usage taxes, through a mechanism few understand.No one knows how much of this agenda, largely thrown together rather than the product of deep study and debate, is for real. His policy office in Washington, created to lay out the position-papers common to most campaigns, was gradually disbanded. He is famously volatile, capable of changing his mind in an instant if he sees new avenues for profit, all the while denying he had ever suggested another path.In Mr. Trump, Professor Allison sees a revolution in approach reminiscent of the 1828 election of Andrew Jackson, another populist who rode to power rebelling against what amounted to America\u2019s first Establishment.\u201cMy God,\u201d Professor Allison said on Tuesday night, as the results veered toward Mr. Trump. \u201cWe are in a strange new land.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Markets Waver, the Rich Park Money in Luxury Homes", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionEvan Kulman, a broker for the real estate firm Compass, was not surprised when the Amagansett luxury home that he listed for sale on the first of August sold in a swift six weeks \u2014 nearly four times as fast as similar homes were selling a year ago.Generally speaking, buying an upscale property to use as a getaway has traditionally been viewed as a lifestyle investment. Stocks and bonds cannot give you the same satisfaction as a heated saltwater pool with a waterfall, surrounded by mahogany decking, and Amagansett ocean breezes.While owning residential real estate is typically part of a diversified investment portfolio, what is different in the last year or two is the role the uncertain economy is playing in making purchasing decisions.\u201cBut once they have found what they want, there\u2019s more urgency,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said. \u201cIn the past year, they\u2019ve been quicker to pull the trigger on a purchase once they\u2019ve identified such an opportunity.\u201dMany high-net-worth investors are plunking cash in a second or third high-end residence as a safety net, stemming from concern about a wide range of economic and political factors. These include the possibility of rising interest rates in the United States, China\u2019s slowdown, low oil prices, conflicts in the Middle East and the reality that equities have been lethargic and bonds have floundered in a bear market.\u201cThat\u2019s why our members are pulling in on some of their private equity and fixed-income exposure, rolling up their shirt sleeves and getting involved in tangible assets that they buy with cash,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. \u201cFewer people, though, think of it as a pure investment vehicle. They want the security.\u201dAnd they are not just buying United States properties in upscale urban real estate markets like New York and Miami, and vacation spots such as the Hamptons, Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Nantucket, in Massachusetts. \u201cI believe the interest among high-end property buyers in overseas markets is greater than ever right now,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said.\u201cPeople with money are keen to diversify it beyond the U.S. stock market in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cA vacation or second or third home in a sunny Shangri-La is an increasingly appealing option. It\u2019s a hard asset that doubles as a lifestyle enhancement and that cushions the buyer from any shocks U.S. markets may be in for.\u201dThe middle-market buyers are spending $250,000 to $500,000 on single properties, but high-net-worth individuals are spending $1 million or more in many markets, including the Caribbean and Europe, Ms. Peddicord said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased interest in Panama and countries where the U.S. dollar is strong,\u201d she said. These include France, Spain and Portugal.Call it market timing. As investors look for a shelter for some money, luxury home prices have softened and are continuing to decline in many markets.The gap between asking prices and sales prices of luxury homes is widening, according to Luxury Defined 2016, a study of 2015\u2019s top sales in 100 luxury-housing markets worldwide by Christie\u2019s International Real Estate.Beyond more realistic prices and the allure of a stable investment to weather stock market volatility, wealthy buyers are also purchasing eco-friendly homes that are energy efficient and smart homes with the latest tech installed to make it seamless to work from any location, according to the Wealth-X and Sotheby\u2019s report.\u201cBuying an island is an emotional buy, rather than one that\u2019s triggered by economic uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a luxury, not a necessity.

{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Might Do for Working-Class Families", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byWork-Life BalanceAmong the rare areas of agreement in the aftermath of a contentious presidential election: Families with working parents, especially those with lower incomes, are having too hard a time.Many can no longer count on lives that look like the ones their parents led. High-paying manufacturing jobs have been disappearing, especially for men. Fewer people are marrying, and more children are growing up in unstable families. Parents are struggling to work while raising children.President-elect Donald J. Trump vowed to help the working class, and blue-collar whites in particular helped propel him to victory. Although quite a few economists disagree with him on the merits of his prescriptions, he has said cutting taxes, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade deals will ultimately raise incomes of struggling families.His daughter Ivanka has pushed ideas like paid leave and seems to be taking a role in devising new policies. In a statement last week, she said she was distancing herself from certain aspects of her company in order to \u201cbroaden her efforts to take a stance on issues of critical importance to American women and families.\u201dWhich policies will Mr. Trump pursue to directly address the needs of working and working-class families? A look at what he has said \u2014 along with the wish lists of Republicans in Congress, scholars and advisers \u2014 provides some clues.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal would apply only to new mothers, and he said he would pay for it with savings from reducing unemployment insurance fraud, though it\u2019s unclear how that would work.\u201cIf he structures it in a way that it\u2019s not a burden on businesses and does not work against women\u2019s work force participation, I think more Republicans will get behind it,\u201d said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute.Democrats have argued that by limiting parental leave to new mothers, Mr. Trump ignores the role fathers play in raising children, exposes women to discrimination in hiring and neglects the needs of people with ailing or elderly family members.\u201cIt was fantastic to see the Republicans stepping up and having this debate,\u201d said Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who was the chief economist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s transition team. \u201cIt really spoke to how important these issues are in terms of economic policy. But I hope that the actual policies are really grounded more in the evidence of what works than what he\u2019s put out so far.\u201dAnother Democratic dream that Mr. Trump raised on the campaign trail was financial help for child care.\u201cFor many families in our country, child care is now the single largest expense, even more than housing, yet very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area,\u201d he said in September.His proposal would allow parents earning less than $250,000 individually or $500,000 jointly to deduct the average cost of child and elder care from their income taxes. In a nod to social conservatives, he said parents who stayed home with children would also get the child care tax deduction.\u201cThe idea here is letting the family choose how the money is spent,\u201d said Bradford Wilcox, director of the national marriage project at the University of Virginia.For low-income families, Mr. Trump proposed child care spending rebates as part of the earned-income tax credit. He also said he would make pretax dependent care savings accounts available to everyone, not just people whose employers offer them, and give tax deductions to employers that offer on-site child care.Democrats have favored refundable tax credits over deductions because they say they are more helpful to lower-income families, who might not make enough to pay income taxes. Also, credits directly reduce someone\u2019s tax bill, while deductions reduce taxable income but not necessarily the final bill.Democrats see the ultimate goal as high-quality, universal care for young children. There seems to be bipartisan support for a small step in that direction.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got there is a tremendous amount of support from women \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2014 to move forward,\u201d said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee.Mr. Trump has pledged to create 25 million jobs over the next decade. Analysts and policy makers on both sides of the aisle say one route toward that goal is apprenticeships.They are viewed as a way for people to acquire vocational skills while earning money, as opposed to attending college and building up debt. Not only would they address unemployment among people without college degrees, advocates say, but they could also lead to more stable families.\u201cIt\u2019s likely if we can improve the job picture for working-class young adults, they\u2019d have family lives that are more stable,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople want to have earnings, they want to have dignity, they want to show that they\u2019ve been able to master a certain profession, and that gives them a kind of identity,\u201d Mr. Lerman said. \u201cIt has both a social as well as an economic dimension.\u201dThough the idea has received bipartisan support, some Republicans have resisted registered apprenticeships, which are overseen by the Labor Department, because of their association with unions. Some Democrats have questioned whether apprenticeships lead to a two-tier wage system, and have focused instead on making college accessible to more people.Policy makers and researchers have a long list of other policy ideas for Mr. Trump that they believe could help blue-collar families. Some have historically appealed to Republicans, like those that encourage marriage. Others, like mandating predictable work schedules for hourly workers, have been promoted by Democrats.With both parties fighting even more for the allegiance of the working class, there actually might be some movement on some or all of these issues.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": " Egypt Averts Economic Collapse, for Now", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byEditorialA result has been a lack of foreign currency, which has forced many Egyptians to buy dollars on the black market, reduced imports of everything from sugar to cars and led to layoffs in some companies. After President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in 2013, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provided billions of dollars in aid. That saved Egypt, but it also allowed Mr. Sisi, who fears popular unrest, to ignore the I.M.F. and its demands for structural reforms as a condition of its lending.Mr. Sisi, a former general who has become an authoritarian and repressive leader, is not known for his economic expertise or political courage. But several factors \u2014 further economic deterioration, rising criticism of his government and pressure from the United States \u2014 have combined to change his mind. Even so, he waited until now to accept a deal that was tentatively approved in August.Ahead of the float, scheduled to begin on Sunday, the Egyptian central bank had devalued the currency by nearly 50 percent, an effort to guide the level at which it should eventually trade. The move was designed to wipe out the advantage of the black market, which siphoned money from the banking system. Fuel subsidies were also cut. Egypt had already been addressing the I.M.F. requirements that it pass a value added tax, reduce electric subsidies and raise $6 billion in external financing.Whether poor Egyptians can hang on that long is unclear. The price of many subsidized staples, including bread, sugar, rice and cooking oil, could rise. Inflation across the board is already at a seven-year high, about 15 percent, and food prices are even higher. More anger and deprivation could lead to popular unrest, further taxing a country that has experienced enormous upheavals, including the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and the ouster of his successor, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, two years later.Mr. Sisi and other Egyptian leaders will have to convince the public that they have a plan that can rescue the economy without hurting the poor. More broadly, to put Egypt on a path to revival, they must educate and provide jobs for millions of young Egyptians; attract foreign investment to help move many of the nearly seven million government workers to the private sector; reduce the army\u2019s role in the economy; and develop a political system in which ordinary Egyptians, not just the military, can have a voice.Advertisement"}

Trump that put him at odds with his own party.Democrats, who lost the White House and made only nominal gains in the House and Senate, face a profound decision after last week\u2019s stunning defeat: Make common cause where they can with Mr. Trump to try to win back the white, working-class voters he took from them, or resist at every turn, trying to rally their disparate coalition in hopes that discontent with an ineffectual new president will benefit them in 2018.Mr. Trump campaigned on some issues that Democrats have long championed and Republicans resisted: spending more on roads, bridges and rail, punishing American companies that move jobs overseas, ending a lucrative tax break for hedge fund and private equity titans, and making paid maternity leave mandatory.Some Democrats are even co-opting Mr. Trump\u2019s language from the campaign. \u201cEvery single person in our caucus agrees the system is rigged,\u201d said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan.Still, there will be areas of bright-line disagreement.

Bannon as his chief strategist, and will oppose his promised tax cuts for the wealthy and his vow to deport millions of illegal immigrants.What is not clear is whether Mr. Trump will hew to his stated agenda or turn it over to Republican lawmakers who seek a far more traditional conservative program.In several key states, namely Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin, Democratic Senate candidates and the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, failed to connect with middle-class voters, who gravitated instead to the populist appeals of Mr. Trump.\u201cThere is an acknowledgment that it is very shortsighted to blame this loss on a letter from the F.B.I. or what states Hillary went to,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. \u201cWe need to do a better job having a bold sharp focus on the economy,\u201d she said, like the cost of prescription drugs and predatory pricing on foreign steel.\u201cIt is not just being a collection of groups,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s talking about policies in a serious way and talking about them in a way that touches all Americans.\u201d\u201cThis team is ideologically and geographically diverse, it mixes the wisdom of experience with the vigor of youth, at least in Senate years,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.But Mr. Schumer\u2019s immediate challenge will be to meet the often competing imperatives of those senators, who reflect the Democrats\u2019 larger struggle of whether to try to tailor an appeal to the working-class white voters who defected to Mr. Trump or to try to increase the so-called Obama coalition anchored by minority and younger voters.That debate is playing out in some ways in the House, where Democrats have been knotted up in an internal battle over whether Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who hails from one of the wealthiest, most liberal districts in the nation, ought to make room at the top for a new leader, possibly from a Rust Belt state.Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, a former football player from the ailing industrial region around Youngstown, is talking about challenging Ms. Pelosi, and the contrast he would present would be stark.Democrats need someone \u201clike me, who has constituents and friends who are steelworkers or work in construction,\u201d Mr. Ryan told The Youngstown Vindicator. \u201cThe economy and blue-collar jobs are important for us as a party. We need leaders who can go into these Great Lakes districts.\u201dThe struggle to stitch together a winning coalition will play out in the competing policy ideas that Democrats are offering.In a speech this week to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Executive Council, Ms. Warren, who sparred in viciously personal terms with Mr. Trump during the campaign, noted the many ways she agreed with the president-elect.\u201cHe spoke of the need to reform our trade deals so they aren\u2019t raw deals for the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he will not cut Social Security benefits. He talked about the need to address the rising cost of college and about helping working parents struggling with the high cost of child care. He spoke of the urgency of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and putting people back to work. He spoke to the very real sense of millions of Americans that their government and their economy has abandoned them. And he promised to rebuild our economy for working people.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, long a critic of trade deals, said in an interview that he had spoken extensively with Mr. Trump\u2019s trade adviser and would work with him on issues concerning steel workers. \u201cWe can work with him on things we agree on,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cOn Bannon, no.\u201dMr. Brown sent a letter to Mr. Trump urging him to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, make changes to the trade relationship with China and fight currency manipulation, which is also a pet issue of Mr. Schumer. Mr. Sanders put out a statement after the election saying he too would work with Mr. Trump on areas of populist agreement.At the same time, they remain his adversary on other matters. For example, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, now the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe committee will pay very close attention to proposed nominees to ensure the fundamental constitutional rights of Americans are protected.\u201dRepublicans will not like many of these proposals, but they have been fulsome in their praise of Mr. Trump since his election. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for instance, has repeatedly said that he expects Mr. Trump to work with Republicans on their agenda of rolling back the Affordable Care Act and making large-scale changes to the tax code and entitlements.On one area, though, Democrats and Republicans agree: Most of them strongly oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for congressional term limits.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coal Industry Isn\u2019t Coming Back", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAustin, Tex. \u2014 Donald J. Trump made many important campaign promises on his way to victory. But saving coal is one promise he won\u2019t be able to keep.Many in Appalachia and other coal-mining regions believe that President Obama\u2019s supposed war on coal caused a steep decline in the industry\u2019s fortunes. But coal\u2019s struggles to compete are caused by cheap natural gas, cheap renewables, air-quality regulations that got their start in the George W. Bush administration and weaker-than-expected demand for coal in Asia.Nationwide, coal employment peaked in the 1920s. The more recent decline in Appalachian coal employment started in the 1980s during the administration of Ronald Reagan because of the role that automation and mechanization played in replacing miners with machines, especially in mountaintop removal mining. Job losses in Appalachia were compounded by deregulation of the railroads. Freight prices for trains dropped as a result, which meant that Western coal \u2014 which is much cleaner and cheaper than Eastern coal \u2014 could be sold to markets far away, cutting into the market share of Appalachian mines. These market forces recently drove six publicly traded coal producers into bankruptcy in the span of a year.Mr. Trump cannot reverse these trends.For Mr. Trump to improve coal\u2019s fate would require enormous market intervention like direct mandates to consume coal or significant tax breaks to coal\u2019s benefit. These are the exact types of interventions that conflict with decades of Republican orthodoxy supporting competitive markets. Another approach, which appears to be gaining popularity, is to open up more federal lands and waters to oil, gas and coal production.Doing so would only exacerbate coal\u2019s challenges, as it would add to the oversupply of energy, lowering the price of coal, which makes it even harder for coal companies to stay profitable. Those same policy actions would also lead to more gas production, depressing natural gas prices further, which would outcompete coal. Instead of being a virtuous cycle for coal, it looks more like a death spiral. And this is all without environmental regulations related to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which aren\u2019t even scheduled to kick in for several years.Even if the president-elect tried to make these moves, surprising opponents might step in his way. Natural gas companies are the primary beneficiaries of, and now defenders of, clean air and low carbon regulations. They include Exxon Mobil, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, which operates in a lot of countries that care about reducing carbon emissions. The company issued a public statement in support of the Paris climate agreement on Nov. 4, the day it took effect. Shutting down coal in favor of natural gas, which is cleaner and emits much less carbon, is a big business opportunity for companies like Exxon Mobil.In the battle between coal companies and major oil and gas producers, I expect the latter will be victorious.The rapid uptake of cheap renewables is also a contributor to coal\u2019s demise. Mr. Trump made campaign comments suggesting the end of support for renewable energy technologies. But his recent statements call for supporting all energy forms, including renewables, suggesting he won\u2019t target them after all.Even if he did, what are his options? Their tax subsidies are already scheduled to expire or shrink. Plus, wind and solar farms are usually installed in rural Republican districts, which explains why they get so much Republican support in the first place. All those rural districts in America\u2019s wind corridor might not be thrilled if their preferred candidate seeks to undermine one of their most important sources of economic growth.The saving grace for coal production in the United States may be exports to Europe or China. But Europe\u2019s demand for coal is waning. And Mr. Trump seems to be marching us toward a trade war with China. Doing so means the Chinese could retaliate by not buying our coal. And even if a trade war is avoided, cheap coal is readily available from nearby Australia.What does this mean for the average American? More of the same when it comes to energy, which is a good thing. Energy prices will stay low and our air quality will keep improving. And both will help the economy grow.Any way you slice it, coal\u2019s struggles are real and hard to mitigate. No matter how much Mr. Trump tries to protect coal from market competition, doing so will be hard to execute and will get him crosswise with important Republican stakeholders and long-held Republican policy priorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Leader Digs In Against Rising Calls for Impeachment", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 She is facing impeachment and prosecution over allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. One of her advisers is being likened to Rasputin by a shrill South Korean news media. Increasingly large crowds of protesters have taken to the streets, demanding her resignation.President Park Geun-hye has been paralyzed by a bizarre scandal and an escalating public backlash that could make her the first South Korean leader to be removed from office since her father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee, was assassinated in 1979.Moreover, with reports that the cold conflict over North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile program may be heating up as President-elect Donald J. Trump prepares to take office in Washington, the standoff in Seoul could leave the United States with a seriously hobbled ally.On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Seoul for what is believed to be the largest protest against a South Korean president.Ms. Park has remained cloistered in the presidential Blue House, denying the charges against her through a spokesman and refusing to allow prosecutors to question her.\u201cThe president has no intention of stepping down, the people are fighting on the streets, and the government is paralyzed,\u201d said Woo Sang-ho, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party. \u201cWe have no option but to impeach her.\u201dAn impeachment vote, expected early next month, requires a two-thirds majority to pass. If the opposition parties remain united, they will need fewer than 30 votes from Ms. Park\u2019s governing Saenuri Party to impeach her. The vote would have to be ratified by the Constitutional Court.One prominent defection came last week when Kim Moo-sung, a former party chairman and Ms. Park\u2019s presidential campaign manager, vowed to impeach her, saying she had \u201cbetrayed the people and our party.\u201dThe alleged conspiracy revolves around a secret presidential adviser and confidante, Choi Soon-sil, who was indicted on Nov. 20 on charges of exploiting her influence with Ms. Park to gain access to confidential government documents and to force businesses to donate $69 million to two foundations she controlled.Prosecutors said Ms. Park was an accomplice in the scheme, directing her aides to help Ms. Choi shake down major corporations like Samsung and Hyundai.Ms. Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, the founder of the Church of Eternal Life and a self-proclaimed messiah, had been a mentor to Ms. Park. According to a report by the Korean intelligence agency, he approached her after her mother was assassinated in 1974, telling her that her dead mother had spoken to him in his dreams.The report said Mr. Choi had cultivated his influence with Ms. Park, the dictator\u2019s daughter, to solicit bribes and accumulate a family fortune. According to the Nov. 20 indictment, his daughter continued the family business.Ms. Choi\u2019s former driver told the Segye Ilbo newspaper last week that he had delivered a suitcase of cash from the Choi family to bankroll Ms. Park\u2019s run for Parliament in the late 1990s. During her presidential campaign in 2012 and even after her inauguration, Ms. Choi edited Ms. Park\u2019s speeches, Ms. Park has acknowledged.After Ms. Park took office in 2013, Ms. Choi used her connections to force a Seoul university to accept her daughter and give her good grades even though she hardly attended any classes, Education Ministry officials said.In 2014, Ms. Park instructed an aide to ask Hyundai Motor Company to sign a contract with a parts supplier owned by a friend of Ms. Choi\u2019s, prosecutors said in their indictment of Ms. Choi. Ms. Choi later collected $44,000 in kickbacks from her friend. In February, again acting on Ms. Park\u2019s orders, the aide asked Hyundai to hire Ms. Choi\u2019s advertising agency. Ms. Choi\u2019s company earned $780,000 from the account.Ms. Park was accused of leaking secret government documents to Ms. Choi, who did not have security clearance and had no experience in government or policy making. She shared with Ms. Choi classified information on things like appointments to top government jobs and where the government planned to build a sports complex. Two of Ms. Park\u2019s former aides were also indicted.As early as 2013, officials tried to raise alarms about Ms. Park\u2019s relationship with Ms. Choi, only to be demoted, fired or even imprisoned. A police detective who worked in the president\u2019s office filed a report in 2014 accusing relatives and associates of Ms. Choi of meddling in state affairs. The detective was reassigned, and was then charged with leaking government documents, convicted and sent to prison.Ms. Park has publicly apologized twice for the scandal in televised speeches, saying she let her guard down with a trusted friend. But she has not said she knew of any extortion, and her office last week called the prosecutors\u2019 findings groundless.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the prosecutors\u2019 investigation has been fair or politically neutral,\u201d said her spokesman, Jung Youn-kuk.Party loyalists have banded together to thwart the impeachment effort. Lee Jung-hyun, the party\u2019s chairman, warned against breaking ranks: \u201cEven if you jump off because the ship is tilting, the only thing that awaits you is a sea of death.\u201d He also compared party members wanting to impeach Ms. Park to Judas.Still, the prosecutors\u2019 revelations alienated even some of Ms. Park\u2019s staunchest conservative allies, many of whom saw her as a replica of her father, who was revered for leading the country out of poverty. Critics say her administration has been a poor copy, mimicking some of her father\u2019s authoritarian tendencies and lacking his effectiveness and policy drive.She has shunned one-on-one briefings from her top aides and has held only one news conference a year. Her perceived aloofness came under fire after the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014, in which more than 300 people died. She emerged from her residence seven hours after she was first informed of the accident.North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests over the last decade and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles this year, with the professed goal of developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.Although they are disillusioned with Ms. Park, many South Korean conservatives also fear that her travails have increased the chances of a progressive candidate winning the next presidential election and reversing or softening South Korea\u2019s policy on the North.At this point, Ms. Park\u2019s fate may hang on timing as much as the weight of the evidence. If an impeachment bill passes, her presidential powers will be suspended while the Constitutional Court has six months to rule on its validity. Ms. Park\u2019s five-year term ends in February 2018.Analysts say she is buying time by stonewalling the investigation, hoping for the uproar to subside or for the National Assembly or the right-leaning Constitutional Court to vote against impeaching her.Running out the clock on impeachment will not necessarily spare her from prosecution, however. Already identified by prosecutors as a criminal suspect, she could be arrested the day she leaves office and loses her presidential immunity.That does not appear to be a privilege she will give up voluntarily.\u201cShe will sit tight, even if the entire 50 million people of South Korea turn out to deny her presidency and demand her resignation,\u201d former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, Ms. Park\u2019s relative, told the newsmagazine Sisa Journal this month. \u201cOnce she gets bullheaded, no one can budge her.\u201dAn article on Nov. 28 about the defiance of South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, in the face of threats of impeachment and prosecution misstated, in some editions, the time frame for nuclear tests conducted by North Korea, against which Ms. Park has taken a hard line. It has conducted five tests over the last decade, not just this year. (The South Korean Parliament voted to impeach her Dec. 9.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Retreat Into Fortress America", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsFormer Secretary of State Dean Acheson\u2019s memoir, \u201cPresent at the Creation,\u201d is a classic account of how a durable and productive Atlantic alliance, based on common values and a cleareyed judgment of America\u2019s strategic interests, rebuilt Europe after World War II and produced international institutions responsible for the security and expanding economic opportunities that have been of such benefit to the United States.Today we are faced with this question: Will two remarkable events within the past several months, the Brexit vote in Britain and the election of Donald J. Trump as president, threaten to undo what Harry S. Truman, George C. Marshall, Acheson, Dwight D. Eisenhower and their farsighted counterparts in Europe and Asia created 70 years ago?Acheson\u2019s book recounts the struggles, the intense negotiations and the occasionally brilliant statecraft that established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The foundations of NATO became the European Union and other international institutions. They also led to the Bretton Woods agreement stabilizing currencies; the Marshall Plan, which saved much of Europe from tyranny; efforts to devise an international understanding on nuclear weapons; and development of the Truman Doctrine, which halted Communist expansion in Europe.These eventually led to border arrangements that produced freer flows of people and goods, a common currency in much of Europe and, most of all, a stable and secure trans-Atlantic region. These institutions, while not perfect and always ripe for reform and evolution to meet contemporary challenges, have brought prosperity to millions and created a remarkably peaceful period in a European history filled with costly wars.All this and more represented the foundation of an international order not just in Europe but also Asia that would last, with several detours, until 2016.As the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump\u2019s election showed, too many of our fellow citizens feel left out of this history. But, if he is to be taken at his word, Mr. Trump now proposes that these international arrangements be called into question, so far without much of a plan beyond retreating to \u201cFortress America.\u201d On some issues, he has a point: Those NATO allies that have not met their promises to contribute more should help pay for the common defense. But calling into question the solemn guarantee to defend a NATO ally that is attacked can lead only to a test of wills with Russia.Mr. Trump also proposes to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted in 1994 with bipartisan congressional support. Explicitly or implicitly, he offers encouragement to right-wing leaders and parties in several European nations, virtually all of whom share nationalistic and xenophobic beliefs and who wish to erect barriers to immigration similar to Mr. Trump\u2019s wall for the border with Mexico.Or take Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, produced after many months of intense multilateral negotiations, and to cancel the Climate Action Plan created by the Obama administration. Virtually the entire world has signed the Paris accord. Unilateral abrogation would be a huge blow to the United States\u2019 international credibility, and make it impossible for the world to meet the carbon emissions goals necessary to stall global warming.Addressing climate change is not just about \u201csoft power.\u201d Senior military commanders believe that global warming threatens to become a major security problem, with mass migrations from coastal cities and major disruptions in agricultural production.The United States is engaged in a global debate about who will set standards for the future on crucial questions like international governance, human rights, the protection of free market principles and the resolution of problems without resort to force. This matters to Americans, and particularly to the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump and will still have to compete in the global marketplace for jobs, despite the wish that the country go it alone.Truman, Marshall, Acheson and Eisenhower, through their belief in having the strongest military in the world to back a focused and creative diplomacy, put America in a position to lead the world for 70 years. Will Mr. Trump cede that responsibility to Moscow, Beijing or Tehran?The anchor of American military presence in Europe and Asia, including bases and fleets, contributes mightily to stability in both regions. There is no benefit to America in a world where individual nations develop their own security arrangements, including, quite probably, nuclear arsenals. North Korea should be example enough.The surprise, if not shock, of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory lingers. Predictably, much of the focus is on the domestic changes his election may bring. But serious foreign policy experts and institutions must process the implications of his victory and the Brexit vote and place them within the lessons of the post-World War II world.Wise leaders such as Truman, Eisenhower, Marshall and Acheson constructed a temple in which freedom could thrive and economies could prosper. The interior of the temple may be in need of renovation, but Mr. Trump should not pull apart its central pillars and bring it crashing down.William S. Cohen is a former Republican senator and secretary of defense.

{"Headline": "In North Carolina, a Governor\u2019s Race Is Too Close to Call", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byPat McCrory, North Carolina\u2019s Republican governor, trailing by only a few thousand votes in one of the country\u2019s most volatile and expensive races, said early Wednesday that he would not concede the contest until at least Nov. 18, after votes are scrutinized county by county.\u201cThe democratic process is going to proceed in North Carolina for a while,\u201d Mr. McCrory said, on the same night that his Democratic rival, Attorney General Roy Cooper, declared victory. The State Board of Elections reported early Wednesday that, with all of North Carolina\u2019s precincts reporting, Mr. Cooper led Mr. McCrory by fewer than 5,000 votes out of more than 4.6 million that were cast.The North Carolina contest had been one of only a few governor\u2019s races where existing Republican control was considered to be in jeopardy. Mr. McCrory, battered by his support for a law that curbed transgender rights and the subsequent fallout, struggled, even as Donald J. Trump won the state handily.Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said that all counties would begin reviewing thousands of provisional ballots between now and Nov. 18, the date that all counties must canvass, or certify, their vote counts. At that time, if the trailing candidate is within 10,000 votes, he may ask for a recount under North Carolina law.In North Carolina and 11 other races for governor\u2019s offices and in more than 5,900 for state legislative seats, Democrats had hoped on Tuesday to take back some of the vast ground they have lost to Republicans over the last half dozen years as they swept through state capitals. Yet, regardless of the eventual outcome in North Carolina, it appeared that Republicans actually made at least some additional gains, including two governor\u2019s offices, in Missouri and Vermont, and in state Legislatures in Kentucky and Iowa.In Missouri, Eric Greitens, a former member of the Navy SEALs, won the governor\u2019s office, turning over control of the seat to Republicans and easing the way, Missouri Republicans say, for more conservative legislation to clear the state capital.Mr. Greitens, who has portrayed himself as an outsider whose lack of political experience should be viewed as a benefit, beat Chris Koster, the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, who has decades of experience in Missouri politics. Mr. Koster\u2019s current brand of politics \u2014 as a conservative Democrat \u2014 had proven successful in past statewide elections in Missouri.The incumbent, Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who was barred by term limits from running again, had been viewed as a check on the state\u2019s Republican-held legislature and its efforts to pass measures such as legislation barring unions from collecting fees from all workers.And in Vermont, the Democrats lost another governor\u2019s office they had held, when Phil Scott, the Republican lieutenant governor, won. He beat Sue Minter, a Democrat and a former state transportation secretary, in a tight contest to succeed Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who did not seek re-election. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make the economy and affordability Montpelier\u2019s top priorities,\u201d Mr. Scott said, declaring victory late on Tuesday.While an unusually large portion of the governor's seats were open, the result of term limits and candidates who chose to seek other offices, many of the seats did not change partisan hands.In Indiana, where Eric Holcomb was the Republicans\u2019 replacement to run for governor instead of Mike Pence, Mr. Holcomb was elected on Tuesday, overcoming his late arrival to the race, his relative obscurity statewide and a significant challenge from a Democrat.Mr. Holcomb, a former state party chairman who had been appointed Indiana\u2019s lieutenant governor only this year, defeated John Gregg, a Democrat who struck a conciliatory tone on Tuesday night. \u201cSo much is divided in our nation and divided in our state,\u201d Mr. Gregg told a crowd of Democrats who gathered in downtown Indianapolis and saw one candidate after another lose. Mr. Gregg urged his supporters to make Tuesday\u2019s defeat \u201ca point where the healing begins, where we all move closer together, where we begin to move forward as one.\u201dDemocrats held on to at least one governor\u2019s seat that had been seen as up for grabs. West Virginia voters, looking past their state\u2019s diminished economy and their gradual embrace of the Republican Party, elected a Democrat, Jim Justice, as governor on Tuesday. Democrats have remained in the governor\u2019s mansion since 2001.Mr. Justice, a mining executive and the owner of the Greenbrier resort, defeated Bill Cole, the president of the State Senate. He will inherit a state with a 5.8 percent unemployment rate, one of the country\u2019s highest.The fate of the statehouses has huge stakes because so much has taken place in them in recent years. The dominance of Republicans has freed many states to take a significant turn to the right on several issues, even as a divided federal government in Washington finds itself gnarled in gridlock. Republican-led states passed hundreds of laws restricting abortion, while others worked to tighten voter identification laws. Republicans have also controlled the redrawing of political maps in some states, making it more difficult for Democrats to win elections.In North Dakota, voters opted to continue the state\u2019s streak of Republican governors, electing Doug Burgum to succeed Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who did not seek another term. Republicans have controlled the governor\u2019s office in North Dakota since 1992.In Utah, voters backed a second full term for Gov. Gary R. Herbert, a Republican who became the state\u2019s top elected official after the resignation of Jon Huntsman. Mr. Herbert\u2019s victory was never in much doubt in Utah, a reliably conservative state where he won 68 percent of the vote four years ago.In Democratic-leaning Delaware, John Carney, a Democratic member of the United States House, won the race for governor, as was widely expected there.Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, was elected to a second term, defeating Bill Bryant four years after he edged into power.And in Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown won a special election and will finish a term that will end in 2019. Ms. Brown, a Democrat, became governor last year after an ethics scandal prompted the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat. Ms. Brown easily defeated four other candidates, including Bud Pierce, the Republican nominee.But the state legislative contests had potential to have a still wider effect on policy across the country. At least 20 chambers were seen as highly competitive in the election, and a majority of those are now controlled by Republicans.Republicans hoped to hold control and extend their reach in places like Iowa, where they succeeded in taking over the state Senate on Tuesday. They also seized control of Kentucky\u2019s House of Representatives, which Democrats have held since 1922. The chamber was the last in the South that Democrats led, and it had been a firewall for the party in Kentucky, where Republicans have won significant victories in recent years.Jess Bidgood contributed from Bangor, Maine; Mitch Smith from Indianapolis; and Richard Fausset from Raleigh, N.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toblerone Alters Shape of 2 Chocolate Bars, and Fans Are Outraged", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The peaks are slimmer and the valleys are wider, but the price hasn\u2019t changed.The maker of Toblerone, the Swiss chocolate bar, has reconfigured the unique appearance of two of its milk-chocolate versions, with narrower triangles and a larger gap between peaks.\u201cToblerone is all about the triangle,\u201d Stephen Mason said on Facebook. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just lose a triangle at the end or make the triangles smaller?\u201dThe 170-gram and 400-gram milk chocolate bars (about six ounces and 14 ounces) have been cut down to 150 grams and 360 grams to reduce costs, because of rising prices for ingredients, said Mondelez International, which makes the bars. The altered shape is visible only once the box is opened.The effect of the alterations on the signature shape of the 400-gram bar, which is sold across Europe, was less noticeable, a company spokeswoman said.Most consumers are unaware of the changes because the product usually looks and is priced the same \u2014 there is simply less of it \u2014 but the newer, gappier Toblerone bar felt treasonous to the brand\u2019s loyal consumers.\u201cThe key part of a Toblerone is the Alpine shape of peaks,\u201d Fiona Prince said on Facebook.The change to the 400-gram bar was made early this year, and the 150-gram version appeared in British discount stores last month.Gemma Pryor, the head of external affairs for Britain at Mondelez International, said the company had to choose between changing the shape of the bar and raising prices \u2014 a significant issue in Britain, where the economy is facing uncertainty and the value of the pound has weakened after voters backed leaving the European Union in a June referendum.\u201cWe need to make sure it remains on shelves and it\u2019s still affordable,\u201d Ms. Pryor said, adding that, \u201cit would be disingenuous to make the link between this and \u2018Brexit.\u2019 \u201dThe triangular milk chocolate bar, sold in a yellow package with red letters, has been around since 1908. The founder, Theodor Tobler, combined his family name with \u201ctorrone,\u201d the Italian word for nougat, and patented his recipe of chocolate mixed with milk and honey.Mondelez International noted that while the overall look of the bar is different, the recipe remains the same and the chocolate is still made in Switzerland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the University of Alabama Became a National Player", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byPlight of the Public UIt\u2019s only fitting that the admissions tour for the University of Alabama starts in Bryant-Denny Stadium. On game days, the campus\u2019s iconic quad \u2014 a painterly expanse of lawn, majestic trees and bell tower \u2014 becomes a crimson and white tent city of numbered tailgating plots, some with electricity.Coach Nick Saban is so revered that as rain threatened this year\u2019s sorority rush, prayers went out to \u201cLord Saban\u201d for sunshine, which brings us to the second thing Bama is famous for: Greek life. Banners flew along Colonial Drive after the August rush. One, for Alpha Omicron Pi, descended over four white pillars boasting, with a pun on the house\u2019s floral symbol, of recruiting success: \u201cWe Rose Higher Than the Rest.\u201dHow then, you might ask, did Brianna Zavilowitz, a Staten Islander with 2120 SATs and a 4.0 grade-point average, daughter of a retired N.Y.P.D. detective and an air traffic controller, with zero interest in pledging and middling enthusiasm for football, wind up in Tuscaloosa for college?This was not the capricious choice of a freckle-faced teenager, which she is. Rather, the reason she turned down the University of California, Berkeley, and canceled her Columbia University interview (\u201cI figured I didn\u2019t want to waste his time\u201d) reveals the new competitive ethos in public higher education: Think big and recruit.Ms. Zavilowitz first noticed the university on Facebook. A few clicks and Bama was omnipresent. Pop-ups, emails and literature piqued her interest. She visited, took the bus tour, was tickled by the Southern hospitality. Her mother appreciated detailed parent information suggesting \u201ca well-oiled machine.\u201d There was more: a full-tuition scholarship. \u201cMy mom kept telling me not to look at the money,\u201d said Ms. Zavilowitz, chatting in red Alabama footies. \u201cBut it definitely helped.\u201d Roll, Tide, roll.With state funding now just 12.5 percent of the university\u2019s budget, campus leaders have mapped an offensive strategy to grow in size, prestige and, most important, revenue. The endgame is to become a national player known for more than championship football. Berkeley, the University of Michigan and University of Virginia are the schools \u201cwe compare ourselves against,\u201d said Kevin W. Whitaker, Alabama\u2019s interim provost,Alabama has invested heavily to lure students like Ms. Zavilowitz, who does not qualify for federal financial aid. The university is spending $100.6 million in merit aid, up from $8.3 million a decade ago and more than twice what it allocates to students with financial need. It also has hired an army of recruiters to put Bama on college lists of full-paying students who, a few years ago, might not have looked its way.Each year, about 18 percent of freshmen leave their home state for college in another. They tend to be the best prepared academically and most able to pay, said Thomas G. Mortenson, senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education, who tracks this data. Achieving students are likely to be bound for successful lives, enhancing their alma mater\u2019s status and, the hope is, filling its coffers with donations. Schools want them.Merit aid given to achievers has a magnetic effect. \u201cIf we recruit five students from a high school, we will get 10 students the next year and they may not all be scholarship students,\u201d said Stuart R. Bell, president of the University of Alabama.Instead of layoffs and cuts, some public universities facing budget challenges are following this blueprint for survival: higher charges to students, and more of them. Nowadays, the real money comes from tuition and fees. The average for four-year public colleges rose 81 percent in constant dollars between 2000 and 2014. At Alabama, tuition and fees have about doubled in the last decade, to $10,470 for residents and to $26,950 for nonresidents.Even when it awards full-tuition scholarships, the university makes money \u2014 on dorm rooms and meal plans, books, football tickets, hoodies and school spirit items like the giant Bama banner Ms. Zavilowitz and her roommates bought for the blank wall in the suite\u2019s common area. All told, these extras and essentials brought in $173 million last year \u2014 on top of $633 million in tuition and fees, up from $135 million in 2005.\u201cI hate very much to use this analogy, but it\u2019s like running a business,\u201d Dr. Whitaker said.The impact of this strategy is visible on campus, where pristine brick Greek Revival buildings seem like toy models slipped from boxes and set on green plots amid curvilinear streets of fresh black asphalt. In the past decade, the university has added 64 buildings, including an engineering research quad with labs for testing combustion engines and large-scale structures (a \u201cshake table\u201d simulates earthquakes).\u201cThe university must have campus facilities that are competitive to meet student enrollment goals,\u201d according to the 2014-15 financial statement. Gleaming new labs await researchers, and there are plans to expand graduate programs and hire 300 to 400 new faculty members in the next five years. Around Tuscaloosa are cranes, fenced-off construction zones and new apartments (8,270 additional beds since 2012). The parking lots are license-plate bingo heaven.Ambition has its costs. As colleges adopt enrollment management strategies like aggressive recruiting and merit aid, the traditional role of public colleges is changing, said Stephen Burd, senior policy analyst at the think tank New America. This is leaving state residents and lower-income students with \u201cno four-year schools where they can go in an affordable way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is less aid for low-income students and there are fewer seats\u201d as colleges favor those who already have an advantage.Alabamians are now just 43 percent of the student body. On a campus bus tour crowded with out-of-state students and parents, a senior in a red dress, black heels and pearls (a guide uniform) offered that fact as a selling point.\u2022\u201cWhat happens when states stop funding higher education altogether?\u201d he asked. Politicians have made college affordability a talking point, but education experts like Mr. Mortenson doubt that election-year proposals will reverse the trend, at least any time soon.Overall enrollments have been dropping since 2010. That has all but the nation\u2019s top schools battling for students. Alabama may be a standout example, but across the country university flagships and even regional campuses once focused on serving nearby counties are extending their reach. Arizona State University, Oregon State University and Utah State University have amped up online programs (Starbucks reimburses employee tuition for A.S.U. Online degrees), expanded their campuses, are building or buying satellite campuses and, in the process, significantly raising enrollments.When states suffer budget woes, others feast. \u201cStress in California,\u201d said Kent Hopkins, vice president of enrollment management at A.S.U., \u201cis definitely an advantage as we talk to California students and their parents.\u201d Enrollments from California are up 46 percent in six years. It might be ugly, but once-staid public universities \u201care doing what private colleges have done for a long time,\u201d said Kevin W. Crockett, president of enrollment management at Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a higher education consulting firm. They are asking, \u201cWhat is the appropriate price point for students to cross state lines?\u201dMiami University of Ohio got on board for fall 2010, announcing a scholarship \u201cguarantee\u201d with an ACT of 26 and a 3.7 G.P.A. The university had fallen \u201cseveral hundred\u201d short of the freshman goal, said Susan K. Schaurer, assistant vice president for enrollment management and director of admission. \u201cOur mantra had been to accomplish, but do so humbly and quietly,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are thrust into an incredibly competitive higher education landscape, you have to shift that thinking.\u201dOver the next 18 months, Miami hired two national recruiters and bought contact information from the College Board and ACT for students around the country instead of tapping the usual feeder schools. With its classical arches, tranquil courtyards and liberal arts curriculum, it is often mistaken for a private college, which it is capitalizing on, reaching out to families \u201cseeking that private school experience,\u201d Ms. Schaurer said. Applications are up 62 percent since 2010; two-thirds now come from out of state. Last year, for example, 41 students applied from Greenwich High School in Connecticut and 33 from Mira Costa High School in California.With its success in drawing more students, Miami has walked back on merit aid; there are still scholarships, but the guarantee is gone and, as of this fall, the qualifying ACT score is higher. These days, Ms. Schaurer said, \u201ca student with a 26 ACT is really below average.\u201d Miami now has seven recruiters.The University of South Carolina has 20. Since it hired someone to recruit in Massachusetts, applicants from that state have jumped, from 335 in 2010 to 881 last year, and enrollments have nearly tripled, from 57 to 156; Massachusetts now ranks eighth as a source of out-of-staters to the Columbia, S.C., campus. Over all, applications from out-of-state students are now double those of residents.Recruiters are shaking up college conversations, said Paul C. Kaser, a counselor at the Bergen County Academies, a public magnet school in New Jersey where nearly half the seniors are National Merit Scholars, finalists, semifinalists or commended students, and parents and students meet counselors with Excel spreadsheets in hand. \u201cThere might be an old stereotype of public universities not caring and just looking at numbers,\u201d he said, but their recruiters \u201ccome to our school to be on panels, to host luncheons.\u201d They respond to emails within hours. As a result, students are now at universities that \u201cwere not even on our radar five years ago.\u201d When he first mentioned Alabama four years ago, he recalled, \u201cthe parents said, \u2018Alabama!?\u2019 I said, \u2018Hear me out.\u2019\u201dOne student starts a pipeline. Five graduates of the Academies are now there.The University of Alabama has 45 recruiters \u2014 36 outside of Alabama, including Dee McGraw-Hickey, a Tuscaloosa native living on Long Island. Last spring, she tweeted as her recruits committed. In August, she held a send-off lunch at her home with sweet tea, lemonade and a game of corn hole in the backyard. Her schedule includes 80 events between September and Thanksgiving. She loves to mention merit aid at them because so many from her region \u2014 New York City, Long Island and Connecticut \u2014 qualify, giving Alabama a competitive edge.\u201cEverybody wants the kids from the Northeast and California,\u201d according to Mr. Burd of New America. \u201cThey are wealthy and they tend to be good students.\u201dIn the past six years, in Ms. McGraw-Hickey\u2019s region, applications to Alabama rose from 193 to 903. At Alabama, recruiting assignments go all the way to the top. Dr. Bell, the president, routinely travels to meet parents and students, recently telling a young man in Dallas not to visit campus without stopping by. \u201cHe came to my office on Friday with his dad,\u201d Dr. Bell said.Raising alumni money for academics, much as the Crimson Tide Foundation has cultivated athletic boosters, is on Dr. Bell\u2019s wish list. \u201cThat is an area we are going to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a culture shift.\u201dIt\u2019s one that more are making.While most public universities have sat back as privates landed eye-popping donations, that\u2019s changing. As dusk settled over New York City, the Empire State Building was lit up in green and gold, the colors of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va. Uptown, over miniature Virginia ham sandwiches, the college thanked 400 local donors who helped to raise $52 million. A new $1 billion campaign has as a goal to secure donations from 40 percent of its alumni. This year, donor dollars covered 12.8 percent of William & Mary\u2019s budget; 11.8 percent came from the state. In 1980, state money provided nearly 43 percent of the budget.It is no accident that states with among the largest drops in state allocations since 2008 \u2014 Arizona (down 56 percent), South Carolina (down 37 percent) and Alabama (down 36 percent), according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \u2014 have entrepreneurial public campuses trained on growth. Those same states also had the greatest net gain in students: More entered the state to attend their four-year public institutions than left to study elsewhere, according to fall 2014 data, the most recent available.New Jersey has long struggled to draw students. It had the second largest net loss in students, after Illinois. Rutgers officials noticed. An honors college, another popular recruiting tool, opened at the New Brunswick campus last year in a new building with stained glass windows, carpeted dorm rooms and light-filled social spaces, including a coffee bar with fireplace. Campus recruiting goals are modest \u2014 7 percent more out-of-state students and 2 percent more international students for next fall \u2014 but officials certainly want to keep the likes of Daniel Ferioli from Hillsdale, N.J., with a 2300 SAT and 3.98 G.P.A., from leaving.\u201cWe have been losing top academic talent to other states,\u201d said Matt Matsuda, academic dean for the honors college. Halting that \u201cis something that from the president\u2019s office on down has been a priority.\u201d Mr. Ferioli turned down Georgetown for Rutgers, reasoning that with plans for an M.B.A. from Harvard or Wharton the honors college offered a similar path at a better price. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth paying all that money for Georgetown if I would end up in the same place.\u201dJillian Mazon, too, had weighed college options carefully. When we met before classes began in August, she was still getting used to the South (\u201cEveryone calls you ma\u2019am\u201d) and the serious sorority rush (35 parties in seven days; she\u2019s in Delta Gamma). It was 96 degrees, and unbearably humid for a Burlington, Conn., native. She showed me her dorm room. Over the desk was a map of Connecticut made by one of her six best friends; arrows radiated from a heart with the distance to each one\u2019s college. She has gone the farthest: 1,135.6 miles.An organized person whose closet is arranged by color, Ms. Mazon started her college list in eighth grade and toured 26 campuses. Her mother liked Duke, but she was certain after two visits that Vanderbilt was her top choice \u2014 until the full-tuition scholarship and admission to the honors college came from Alabama. She didn\u2019t apply elsewhere. \u201cI would never want to be $70,000 a year in debt,\u201d said Ms. Mazon, who plans a career in finance.For Ms. Mazon, whose mother is a teacher and whose father heads maintenance at an assisted living complex, graduating nearly debt-free put Alabama alongside prestigious privates in her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am at a disadvantage,\u201d Ms. Mazon said, leaning against a crimson padded bench, green toenails slipped into flip-flops. \u201cHow many Alabama alumni are out there compared to Harvard? My freshman class is 8,000 kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThat network is so extensive, it is insane.\u201d\u2022To critics who say public universities are shirking their public service role, Dr. Bell counters that enrolling out-of-state students seeds the Alabama economy with talent. It\u2019s not uncommon for students to settle in the state of their alma mater \u2014 \u201cone of the biggest drivers of growth in our state,\u201d he said.But Natasha Levitin, daughter of computer programmers, is looking forward to \u201cgoing home\u201d for a job as an analyst at Wells Fargo in New York City after graduation this spring. \u201cI was just looking for the school that was the best bang for the buck,\u201d she said.When she matriculated, she had not grasped the culture of the campus. \u201cI had never seen a Confederate flag until I came down here,\u201d she said. Then there was the dominance of Greek life. She had known a sorority was not for her. But neither was she prepared for the protests and national attention after the student newspaper reported the exclusion of black women from sororities, partly because of pressure from the Machine, a secret society that controls Greek life, to block pledges based on skin color.\u201cSeeing it happen my freshman year that black girls are not allowed in sororities because they are black \u2014 it was embarrassing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all over the news.\u201d Suddenly, she had to defend her choice of Alabama to friends on social media.The campus is now 11 percent African-American. It was 15 percent in 2000. The state is 27 percent black.When I asked Ms. McGraw-Hickey how diversity concerns figured in her recruiting, she said it rarely comes up. \u201cI feel like to me the campus is diverse in so many ways,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cYou see so many students from all over the country, from different religions, different racial backgrounds.\u201dHow a school with deep Southern history builds a modern national identity is an open question. To students from the urban North, the oft-evoked appeal to Bama \u201cpride\u201d and \u201ctradition\u201d may seem more like stubborn adherence to parochial views than something rich to rally behind. More than just ACT scores and G.P.A.\u2019s, growth in stature is also about extending cultural boundaries.Diluting ties to home states and communities, and filling classrooms with students from around the nation, can free ingrained perspectives.On the other hand, it may transform these entrepreneurial public players \u2014 the pathway to better fortune for generations of state residents \u2014 into yet another national brand for those with resources. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you can travel around the country and you see the same suburban stores everywhere you go, the same chains,\u201d said Mr. Burd of New America. \u201cYou don\u2019t diversify by only bringing in the most privileged people. You just get people who have pretty much the same values.\u201dMr. Mortenson understands the pressures for revenue. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what kind of future are we building for the country?\u201dLaura Pappano is writer-in-residence at Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.Advertisement"}

Trump to step up deportations, announced a plan on Wednesday to provide more protection and support for Mexican immigrants in the United States and urged the Mexican population to \u201cstay calm.\u201dIn a statement and an accompanying video, both titled \u201cWe Are With You,\u201d the ministry laid out an 11-point plan intended to help Mexicans in the United States get accurate information about possible changes in immigration policy and avoid falling victim to \u201cabuse and fraud.\u201dThe ministry\u2019s strategy promised an expansion of services offered by Mexico\u2019s Embassy in Washington and its 50 consulates around the United States, including a 24-hour toll-free consular hotline to address migration concerns and report possible fraud; an increase in outreach efforts in neighborhoods with large Mexican populations; and more help for Mexican immigrants to secure identification documents for them and for their American-born children.While the statements did not specifically mention Mr. Trump or his deportation plans, Mexican officials have been worried about the possibility that he might follow through on his campaign promises to step up deportations beyond even the record rates that President Obama has achieved.His estimate contrasted with that of the Obama administration, which put the number of \u201cremoval criminal aliens\u201d at about 1.9 million, including undocumented immigrants as well as legal permanent residents and immigrants with temporary visas.For the Mexican authorities, Mr. Trump\u2019s deportation policy could also have major domestic implications in Mexico, including the return of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans who might struggle to find jobs in an economy already troubled by high unemployment rates. Mass deportations might also result in the loss of many millions of dollars in remittances for Mexico.Because of an editing error, an article on Nov. 17 about an announcement by Mexico\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, following Donald J.

{"Headline": "Diplomats Confront New Threat to Paris Climate Pact: Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byInstead, with the election of Donald J. Trump \u2014 and his threat to withdraw the United States from the accord \u2014 shellshocked negotiators confronted potentially deep fissures developing in the international consensus on climate change. On the sidelines of the negotiations, some diplomats turned from talking of rising seas and climbing temperatures toward how to punish the United States if Mr. Trump follows through, possibly with a carbon-pollution tax on imports of American-made goods.\u201cA carbon tariff against the United States is an option for us,\u201d Rodolfo Lacy Tamayo, Mexico\u2019s under secretary for environmental policy and planning, said in an interview here. He added, \u201cWe will apply any kind of policy necessary to defend the quality of life for our people, to protect our environment and to protect our industries.\u201dForcing United States industries to turn to cleaner energy sources with the hammer of an import tariff is not far-fetched. Countries imposing costs on their own industries to control carbon emissions could tell the World Trade Organization that United States industries are operating under an unfair trade advantage by avoiding any cost for their pollution.The tax would be calculated based on the amount of carbon pollution associated with the manufacturing of each product. That would impose a painful cost on the heaviest industrial polluters, particularly on exporters of products containing steel and cement.\u201cThe Paris Agreement is meant to get everyone on board in one structure where you can address climate change together,\u201d said Dirk Forrister, the president and chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Organization, a nonprofit organization that consults with governments and companies. \u201cBut if one big country backs out it could trigger a whole wave of trade responses.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere is no need to start a trade war over climate change. But it might happen.\u201dThe Marrakesh summit meeting was expected to conclude late Friday or early Saturday with a declaration that all governments will continue to carry out and strengthen the Paris accord, and a timetable for adopting the details of the pact, such as a global system to monitor and verify carbon emission reductions at the national level.In Washington, the Obama administration has pressed forward with its environmental agenda as if Mr. Trump had not been elected. An offshore drilling plan unveiled Friday assumes continued bans on oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans \u2014 which the Trump administration could easily reverse.But diplomats are quietly going off their agendas to begin planning how to react if Mr. Trump chooses to reject the Paris Agreement. The pact, as it stands, contains no enforcement measures, such as economic sanctions, for countries that do not comply. But individual governments could put trade sanctions in place on their own or in concert.In Mexico, which is already preparing for a newly adversarial relationship with an American president who has threatened to build a wall along the border, government officials said they have begun considering the idea of a carbon tariff.Canada, the United States\u2019 largest trading partner, is also discussing a tariff. Some Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Quebec, already have carbon tax policies that include fees imposed on fossil-fueled energy generated across provincial borders.\u201cI see that extending across the Canadian border if the U.S. pulls out of Paris,\u201d said Lisa DeMarco, a senior partner with DeMarco, Allan, a Toronto-based climate law firm that advises Canadian provinces and international businesses.\u201cIf you want to sell your goods in Canada, you\u2019d have to meet the same emissions standards,\u201d she said.In France, Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president who is campaigning to hold that office again, suggested this week that the European Union impose a carbon tariff on American imports if Washington withdraws.Supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s climate change policies say they are not worried.\u201cIt\u2019s an empty threat,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles and David Koch and which Mr. Trump has cited as influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals.Economists widely agree that the most effective way to attack climate change is to tax or otherwise put a price on planet-warming pollution. Most of the world\u2019s major economies, including the European Union and China as well as Canada and Mexico, have already begun to put domestic carbon pricing programs in place.The European Union\u2019s \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system capped carbon pollution levels and created a market for companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. China plans to implement a similar program next year and Mexico, which already taxes carbon pollution, is on track to put in place its own cap-and-trade program by 2018.Canada\u2019s national carbon pricing system, set to go into force by 2019, allows its provinces to mix cap-and-trade programs and carbon taxes.With Congress unwilling to pass either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program, President Obama pushed for climate change regulations to limit carbon emissions while encouraging states to create their own cap-and-trade programs to comply.Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese, campaigned on a promise to dismantle the Obama administration\u2019s climate rules and put coal miners back to work. But since he was elected, he has not commented publicly on his climate plans. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.While some politicians are already responding belligerently, other European officials are taking a wait-and-see approach. \u201cIn the European Union we have a strong climate policy,\u201d said Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the bloc\u2019s commissioner on climate action. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think it is appropriate yet to speak to a U.S. carbon tariff, because the new U.S. president has not yet taken a public position on climate.\u201dAnd a trade war may be a price too high for countries whose economies depend on American consumers and suppliers. Asked if Beijing would consider a carbon tariff against the United States, Liu Zhenmin, China\u2019s lead climate negotiator, said, \u201cAddressing climate change should not become an obstacle for trade. China will continue to promote free trade.\u201dChinese negotiators appear to be hoping for the best.\u201cA wise leader will follow the global and historical trend,\u201d Xie Zhenhua, a Chinese negotiator, said.The idea that other nations might punish the United States with a pollution import tax is a switch. President Obama\u2019s failed cap-and-trade bill in 2010 included a carbon tariff on imports from other countries. The United States hoped to use trade sanctions to punish other countries, particularly China, for polluting and push them toward global climate talks.Now the policy could be reversed and used against the United States, as much of the rest of the world economy moves ahead with pricing carbon, while Washington prepared to roll back its climate change plan.Economists warn that a carbon tariff now could backfire.\u201cIs he the sort of person who would back down or would he retaliate?\u201d Robert N. Stavins, the director of Harvard University\u2019s environmental economics program, asked about Mr. Trump. \u201cHe seems like the kind of person who would retaliate. And then you\u2019d have a trade war.\u201dMr. Stavins added, \u201cThat would be an example of the cure being worse than the disease.\u201dOther experts agreed that choosing to impose a carbon tariff should be done with care for the consequences.\u201cA carbon tariff is a power tool,\u201d Mr. Forrister said. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that any country would use lightly. Things would have to get pretty serious for any country to take it out of the toolbox and use it. But given the current situation it\u2019s a possibility that they would do it.\u201dMr. Tamayo, the Mexican official, said that for the moment, Mexico is more focused on linking its forthcoming cap-and-trade program with similar programs in California and Quebec.\u201cFor now,\u201d he said, \u201cwe hope to build bridges, not walls.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Leans on Carrier to Keep 2,000 U.S. Jobs From Moving to Mexico", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byThe value of the bully pulpit of the president of the United States can\u2019t be measured on a corporate spreadsheet or the Excel file of a Wall Street analyst.But as President-elect Donald J. Trump tries to stop Carrier from moving more than 2,000 jobs to Mexico, the company is learning that the pulpit can be powerful indeed.Carrier, in the middle of negotiations with the incoming administration, may end up keeping some of the jobs in Indiana. In exchange, the incoming administration could ease up on regulation for businesses and cool campaign rhetoric on imposing tariffs.Officials familiar with the situation, who insisted on anonymity because talks were still underway, described the discussion on Friday as a two-way negotiation, with both sides seeking a compromise.For both Mr. Trump and the company, the stakes are huge. His promise to reverse trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and bring back manufacturing jobs to the United States was critical in taking the Rust Belt out of the Democratic column and winning the White House.\u201cTrump cannot afford to back down on this one,\u201d said Robert Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. \u201cHe prides himself on the art of the deal, and he\u2019s going to make Carrier an offer they can\u2019t refuse.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hallmark case and if Trump can win it, which I think he will, it will send a message to every single American company that\u2019s thinking of going offshore,\u201d Mr. Dilenschneider added.For the company, the costs of defying the president-elect are at least as high, if not higher, and may well outweigh the tens of millions of dollars to be saved by relocating production to Monterrey, Mexico, from Indiana.United Technologies is among the country\u2019s biggest military contractors, producing engines for the Pentagon\u2019s most advanced fighter jets and receiving more than $5 billion annually from the federal government. That equals 10 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.The size of the federal government\u2019s dealings with United Technologies has also caught the eye of legislators on Capitol Hill, like Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana.\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to ask the same workers who have been laid off to pay tax dollars that will go to the company that fired them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together as Americans. When our workers succeed, our economy succeeds and our defense contractors succeed.\u201dSenator Donnelly is pushing for the government to consider outsourcing as a factor in deciding which companies receive federal contracts.Kenneth G. Dau-Schmidt, a professor of labor and employment law at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University, said he also thought that Mr. Trump \u201ccould get a win here,\u201d adding, \u201cBecause they are a defense contractor, the federal government has some leverage.\u201d\u201cWhether he can do something that benefits the working class in general is a different story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe underlying problems are very hard to address. Trying to hold back the economic tide of automation, and the loss of middle-class manufacturing jobs, is something I\u2019m not sure anybody can do.\u201dWhile Carrier is best known for its air-conditioners, it also sells a variety of other heating and cooling equipment for homes and small businesses, like the furnaces and fan coils made at the Indianapolis factory.And as a consumer-oriented business, Carrier is much more vulnerable to public pressure than firms that primarily deal with other businesses, said Barbara J. Fick, a professor of law at Notre Dame Law School.She noted that not far from Notre Dame\u2019s campus, at a plant in South Bend, Honeywell has been engaged in a bitter standoff since May with employees represented by the United Automobile Workers.\u201cHoneywell doesn\u2019t make a lot of things you can boycott,\u201d Ms. Fick said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly business-to-business. To the extent that Carrier makes air-conditioners and furnaces, you can hit them with the pocketbook.\u201dAlthough Carrier workers in Indianapolis say management at the factory has been traveling back and forth to Mexico in recent months, with Mexican engineers measuring machines that are expected to be transported to Monterrey, there is plenty of time for the company to change course.In a presentation this week, Carrier\u2019s management told employees that the fan coil line would be the first to close in mid-2017, eliminating 300 to 400 jobs. But as that line closes, about 100 jobs will be saved temporarily by the creation of a new night shift making high-efficiency furnaces.High-efficiency furnace production is not set to end until mid- to late 2018, while the final line to close, mid-efficiency furnaces, won\u2019t he shuttered until early 2019.That staggered schedule has given workers some hope that if a compromise between the new administration and the company does emerge, it may revolve around keeping the gas furnace production lines open, even if a smaller number of jobs are relocated to Mexico in the meantime.If a deal was reached, it could also help set the tone for a Trump presidency in terms of corporate America, Mr. Dilenschneider said.Much as Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision to fire striking air traffic controllers in 1981 signaled to organized labor that political momentum was no longer on their side, keeping Carrier in Indiana would show that a Republican president was willing to stand up to corporate America.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference who the president is,\u201d Mr. Dilenschneider said. \u201cIf the president of the United States says, \u2018Do it,\u2019 you\u2019ve got to give it some very serious thought.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton, a Woman Dogged by Men\u2019s Misdeeds", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byNotebookWhen millions of women cast their votes for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, they may have been thinking about male power as much as female equality \u2014 about the sleazebags who never heard \u201cno,\u201d or the male bosses who lowballed them in salary negotiations, or those men in positions of authority who patronized them or ignored them altogether. There was a sense of collective curiosity and anticipation: Would having a woman serve in the most powerful role in the country make any of those scenarios less likely for women going forward?That question may be answered one day, but not with Hillary Clinton. Already the consensus about why she lost seems to have moved away from gender and toward her, personally: She was the wrong candidate from the start, she never adequately addressed issues of her integrity, she represented a party too closely aligned with elites, in ways the mainstream media vastly underappreciated. But we will also never know how much of her candidacy was derailed by the fact of her being female \u2014 not just the way she was victimized, but the way she suffered, even, for other women\u2019s victimization.In some perverse way, both Hillary and Huma Abedin may have found some motivating energy in their husbands\u2019 chronic sexual exploits. They were strong second fiddles and then survivors who struck out on their own to try to change the world for women, having recognized all too clearly the limits of the powerful men in their lives. That is how the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, in \u201cNo Ordinary Time,\u201d explains the political rise of Eleanor Roosevelt, who came into her own in the years after she made a painful discovery: a packet of love letters her own social secretary sent to her husband. Following that revelation, Roosevelt proceeded as if \u201ca path had opened, a possibility of standing apart from Franklin,\u201d writes Goodwin.Margaret Chase Smith, who was married to a congressman before serving as a congresswoman herself, recognized, writes the historian Ellen Fitzpatrick, that \u201cwomen loved my husband, and he loved them,\u201d before going on to become the first woman to be placed in nomination for the presidency by a major party, in 1964. Hillary Clinton first considered running for a prominent office \u2014 governor of Arkansas \u2014 around 1989, at a time when her marriage was at a crisis point.It is heartbreaking that in the end, Clinton and Abedin were unable to escape their husbands\u2019 pasts, at least in this election. The fallout from their husbands\u2019 alleged sexual transgression was among the forces that thwarted their hopes and the hopes of the women (and men) counting on their leadership. It is easy enough to see a metaphor in Weiner\u2019s alleged actions \u2014 he is a man accused of undermining a 15-year-old girl just as she is at the age when she is about to come into her own power, and it is her gender that makes her vulnerable.The headlines about the emails forced Clinton, in the last days of her campaign, to turn away from the one issue that seemed to move non-college-educated white women \u2014 the economy \u2014 and instead spend those last days defending herself or trying to attack Trump, said the pollster Stan Greenberg. And her own campaign believes that suburban white women turned out in lower numbers than expected because the email issue arose. That segment of the population was the one most perturbed by the video that emerged of Donald Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women. That a subsequent news story of alleged sexual assault \u2014 a crime in which Clinton was obviously blameless \u2014 would then lead some of those same suburban white women to discount the female candidate is a painful, paradoxical quirk of history.During the election, there was hope that all the stories of sexual assault or harassment would at least force members of both parties to consider the gravity of the issue and its shocking prevalence; there was a momentary sense of women rising up to demand better and to refuse to stay silent. And yet even that seemingly noncontroversial issue took on a partisan feel, as Trump supporters dismissed mere \u201clocker room talk.\u201d A brutal lesson of this election, for so many women, may be that there is no escaping the direct or indirect effects of the male libido. Now that Hillary has lost, it is hard to shake the impression that the leches have won.Susan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Both considerations underpinned the leadership\u2019s decision to go along with raising his status.\u201cHe\u2019s seen the Arab Spring and the crisis of power across the Middle East and northern Africa, and he\u2019s discussed that several times, and he\u2019s also seen the lessons from Soviet history,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cEstablishing him as the core is to set the tune that the central leader must have authority.\u201dFor Mr. Xi, 63, the son of a revolutionary veteran who revered Mao, fear of risking the Communist Party\u2019s hold on power is especially heartfelt.He enjoys mastery over the elite, but he has expressed frustration about a lack of control at the grass roots. That paradoxical combination explains why his power can appear both commanding and brittle, even after four years as national leader. And it is likely to magnify his drive for control, even if he enters a second term as president in 2017 surrounded by officials he has handpicked, several experts said.\u201cWe must strengthen centralized and united leadership at the center,\u201d Mr. Deng added. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, we can\u2019t solve the problems that we\u2019re confronting.\u201dIn the days after his elevation to \u201ccore\u201d status, Mr. Xi has moved quickly to keep positioning his allies for promotion into the party\u2019s top ranks next year, when nearly half the 25 members of the decision-making Politburo are to retire.\u201cXi has repeatedly gone out of his way to place individuals with whom he had past ties in important positions, sometimes against party norms or convention,\u201d he said. \u201cXi clearly wants his trusted followers in the key positions in the party, the military and in the internal security apparatus.\u201dThat does not mean that all posts will be stacked with Mr. Xi\u2019s longtime friends. The decision that elevated him to \u201ccore\u201d also emphasized \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d \u2014 giving all senior officials a say \u2014 and said they should come from the \u201cfive lakes and four seas,\u201d meaning from varied backgrounds.\u201cHe will draw on a wide variety of constituencies,\u201d Mr. Teiwes said by email. \u201cThese will obviously include people he knows well and trusts, and others with primary connections elsewhere will adjust their loyalties and in some sense become \u2018Xi\u2019s people.\u2019 \u201dBut adulation of Mr. Xi has been accompanied by an undercurrent of frustration that his plans have repeatedly run into obstacles, impeding efforts to tame threats to party control.The decision last week summed up those risks as the \u201cFour Big Ordeals\u201d: maintaining power, managing the country\u2019s exposure to the international economy, coping with market changes and navigating an uncertain external environment.Above all, Mr. Xi worries about obstacles that could prevent China from shifting toward slower but more sustainable growth, and from turning his anti-corruption crackdown into lasting improvements in government, several experts said.\u201cWithout delivery, his agenda is in trouble,\u201d Mr. Zheng said. \u201cPeople are very realistic.

Years of easy money from central banks have helped inflate the prices of just about everything an investor can buy, like stocks or property.\u201cI think that clearly we are in an asset bubble,\u201d Mr. Shan said in a phone interview from Hong Kong.So what should investors do? Mr. Shan recommended a return to the basics. His firm, with $16 billion under management in funds that specialize in fields like private equity and real estate, is looking for value in areas still growing in a sluggish world economy.\u201cWe are not chasing bubbles as many of our peers do,\u201d said Mr. Shan, a former professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cI only want to look at the fundamentals. I want to know how much money this business makes.\u201dIn that, Mr. Shan is positioned well. PAG focuses mainly on investments in or related to Asia, where the fortunes of China, India and other countries remain buoyant even as the global economy sags.\u201cIf you look around the world, Asia is where the growth is,\u201d he said.Mr. Shan said that China, where he was born, \u201cis the most interesting market because of its growth.\u201dBut that growth has declined. In the third quarter, China\u2019s gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent, in contrast with the 9 percent to 10 percent the country enjoyed for years. The downturn has intensified the struggles of what Mr. Shan called China\u2019s \u201cbad economy\u201d \u2014 mainly manufacturing and heavy industries, which have too many factories and too much debt.Mr. Shan, however, also sees a \u201cgood economy\u201d in China. As the government tries to shift the country\u2019s engine of growth away from investing in steel mills and apartment blocks, it is encouraging more private consumption. That is opening opportunities in areas that cater to Chinese consumers.\u201cChina has a split personality at this moment,\u201d Mr. Shan said. But \u201cthe good economy remains quite resilient in spite of the bad economy.\u201dMr. Shan, who once served as a senior partner at the investment firm TPG, is focusing his money on companies that can benefit from China\u2019s rising consumerism. In October, PAG\u2019s private-equity arm invested an undisclosed amount in the Paradise Group, based in Singapore, which operates restaurants across China and Southeast Asia.In August, it spent about $250 million to acquire Golden Apple, which runs a chain of private schools from Chengdu, China\u2019s western metropolis.In its most prominent deal, PAG in April joined Apex Technology, a Chinese producer of ink cartridge components, and others in the acquisition of the printer maker Lexmark International, based in Kentucky, a transaction valued at $3.6 billion. The deal was appealing to PAG, in part because the new owners hope to raise the profile of Lexmark printers in the Chinese marketplace.Mr. Shan also wants to take advantage of some of Asia\u2019s bad economy. With debt levels continuing to rise in China, PAG is developing a strategy for buying and profiting from bad loans at Chinese banks. He also says his firm has generated good returns from buying distressed debt backed by real estate in the region. PAG, which has 30 percent of its capital in real estate, is still sniffing around for reasonably priced property as well.\u201cWe invest in real estate where the price is not out of whack,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is in times like this that you really can differentiate among investors who will be more focused on fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cwho invests along with the rest of the bandwagon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Finance and Technology Come Together", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe hub of the technology industry is Silicon Valley. In finance, the world capitals have long been London and New York.But in the emerging industry that combines finance and technology, often called fintech, the center of activity is less obvious.The traditional centers, London, New York and San Francisco, are attracting substantial investment, but so are less-established capitals like Berlin, Singapore and Sydney, Australia.The lack of a clear winner has been apparent to executives like Chris Larsen, chief executive of the San Francisco company Ripple, which offers international payment processing services to banks. Mr. Larsen fields a steady stream of calls from representatives of foreign cities hoping to lure him and his company to their shores to bolster their fintech credentials.\u201cEverybody recognizes that the capital of fintech has yet to be determined,\u201d said Mr. Larsen, who founded the fintech companies Prosper and E-Loan.Several cities around the world are competing to become the capital, or at least one of the regional capitals, of fintech. If the young financial technology industry has the transformative effect that some have imagined, the contest could also determine the future capitals of finance as a whole.At the recent Money 2020 conference in Las Vegas, the largest fintech conference in the world, government representatives from Dublin, Hong Kong, London, Luxembourg and Belfast, Northern Ireland, among others, were walking the floor looking to woo companies.In the exhibition hall, Invest Hong Kong, a quasi-governmental agency, had a booth where start-ups could learn about the regulatory benefits and subsidies the government of Hong Kong recently began to offer fintech companies.\u201cThe whole industry is waiting to be disrupted,\u201d said Lawrence Tang, the agency employee at the booth. \u201cWe are at the right place to try to capture some of these high-flying fintech companies.\u201dHong Kong has the benefit of being connected to China, which has, mostly in isolation, been home to some of the most notable developments in the fintech world. Chinese fintech companies like Alipay and Tencent have been processing more financial transactions than the largest Chinese banks. The four most highly valued fintech unicorns (companies valued at $1 billion or more) are based in mainland China, according to most recent surveys.Early this year the chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s central bank, Norman Chan, announced a multipronged effort to become a \u201cFintech Innovation Hub.\u201dThe city-state\u2019s government is offering to put money into companies that locate in Hong Kong, and its regulators have a new \u201csupervisory sandbox\u201d where new companies can try their products without needing to fulfill all the normal regulatory requirements. Hong Kong brought in several foreign companies this month to attend its first government-sponsored conference.Hong Kong has lots of competition from Singapore, which recently started its own aggressive effort to become a capital of fintech. Singapore has begun offering some of the same inducements as Hong Kong, including its first fintech week.Last year, more fintech companies in Singapore raised money from venture capitalists than did in Hong Kong, but the Singapore companies raised less money in sum than those in Hong Kong, according to data from Accenture.Nowhere, though, has the competition been fiercer than in Europe, because of the British vote to leave the European Union.Before the so-called Brexit vote, London had clearly established itself as the hub of fintech activity for the Continent. But if Brexit comes to pass, financial institutions in London are likely to find it harder to do business freely with European companies and financial institutions. Equally important for start-ups, young developers from outside Britain may not be able to remain in London.The day after the Brexit vote, the Irish government sent a playful message to Mr. Hinrikus and TransferWise on Twitter: \u201cDublin sure is a nice place for a fintech company. Just saying\u2026\u201dBerlin, which has become a hub for young technology workers, took an even more aggressive approach. The city\u2019s minister of the economy and technology wrote a letter to dozens of fintech companies in London pitching Berlin as a better option.Berlin Partner, a government-financed agency leading the city\u2019s effort, opened a small office in London in September to court fintech companies full time.Stefan Franzke, chief executive of Berlin Partner, said that five London-based fintech start-ups had already decided to move to Berlin, and he has 40 more prospects.Mr. Franzke said that many banks did not want their fintech employees in a financial capital like London or Frankfurt, because they needed the workers to avoid the mind-set of the traditional financial industry.\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated to disrupt something in your headquarters,\u201d Mr. Franzke said.Mr. Hinrikus, of TransferWise, said that a year ago he would have told young companies to go to London. \u201cBut right now,\u201d he said, \u201cI would recommend people to go to Berlin.\u201dLondon is certainly not watching business go quietly. The primary British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has set up Project Innovate to help start-ups clear regulatory hurdles.At the conference in Las Vegas, the British Department for International Trade was co-host of a breakfast at a French bistro, where start-ups could meet with the head of Project Innovate.Shaul David, the department\u2019s leader of fintech expansion, said at the breakfast that his job was certainly easier before the Brexit vote. But he said his goal remained the same, \u201cto make London synonymous with fintech as much as Silicon Valley is with technology more broadly.\u201dIn the United States, the government has been slow to act, but the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been talking about creating a type of charter, with more limited rules, for fintech companies.And the United States still has the hub of tech talent that is Silicon Valley. Mr. Larsen, of Ripple, still has his headquarters in San Francisco, but said the United States might not keep companies like his.\u201cIt\u2019s not prewritten that we are going to win this battle,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Gloat, Democrats", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisIt is hard to begrudge Democrats their gloating about the state of the Republican Party as the campaign enters its final hours. By most measures, Donald J. Trump appears headed for defeat. Win or lose, the Republican Party is scattered and divided, and faces wrenching post-Election Day battles over its future.But it is not only the Republicans. Democrats face their own challenges after Nov. 8, whether or not Hillary Clinton captures the White House. While not as severe as those roiling the Republican Party, those challenges stand ready to complicate the early days of a Clinton presidency, should she win, and any effort by the Democratic Party to move into a post-Clinton era, should she lose.The sprawling Democratic coalition lined up behind Mrs. Clinton \u2014 labor and Silicon Valley moguls, Latinos and white middle-class women \u2014 could easily splinter as attention turns from a campaign to the specifics of governance. Moderate Democrats in Congress will need to worry about primary challenges from the left, much as moderate Republicans faced Tea Party challenges from the right. That will be particularly true should Mrs. Clinton begin striking compromises with Republicans to pass, to name one example, an immigration overhaul.And while the tensions between Mrs. Clinton and her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, may be forgotten, they are hardly gone. Mr. Trump was a powerful force that helped bridge two wings of the Democratic Party through the fall, so his departure might not be an entirely welcome development for the party.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mistrust of Hillary among people who supported Sanders, even among people who didn\u2019t support Sanders,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of pent-up energy behind a social Democratic agenda.\u201dAfter a hard-fought primary season the Democrats have plenty of internal wounds to heal.The challenges go beyond party fractures. Howard Dean, a former governor of Vermont who ran for president in 2004, said Democrats needed to reach out to blue-collar white voters who fled the party and voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cIf we win, it means we can win without them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is aimed at being able to run the country properly. You can\u2019t run the country as divided as it is today. And you can\u2019t govern with just 55 percent of the country. We have to reach out to working-class white voters in order to govern.\u201dMrs. Clinton is by nature a cautious politician and centrist. Her husband, Bill Clinton, won the presidency in 1992 by moving the party to the middle, championing policies that have come under fire from the left during his wife\u2019s campaign.Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers suggest that the ideological schisms among Democrats have been exaggerated. And Mrs. Clinton has certainly taken steps to bridge the gap, such as coming out in favor of free college tuition for some students (though not as broadly as Mr. Sanders would have liked).\u201cI think we can overstate the divisions,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a leader of the White House transition team appointed by Mrs. Clinton. \u201cEvery primary in any party brings out fundamental questions about where the party is and what it stands for. The debates within the Democratic Party are pale compared to the Republican Party.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not ignoring those differences,\u201d she added. \u201cBut they are far less stark.\u201dMrs. Clinton faces complicated terrain in dealing with a Congress already reeling after years of paralysis. And this election has emboldened the party\u2019s left. Though it is hardly clear if it will be the well-organized threat to moderate Democrats that Tea Party challengers were to moderate Republicans, the party\u2019s liberal wing stands to be a powerful force with clear ideas of what the party embodies \u2014 and those ideas don\u2019t necessarily track what Mrs. Clinton said during her campaign. And the House is almost certain to remain Republican.The Republican electorate has fractured over the policy views and personal history of Donald J. Trump.\u201cThere will be a lot of people pulling on President Clinton for a lot of things,\u201d said Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who supported Mr. Sanders in the primary. \u201cAnd absolutely everybody is going to have to be energetic in advocating for the things that they consider most important. But I think people like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders will have an advantage, in that we already have very progressive positions in the party platform.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton will also be under considerable pressure to accommodate moderate Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 who gave her support, centrist credentials and money during the campaign. That includes Senator Chuck Schumer, her fellow New York Democrat who is in line to be the next majority leader if the party takes the Senate. Mr. Schumer has little interest in letting Mrs. Clinton and the party move to the left, given that Senate Democrats already face an uphill battle in 2018 to retain seats.Any effort by Mrs. Clinton to court Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, as suggested by Mr. Dean, will have to be done delicately, given the concerns of Latino and African-American supporters, among others, who recoiled at the racially tinged nature of some of his appeals. Within her party, she is going to face conflicting demands from old-line liberal economists intent on bolstering the American manufacturing base against the new wave of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have a decidedly different view of the future of the American economy.Even if Mrs. Clinton faces the same Republican leaders who resisted giving Mr. Obama any legislative victories, Mr. Schumer said he thought both parties would be under pressure to get things done once the election was over.\u201cWe have to work with the other side of the aisle,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to put things on the floor and have all our people vote for it and then say, \u2018Those sons of guns opposed it but we tried\u2019 \u2014 that is not good enough.\u201dIn any event, there are some Democrats who suggest that even in defeat, Mr. Trump \u2014 or at least his supporters \u2014 would remain very much on the scene, allowing Mrs. Clinton and Democrats to avoid what otherwise might have been a moment of political reckoning.\u201cTrump may go away, but Trumpism may be around for a while,\u201d Mr. Ellison said. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t invent this movement. He just spoke to it.\u201dAdam Nagourney is the Los Angeles bureau chief and a former chief national political correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The States That College Graduates Are Most Likely to Leave", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byMoving OnThis year\u2019s election has forced Americans to take notice of class divisions between workers. And while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes \u2014 the rural Rust Belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban college-educated worker \u2014 they\u2019re rooted in a real dynamic. Many of the most skilled workers \u2014 young people with college degrees \u2014 are leaving struggling regions of America for cities, specifically for cities in Southern and coastal states.In theory, these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas. But moving outside one\u2019s region is relatively rare these days, and even more rare for someone without a college degree.For America\u2019s first century, internal migration was largely driven by farming \u2014 moving west to new land. But toward the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century, migration began to be driven by people moving to American cities \u2014 small and large.This advantage provided by clusters of cities is helpful for coastal states, which tend to contain many big metro areas, like San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco in California, or the so-called Acela corridor stretching from Washington to Boston. But it can be bad news for inland areas with one or two large cities that are farther apart: Omaha and Kansas City, Mo., say; or Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio.The flows of young college graduates out of a state can often be replaced by flows of young college graduates moving in. The problem that many interior states face is that young college graduates moving into the state aren\u2019t keeping up with those that are leaving.\u201cLots of talented young people all over the country are eager to see new sights \u2014 what is different, and a problem for Michigan is that we have an unusually low rate of immigration,\u201d said Charley Ballard, a regional economist at Michigan State University, in an email.Keeping young college graduates would help alleviate the effects of globalization and technological change on these local economies. It\u2019s not surprising that many states with net losses in their young and college-educated populations also showed some big gains for Donald J. Trump relative to Mitt Romney\u2019s performance in 2012.The map shows the total net migration figures for those with a college degree under 40 between 2000 and 2015. (People who grew up in one state, went to college in another and then moved somewhere else are counted as migrating from the state where they attended college.) Generally, Rust Belt and Midwest states like Ohio, Michigan and Iowa, and Plains states like South Dakota and Nebraska have seen the largest net losses in younger, college-educated people.The places that are gaining college graduates tend to be coastal and Southern states like California, Maryland, Texas and South Carolina. Two exceptions to this trend are New York and Massachusetts, states that also produce a large number of college graduates to begin with (harsh winters and a high cost of living could be factors).One reason that inland states have a reasonable case for disappointment at not keeping their young college graduates: They\u2019re helping to pay to educate them. A majority of college graduates get their degrees from public universities, which are partly funded by state governments. Of course this doesn\u2019t diminish the other important benefits that public universities bring to each state\u2019s economy, but if states are losing more college graduates than they are holding or bringing in, they\u2019re effectively subsidizing other states\u2019 skilled labor forces.Cities in these states do have some advantages. The cost of living is lower, mostly because housing is cheaper. Outdoor recreation is often more accessible. Still, these areas are in a bind: Without jobs to offer, luring young college-educated people is hard. At the same time, it\u2019s hard to create jobs without a college-educated labor force.To Mr. Ballard, it\u2019s not clear that one policy proposal exists that could jump-start the process. \u201cIt really is a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody out there that thinks there\u2019s some quick, easy solution.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not all about jobs,\u201d Mr. Ballard said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have it be a place where people want to live.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind 2016\u2019s Turmoil, a Crisis of White Identity", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterCall it the crisis of whiteness.White anxiety has fueled this year\u2019s political tumult in the West: Britain\u2019s surprising vote to exit the European Union, Donald J. Trump\u2019s unexpected capture of the Republican presidential nomination in the United States, the rise of right-wing nationalism in Norway, Hungary, Austria and Greece.Whiteness, in this context, is more than just skin color. You could define it as membership in the \u201cethno-national majority,\u201d but that\u2019s a mouthful. What it really means is the privilege of not being defined as \u201cother.\u201dWhiteness means being part of the group whose appearance, traditions, religion and even food are the default norm. It\u2019s being a person who, by unspoken rules, was long entitled as part of \u201cus\u201d instead of \u201cthem.\u201dBut national and racial identity were often conflated for the white majority. That identity felt to many white people like one of the most important pillars holding up their world \u2014 and now it seems under threat.There are, of course, complicated contours to 2016\u2019s unusual politics. In Britain, immigrants from South Asia voted heavily to leave the European Union, citing hopes that curtailing European migration might open space for more people from Asia. In the United States, frustration with and alienation from status quo politics have helped drive Mr. Trump\u2019s rise.There has also always been a certain fluidity to this concept of whiteness. Irish and Italian immigrants to the United States, and Jews in Britain, were once seen as separate from the white national majority, and are now generally considered part of it, benefiting from racial privilege. At the same time, Jews\u2019 white skin did not protect them from being cast as outsiders by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters who have circulated anti-Semitic memes on social media.Still, experts see a crisis of white identity underlying much of the West\u2019s current turmoil.\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally about \u2018who are we?\u2019\u201d said Eric Kaufmann, a professor of politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. \u201cWhat does it mean to be part of this nation? Is it not \u2018our\u2019 nation anymore, \u2018our\u2019 meaning the ethnic majority?\u201cThese kinds of questions are really front and center, even though they\u2019re not necessarily verbalized.\u201dThe questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism, through the civil rights movement in the United States and the European Union\u2019s opening up of borders.In fact, academic research suggests that other economic and social transformations unfolding at the same time have led many people to anchor themselves more fully in their whiteness \u2014 even as whiteness itself has lost currency.\u201cWhen I look at the data, I keep coming back to this issue that it\u2019s really about identity politics,\u201d said Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, a professor at Norway\u2019s University of Bergen who studies Europe\u2019s far-right parties. \u201cThis is the most powerful predictor of support for the populists.\u201dIdentity, as academics define it, falls into two broad categories: \u201cachieved\u201d identity derived from personal effort, and \u201cascribed\u201d identity based on innate characteristics.Everyone has both, but people tend to be most attached to their \u201cbest\u201d identity \u2014 the one that offers the most social status or privileges. Successful professionals, for example, often define their identities primarily through their careers.For generations, working-class whites were doubly blessed: They enjoyed privileged status based on race, as well as the fruits of broad economic growth.White people\u2019s officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the 20th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in, say, university admissions. But rising wages, an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that. Most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents, and confident that their children would do better still.That feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself.But as Western manufacturing and industry have declined, taking many working-class towns with them, parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation.That creates an identity vacuum to be filled.\u201cFor someone who is lower income or lower class,\u201d Professor Kaufmann explained, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get more self-esteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity.\u201dFocusing on lost identities rather than lost livelihoods helps answer one of the most puzzling questions about the link between economic stress and the rise of nationalist politics: why it is flowing from the middle and working classes, and not the very poor.While globalization and free trade have widened economic inequality and deeply wounded many working-class communities, data suggests that this year\u2019s political turmoil is not merely a backlash to that real pain.Her subjects felt like they were waiting in a long line to reach the top of a hill where the American dream was waiting for them. But the line\u2019s uphill progress had slowed, even stopped. And immigrants, black people and other \u201coutsiders\u201d seemed to be cutting the line.For many Western whites, opportunities for achieved identity \u2014 the top of the hill \u2014 seem unattainable. So their ascribed identity \u2014 their whiteness \u2014 feels more important than ever.Michael Ignatieff, a historian and former Liberal Party leader in Canada, said that in much of the West, \u201cwhat defined the political community\u201d for many years \u201cwas the unstated premise that it was white.\u201dThe formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has, by extension, constructed a new, broader national identity. The United States has a black president; London has a Muslim mayor of Pakistani descent.But that broadening can, to some, feel like a painful loss, articulated in the demand voiced over and over at Trump rallies, pro-Brexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout Europe: \u201cI want my country back.\u201dThe mantra is not all about bigotry. Rather, being part of a culture designed around people\u2019s own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance, of belonging.The loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that Robin DiAngelo, a lecturer and author, calls \u201cwhite fragility\u201d \u2014 the stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default; that whiteness is just a race like any other.Fragility leads to feelings of insecurity, defensiveness, even threat. And it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders.Social scientists, after crunching data from both sides of the Atlantic, have discovered something surprising: It\u2019s not the amount of racial or ethnic diversity in a community that predicts white resentment and support of anti-immigrant policies, but the pace of change.Denmark, for instance, is 88 percent white Danish today \u2014 hardly a majority in jeopardy. But a generation ago, in 1980, it was 97 percent white. The anti-immigrant Danish People\u2019s Party is now the second-largest party in the Danish Parliament. In Germany, where the foreign-born population shot up by approximately 75 percent between 2011 and 2015, the anti-immigrant, populist Alternative for Germany party is now drawing record support.Britain saw a 66 percent increase in its foreign-born population between 2004 and 2014. Voters who chose \u201cleave\u201d in the recent referendum overwhelmingly cited immigration as their main concern.For decades, the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy. When that became taboo, it left white identity politics without a vocabulary.If you are a working-class white person and you fear that the new, cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish, you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis.Some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns: trade, crime, the war on drugs, controlling the borders, fear of Islamist terrorism. All are significant in their own right, and create very real fears for many people, but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what society\u2019s changes mean for white majorities.Professor Ivarsflaten cited the U.K. Independence Party, whose official platform focused on Brexit but whose pitch to voters emphasized immigrants\u2019 effects on the economy and culture, as an example of an effective hybrid populist pitch.The approach has in some cases moved from the political fringes into the mainstream. Some leaders from Britain\u2019s center-right, governing Conservative Party, for example, helped push a British exit, and since the referendum the new Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, has signaled sympathy with white identity politics.Mrs. May\u2019s government proposed a rule that would publicly shame employers who hired foreign workers. And her first major speech was full of barbs directed against multiculturalism, including a jab against people who claimed to be \u201ccitizens of the world,\u201d whom she called \u201ccitizens of nowhere.\u201dBut the struggle for white identity is not just a political problem; it is about the \u201cdeep story\u201d of feeling stuck while others move forward.There will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity. Immigration cannot be halted without damaging Western nations\u2019 economies; immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage. And the other groups who seem to be \u201ccutting in line\u201d are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them.Western whites have a place within their nations\u2019 new, broader national identities. But unless they accept it, the crisis of whiteness seems likely to continue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Tightens Controls on Overseas Use of Its Currency", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As an exodus of money adds to the pressure on a slowing economy, regulators are trying to put the brakes on overseas use of China\u2019s currency by increasing the scrutiny of certain overseas deals.The decision to restrict overseas use of the renminbi represents a setback in China\u2019s long-term drive to turn the currency into a rival to the dollar and euro in the global marketplace.But that leniency created a problem for China. The currency flowed out of the country in recent months and then traded heavily overseas, beyond the control of China\u2019s regulators.The situation has contributed to the currency\u2019s steady weakening against the strong dollar this autumn. That weakness, in turn, has prompted some Chinese businesses and households to move even more money out of the country before its value can erode further.\u201cThe authorities, under the relentless pressures of capital outflows, are poised to impose extensive restrictions on capital movements, marking a reversal of the gradual liberalizations introduced in recent years,\u201d Fred Hu, the chairman of the Primavera Capital Group, an investment firm based in Beijing and Hong Kong, wrote in an email reply to questions.\u201cWhile such capital controls may be intended to be temporary,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey will introduce mounting uncertainties for Chinese outbound investments.\u201dIn an effort to slow the exodus, an affiliate of China\u2019s central bank, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, issued a directive to bankers on Monday that amounted to additional scrutiny.The directive, which was quickly and broadly circulated within China\u2019s financial community, told banks that their domestic customers must check with the Beijing regulator before transferring $5 million or more \u2014 in dollars or renminbi \u2014 out of the country. The rules will also cover renminbi that is sitting in overseas accounts, which had previously escaped most regulation.\u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China in Shanghai is facing great pressure to keep a balance\u201d between inflows to and outflows from China, said the directive, referring to the Shanghai office of the central bank. The directive said that 5.1 trillion renminbi, or $740 billion, sluiced out of China in the first 10 months of this year while only 3.1 trillion came back into the country.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange declined Tuesday evening to respond to a faxed question regarding offshore renminbi, suggesting that the question should be submitted instead to the People\u2019s Bank of China. The central bank did not respond to questions late Tuesday evening.Government directives are not supposed to be public in China. In a sign of government irritation at the unauthorized distribution, censors reached into private WeChat social media accounts on Tuesday and deleted copies of the directive.The rules appear to take aim at a relatively discrete set of overseas deals that largely allow companies to pull money out of the country, rather than more strategic acquisitions.Many Chinese companies, for example, have used their overseas subsidiaries to buy or borrow renminbi in Hong Kong, London, New York and elsewhere from the international arms of Chinese banks. Some of them then sell the renminbi and buy dollars, in a bet that the dollar will strengthen.The new rules will apply broadly to Chinese companies. In the past, only companies with headquarters in Beijing typically had to notify the government of big moves in offshore renminbi.Even so, the new rules amount more to a modest tweak than an outright overhaul.Capital controls in China already restrict the movement of money. Individuals, for example, are not supposed to move more than $50,000 out of the country annually. Companies, too, have limits and other approval processes. The latest directive basically adds another layer of approval and closes some additional escape valves.\u201cThey are not changing the rules,\u201d said Jeffrey Sun, a partner in the Shanghai office of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, a global law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s that, internally, they need to go through this extensive process.\u201dWhile Chinese regulators are increasing their scrutiny, they have been reluctant to ban overseas investment outright. Four different regulators issued a joint public statement on Monday through the official Xinhua news agency to emphasize that it was still acceptable for Chinese companies and households to invest overseas.China\u2019s overseas investments have \u201cplayed an important role in deepening China\u2019s mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries and promoting domestic economic restructuring and upgrading,\u201d the statement said.But even those more strategic deals may soon get a second look. Regulators are also drafting rules that would require prior approval from Beijing for very large overseas corporate acquisitions.\u201cThe companies behind these large acquisitions are themselves very influential, and many will still find ways to close targeted deals,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai investment advisory firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traders Bet on Big Stimulus Spending. Congress May Not Go Along.", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stock traders celebrating Donald J. Trump\u2019s election have been bidding up equity prices on a risky bet: that the new president will steer congressional Republicans in a U-turn away from their tightfisted fiscal policies \u2014 and bring Democrats along for the ride.The hope, reflected in financial firms\u2019 postelection tip sheets for investors, is for a robust program of tax cuts and new spending, especially for infrastructure projects.That combination could bring soaring stock prices back down to earth.\u201cMarket expectations of quick fiscal expansion may be running ahead of political and legislative realities,\u201d Alec Phillips, a Goldman Sachs economist, recently cautioned clients in an analysis, a point he reiterated in an interview.Mr. Phillips suggested to clients that \u201ca modest infrastructure package\u201d is more likely. But even that probably would not come as soon in 2017 as markets seem to anticipate, given the political and budgetary hurdles ahead.Mr. Trump is unleashing a debate within the Republican Party that will challenge its fiscal orthodoxy against spending and deficits \u2014 and test how fully he has commandeered the party. Conservative hostility to stimulus spending, proposed by both President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama, helped spawn what became the Tea Party movement.For evidence of just how significant the fiscal policy shift could be for Republicans, consider the difference between the bottom lines of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign platform and the most recent House-passed budget outline.Republicans\u2019 anti-spending bent was evident within days of the election, when the lame-duck Congress convened to finish the annual government-funding bill. Hard-line conservatives in the House publicly warned that Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s job would be in danger if he compromised with Mr. Obama on additional spending.He has countered that Congress last year passed, and Mr. Obama signed, the largest highway bill since the 1990s. But the roughly $60 billion a year the law provides over five years for roads and mass transit is far less than Mr. Obama wanted \u2014 or Mr. Trump has proposed \u2014 and would not cover public works unrelated to transportation, like water systems, levees and schools.Yet with Mr. Trump\u2019s election, just the prospect of the federal government\u2019s belt-loosening has cheered not just markets, but also economists who otherwise worry that the president-elect\u2019s trade and immigration proposals, if realized, could hurt the economy.Lately those complaints have mounted, spurred by a new economic development: the prospect, forecast by the Fed, of lower-than-expected interest rates for perhaps years. Lower borrowing costs for public investments could put people to work now and provide long-run returns for the economy and society, a range of proponents say. So Congress and the White House should invest more for now, they say, and worry less about deficits.\u201cBorrowing, especially for investment, passes a cost-benefit test,\u201d he added.In an interview, Mr. Elmendorf, now dean of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, said the \u201coverwhelming\u201d consensus of economists was that Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act had bolstered economic output and employment.\u201cToo many political leaders don\u2019t understand the importance of fiscal policy in fighting recessions and making crucial public investments,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the place where the federal government does any genuine investment to improve the economy in the future,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cAnd the caps really just codified what was going on anyway, which is that the large amount of entitlement growth is just pushing all of the sort of basic infrastructure, research, education, national security out of the budget.\u201dYet the sort of projects he named suggest a need for direct government spending. Dangling tax credits to private investors is not likely to spur them to undertake public works that do not readily offer a profit stream, critics say; instead, tax breaks of as much as $1 trillion over 10 years could reward investors for endeavors like energy pipelines that would have been built anyway.Congressional Republicans are more likely to favor tax credits over spending. But Mr. Trump\u2019s trillion-dollar tax credit proposal has its conservative critics. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said he was \u201cenraged\u201d by it, given its cost and the claim that it would pay for itself through growth.Democrats prominent in the debate, such as Representative John Delaney of Maryland, say they will oppose a tax credit without new funding for public works, and perhaps a long-discussed infrastructure bank to leverage public and private investment. Steven Mnuchin, a senior member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and a possible nominee for Treasury secretary, told reporters that the president-elect was \u201clooking at the creation of an infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure investments.\u201dIn the past, Mr. Ryan had negotiated with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who will be the Senate Democratic leader, on a deal to increase infrastructure spending if Democrats supported reducing the tax on multinational corporations\u2019 foreign profits so they would bring the money to the United States to invest.But they could not reach agreement, and now the infrastructure-tax trade-off could be moot. Some Republicans say that, with Mr. Trump\u2019s election, they would rather use tax revenues from corporations\u2019 repatriated profits to offset the cost of reducing corporations\u2019 overall tax rates.Advertisement"}

Maybe you were a superhero, a dinosaur or a princess. It\u2019s normal when you\u2019re little, and it\u2019s usually harmless. Most children know the difference between pretending to be a superhero and jumping off the roof thinking they can fly.But adults often forget.For instance, we may stop pretending to be superheroes, but a lot of us seem convinced that we can pretend to be investors. That\u2019s dangerous.Real investors know that they make changes to their investments based on what happens in their own lives. If their goals change or there is a fundamental change in their financial situation, then they consider an alteration. But they would never make a change based on someone yelling \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d on television.3. Pretend investors think they need to monitor their investments all the time. The little supercomputer they carry around in their pockets makes it so easy.4. Pretend investors talk about their investments \u2014 a lot. They say things like, \u201cI\u2019m long this, or short that.\u201d They use jargon that often does not make sense, though it sounds kind of impressive if you don\u2019t listen too closely. Sometimes they cheer for things like increased consumer spending, higher unemployment, or in some cases, war.Real investors understand the difference between the global economy and their personal economy and choose to focus on the latter.5. Pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some far-off part of the world or the impact on their portfolio.Real investors focus on the things they can control, like saving a bit more next year, keeping their investment costs low, not paying fees unless it\u2019s necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low.6. Pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have short-term impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks.Real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than 180 percent in the last 20 years.So ask yourself this: Isn\u2019t it finally time to stop pretending now?Advertisement"}

The ally of Mr. Temer, Geddel Vieira Lima, who held the title of government secretary, had invested in an apartment in the development. Mr. Vieira Lima submitted his resignation on Friday morning, apologizing and explaining in a letter to Mr. Temer that he was leaving the government for the good of the nation.Signaling the potential for even more turmoil, pressure is growing on another leader in Mr. Temer\u2019s party, Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate, who is battling multiple claims of corruption including a case in which he is alleged to have allowed a lobbyist for a construction company to pay child support for Mr. Calheiros\u2019s son from an extramarital affair.Mr. Temer and his party were allies of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party for more than a decade before breaking this year with Ms. Rousseff and her mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was president for eight years, starting in 2003.Mr. Vieira Lima, the official with the investment in the real estate venture in Salvador, was already under investigation in connection with a corruption scandal around the national oil company, Petrobras. Mr. Temer had insisted that the inquiry should not prevent Mr. Vieira Lima from remaining in his cabinet, where he held one of the most influential positions in the executive branch.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of years that Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was president.

In a country polarized and paralyzed, an unchecked authoritarian right-wing populism \u2014 Trumpism without Trump \u2014 is coming to define the political culture.The latest convulsion was caused by a lawsuit brought by a London-based investment manager, Gina Miller, to force the government to hold a debate and vote in Parliament before activating Article 50, the treaty provision that begins the process of leaving the bloc. Ms. Miller, who was born in Guyana, has been advised by the police to avoid public spaces for fear of attack. But it was the judges of the High Court who came in for abuse when, earlier this month, they ruled in Ms. Miller\u2019s favor.\u201cEnemies of the People,\u201d bellowed the front page of The Daily Mail, the country\u2019s second-most-read newspaper, below images of the three judges who had made the decision. One was denounced as \u201can openly gay ex-Olympic fencer.\u201d\u201cLoaded foreign elite defy will of Brit voters\u201d was the verdict of The Sun, a newspaper owned by the press tycoon Rupert Murdoch. The Brexiteers are bitter winners.The High Court did not overturn the referendum result; it merely obliged the government to hold a parliamentary debate and vote before invoking Article 50. (Paradoxically, one plank of the Leave platform was a call to restore sovereignty to Britain\u2019s Parliament.) The government\u2019s appeal will go to the Supreme Court, but it seems unlikely to succeed \u2014 and some Conservative members of Parliament are calling for it to be dropped rather than provide another \u201copportunity for ill-motivated people to attack the judiciary.\u201dIn post-Brexit Britain, the rule of law has become just another liberal elite institution designed to thwart the popular will. At her party\u2019s annual conference in October, the new prime minister, Theresa May, caught the mood.\u201cThey find your patriotism distasteful, your concerns about immigration parochial,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere.\u201dWhy such antagonism over a referendum about membership of a trading bloc? The vote exposed and widened divisions familiar also in America: metropolitan, university-educated people against working-class people; big cities versus small towns; young versus old. The Leave campaign appealed to communities battered by deindustrialization and working-class people whose lives are defined by insecurity.Take the former industrial town in Northern England where I grew up: Stockport. The people there are seeing the longest squeeze in wages since the 19th century; a housing crisis caused by the lowest level of homebuilding since the 1920s; and public services under strain because of the worst budget cuts in generations. Many of the town\u2019s residents view all these problems through the prism of immigration.This highlights a dilemma for the opposition Labour Party on how to position itself. A chaotic Brexit beckons, which the Conservative chancellor, Philip Hammond, concedes will mean two years of \u201cfiscal uncertainty,\u201d and which is likely to conclude in an unfavorable deal for Britain. So should Labour use the court judgment to try to block Brexit in Parliament, hoping that enough Leave voters will feel buyer\u2019s remorse over the referendum result and return to the Labour fold?Labour\u2019s own woes amply match the government\u2019s problems. Although a fragile internal cease-fire currently holds, the party is chronically divided. Its left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has the enthusiastic support of grass-roots members, hundreds of thousands of whom have joined over the last year and a half. About three-quarters of the party\u2019s members of Parliament, however, rebelled but failed to oust him in a leadership election following the referendum debacle.Labour\u2019s electoral coalition is unwieldy, to say the least, with fractures of class and region exposed by the Brexit referendum. Despite the party line, more than a third of Labour\u2019s supporters voted Leave, especially in northern heartlands. Party leaders privately believe that the greatest threat to Labour is losing this segment of electoral support.A further wrinkle is that if Labour attempts to use parliamentary process to disrupt the government\u2019s plans, the government could respond by calling a snap election. All the polling suggests that the Conservatives would bury Labour in a landslide.So despite internal divisions over Brexit \u2014 with many supporters favoring a second referendum in hopes of overturning the first \u2014 Labour has rather desperately changed tack, emphasizing its commitment to Brexit, rather than offering opposition. The party\u2019s economic spokesman, John McDonnell, has praised \u201cthe enormous opportunities\u201d offered by Brexit, and suggested that those seeking to frustrate the triggering of Article 50 are \u201con the side of certain corporate elites.\u201dHow should Labour navigate this politically perilous path? Polling suggests that British voters are evenly split between cutting immigration and retaining access to the single market as the key objective of Brexit negotiations. Labour surely must emphasize that it would put the economy first, meaning maximum access to the single market, while addressing concerns caused by freedom of movement in the European Union by clamping down on the undercutting of wages and compelling multinational companies to train local workers. If the economy does indeed suffer, then Labour can pin it on the government\u2019s failed strategy.There are other possible openings. Britain\u2019s national debt has been a key bone of political contention, used to clobber Labour in the 2015 general election as a spendthrift party in denial of economic realities. But when the Tories\u2019 \u201causterity chancellor,\u201d as George Osborne was called by one financial journalist, was ousted after Brexit, the Conservatives\u2019 credibility as the party of fiscal discipline went with him. The referendum showed that voters wanted economic regeneration, and Mr. Corbyn won the leadership election largely because of his clear opposition to austerity, but Labour has yet to lay out a clear alternative \u2014 and risks being defined by its opponents instead.Labour must redefine patriotism, too, despite the left\u2019s traditional discomfort with such ideas. With Scottish nationalism dominant north of the border, national identity increasingly matters to English voters. Defending great British institutions like the National Health Service and the welfare state can be patriotic; corporate elites who put profit before people could be called unpatriotic.The government may lose its Supreme Court appeal, but Parliament is sure to vote to activate Article 50. Even so, Nigel Farage, the then interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party (often known as \u201cUKIP\u201d), has \u2014 Trump-like \u2014 warned of riots if the referendum outcome is undermined, calling for a march on the court. One Conservative member, himself a Leave campaigner, has resigned from Parliament in protest at the government\u2019s handling of the Brexit process, telling friends the party was now \u201cUKIP-lite.\u201dAn extremism that was once consigned to the fringes is now center stage in British politics. Right-wing populism may remake Britain in its own image. It may only be Labour that can stand in its way, but the party faces an immense challenge if it is not to be steamrolled by the forces that gave us Brexit.Owen Jones is a columnist for The Guardian and the author of \u201cThe Establishment: And How They Get Away With It.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Curse of Hypercorrection in Latin America", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 In the late 2000s, leftist politicians were leading countries all across Latin America. Today, most are in retreat, challenged by a new crop of would-be leaders promising to fix the problems created by the left. In Argentina, Paraguay and Peru, these challengers have won elections. In Brazil, they took office this year as a result of a presidential impeachment and, as in Chile, gained ground in municipal elections. In Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, they are regaining electoral strength.Because these new leaders are defying the left, it is tempting to call them right-wing. Some, such as President Mauricio Macri of Argentina and President Michel Temer of Brazil, would not necessarily repudiate that label. But another way to describe them is as hypercorrectors. They see themselves as on a mission to tidy up the messes left by their predecessors.Will they succeed as cleaners in chief? There is reason for optimism, but also for concern. In some areas, they may well repeat mistakes of the past because the politics of hypercorrection, regardless of what policies are adopted, are prone to overreach. Fixating on huge crises prompts politicians to go overboard, become too improvisational and ignore other issues.Hypercorrection has been the essence of Latin American democratic politics since the 1980s. Back then, Latin America was making the transition to democracy. Presidents came with a mandate to end the human rights abuses and authoritarian practices of their dictatorial predecessors. As as result, they often went too far in decentralizing government authority, leading to unstable administrations. They obsessed over taking away power from the military and paid insufficient attention to the economy, leading to escalating inflation.Neoliberal economics came next. The champions of this approach arrived in the late \u201980s with an ambitious agenda. They did rectify macroeconomic imbalances, but they also overcompensated with privatizations and deregulation, which left a legacy of price-fixing and financial frailty. They also paid less attention to poverty, leading to rising income inequality.In the late \u201990s, leftist leaders intent on correcting the problems of the neoliberal era began to assume power. They, too, responded by overshooting the mark. To deal with income inequality, they expanded the reach of the state and reinforced their economies\u2019 dependency on the export of natural resources, leading to rampant corruption, low savings and political sectarianism. In some cases, they neglected fiscal discipline, causing ballooning debts and deficits.And now it\u2019s time for post-left presidents. An encore performance of overcompensation and neglect is in the works.Let\u2019s begin with economics. On the plus side, today\u2019s reformers have fewer reasons than in the past to overcorrect. Except for Venezuela and Brazil, Latin American countries are not facing imminent economic collapse. So there is less need for so-called big-bang reforms of the past, which produce a lot of mistakes and pain.The real risk is misfiring \u2014 that is, going after the wrong target. The region\u2019s key economic problem is overdependence on natural resources, yet most of the new hypercorrectors are ignoring the issue. In Peru, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski went to China on his first foreign trip, an odd choice considering China\u2019s contribution to keeping Peru reliant on mining.To the extent that the new reformers propose a solution, it is to attract foreign investment by relaxing rules on exports. Such liberalization might increase investment, but as a policy to minimize dependence on exporting natural resources, it fails. If anything, it increases dependence on foreign partners.Reducing such dependence requires instead establishing stabilization funds, improving education so workers learn more skills, and creating a more diversified service economy. Sadly, today\u2019s presidents hardly talk about these tasks.A second big item of the reform agenda is corruption. No other issue seems to mobilize the electorate more than disgust with corruption. Allegations of corruption destroyed the electoral strength of once-popular leftist presidents like Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in Argentina, Mauricio Funes in El Salvador and Evo Morales in Bolivia.On corruption especially, Latin American presidents have a long history of misfiring. Under neoliberalism, the preferred strategy to deal with corruption was to \u201croll back the state,\u201d in the assumption that a smaller public sector offered fewer opportunities for corruption. Under leftist presidents, the preferred strategy was to punish parties and expand \u201cparticipatory democracy\u201d in the hope that giving ordinary citizens more power to make decisions would turn them into effective watchdogs.This time around, presidents, rather than rolling back the state, should build a rules-based state. Rather than relying only on citizen participation, they should give more power to a narrower constituency: the courts.There are obstacles. Making the state more bound by rules and giving the courts more teeth limit the discretion of the executive branch, which presidents dislike. Sometimes, as in Brazil, the parties that support such moves are tainted by corruption scandals. And hypercorrectors, in particular, think that judicial checks hamstring them in their effort to overhaul a dysfunctional status quo.Finally, today\u2019s reformers have also inherited the problem of political sectarianism \u2014 the tendency of ruling parties to provide special favors mostly to loyalists and ignore opponents. Latin America\u2019s radical left proved notoriously sectarian. Followers were rewarded with extraordinary state largess, often in the form of welfare benefits; dissidents were punished by being barred from such benefits. Opponents felt, rightly, that the state was using social policy to discriminate against them.This kind of sectarianism is the reason for one of Latin America\u2019s most remarkable paradoxes since the late 2000s: Poverty and inequality declined, but political tensions increased \u2014 not so much because social programs relied on redistribution (their funding actually came from exports rather than tax increases), but on favoritism. This produced a vicious cycle: Social programs made presidents popular, and that popularity encouraged them to create more rules that were biased against opponents, leading to polarization.Today\u2019s reformers face the challenge of reducing this dynamic. But it\u2019s not clear that today\u2019s hypercorrectors can; their electoral coalitions might not allow it.In some countries, like Argentina and Peru, these coalitions consist of your typical anti-populist front: middle-class voters, technocrats and business, all aligned against inefficient government spending. They demand an exclusive focus on macroeconomic discipline.In other cases, the electoral coalition behind today\u2019s reformers is more religious, as is the case with Donald J. Trump in the United States. An alliance of evangelicals and Catholics is taking shape across the Americas, aiming to advance a very conservative agenda on sexuality and security. This new coalition, which is strongest in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Central America, wants presidents to commit to restrictive policies on abortion, gay rights, drug use and crime. Their latest target is \u201cgender ideology,\u201d the idea that gender identity is socially constructed rather than biologically determined. These groups claim that gender ideology is anti-biblical and oppose policies to protect gay and transgender people, family planners and nontraditional families.Coalitions like this helped place Mr. Temer in power in Brazil and Jimmy Morales in Guatemala. In Mexico, they pressured the Congress to shelve a same-sex-marriage bill. In Colombia, they helped the right defeat, in a referendum, the government\u2019s peace agreement with the FARC guerrilla group. In Nicaragua, they encouraged President Daniel Ortega, a former Marxist, to adopt an anti-abortion position. In Chile, they helped elect a significant number of mayors in the most recent municipal elections.Like the radical leftists of the 2000s, these religious groups have adopted intransigent positions on issues they care about. Presidents owing their victories to religious conservatives may feel too indebted to these groups, and this is a recipe for more sectarianism. The challenge for these presidents is to establish what one could call a separation of church and party. If they insist on excluding the ever-growing sections of the electorate that are more secular, they risk heightening polarization.There are two ways to interpret this moment in Latin America. One is to see it as a moment of an ideological pendulum shift from left to right. The other is to see it as a repeating cycle of hypercorrection, with crises of governance once again producing mega-reformers. Hypercorrection comes from crises and is prone to crises.The prospects for breaking this unfortunate cycle seem uneven. On economics, the chances look better than in the past. But on issues of corruption and sectarianism, there is trouble ahead.Javier Corrales is a professor of political science at Amherst and a Fulbright scholar at the University of the Andes and the Pontificial Javeriana University.Advertisement"}

The government\u2019s powerful family-planning apparatus still fines married couples who have more than two children and women who give birth out of wedlock, despite a looming demographic crisis in the country.\u201cEspecially with these falling birthrates, the right thing to do would be to allow single women to have children,\u201d Wu Youshui, a lawyer in Hangzhou who specializes in reproductive issues, said in an interview.\u201cBut in fact, they\u2019re still fining people,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot.

{"Headline": "Ahead of Trump Presidency, Global Investors Sell Bonds and Grab Stocks", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byGlobal investors have rendered their verdict on Donald J. Trump as president: Sell government bonds and pile into stocks that will benefit the most from a resurgent United States economy.From Indonesia to the United States, government bonds are undergoing a sharp sell-off as investors \u2014 large sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds, as well as the accounts of American retirees \u2014 restructure investment portfolios to try to capture the fruits of what they expect will be a free-spending Trump presidency.Across the board, the yields of these bonds, which move up as their prices decline, are pushing higher. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note \u2014 a benchmark for mortgages and other lending rates \u2014 has risen to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent in less than two months. For such a widely held and traded security, that is an unusually abrupt move.Other safe-haven bonds have had similar reactions. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year notes has gone to positive. In just a week, it has gone to 0.35 percent from negative 0.15 percent.And the Swiss 10-year is now on the cusp of paying investors to borrow money after close to two years of trading in negative interest rate territory.If the trend continues, it will signify a jarring philosophical shift from the view put forward by many prominent economists, like the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, that the global economy is destined to stagnate for some time under a regime of low growth, zero interest rates and deflation.A series of earlier signals pointed to a move away from bonds in the weeks before the election, including higher wages in the United States and signs of increased inflation in Europe.But what has resonated deeply with countless risk-averse investors who have been camping out in government bonds for years now is Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to have the federal government take responsibility for stimulating the economy \u2014 in the form of infrastructure investments and tax cuts \u2014 away from global central banks.\u201cIt does not surprise me that the markets have reacted this way,\u201d said Luciano Siracusano, chief investment strategist for WisdomTree asset management in New York. \u201cThis is a very pro-growth agenda, and we have not had that in a while.\u201dAfter the financial crisis unleashed an unprecedented wave of activism on the part of global central banks, investors the world over followed the lead of central bankers and loaded up on long-term government bonds.Until recently, it has been a no-fault trade, with global growth stagnant, governments divided and political risk omnipresent.The numbers tell the story.According to J. P. Morgan, central banks and financial institutions in developed markets are sitting on $26 trillion in bonds, or 49 percent of the tradable market for these securities. That figure is up from 40 percent in 2002, and it highlights the extent to which worries about deflation and stagnation (political and economic) have resulted in a nonstop bull market for government bonds.Most investors, and many policy makers as well, have become fed up with this so-called stagnation trade and they have been calling for lower taxes and more government spending not just in the United States but also in Europe and Japan.\u201cInvestors have been frustrated with the limits of monetary policy,\u201d said Michael Zezas, a bond strategist with Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere has been a presumption of the necessity of fiscal stimulus. With a Trump presidency, the political rationale aligns with the economic rationale.\u201dSoaring bond yields are not the only way that this new \u201creflation trade\u201d is playing out. Investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like copper, the price of which was up 20 percent in the last month.Bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest rates, which help their lending margins.Even the long-suffering stock price of Deutsche Bank, for example, has bounced back by nearly 20 percent in the last week.More broadly, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 3.8 percent last week, while on Monday, the major market measures ended largely flat.Of course, such an investment trend carries with it serious risks. If bond yields shoot up too starkly, investors in the stock market will get jittery and all the fast money that has recently piled into stocks could turn tail, leaving chaos in its wake.For example, $22 billion has poured into exchange-traded funds that invest in the United States stock market in the last three days alone.It is worth recalling that the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies, was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar \u2014 which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now.A Trump-inspired inflationary surge could also force the Federal Reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates, a dynamic that no investor wants to see.The trick, of course, for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and, in addition to pushing for a building boom, cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures. That could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control.For now, such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in Mr. Trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth, low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny, all of which pushed them into the safety and security of low-yielding government bonds.Some even suggest that a President Trump will not be unlike President Reagan in showing a devotion to bedrock laissez-faire principles, even if many of those philosophies were called into question when American investment banks nearly torpedoed the global economy.\u201cThe global impact of this stuff is that once you start it, you can\u2019t stop it,\u201d said Arthur Laffer, a supply-side evangelist who advised Ronald Reagan and was among a core group of economists who cobbled together Mr. Trump\u2019s own tax-slashing program. \u201cThat is the way it was with Reagan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Auto Safety Regulators Seek a Driver Mode to Block Apps", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byApple iPhones and other hand-held devices have long had an airplane mode that shuts off wireless communications to prevent interference with the vast electronics systems that control modern aircraft.Now federal auto safety regulators want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain apps and features to keep a driver\u2019s attention on the road.The initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines that will be issued Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They arrive amid a spike in traffic fatalities in the last two years and increasing concerns about the distractions posed by smartphones and the many apps that Americans are using while behind the wheel.\u201cYour smartphone becomes so many different things that it\u2019s not just a communication device,\u201d Anthony Foxx, secretary of the Transportation Department, said in an interview. \u201cDistraction is still a problem. Too many people are dying and being injured on our roadways.\u201dThe guidelines call on electronics manufacturers like Apple and Samsung to design future operating systems that limit the functionality and simplify interfaces while a vehicle is in motion and to develop technology to identify when the devices are being used by a driver while driving. That would ensure the limits are placed on drivers and not other vehicle occupants.The new guidelines from N.H.T.S.A. are the agency\u2019s first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving. The agency cannot force electronics companies to comply, but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and carmakers adopted them, for the most part.The airplane mode has been around about as long as smartphones. The Federal Aviation Administration had required turning off electronics before takeoff, but that rule was relaxed to allow the use of smartphones in flight as long as they had their communications shut off. That led to airplane mode, which the iPhone had in 2007.\u201cUnfortunately, there are varying degrees of recognition in the tech community that when you\u2019re building an app or a smartphone, or contemplating usage, there\u2019s a strong possibility that someone could be trying to use that in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Mr. Foxx said.In the first six months of 2016, highway deaths increased 10.4 percent, to 17,775, according to preliminary data compiled by N.H.T.S.A. At that rate, more than 100 people die every day in traffic accidents. In 2015, traffic fatalities rose 7.1 percent; it was the largest annual percentage increase in traffic deaths in 50 years.Part of the increase in road deaths can be explained by the improving economy, higher employment numbers and low gasoline prices, all of which are causing Americans to drive more than they did just a few years ago, during the depths of the recession.In an interview in October, Mark Rosekind, the N.H.T.S.A. administrator, said the increase in miles traveled was not enough by itself to explain this spike in crashes, injuries and deaths. Indeed, fatalities are occurring more frequently even when the increased travel is factored in.Mr. Rosekind and other safety experts think one factor is distracted driving. In their view, distractions and the allure of smartphones, other devices and in-car electronics have multiplied greatly since the dangers of distracted driving entered the national consciousness years ago.At that time, the main phone-related distracting activities were texting and talking on the phone. Now a wide range of apps and games also tempt drivers to reach for their phones.Niantic, the maker of Pok\u00e9mon Go, recently modified the game to prevent it from operating while moving at speeds of more than about 10 miles per hour, a spokeswoman for the company said. She declined to give further details on the modifications because Niantic did not want users to find ways to get around them, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t think Pok\u00e9mon Go is something any driver should be using at any speed,\u201d Mr. Foxx said.Makers of smartphones have added some technology that can be used to reduce the distraction of electronics. Apple\u2019s iPhones have a do not disturb feature that can block incoming calls and texts, and a silent mode that eliminates the chimes and other audio cues that signal the arrival of a new message or posting on Facebook.Many carmakers now include Apple\u2019s CarPlay software in their newest models. When an iPhone is connected to the vehicle via CarPlay, the software limits the apps drivers can use to Apple Maps, the music service Pandora and others that are used while traveling. Drivers can have the system read new texts aloud and dictate responses.There are apps and other products that can be used to block incoming communications in cars. One called DriveSafe Mode lets parents monitor if a child\u2019s phone is used for texting or email while in a vehicle.The guidelines encourage smartphone makers to ensure their devices pair up with in-car electronics so drivers can use their steering-wheel buttons and in-dash screen to control apps.A driver mode would present a simplified interface and detect when the device is being used by a driver. In this mode, a smartphone would block any video or distracting graphics; eliminate scrolling text; and prohibit keypad use for texting or email. Any social media content or content from web pages like news reports should be blocked as well, the guidelines say.Advertisement"}

The good news is that globalization really has, on average, made the world a better place for most people. Not for everyone, but on average, it has helped people who didn\u2019t have opportunities. It helped take hundreds of millions, if not billions, out of poverty. That\u2019s long term. Short term, there is an incredible backlash in this country and in Europe and pretty much every country in Asia. You see regimes that are more reactionary and defensive in nature. It\u2019s a reaction to globalization and technology.How are you managing those concerns?You do what we do, which is to spend time working on political thinking and ideas. You come up with ideas and build bridges. From an investment standpoint, you can take one of two views \u2014 you can say the political backlash is going to win and you stop investing. Or you say to yourself, globalization is going to win and you keep investing. I take the second one. I\u2019m an optimist.What are you investing in? I spend less and less time on investments.

The only area I\u2019m actually interested in being more active is technology. It\u2019s more to learn than make returns. If you\u2019re not close to what\u2019s happening in technology, you don\u2019t really understand where the world is going.Where are the biggest opportunities?The biggest opportunities are going to be \u2014 and it sounds a little too obvious \u2014 in two areas. One, you have a part of the world that used to not be part of the economy but has become part of it, as a contributor and an actor and a consumer. All the so-called emerging countries \u2014 these are huge opportunities. The other is technology. Technology destroys jobs, but it creates new ones. But it also compresses costs.

{"Headline": "Owner Was Target, but Restaurant Workers Are Swept Up in Immigration Raids", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byBUFFALO \u2014 Immigration enforcement agents were supposed to be targeting the restaurant owner. But Antonio Ramos Salazar, a cook, was the one with guns pointed at his head.Mr. Mucino was arrested at his home on Oct. 18. But two dozen of his workers were swept up in simultaneous raids that morning at all four of his restaurants.During the raids, the authorities discovered that nine workers had re-entered the country after having been deported, which is a federal crime. Three more, including Mr. Salazar, were charged with immigration violations \u2014 which are administrative offenses only \u2014 and were ordered deported. The remaining 10 workers were released.\u201cThe targets of the investigation were the employers,\u201d a homeland security spokesman, Khaalid Walls, said. \u201cAfter investigating the case, we alleged that many of the employees were either subject to criminal charges or immigration violations, and we charged accordingly.\u201dNow, Ms. Mackler added, workers and advocates fear that this could be the blueprint for future raids under Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201cand that would be on the small side.\u201dMr. Trump pledged that in his first year in office he would deport unauthorized immigrants with criminal records, putting their number at two million, while increasing enforcement operations to deal with an undocumented population of more than 11 million people in the United States.Mr. Bauerle said that after the raids the radio station received numerous comments from listeners cheering the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cthey are disappointed because apparently these places made awesome tacos.\u201dThe authorities said the raids were set in motion more than two years ago, thanks, in part, to a tip from a former employee who was fired.According to the workers and their lawyers, Mr. Mucino paid weekly salaries for 11-hour days that worked out to be below the minimum hourly wage of $9. Two workers interviewed said salaries started at $450 a week for a dishwasher and increased at different positions in the kitchen. The federal complaint stated that each restaurant grossed $50,000 per week, which was not reported for state or federal taxes. The authorities said Mr. Mucino operated some of the business on the books, endorsing payroll checks to 28 employees.\u201cBuilding and supporting a business through the intentional use of people not lawfully authorized to work here is a model that H.S.I. will not tolerate,\u201d said Kevin Sibley, the acting special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Buffalo. He added that such practices undermine competition and \u201coften come at the peril of the workers.\u201dBut the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Western District of New York did not charge Mr. Mucino or his associates with human trafficking, nor have tax evasion or labor violation charges been filed.Nicole Hallett, a University at Buffalo law professor who is representing three workers in their immigration cases, called the government\u2019s actions counterintuitive.\u201cIf you are concerned about the exploitation of workers, you should not be prosecuting or deporting worker victims, because that discourages workers from coming forward in situations where they are being exploited,\u201d Professor Hallett said.In interviews, four workers said they were not mistreated at the restaurants. They noted that the pay was better than that at agricultural or factory jobs they held previously.Mr. Salazar, the head cook at La Divina, is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor as he awaits deportation proceedings, though he is charged only with a civil offense. \u201cIf this is just from being here to work,\u201d Mr. Salazar said, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, \u201cwhat would happen if I actually committed a crime?\u201dHe said he had earned a law degree in Mexico, but was unable to find work there to support his family of three.Sergio Roblero, 19, said he had paid a recruiter in Mexico $4,480 for a guest worker\u2019s visa and travel expenses to pick blueberries in Georgia. He was told he would be making $10.59 an hour; he made only $3, he said. Mr. Roblero was unable to leave the farm unless he paid $1,000 to get his passport back. To recoup his losses, he moved four months ago to Buffalo, where a friend from Mexico was working for Mr. Mucino\u2019s restaurants.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that other people are going to go through what I did,\u201d Mr. Roblero said. \u201cI know that the economy in Mexico is always going to be bad and people are always going to come to this country.\u201dAccording to statistics from 2014 released this month by the Pew Research Center, nearly eight million undocumented people in the United States were part of the work force or seeking employment. In New York State, undocumented immigrants represented 6 percent of the labor force.While some of his workers are still detained, Mr. Mucino was released on $85,000 bail and reopened La Divina, though his other restaurants, which are full service, remain closed.Mr. Mucino parked a black Mercedes sport utility vehicle behind the store last week and spoke of his employees. \u201cAll of them are very nice people and they\u2019re hard workers,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel very bad for everything that happened.\u201d He declined to comment further on the charges.According to the authorities, an incident in August accelerated the investigation. Fourteen men went to play basketball after their shifts around 10 p.m., at a suburban Buffalo playground.The local police answered a call about the group and asked for identification. When some of the men could produce only Mexican identification cards, the police called the United States Border Patrol. By 1:30 a.m., 10 people were detained and five were arrested, charged with having illegally re-entered the country.Later, a manager, Manguin Sanchez, a United States citizen, went to collect the men\u2019s cash, which had been seized by immigration officers, and told the authorities it was their pay. According to the federal complaint, he also said restaurant workers lived in properties he owned. It was confirmation for investigators.In addition to Mr. Sanchez, 22, and Mr. Mucino, the authorities arrested another manager, Jose Sanchez-Ocampo, 37. The men provided two houses and nine apartments for their employees\u2019 housing.Leticia and Saul Sanchez-Ocampo \u2014 Jose Sanchez-Ocampo\u2019s brother \u2014 live in one house, along with four children, all of whom are United States citizens.Ms. Sanchez-Ocampo, who had started working with her husband at La Divina only two days before the raids, said the family moved in 2015 from Los Angeles to Buffalo to be closer to relatives. Her daughter, Magali, 17, is the best student in the family, she said, and had saved more than $9,000 in cash for her college fund. It was confiscated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during a raid of the house.\u201cIt\u2019s been like a nightmare for the whole family,\u201d Ms. Sanchez-Ocampo said in Spanish, through an interpreter.Some Buffalo residents have put aside questions of immigration policy and the exploitation of immigrant labor in favor of their taste buds. Since opening in 2015, La Divina has drawn rave reviews and long lines for its authentic, overstuffed $2.50 tacos.Gaetano Augello, 60, acknowledged that he felt uncomfortable hearing that workers might have been taken advantage of. \u201cOf course, who wants to subsidize that? That\u2019s not a feel-good story,\u201d he said.But he had returned for the tacos. And now that Mr. Mucino has hired replacement cooks to make the recipes?\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re quite as good,\u201d Mr. Augello said. \u201cThey\u2019re good, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is important for Europe, but it is also important for the United States.\u201dMr. Stoltenberg, who is a former prime minister of Norway, said he would tell Mr. Trump that Europe was prepared to increase its financial commitment to the alliance, which he said was crucial at a time of increased instability, including a more assertive Russia; the threat of the Islamic State; turmoil in the Middle East; and cyberwarfare. \u201cI will tell President-elect Trump that my main priority is that European allies increase defense spending,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said.Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that Europe pay more, Mr. Stoltenberg added, was hardly a new demand. He said he had heard the same message from other leading American officials, including President Obama and every member of Congress that he had met.The United States accounts for 70 percent of spending on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Mr. Stoltenberg noted that other than the United States, only four NATO countries \u2014 Britain, Estonia, Greece and Poland \u2014 spent at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense, the alliance\u2019s goal for its members. He stressed that if all NATO members matched that target, it would mean an additional $100 billion a year for the alliance.In words that appeared calibrated for Mr. Trump, Mr. Stoltenberg stressed that the only time the Atlantic alliance had invoked its self-defense clause, which states that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all members, was in support of the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The purge has been criticized by human rights advocates who have accused the government of seeking to silence its critics and solidify its grip on power.\u201cI expect all allies to live up to those values,\u201d he said.Amid growing jitters among American allies that Mr. Trump could back away from security commitments that have defined international relations for decades, President Obama sought last week to reassure Europeans, saying in Athens that American support for NATO was robust and transcended whoever was in the White House.Mr. Kiesewetter said that Germany, the largest economy in the 28-member European Union, could play a central role in urging nuclear powers like Britain and France to take over from the United States in providing nuclear security guarantees for the rest of the region.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Takes a Chain Saw to a Center of Tibetan Buddhism", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byLarung Gar JournalLARUNG GAR, China \u2014 Atop a hill, a growling chain saw drowned out loudspeakers broadcasting a lama\u2019s chants from a nearby temple.The chain saw, wielded by workers demolishing a row of homes, signaled the imminent end of thousands of hand-built monastic dwellings here at Larung Gar, the world\u2019s largest Buddhist institute.Since its founding in 1980, Larung Gar has grown into an extraordinary and surreal sprawl \u2014 countless red-painted dwellings surrounding temples, stupas and large prayer wheels. The homes are spread over the walls of this remote Tibetan valley like strawberry jam slathered on a scone.On a recent afternoon, workers in hard hats were dismantling cells that monks and nuns had built along a ridge. As they tossed aside wooden beams and plastic sheeting, nuns looked for their belongings in the rubble. Men who appeared to be plainclothes police officers looked on from a bench across the street.\u201cI heard my home will be demolished,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be allowed to stay.\u201dTensions between Tibetans and the Chinese government have been high ever since a widespread uprising across the Tibetan plateau in 2008. Suppression of their culture and religious life remains at the heart of Tibetans\u2019 grievances, and restrictions at important religious institutions like Larung Gar stoke that resentment.Tibetan users of WeChat, a popular Chinese social networking app, have said that those evicted must promise never to return. As of October, as many as 1,000 people had been forced out, residents and human rights groups said.When the demolitions began this summer, officials closed the area to foreigners. The police set up checkpoints outside the valley. But last month, I managed to enter Larung Gar with two colleagues.A major checkpoint on the road was unattended, and we boarded buses at the mouth of the valley that took us into the heart of the settlement. Chinese tourists were also visiting, many drawn by the chance to see a sky burial, an outdoor Tibetan funeral ritual in which a man cuts up a body so that vultures can feast on the remains.At noon, crimson-robed nuns flocked to a gathering at the main nunnery. Among the winding alleyways, clergy walked in and out of their homes, little more than shacks built with wooden beams and sheets of metal and plastic. Monks speaking Mandarin Chinese \u2014 probably ethnic Han \u2014 were digging a sewage canal.It looked like daily life, nothing out of the ordinary, until we reached a large prayer wheel on a road winding up the valley\u2019s north wall. Next to the wheel, four workers in hard hats stood atop a home, ripping off the metal roofing. Nearby was a plot of dirt with rubble from another demolished home.We continued uphill. At the top of the ridge, we saw a long stretch of homes being torn down by workers. We could hear a chain saw, and a yellow earth digger was nearby.This destruction was occurring in a part of Larung Gar with particular religious significance. The homes had been built across from the valley\u2019s highest stupa, which pilgrims and residents circumambulate, often while spinning hand-held prayer wheels.\u201cThe party sees Tibet, inside and outside the Tibet Autonomous Region, as one of the more volatile regions and does not take kindly to alternate sources of authority, including moral and behavioral authority, and clearly the growth of Larung is problematic,\u201d Mr. Sperling said.After Jigme died in 2004, two senior lamas took over, both of whom have expanded Larung Gar\u2019s profile, often going overseas to give talks and teachings. One of them, Sodargye, went to Europe this summer, while the other, Tsultrim Lodro, made the rounds of American universities.The two abbots have not spoken out publicly against the demolitions, and have in fact told residents not to oppose the government. Their view, residents said, is that it is better not to protest the demolition, and instead let it run its course and live peacefully afterward.Across Chinese-controlled Tibet, disciples of Larung Gar have been spreading the \u201c10 new virtues\u201d movement. Based on a Buddhist model, it advocates a retrenchment in 10 principles: no killing or selling animals, no stealing, no drinking, no feuding and so on. The doctrine is especially popular in Garze. Some practitioners wear a pendant with the image of a white pigeon, and officials have noticed their religious activism.Monks from Larung Gar have traveled across Garze to try to defuse local conflicts and help with issues of social justice. In the grasslands area of Lhagong, called Tagong in Chinese, monks helped residents draft paperwork when they wanted to protest a large lithium mine.But residents of the region said the authorities were not happy with such activity. \u201cThey want to control Tibetans,\u201d said a man from Garze who has visited Larung Gar multiple times. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the monastery to develop too quickly.\u201dVanessa Piao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixation on Fake News Overshadows Waning Trust in Real Reporting", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byEssaySomething is deeply wrong when the pope\u2019s voice, reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as \u201ca fantasy news site\u201d to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate, and then be amplified, unchallenged, through a million individual shares.The attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies, because they are indefensible, easy to identify and extraordinarily viral. Fake news is created by the kinds of people who, when asked, might call their work satire, or admit that they\u2019re in it for the money or for the thrill of deception. Theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned, and that Facebook is equipped, and maybe willing, to deal with.For many people, and especially opponents of President-elect Donald J. Trump, the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief, the discovery of the error that explains everything. But as the attention has spread widely \u2014 even President Obama talked passionately about it on Thursday \u2014 it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation, but also as a way to correct the course. It misunderstands a new media world in which every story, and source, is at risk of being discredited, not by argument but by sheer force.False news stories posted on fly-by-night websites were prevalent in this election. So, too, were widely shared political videos \u2014 some styled as newscasts \u2014 containing outright falsehoods, newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions, and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods.During the months I spent talking to partisan Facebook page operators for a magazine article this year, it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication, it contained much, much more of something else.I recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story, posted on a pro-Trump website and promoted on a pro-Trump Facebook page \u2014 and, incidentally, copied from another pro-Trump site by overseas contractors. It tried to cast suspicion on Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier, who had spoken out against Donald J. Trump.The overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying; the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new, sinister one; its insinuating mention of \u201cMuslim martyrs,\u201d in proximity to mentions of Mr. Khan\u2019s son, and its misleading and strategic mention of Shariah law, amounted to a repulsive smear. It was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them.This was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election, clearly designed to function well within Facebook\u2019s economy of sharing. And it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of \u201cfake news.\u201dStories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up \u201cfake news\u201d as a broad media offensive position, especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, and by the candidate himself. As the campaign progressed, criticism of Mr. Trump was instantly projected back at his opponent, or at the critics themselves. \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet.\u201dThis tactic was used on the language of social justice, which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically, in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained. Anti-racists were cast as the real racists. Progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms. This was not a new tactic, but it was newly effective. It didn\u2019t matter that its targets knew that it was a bad-faith maneuver, a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason. The referees called foul, but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds. Or maybe they could, but realized that nobody could make them listen.\u201cFake news\u201d as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold. The fake news narrative, as widely understood and deployed, has already begun to encompass not just falsified, fabricated stories, but a wider swath of traditional media on Facebook and elsewhere. Fox News? Fake news. Mr. Trump\u2019s misleading claims about Ford keeping jobs in America? Fake news. The entirety of hyperpartisan Facebook? Fake news. This wide formulation of \u201cfake news\u201d will be applied back to the traditional news media, which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true, even when they are.Facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem, the clearly fabricated posts. Facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one, to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform. But the worst identified defenders make their money outside Facebook anyway.Another narrow response from Facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces. Facebook tried this, to a very limited extent, with Trending Topics. Members of the company\u2019s editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories, accompanied by links they deemed credible. This initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear. But it is easy to imagine a system in which a story, upon reaching some high threshold of shares, or a source, upon reaching some cumulative audience, could be audited and declared unreliable. This could resemble Facebook\u2019s short-lived experiment to tag satire articles as such.A number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope, for example. But where would that leave the rest of the media? Answered and rebutted, and barely better positioned against everything else that remained. It would be a still-dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact, the main difference being that it would have all been declared, implicitly, not fake.Facebook is a place where people construct and project identities to friends, family and peers. It is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities. It is a system built on ranking and vetting and voting, and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely possible, and where conflict is resolved with isolation. (Not that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy alternatives: For Twitter, it has been a source of constant crisis.)Fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the Facebook economy \u2014 more closely, perhaps, than most of the organizations that are identifying them. Their removal will be an improvement. The outrage at their mere existence, and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the world, will have been justified.But the outrage is at risk of being misdirected, and will be followed by the realization that the colloquial \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 the newslike media, amateur and professional, for which truth is defined first in personal and political terms, and which must only meet the bar of not being obviously, inarguably, demonstrably false \u2014 will continue growing apace, gaining authority by sheer force, not despite Facebook but because of it. The company that created the system that resulted in hoax news stories should try to eliminate them, and with any luck it will. But the system stands to remain intact.Media companies have spent years looking to Facebook, waiting for the company to present a solution to their mounting business concerns despite, or perhaps because of, its being credited with causing those concerns. Some have come to the realization that this was mistaken, even absurd. Those who expect the operator of the dominant media ecosystem of our time, in response to getting caught promoting lies, to suddenly return authority to the companies it has superseded are in for a similar surprise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Is About to Find Out What Donald Trump Really Believes", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In Donald J. Trump\u2019s private conversations and public commentary, one guiding principle shines through: The world is a zero-sum place, and nations, like real estate developers, are either on the winning side of a deal or the losing side.Yet he also is the ultimate pragmatist, perfectly willing to dispense with seemingly core beliefs in return for negotiating advantage. That is why many of his closest supporters have long cautioned that the most headline-grabbing proposals of his run for the presidency should not be taken literally \u2014 they are guideposts, the supporters suggest, not plans. Even Mr. Trump once described his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants as a mere \u201csuggestion.\u201dAs he enters the Oval Office that Ronald Reagan \u2014 another populist pragmatist, but one who had served in public office before the White House \u2014 left nearly 28 years ago, the world is about to find out what Donald Trump really believes. Or at least what he is going to try to do, in partnership with Republicans who on Tuesday retained control of both houses of Congress.It was in Mr. Reagan\u2019s last months in office that Mr. Trump took out a full-page ad in several newspapers complaining that \u201cfor decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States.\u201d Flirting with a presidential run himself \u2014 he was 41 \u2014 and seeking the publicity that would become addictive, he called for the United States to pull out of the Middle East, which he called \u201cof only marginal significance to the United States for its oil supplies,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhy are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing protect their interests?\u201dIt is a line he often repeated in his unlikely candidacy. America\u2019s Asian allies, South Korea included, are about to learn whether that is an opening negotiating position, or the condition for America\u2019s continued military presence in the Pacific. Japan\u2019s best hope arises from the fact that he is now focusing his attentions on the United States\u2019 five-times-as-large trade deficit with China, which he described in May as engaged in \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world.\u201dAt home, his instincts often mix elements of what he has heard or read from the left and the right. His economic policy might best be described as \u201cBig Government Conservatism,\u201d a mix of major tax cuts, mostly for businesses, and a massive infrastructure program to rebuild the dank airports and collapsing bridges that he used in the campaign as a symbol of America\u2019s declining status. It is a subject he comes to easily as a developer who wanted to get customers to his properties.So far, those proposals do not add up to a coherent strategy. The tax cuts come right out of the Republican playbook; the spending right out of the Democrats\u2019 agenda of spurring the economy with government-led job creation. His commitment to preserve social programs is far more Obama than Reagan. His vow to rip apart the Affordable Care Act, the symbolic domestic achievement of the Obama presidency, adopts the favorite cause of the Republican leadership with whom he has often clashed.Experts who have looked at his proposals \u2014 many so vague they cannot be \u201cpriced\u201d \u2014 have concluded that federal deficits will soar. And that gets to Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to entertain two completely contradictory thoughts at once, because rarely did he finish an interview or a debate without reminding listeners that a federal debt heading toward $20 trillion was a \u201cdisaster\u201d that only he could fix. In his first year, he will have to square those two promises \u2014 or not.Indeed, his campaign talk has often contradicted his past proposals. In the early 1990s, for example, Mr. Trump lobbied Congress to raise income taxes on the wealthy to encourage investment in real estate, while advocating the restoration of tax breaks for real estate investments.In 1999, Mr. Trump proposed a \u201cnet worth tax\u201d on the wealthy to pay off the national debt. \u201cPersonally this plan would cost me hundreds of millions of dollars, but in all honesty, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. His motivation: He was considering a bid for the presidential nomination of Ross Perot\u2019s Reform Party, which had made federal debt reduction one of its signature issues.But it is in national security that he faces some of the biggest quandaries.His zero-sum instincts kick in when the subject turns to immigration, which is essentially the importation of people. He has long argued that immigrants take jobs from Americans, diminishing prosperity by dividing the American pie into a larger number of smaller pieces. The idea that they can bolster the economy, too \u2014 as some of the founders of Intel, Google and other Silicon Valley powerhouses did \u2014 never creeps into his speeches.Mr. Trump\u2019s views of the economy are also deeply rooted in his identity as a real estate developer. He regularly emphasizes the economic importance of making things, while rarely mentioning the service work that employs most Americans. He has repeatedly promised to revive the steel production, a line of work that now employs about as many people as a large medical center.In fact, the steel-making era is the one that Mr. Trump harks back to when talking about the time when America was at the peak of its power. He noted in a March interview that in the late 1940s and early 1950s, \u201cwe were not pushed around, we were respected by everybody, we had just won a war.\u201dIt is a view of American power that spills over into his approach to national security. He sees little long-term benefit from funding efforts to eliminate the root causes of terrorism. His mind goes to military solutions first. Few statements were more often repeated, or more heartfelt, than his vow to bomb the Islamic State, and \u201ctake the oil.\u201dThose lines always brought his crowds to their feet. Now comes the far more complex part: He is about to inherit the problem of how to hold and redevelop Mosul once the Islamic State forces are ousted \u2014 under a military plan that he has dismissed as ineffective \u2014 and how to \u201ctake the oil\u201d of a sovereign state, Iraq. And he must do so without returning to an era of constant American combat presence that had made members of his own war-weary party, and Hillary Clinton, blanch.And no relationship will be under more scrutiny than how Mr. Trump handles President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom he has repeatedly praised in terms that shocked his own party, and his running mate.The Cold War was the ultimate geopolitical zero-sum game. For most Republicans, it still is: Twenty-five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is a growing bipartisan consensus in the foreign policy and intelligence leadership that Russia must be both constrained and contained, its harassment of the new members of NATO halted, its cyberattacks deterred.Mr. Trump is an outlier to that view, and never once backed the idea of \u201ccontainment.\u201d He repeatedly made the case that he, and he alone, could negotiate with authoritarians like Mr. Putin.Would he lift the sanctions over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea \u2014 a move that Mr. Trump has seemed to suggest was justified \u2014 and its harassment of Ukraine? Would he back off from the Obama administration\u2019s decision to bolster the American military presence off Russia\u2019s borders?\u201cMy administration,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwill work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS, and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And that includes Russia.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Putin seemed to return that sentiment, sensing his opportunity and saying he looked forward to restoring \u201cfully fledged\u201d relations with the United States.\u201cIf they want to join us by knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Trump said recently, in a statement that oozed Kissingerian realpolitik. \u201cIt is a very imperfect world, and you can\u2019t always choose your friends. But you can never fail to recognize your enemies.\u201dSuch issues will stretch Mr. Trump in new directions. His experience in the business world did little to hone his thinking how to prioritize American national interests: When asked about it in March, he said that \u201cprotection of our country\u201d was No. 1, but he struggled to explain others, including when he thought American troops should be put at risk in defense of a humanitarian cause. With nearly 500,000 people dead in Syria, that issue will be on his desk on the afternoon of Jan. 20, along with many others.David E. Sanger and Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Viacom in Deal to Buy Argentine Broadcast Network", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Viacom has a deal to purchase Argentina\u2019s largest broadcast network, Televisi\u00f3n Federal, for $345 million from Telef\u00f3nica of Spain.The all-cash purchase of Telefe, as it is commonly known, gives the American media giant a strong presence in Latin America. Telefe reaches 95 percent of Argentina\u2019s households through a network of channels and is also a production powerhouse, spreading content throughout the region.\u201cTelefe is an outstanding broadcast and production business, and this acquisition will accelerate our growth strategy in Argentina, one of the most advanced and valuable media markets in Latin America,\u201d Robert M. Bakish, acting president and chief executive of Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon and MTV among other channels, said in a statement.Mr. Bakish recently moved to acting C.E.O. from his previous role leading Viacom\u2019s international business.Viacom would become the first American firm to operate a free-to-air channel in Argentina in almost 50 years. President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December, is trying to woo international investment through a series of market-friendly policies.In addition to the main broadcast network Telefe, which serves the capital and its suburbs, the deal also includes eight networks in Argentina\u2019s provinces, an international pay-TV channel and online platforms.Perhaps most important is Telefe\u2019s production capacity, including 12 studios that produce more than 3,000 hours of Spanish-language content yearly. It also has a library of more than 33,000 hours of content that could help Viacom\u2019s ambitions of expanding into Latin America as it looks internationally to try to make up for a slowing domestic market.\u201cIf it is true that they want to create a production center for all of Latin America, this would be a good place to do that,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Becerra, a local media expert. \u201cTelefe has a very significant archive of content, but what Viacom is really buying is the production capacity.\u201dThe content produced in Argentina could also help feed the growing market for Spanish-language content in the United States.The deal had been rumored for weeks; local media had reported that Time Warner was the front-runner. Telef\u00f3nica had long been looking for a buyer for Telefe, the only free-to-air channel it owned, as it continues to sell assets to pay down debt.Two other American media companies \u2014 Turner, which is a division of Time Warner, and Fox, a News Corporation unit \u2014 seem poised to take over the broadcast of Argentine soccer matches as Mr. Macri\u2019s government undoes a state-run system adopted by the previous administration.An earlier version of this article erroneously included one channel among those that Viacom owns. It does not own Cartoon Network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Companies to Trump: Don\u2019t Abandon Global Climate Deal", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byHundreds of American companies, including Mars, Nike, Levi Strauss and Starbucks, have urged President-elect Donald J. Trump not to abandon the Paris climate deal, saying a failure by the United States to build a clean economy endangers American prosperity.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t change our commitments,\u201d said Kevin Rabinovitch, global sustainability director at Mars, which has pledged to eliminate 100 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions from its factories and offices by 2040. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we see a real business risk. We see a real business problem.\u201dBusinesses large and small have scrambled in the days since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to chart their next moves in an uncertain regulatory situation. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pledges and musings have been driven by the belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from cumbersome federal regulations, especially those that limit carbon emissions.Others, like solar and wind power companies, have raced to find common ground with Mr. Trump, pressing for reassurances that his administration will not slash investment in renewable energy or alter federal tax credits on renewable energy projects.\u201cMr. Trump talks about infrastructure, he talks about jobs,\u201d said Michael Skelly, founder and president of Clean Line Energy Partners, a company based in Houston that builds transmission lines for renewable energy.\u201cWhat we\u2019re creating are welding jobs, steel manufacturing jobs, in Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are projects that create income for landowners, create jobs in the middle of the country.\u201dEnvironmental groups have been left with the daunting prospect that, with a climate skeptic in the White House, they will need to look directly to corporations to assume the mantle of leading the country\u2019s response to climate change. But without strict regulatory standards or oversight, companies will be left freer to pick and choose which climate-friendly policies to pursue, and which they will choose to ignore or abandon.Still, some American corporations have already made significant efforts to reduce their environmental footprints. So reversing them now would be disruptive not just for the environment, but for their bottom line. And even with a move away from climate-friendly policies back home, American corporations face tightening regulations overseas.\u201cNow more than ever, Levi Strauss believes it is important to reaffirm our commitment to address climate change by supporting the Paris Climate Agreement,\u201d said Michael Kobori, the company\u2019s vice president for sustainability.\u201cBuilding an energy-efficient economy in the U.S. will ensure our nation\u2019s competitiveness,\u201d he said, \u201cand position U.S. companies as leaders in the global market \u2014 all while doing the right thing for our planet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
