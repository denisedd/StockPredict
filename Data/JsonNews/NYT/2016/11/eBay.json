{"Headline": "Sculpture\u2019s Woman of Steel, Carol Bove", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byA visit to the sculptor Carol Bove\u2019s studio in a former brick factory near the Brooklyn waterfront does not exactly make Rimbaud\u2019s advice for the true artist \u2014 to engage in a \u201cboundless and systematized disorganization of all the senses\u201d \u2014 leap to mind. A huge manufacturing floor dominated by an overhead gantry that looks as if it could hoist a subway car, the place instead evokes distinctly unpoetic phrases like \u201cproductivity gains\u201d and \u201ccustomer fulfillment strategies.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want my work to be reduced to my personality,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cI want it to be my self, which I think of as something much larger.\u201dDuring a recent visit, she and her assistants had arranged many of the sculptures to mimic the space inside the Zwirner gallery in Chelsea. Ms. Bove (pronounced Bo-VAY) is obsessive about how groups of her pieces work in tandem, almost in the manner of a theater troupe, and how they are experienced \u2014 \u201ckind of like walking through a picture,\u201d she said.The ability to afford what is essentially a huge machine shop has allowed her, perhaps counterintuitively, she said, to make pieces with more spontaneity \u2014 \u201cto look as if they\u2019re almost easy\u201d \u2014 and to continue to have the mental space to think in unconventional ways. It has also allowed her to expand her horizons while staying in Red Hook, where she and her husband, the painter Gordon Terry, have long lived and are raising their two children.Laura Hoptman, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art who organized a show of Ms. Bove\u2019s work in 2013, said she became interested in her art partly because of that risk. She considers Ms. Bove\u2019s forays into big-footprint sculpture to be only superficially riffs on 20th-century forebears. \u201cI had always thought of her as a neo-Modernist,\u201d Ms. Hoptman said. \u201cBut I came to the realization that that wasn\u2019t really it. I started to think that she was more a collector than an appropriator \u2014 a collector of talismans. Her pieces might be the children of those earlier sculptors, but they\u2019re sprinkled with a different kind of fairy dust.\u201dShe added: \u201cThere are some people who come from the time of the counterculture, and they reject it, but she\u2019s embracing it and inspecting it. She\u2019s really drunk her own Kool-Aid.\u201dMs. Bove allowed about as much. \u201cI don\u2019t really believe in the stable self,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a John Chamberlain who wants to come through me, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Later, she emailed this thought: \u201cYears ago, my grandmother made some diminishing remark to me about Busby Berkeley\u2019s achievement, saying that he just copied all of his choreography from a kaleidoscope. But a lot of people have seen a kaleidoscope, and only one person made those dances! Everyone is thoroughly interconnected and everyone is also an individual.\u201dLocating her artistic coordinates on that existential plane is sometimes tricky. \u201cMy failure rate with pieces is pretty high,\u201d she said, but added that she was also practical enough to understand that bills must be paid. (Prices for her large works are now well into the six figures.) \u201cI think of some pieces as the ones that really aren\u2019t going to be able to go out and get a job \u2014 they\u2019re the poets and the dreamers, and that\u2019s O.K. And then there are the others that get out there and earn enough for everybody else. And that\u2019s O.K., too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The original assemblage, with plaster, ceramic vessel, pottery jars and wood, was featured in MoMA\u2019s recent Picasso sculpture show.\u201cIt\u2019s a moment when Picasso is starting a new experimentation in the field of sculpture,\u201d Diana said. \u201cIt\u2019s also one of the works which is totally timeless. She\u2019s like a goddess of fertility.\u201dCalder\u2019s grandson Alexander S. C. Rower \u2014 13 at the time \u2014 vividly remembers his mother coming into his room to tell him that his grandfather was gone.\u201cThere was my grandfather\u2019s dead body under a sheet, the mountainous form of his belly,\u201d Mr. Rower recalled in an interview at the Calder Foundation\u2019s headquarters in Chelsea. \u201cIt was a shock. This guy was vigorous. The night before he died, he was talking about books he had read in his 20s in great detail.\u201d\u201cIt protects Calder\u2019s legacy by keeping coffee mugs or fake prints off eBay, but that\u2019s not where the fun is,\u201d Mr. Rower said. \u201cIt has to be about staying relevant at the same time as honoring his history, back to 1898,\u201d Calder\u2019s birth year.The foundation is the go-to reference center for all things Calder. Curators consult Mr. Rower on how to hang a mobile. Auction specialists call him to examine pieces that come up for sale. Each year the foundation lends about 1,500 Calder artworks and mounts about 15 Calder exhibitions.\u201cWe were both teenagers when our grandfathers died,\u201d Mr. Rower said.In 1977, one year after Calder\u2019s death, Mr. Rower was in his grandfather\u2019s house in France as his aunt prepared to clear away the pile of papers on the artist\u2019s 10-foot-long table. \u201cI said, \u2018What are you doing with all those papers?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m taking them to the dump,\u2019 she said. I said, \u2018No, you\u2019re not,\u2019 and went to the little town two miles away and got cardboard boxes.\u201d\u201cI put all the papers in the cardboard boxes and shipped them back to New York \u2014 it was 14 boxes,\u201d he added. \u201cI put them in my mother\u2019s house on Macdougal Street in a fourth-floor closet. And there they sat for 10 years.\u201dMr. Rower established the foundation in 1987, and said it was \u201cconstantly evolving, constantly unfolding.\u201dNext year, Mr. Rower said, he would consider how to open to the public Calder\u2019s studio and home in Roxbury, Conn., where the artist moved after returning from France in 1933. The studio, built in 1938, \u201clooks like he just went off to lunch,\u201d Mr. Rower said.\u201cEverything\u2019s there,\u201d he continued, \u201chis tools, all the workbenches that he made himself \u2014 it just is this incredible energetic place.\u201dThe residence, too, is just as the Calder family left it. \u201cYou open up a drawer, it\u2019s got my grandfather\u2019s underwear in it and his handkerchiefs \u2014 nothing\u2019s been removed,\u201d Mr. Rower said. \u201cHow do you present that to the public? How do you share that? I want to share it.\u201dCalder\u2019s \u201cConstellations\u201d series was given its title by Marcel Duchamp (who also named the \u201cmobiles\u201d in 1932) and the critic James Johnson Sweeney; Mir\u00f3\u2019s were named by Andr\u00e9 Breton, the father of Surrealism.\u201cBoth bodies were made by these two guys, but neither of them named these bodies of work \u2018the constellations\u2019 themselves \u2014 they were named by other people,\u201d Mr. Rower said.\u201cIf you can project yourself back in time and do this kind of in-depth research,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou discover something that\u2019s really quite surprising.\u201dAn earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to the Picasso sculpture \u201cLa Femme Enceinte,\u201d which is in the Gagosian show. It is an original plaster work, not a plaster cast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " What 10 Actors Wore to a Spike Lee Casting Call in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byFew filmmakers are linked to a borough the way that Spike Lee is to Brooklyn. So when Mr. Lee, the 59-year-old director, announced that he was having an open casting call for a coming Netflix series based on \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d last month, Brooklynites of all stripes turned out. The line of actors and performers at the Masonic Temple was so long that it wrapped around an entire block in Fort Greene. Despite the wait, the crowd was in good spirits and, naturally, smartly dressed. Where did you get that jacket?Tell me about the hat.I\u2019m a Brooklyn boy, born and bred. I\u2019ve got to always represent. I always wear this out to auditions. It\u2019s kind of like my lucky hat.Tell me about these glasses.They came from American Apparel, I got them when I worked there a few years ago. They help simplify outfits. I can wear something crazy and then just some plain glasses.You\u2019ve got the goatee going.I used to have a high-top fade. I cut it off when I graduated because for auditions, it put me in too much of a box. So since my top hair went missing, I was like, I\u2019m going to start doing facial things. I don\u2019t like to look plain. I love your hat.I got this on eBay for like, $4. They had one at Urban for like, $32, and I was like, maybe not. I found an image of the hat and looked it up through Google Image. I just got it in the mail, so I\u2019ve been wearing it to death.Your lipstick and pants match.I\u2019m feeling fall vibes. The color is called saddle, which I guess makes sense.You have a strong layering game going on with the cardigan, the jacket, and the top.I have no bodily climate control. If it\u2019s below 75 degrees, then I\u2019m freezing. And if it\u2019s above 75 degrees, I\u2019m sweating profusely, so I have to dress in layers pretty much all the time.What did you want your outfit to project for this audition?Lately, not just for this audition, I\u2019ve been feeling fall goddess-y. October is my prime. I\u2019m from New England, so this is peak fall, so I\u2019m trying to channel that. Plus, I ran straight here from work.You have a lot of different jobs.They all relate to each other, so why not just do it all? You can meet new people, network. I met someone over here through a fashion designer, and now they\u2019re acting.So is your jacket and hat of your own design?I make jackets and hats, based here in New York, really Brooklyn. All the styles really come from Brooklyn. That\u2019s where all the inspiration comes from. There\u2019s Biggie Smalls, as you can see. He\u2019s from Brooklyn.What\u2019s your company called?TruckingFlyWear. Like a trucker\u2019s hat. If you take the \u201cc\u201d out, it\u2019s true king wear. It has a double meaning.How would you classify your style?I don\u2019t like to curse, so I\u2019ll say trucking fly.Why are you here today?Spike Lee helped Martin Lawrence, and I\u2019m a big fan. Huge. The TV show, the stand-up, his personality. That\u2019s who I grew up with, and Spike Lee gave him an opportunity. I came out here with hopes and dreams like everyone else.Tell me about your hat.I picked it up in a consignment shop in Phoenix last summer. It was a one-of-a-kind piece, and I just had to have it.Your glasses are great.I liked the classic frame, the cat eye. They frame everybody\u2019s face well. It\u2019s all vintage minus the jeans. They\u2019re from Uniqlo.You have a retro look going on.Well, I\u2019m from Baltimore.How do you approach dressing for an audition like this? You want to be a blank slate, but you want an edge. You want to have a certain twist to it, you want to have a bit of glam to it if you\u2019re a girl, because you want to stand out.Where\u2019d you get your hat from?I believe I got it from T.J. Maxx. It was a neutral color, and I thought it was stylish. Everyone asked me about it. I have a lot of hats, some brims, some baseball caps.Where are your glasses from?I got these from a little stand in Union Square. Because I have a fuller face, I always look for something bigger. Smaller frames, they just, like, sink in.Tell me about your outfit.I think my jacket\u2019s from Old Navy and the button-up is from Nordstrom Rack. And my shoes are from Ralph Lauren Chaps.You\u2019ve got a great beard.You were in a K-pop band?Yes, it was called EXP. They are now overseas, and I\u2019m no longer with them. I started acting, so I had to make a decision. We were shown on some Indonesian show and interviewed by a Korean magazine, and we almost had an MTV show, but that didn\u2019t work out.I love your hoodie.It\u2019s from H&M. For some reason, I was wearing a black hoodie earlier but because everything was kind of light, I went with this one because it maybe evens things out.And you went with classic Converse.They\u2019re fake leather, like pleather? I needed white because I was tired of my black ones. And I needed something to pull together my almost-preppy look.Are you dressing more as yourself or for the audition?I never really dress for auditions. I kind of just dress the way I feel. Like I know you\u2019re not supposed to wear ripped jeans, but I would wear ripped jeans or a scoop-neck T-shirt. Today I wanted to be kind of preppy, but not. It depends on the day.That\u2019s a unique name.My mom actually named me that. And then the last name is like a vacuum cleaner. (Laughs.)I love your jacket.This is actually my grandmother\u2019s. She was very stylish. Tell me about your necklaces.I made one of these, and these two I bought from this couple who sells jewelry on the street. They travel around the world collecting items from Indonesia and different parts of Africa, and over the years I talk to them like surrogate parents.Your hair is amazing.Well, I\u2019m a Gemini, but I guess I\u2019m a Leo rising, so there\u2019s a part of me that likes to look like a lion with a mane. So some of it is my own and some of it is not, but I added it in myself. I love the idea of have your aura be something that shines out but you\u2019re giving a few clues.What made you come out today?I\u2019ve been following Spike Lee for most of my life. I grew up around the corner from \u201cDo the Right Thing Way.\u201d I\u2019m black and it\u2019s Spike Lee. You just go.Where\u2019s your jacket from?What does your shirt say?Bloodlinefresh. I got it from the thrift as well. It\u2019s a vintage company. I didn\u2019t know about it before I bought it.Is this how your normally dress or is this for the audition?Both. It\u2019s how I normally dress but I also feel like it\u2019s a nice aesthetic to visualize me for a role.Where\u2019s your coat from?It\u2019s vintage from Goodwill. I saw that it was extra, extra large and I love large clothing. I wanted that stump look.I like that you\u2019re wearing a man\u2019s shirt.I want a uniform look. I didn\u2019t want to do too much. I wanted to be plain today, and I thought this was simple but chic.What\u2019s going on with your jeans?My friend made these. It says \u201cMind Your Business, Summer Spring.\u201d I just told her to put these roses on it, and she added all these extra details.I\u2019m extremely eclectic. I might wear a minidress one day or something oversized the next. It depends on what I\u2019m feeling and how I want to express myself. Tell me about your necklace.How do you dress for an audition, especially since Spike has a distinct visual style?I did think that Spike\u2019s about Brooklyn, he\u2019s Afro-centric, which is why I have the kente bit of my shirt. I\u2019m not the best actor when it comes to dressing for the role. I just tried to do nouveau Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn and his mentality.Why did you come out today?I have an agent and a manager, and I almost didn\u2019t come. But I thought that\u2019s not really the spirit. I have a shot to get into a Spike Lee film, one of my lifelong heroes, why not stand out here with everyone else? You\u2019ve got to be in it to win it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Baking Sweets From Childhood Tales", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byFor love of all the cakes and cookies and treacle and tarts in childhood stories, one mother brings books to life in the kitchen.Do you have a kid? And do you buy your kid the books you loved as a child and remember vividly or not so vividly, more in that weird dream state of illustrations and colors and images and paper? I\u2019ve been doing this, buying these old books. I do it in bed, at night, sourcing the out-of-print ones on Etsy and eBay and AbeBooks, taking impossibly long shots with search terms like \u201cmouse living next to river children\u2019s book\u201d or \u201cdoll with black shoes falls asleep in a flower bed children\u2019s book.\u201d And \u201cbig building painted by children children\u2019s book.\u201dI want, in a greedy way, to see the illustrations again and feel the reassuring cadence of the words I read and reread in order, back then, to not go to bed. This longing is about wanting to be that child again, because books, especially children\u2019s books, can still make me forget the corporeal, that I am who I am.I remembered vaguely one book I loved, about a rodent. (There are so many rodents in children\u2019s books! Nocturnal, squirmy \u2014 it makes sense.) Anyway, about a rodent, and about cakes and icing, illustrated with color photographs. Slowly, with some inside-out search terms and some emails to my brother I rediscovered \u201cMonty Mouse Looks for Adventure,\u201d by Esta de Fossard.Monty is a naughty mouse who goes seeking adventure. After startling a puppy dog eating porridge, Monty catapults into the sugar bowl on a table laid for tea and loads up a roller skate with doughnuts and iced buns before narrowly evading a woman wielding a broom. The photos were spellbinding: the porridge sticky, the iced cakes pink and white and sugary, the mouse cute. Looking at them now, they fall in the so-crap-they\u2019re-great variety. Monty mouse (either taxidermied or trained) looks downright greasy, but still, a deep happiness stirs at the sight of that roller skate heaving with buns.The books I loved best usually had something to do with food. Like \u201cSocks for Supper\u201d by Jack Kent, which is a blunted \u201cGift of the Magi\u201d-type tale about a poor couple who eat only turnips. I loved the crusty drawings of Mickey in Maurice Sendak\u2019s \u201cIn the Night Kitchen,\u201d though I didn\u2019t understand what kind of batter they were putting milk into or what \u201cmorning cake\u201d was. I also liked Else Holmelund Minarik\u2019s \u201cLittle Bear\u201d (illustrated by Sendak), who cheerfully makes some grim-sounding soup that is upstaged by a layer cake. I dreamed of the \u201cchocolate sauce Rasputin\u201d Tomi Ungerer\u2019s young heroine Zeralda makes for a grumpy cannibal in \u201cZeralda\u2019s Ogre.\u201d I too wanted to squeeze Frances the badger\u2019s Chompo Bar in \u201cA Birthday for Frances,\u201d or eat one of Paddington Bear\u2019s marmalade sandwiches and quaff a root beer with Woodstock and Snoopy.But my favorite book by far was \u201cThe Sugar Mouse Cake,\u201d by Gene Zion, delicately illustrated by Margaret Bloy Graham, a favorite Canadian illustrator of mine and of many, who died last year. It is, tragically, out of print. It\u2019s about a royal cake competition; Tom, a talented but bullied pastry cook; and his friend Tina, a rodent. The mildly food-shaming plot involves a music box baked into a cake; a fat, fainting queen; and a bossy, dismissive king; but Graham\u2019s drawings of a court filled with cake sweeten the stereotypes.Growing up, there was a no-sugar policy in my house. We ate bran flakes for breakfast and fruit for dessert. Cake and cookies were gobbled down in other children\u2019s kitchens. I would savor the ads for Hostess cupcakes and pies on the back pages of my \u201cArchie\u201d and \u201cCasper\u201d comics. I still eye boxes of Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes longingly. The men I\u2019ve loved all, in some way, resemble Tony the Tiger.Food and books have always been linked. My mother\u2019s single concession to sugar: I got an M&M for every book I read. I read a lot. I read and reread scenes from the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d series, marveling over the popcorn balls and peppermint sticks. I was transfixed by Templeton the rat\u2019s vision of fairground spoils in E.B. White\u2019s \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web,\u201d as described by the wise old sheep:\u201c... a veritable treasure of popcorn fragments, frozen custard dribblings, candied apples abandoned by tired children, sugar fluff crystals, salted almonds, popsicles, partially gnawed ice cream cones, and the wooden sticks of lollypops.\u201dBased on Edmund Pevensie\u2019s loyalty to the White Witch in \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\u201d by C.S. Lewis, I thought Turkish delight must be some delicious cross between Toffifay chocolates and baklava. Until I tried the real thing.As I got older, desserts from holiday parties became tradition and then portal. I still remember how a slice of chocolate devil\u2019s food cake, soggy with vanilla ice cream, tastes, before taking a bath in a cousin\u2019s bathtub. Suddenly I\u2019m getting into the back seat of an Oldsmobile in pajamas and a ski jacket. A triangle of pumpkin pie, with a spoonful of whipped cream slopped over it, brings me back to an iron-frame bed in an attic above a black potbellied stove in a converted schoolhouse during an October cold snap in Parry Sound, Ontario. A 1950s framed color picture of Queen Elizabeth II hangs on the far wall. Now I wonder what scenes and places will make their way from my daughter\u2019s stomach to her heart.I make a pumpkin pie with my daughter one Sunday. She\u2019s 3\u00bd, and it\u2019s a perfect pie to make with a toddler. Jerkily mixing the pur\u00e9e with spice, eggs and condensed milk seems to give her a great sense of accomplishment. Later that week we read part of \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d by Lewis Carroll and, like me, she enjoys the parts about the cakes and drinks and tarts. I tell her about jam tarts and berry tarts and Canadian butter tarts. About mince and quince in Edward Lear\u2019s poem \u201cThe Owl and the Pussy-Cat.\u201dI tell her that years before she was born, her father and I had staged a mince tart-off. We each made a batch of homemade mince and had friends judge. I went the more exotic route; my recipe included pineapple and beets and Branston Pickle, while her father went traditional. He drove across state lines to buy lard for his crust. I can\u2019t recall who won.Going back to the story of Alice, my daughter and I find that the Queen of Hearts\u2019 tarts were not jam tarts, as I recalled, but were in fact treacle tarts.It occurs to me that we could bake our way through a number of my favorite stories. After preschool the next day, we walk to Myers of Keswick, an English grocer in the West Village, which I know sells Lyle\u2019s Black Treacle, Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup and Devon clotted cream. I also buy a paper poppy, a pork pie and a package of HobNobs. The shop is a rhapsody to nursery food.I look up Dan Lepard\u2019s recipe for tart pastry crust. His book \u201cShort & Sweet\u201d is an oft-thumbed, floured brick on my windowsill. Then I look up various versions of treacle tart online and decide to follow one that uses oatmeal instead of white bread crumbs to thicken the syrupy filling.After her karate class, my daughter and I flour and butter the tins, roll out the dough and scrunch together small foil packets of rice to weigh down the tart cases for blind baking. In the original John Tenniel illustration the tarts are open top, but for the tops of our tarts we cut small pastry hearts.My daughter\u2019s review: \u201cYummy.\u201dWe next attempt the mysterious \u201csugarplums\u201d from \u201cA Visit From St. Nicholas,\u201d better known as \u201cThe Night Before Christmas.\u201d It is a masterpiece of dreamy, complex images in verse. Beyond the \u201cvisions of sugarplums,\u201d which evoked soft, sparkly purple stuff that I imagined tasted like grape soda, my other favorite verse was:These are the lines that taught me how to see when I read.The verse in my 1949 Little Golden Book edition is illustrated with hard candies, cookies and an orange floating above the children nestled in bed. Still, I want to make something resembling my own vision of sugarplums.I find an Alton Brown recipe online that I adapt, adding some dried fruits I have in my cupboard already. Sugarplums, traditionally, have little to do with plums, and from the 17th to the 19th century referred to a variety of small candies with a hardened sugar shell (and then, in popular parlance, to a sweet person). Still, I want to make something resembling my vision of sugarplums.After pulsing the ingredients into a sticky, nutty pile, the mix looks (and smells) like an energy bar. My daughter and I butter our hands and form the mix into 32 glistening dark balls and one worm. We then push them across a plate of raw sugar until they sparkle like gumdrops.The resulting \u201cplums\u201d are earthy and nutty, and taste ... vintage. I like this time-travel aspect. I get the same wrinkle-in-time feeling from Victoria sponge cake and Madeira wine. But I can easily imagine updated variations using peanut butter and dried black currants, or maple syrup instead of honey.My daughter\u2019s review: \u201cI don\u2019t want one.\u201dAs December approaches, we read books about snow and I think of Christmas cake. I\u2019ve always wanted to make a blazing pudding, like in \u201cA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales\u201d by Dylan Thomas, or \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d by Dickens. But the cake residing in my imagination is from \u201cA Christmas Memory,\u201d by Truman Capote. While it isn\u2019t a children\u2019s story (in fact it involves a 7-year-old, drunk on whiskey), it\u2019s a lush and loving piece of time travel wherein a boy and his elderly cousin bake 31 fruitcakes from windfall pecans.I decide to bake during a visit to my parents. They live north of Toronto along an escarpment. It\u2019s cold when we arrive, the wood stove is glowing and my daughter is happy to play with some startled-looking dolls a neighbor is throwing away. I couldn\u2019t find Brazil nuts, dried cherries or figs on the drive up, so my father and I head to the Bulk Barn in a nearby town. We talk about a number of tests he\u2019s recently had to undergo. While I dig in barrels for the dried fruit, he walks his German shepherd in the parking lot.Back at home, my daughter would rather color than help with the fruitcake so I measure, chop and mix myself, listening to the house as I do, the low noise of the TV in the family room, my mother\u2019s voice, my father vacuuming my old bedroom upstairs. I cobble together a recipe from the Capote text and a book of fruitcake recipes written by Marie Rudisill, his aunt. It comes along nicely. I forgo the dreaded red and green candied cherries, and the molasses.Capote lists his cousin\u2019s ingredients:\u201cCherries and citron, ginger and vanilla and canned Hawaiian pine-apple, rinds and raisins and walnuts and whiskey and oh, so much flour, butter, so many eggs, spices, flavorings: why, we\u2019ll need a pony to pull the buggy home.\u201dMy mother finishes baking lasagna for our dinner, and I put two full loaf tins in the hot oven to bake for three hours. There is a power outage after two, but the heat is convection so we cross our fingers.Fruitcake is supposed to sit for weeks and be plied with booze, but in the morning we cut into one of them to sample. It is chewy and fragrant, studded evenly with the nutmeats and fruit. I set the loaves on the counter and scrounge around my parents\u2019 basement for airtight containers and clean cloth to soak and wrap the loaves. I can\u2019t find either, but I do find snapshots my father took in Chicago as a teenager, a drawing of a raccoon I made when I was 18 and a green plastic key chain I loved as a child. When we leave to attend a fund-raising concert for Syrian refugees at a local church, the loaves are still next to the stove. Upon our return, we find the speckled and ravaged heel of one loaf on the countertop. The German shepherd has gobbled the loaves down. He is flopped in a corner, tail wagging, nose resting on his paws.My daughter\u2019s review: \u201cOh dog.\u201dHere, the author \u2014 and illustrator \u2014 shares a recipe for fruity sweets.(adapted from Alton Brown)1. Pulse the nuts and fruits in a food processor until chopped into small pieces, but before the mixture becomes a ball.2. Combine the confectioners\u2019 sugar, anise, caraway, cardamom and salt in a medium mixing bowl.3. Add the nut-and-fruit mixture and the honey. Using buttered hands, combine well.4. Make balls with the mixture, roll them in raw sugar and serve.Advertisement"}

This will help curb overspending, she said.The sweet spot for the best bargains is Dec. 10-18, but, she warned, shopping from Dec. 19 onward is not good because retailers know you are desperate, and they are less likely to cut prices.She added that 95 percent of the Black Friday bargains to be found in brick-and-mortar stores \u2014 with the exception of \u201cdoorbusters,\u201d those deeply discounted items intended to draw shoppers in \u2014 can be found online. If you are not keen on crowds, shop online.\u201cBy doing so, in many cases, it will trigger an automated coupon sent to your inbox pleading for you to come back and complete your purchase with the coupon,\u201d Mr. James said in an email.The coupon offers may be for free shipping or discounts of up to 20 percent off a purchase, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a passive-aggressive way to get a deal.\u201dSometimes getting a price break can be as simple as asking.Activate the live chat feature that many online retailers have and politely ask for a coupon for free shipping or a percentage off your purchase.\u201cThese live chat operators are trained to see this person has stuff in their cart and they\u2019re prepared to make a purchase \u2014 let\u2019s throw them a bone,\u201d Mr. James said in a telephone interview.Doorbuster merchandise is usually in such limited supply that only the most dedicated shoppers \u2014 those who camp outside the store to be the first ones in at opening hour \u2014 will get what they want. The remaining shoppers become a \u201ccaptive audience, and now they\u2019ll go out and buy a bunch of stuff at near full price or full price,\u201d Mr. James said.Many of those people will turn around and sell the heavily discounted items on eBay, he said. Because they are looking to turn a profit quickly, their markups will be modest.Downloading the Amazon app can be a useful way to compare prices in stores against the online retail giant. \u201cIt\u2019s a good tool to make sure you\u2019re not making a stupid purchase,\u201d Ms. Demer said.Many big box stores will match a lower Amazon price if you present proof of the lower price at the customer service desk. That rule is in place year-round, but many stores make an exception for Black Friday. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Bed Bath & Beyond are among the few retailers who will still honor the price match on Black Friday, she said.Skip the shopping cart, because navigating crowded store aisles with one will only prolong your visit, Ms. Demer said. She recommended taking an oversize reusable shopping bag instead.It\u2019s also best to avoid bringing your spouse and children to the store, she said.\u201cThe more people you bring, the more money you\u2019re going to spend and the more angry you\u2019re going to become,\u201d she said. \u201cChaos and impulse buying, it\u2019s all much worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Snag Snapchat Spectacles in New York, a Long, Cold Wait", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byNew Yorkers have been known to queue up for many a hot-ticket item: dinner reservations, iPhones, Cronuts.On Monday, Snapchat Spectacles joined that list as hundreds of people lined up for a chance to buy the eyewear. And after six hours of waiting \u2014 first in the wintry cold, and then in a sparsely decorated pop-up store off Fifth Avenue \u2014 I finally claimed mine.First, a primer. Spectacles are sunglasses with embedded cameras that Snapchat introduced two months ago with the aim of funneling ever more videos to its service. The $130 eyewear records 10-second videos and then wirelessly sends them to the user\u2019s Snapchat app.It\u2019s too early to say whether the trendy sunglasses will succeed at that. But it\u2019s no joke to say that they have quickly drawn a following in Manhattan.Snapchat has kept the locations of its Spectacles pop-up stores secret \u2014 they\u2019ve appeared in the Los Angeles area; at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.; in Tulsa, Okla.; and even the Grand Canyon \u2014 but a pop-up in Midtown Manhattan by the glass-cubed Apple Store was sure to grab attention.The attendees were a mix of those whom one might expect and those one might not. Three staff members from the ad agency McCann gathered behind me. One of them, Timothy Min, an ad director, had dashed into the line out of breath, having commuted from Brooklyn via Citi Bike, subway and a frenzied run.There were men in suits and loafers and some apparent tourists.At least one victorious buyer walked back down the line, wearing one pair of Spectacles while hawking the other pair that he had bought with gusto. \u201cFour hundred and you can leave the line!\u201d he shouted. It\u2019s unclear whether he found any takers.Reporters from USA Today and other outlets descended, along with the temperature. By 9:30 a.m., Snapchat employees had handed out wristbands to some of those in line, demarcating in purple plastic who was assured an opportunity to buy up to two pairs of Spectacles. I received the second-to-last bracelet.By about 12:30 p.m., the last of us were ushered into the pop-up space, which had once housed the restaurant and cafe Bottega del Vino. Once warmly decorated, it was now rendered stark white, with brick walls and an exposed industrial ceiling. Television monitors hung from one wall, rotating as they displayed footage captured from Spectacles.At the far end, standing apart from the crowd, was the bright yellow \u201cSnapbot\u201d vending machine that dispensed the glasses.Even inside, time passed slowly. Word circulated that the Snapbot was having trouble reading some credit cards. Some customers were busy taking videos of themselves and others buying the glasses. Mr. Min of McCann worried that he would run late for meetings that he had already postponed on account of his consumerist adventure.Debates arose over which colors to get: stylish black, colorful blue or ostentatious coral. A Snapchat staff member said the most popular choice was black, followed by the teal-like blue. All decisions were final.Several people sat on the floor, peering intently at their smartphones. A few others animatedly discussed how much they could sell their Spectacles for.Though the line was officially cut off two people behind me, a lengthy crowd remained outside. One man pressed his nose against the glass, then placed his palm against the store window while taking a picture of it, a portrait of melodramatic forlornness.Around 1:15 p.m., the store\u2019s white blinds began to descend, slowly closing off the view of the store from the crowd on 59th Street. Perhaps it was to prevent the appearance of pictures of a half-empty boutique.Just before 3 p.m., my turn at the Snapbot finally came up. The vending machine has three giant buttons representing the colors of Spectacles, with a round screen kitted out with Snapchat\u2019s famed lens technology, virtually placing a pair of the glasses on my face as I made my decision. Within five minutes, and after two swipes of my card, I walked away with two pairs, one black and one blue.By 3 p.m., the final customer \u2014 Joey Pennacchio, the creative director for a video game start-up in Los Angeles, who snagged a wristband from a departing customer and persuaded Snapchat employees to let him into the store \u2014 took his turn at the Snapbot. After handing his phone to a security guard to take video of the buying experience, Mr. Pennacchio bought blue and coral Spectacles.\u201cI\u2019m super stoked to get my hands on them,\u201d Mr. Pennacchio said before his purchase. \u201cI came in with pretty low expectations, but the vending machine is pretty cool.\u201dSnapchat employees cheered at the end of their 10-hour workday. The minimalist store would be cleaned up and prepared for the crowds that would surely be lined up when it was scheduled to reopen on Tuesday afternoon.Mr. Pennacchio and I walked out of the store \u2014 and within minutes of leaving, he told me that he had found a taker for one pair, for $450.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Meaning of Selena", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported bySkin DeepOne morning last month, Maria Herrera, a 28-year-old makeup artist, got in line outside the MAC store in downtown Chicago. It was 1:30. There were already 18 people ahead of her waiting to buy a limited-edition makeup collection inspired by the Mexican-American singer Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez. By 9:30, their numbers had grown by dozens.\u201cSomeone would go get snacks, someone else would go to Starbucks to charge phones,\u201d Ms. Herrera said. \u201cWhen it rained, we shared umbrellas and a plastic tarp. We bonded and were all so happy.\u201d\u201cPeople were coming up to me asking: \u2018What is this Selena collection? I don\u2019t even follow MAC, but it\u2019s trending,\u2019\u201d said Catherine Bomboy Dougherty, senior vice president for global communications at MAC Cosmetics. \u201cWe were saying it broke the internet for us.\u201dIn a first for the company, MAC has an online wait-list and plans to restock the collection in early January.Her fans \u201cwent to such great lengths because they love Selena so much,\u201d Ms. Bomboy Dougherty said. \u201cThis was a no-brainer for us.\u201dResellers on eBay are asking up to $1,000 for the complete set. The retail price is $228.Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez, with her family band, Selena y Los Dinos, was one of the biggest Tejano acts of all time. But why can the singer, murdered in 1995 at age 23 by an estranged former employee, still galvanize, inspire and, ultimately, sell?In a way, what happened isn\u2019t surprising. MAC Selena came to be through the will of her fans.About two years ago, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Figueroa, a makeup artist based in Las Vegas, mocked up faux packaging for a Selena MAC collection.\u201cEventually, we had 20 or 30 people outside our New York office with mood boards and signs,\u201d Ms. Bomboy Dougherty said. \u201cThey had product names and ideas. I went out to talk to them, and at that point I said, \u2018We have to do this.\u2019\u201dThe company worked with Selena\u2019s family to design the collection. Her sister, Suzette Quintanilla, still has Selena\u2019s makeup case. She sent images of the makeup Selena actually wore to the company so it could match the colors.\u201cPeople remember Selena and think of her beautiful smile,\u201d Ms. Quintanilla said. \u201cBut I know Selena was never about herself. That is one reason we didn\u2019t put her photo all over the packaging. She would want to keep it simple.\u201dMs. Quintanilla wanted the collection to be an easily identifiable badge of inclusion for her sister\u2019s fans, another reason for the standout purple packaging. \u201cIf they\u2019re out at a restaurant or a club, and they pull out that lipstick and see another woman with it, there will be automatic connection,\u201d she said.\u201cHer appeal from the beginning was always cross-generational,\u201d said Deborah Paredez, the author of \u201cSelenidad,\u201d which explores the posthumous celebration of the performer\u2019s career. \u201cShe was singing Tejano music, which was a genre that appealed to her parents\u2019 generation but was doing interesting things in that genre, like blending in other Hispanic and popular styles, so that made her appeal to younger generations.\u201dFrom mundane Saturday mornings to life\u2019s milestone baptisms, quincea\u00f1eras and weddings, Selena\u2019s music is on the soundtrack of Latino family life. \u201cNow that I have kids, I know they\u2019ll be listening to her,\u201d said Briana Robledo, 25, a stay-at-home mother and Selena fan who missed out of the collection this time but hopes for better luck in January.Beyond the music, Selena\u2019s self-assured personal style still resonates with her fans. Because of her tragic death, Selena is frozen in time as an unapologetically brown Latina. She designed her own clothing for the stage \u2014 elaborate pieces with rhinestones, bell-bottoms, bright colors and animal prints.Her face and body reflect the Latino diaspora. Brown skin with indigenous features. Full lips, not downplayed to lean into idealized whiteness but, rather, emphasized with bright red lipstick. She had curvy hips and a round rear-end. She seemed to embrace herself fully, and in this age of standardized pop-diva beauty, her self-love translates to tremendous authenticity.\u201cShe was not exceptional of Latinas but, in fact, representative of them,\u201d Ms. Peredez said. \u201cI see Latina women every day who are doing exactly what she did. Self-fashioning in ways that don\u2019t fit in with mainstream sensibilities of style.\u201dMakeup can embolden or serve as a form of social armor. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of confronting people\u2019s assumptions about you,\u201d said Sarah Gould, lead curatorial researcher for the University of Texas, San Antonio Institute of Texan Cultures. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018I\u2019m gorgeous,\u2019 when society may suggest otherwise.\u201dThis may be especially true of wearing a lipstick tied to a woman who is the pride of her people. \u201cShe succeeded in all these ways that it is assumed that brown women won\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Gould said. \u201cShe was a businessperson. She owned fashion boutiques and designed the clothes. She was an award-winning singer. She was a huge source of pride for many Mexican-Americans, because like so many of them, she was third generation and working class.\u201dLarissa M. Mercado-L\u00f3pez is an assistant professor of women\u2019s studies at California State University, Fresno, and mother of four. She didn\u2019t have time to stand in line for MAC Selena. A friend from Idaho sent her some pieces from the collection.\u201cI\u2019m probably the only professor who has Selena posters in my office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a conversation starter with my students, many of whom are Mexican-American or Latinas. Selena\u2019s still doing a lot of work in the community.\u201dLast month, when Dr. Mercado-L\u00f3pez was putting together her tenure file, she put on \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d Selena\u2019s signature red lipstick. \u201cIt made me feel powerful and strong,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one of its sources.

The video includes cameos by curators and friends posing as beer experts and enthusiasts, as well as Mr. Ogboh explaining the concept and development of Sufferhead Original.Both silly and poignant, the video and accompanying bottles and canvases, which are affixed with Sufferhead Original labels, point to the challenges for migrants thrust into cultures where they are treated as interlopers, disrupters or terrorists.

Also in this section, an upbeat 1957 promotional film produced by the Automatic Voting Machine Corporation is a real period piece (as seen from our era of hanging chads and hacking fears).Posted around the gallery, an essay by the New York University history professor Jonathan Soffer, outlining the history of vote-recording in this country, from the oral votes of Colonial America to today\u2019s touch-screen systems, is essential reading.

En cambio, los usuarios de BBVA Wallet reciben un c\u00f3digo CVV din\u00e1mico que solo dura cinco minutos, al que tienen acceso a trav\u00e9s de la app. As\u00ed que incluso si sus datos son hackeados, el c\u00f3digo en cuesti\u00f3n habr\u00e1 expirado, evitando compras no autorizadas.\u201cEs como si cada vez que compraras algo en l\u00ednea usaras una tarjeta distinta que solo se puede utilizar una sola vez\u201d, explica Najera. Los consumidores consideran que esto es algo que cambia por completo las reglas del juego. \u201cA nuestros padres podr\u00eda darles miedo este concepto, pero las generaciones m\u00e1s recientes tenemos mucha confianza en todo lo que se hace en l\u00ednea\u201d, afirma Quijas.\u201cLo que queremos es un sistema lo suficientemente seguro para que cualquiera que no sea yo no pueda ingresar, pero lo suficientemente pr\u00e1ctico para que, si soy yo, me permita tener acceso a mi dinero de manera r\u00e1pida y eficiente\u201d, comenta Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Morales, publicista de Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. En una ocasi\u00f3n, la tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito de Morales fue clonada, y \u00e9l describe la experiencia como algo traum\u00e1tico y frustrante. \u201cSientes como si se te viene el mundo encima\u201d, narra sobre el estr\u00e9s de esperar a que los cargos fraudulentos se investiguen y eliminen.El crecimientode la \"cartera\" digitalLa aplicaci\u00f3n BBVA Wallet tiene m\u00e1s de 5 millones de descargas en todo el mundo, incluyendo aproximadamente 2 millones en Espa\u00f1a, donde la aplicaci\u00f3n se comenz\u00f3 a usar hace tres a\u00f1os. En el transcurso del tiempo, la aplicaci\u00f3n se ha vuelto m\u00e1s din\u00e1mica. En M\u00e9xico, BBVA Wallet se ha adaptado para hacer \u00e9nfasis en la seguridad en l\u00ednea, un sector en crecimiento en el comercio nacional, y en su programa de recompensas. Tambien los usuarios pueden comprar con el celular en comercios f\u00edsicos participantes.El programa de recompensas del banco trabaja con 90.000 establecimientos en el pa\u00eds, y abarca desde la tienda de conveniencia Seven Eleven a la tienda departamental Liverpool. A los consumidores se les ofrecen descuentos y la posibilidad de pagar sus compras con Puntos Bancomer. Mediante geolocalizaci\u00f3n, BBVA Wallet tambi\u00e9n ayuda a identificar lugares cercanos donde los miembros pueden encontrar los establecimientos donde aprovechar todos los beneficios del programa de recompensas.Evoluci\u00f3n continuadaLa aplicaci\u00f3n sigue evolucionando con base en las necesidades y comportamientos de los consumidores. Morales se imagina un mundo en el que un d\u00eda su tel\u00e9fono y su refrigerador est\u00e9n sincronizados. Cuando su refrigerador estuviera a punto de quedarse vac\u00edo, recibir\u00eda una notificaci\u00f3n y con solo presionar un bot\u00f3n, podr\u00eda completar su pedido del supermercado.

{"Headline": "Forget Filling Ad Breaks; Some Marketers Make the Podcasts", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingNow comes \u201cLifeAfter,\u201d a futuristic 10-episode drama, the first installment of which was released this month. It tells the story of a low-level worker at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is obsessed with the traces of life his dead wife left behind on social media, particularly a fictional audio service. The first episode kicks off with what sounds like an ad for that service \u2014 but perhaps that\u2019s a wink of sorts. As with \u201cThe Message,\u201d a notable detail in this branding experiment is that the sponsoring brand is, by design, almost never mentioned.Distributing and helping create such \u201csponsor content\u201d has been part of Panoply\u2019s business for a while. Think of it as a variation on the so-called native advertising or branded content now so familiar online \u2014 material flagged as having been paid for, but crafted to resemble editorial content. According to Matt Turck, Panoply\u2019s chief revenue officer, the company has produced more than 100 episodes of custom podcast series for brands including Purina, Umpqua Bank, Prudential and Starbucks.\u201cIt\u2019s been an important part of our business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt generates revenue and differentiates us in the marketplace.\u201dPanoply spun out of the podcast unit of the online magazine Slate in 2015, positioning itself as a platform for shows produced with partners like The Wall Street Journal and Vox, as well as its own roster of programs. Relatively quickly, Mr. Turck said, the possibility of sponsored shows was added to the mix. G.E., which previously worked with Slate Custom, the site\u2019s sponsored-content division, and became intrigued by podcasting, ended up being one of the first examples.But its approach has been distinct. Most sponsored podcasts follow a fairly traditional hosts-and-interviews format. The decision to turn \u201cThe Message\u201d into a multipart series was inspired in part by the runaway success of the true-crime podcast \u201cSerial.\u201d But the fictional form was an attempt to do something different \u2014 \u201ca new way of reprising the kind of radio dramas of the \u201930s, \u201940s, \u201950s,\u201d said Alexa Christon, head of media innovation for G.E. (The name \u201cGE Podcast Theater\u201d echoes \u201cGeneral Electric Theater,\u201d an anthology series on radio and television in the 1950s and early 1960s that was hosted by Ronald Reagan.)One of the plot twists in \u201cThe Message\u201d \u2014 its story unfolded as a fake podcast documenting efforts to decode an alien communiqu\u00e9 \u2014 was loosely inspired by sound-therapy technology that G.E. is working on. But since that connection is never mentioned, most listeners probably never got it. The name \u201cGE Podcast Theater\u201d is noted at the beginning and end of the series, and on the \u201ccover art\u201d people see when playing an episode on smartphones \u2014 but that\u2019s it.Backing up that assertion is tricky \u2014 one of the widely noted shortcomings of podcast advertising is the dearth of detailed audience data. Outside of download numbers, Ms. Christon said, G.E. judged the success of \u201cThe Message\u201d partly by way of \u201cthe organic groups that have sprung up\u201d in places like Reddit, swapping plot theories and even generating fan fiction.It\u2019s a means, Ms. Christon said, for doing something the best advertising always strives for: \u201ccapitalizing on the zeitgeist.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reviving Fears for a New Generation of Watch Fans", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWhen Nicholas Bowman-Scargill\u2019s mother made a joke at a Sunday lunch about restarting the family\u2019s 170-year-old Fears watch business, he laughed. The company closed 60 years ago, and its revival wasn\u2019t something he had thought much about.\u201cIt was my eureka moment,\u201d Mr. Bowman-Scargill, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019d been working at Rolex for two and a half years, and although I was enjoying working in the workshop, I have always wanted to try my own thing and create my own company.\u201d He was sitting in the office at his home, a 1920s townhouse on a gated cul-de-sac in the London Docklands, in early September, just days before the first 200 watches were delivered.\u201cIt would have been easy to have a modern watch and stick the name Fears on it, but there would have been something very inauthentic about that,\u201d said Mr. Bowman-Scargill, the great-great-great grandson of Edwin Fear, who established the company in 1846 in Bristol, England.Instead, the quartz Redcliff Date combines the old and the new, designed, he said, to appeal to his millennial peers. The name Redcliff refers to the street where the company was originally located, and Mr. Bowman-Scargill has added a date window at the 3 o\u2019clock position. \u201cI was keen to find a name that everything could come from,\u201d he said, noting, \u201cI started with a date because I can\u2019t wear a watch without a date. The date is one of the most useful features.\u201dHe designed the dial on a computer, adapting it from vintage Fears watches found on eBay, like the blue model from the 1940s that he wears daily. They come in classic white or shiny teal blue, since \u201cblue isn\u2019t as formal as black but is still smart \u2014 with teal being more distinctive than navy,\u201d he said. The hands, which end in small arrowheads similar to those on the original watch, were created through the Swiss company that manufactures the timepieces. (Mr. Bowman-Scargill said the company wanted to remain anonymous for commercial reasons.)Interchangeable leather straps come in the same teal blue, as well as in red, tan, mink brown and the traditional black. \u201cSo you can wear the watch with a suit or jeans and T-shirt,\u201d he said.Mr. Bowman-Scargill\u2019s experience as a Rolex watchmaker\u2019s assistant and quick-service technician helped him shape his new company. He said the watches will have consistent elements \u2014 like the arrow-tipped hands \u2014 \u201cso in 10 years\u2019 time you can recognize a Fears watch.\u201d And he has created several after-sales services, such as battery supplies, repairs and engraving, that he hopes will keep customers coming back.Mr. Bowman-Scargill said the brand\u2019s history has been a bonus: \u201cBefore I had a physical watch, I had a story to tell, which has started conversations, either in the pub or with suppliers, as it elevates the watch from an idea to there actually being something behind it,.\u201dLucy Cheesewright, the director of SalonQP, agreed. \u201cI brought the brand in because of the story rather than the specifics of the watches,\u201d she said.But Mr. Bowman-Scargill acknowledged that hitting the right blend of heritage and modernity was like walking a tightrope.\u201cI had to decide how much of the heritage I use \u2014 as what is interesting to me, might not actually be interesting to anyone else,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI wanted to create a watch with its own personality, otherwise it\u2019s stuck in the past. But not so modern that it destroys the heritage.\u201dThe watches will be available online beginning Nov. 3, at \u00a3650 pounds, with additional straps at \u00a385 each. Instagram and Facebook helped him get 40 pre-orders since March, and he is in talks with retailers.His plans include the introduction of a chronograph model, as well as a bricks-and-mortar store of his own, to \u201ccreate a Fears world where everything is done, showcasing the theater of watches as Ralph Lauren has done with fashion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nintendo\u2019s New Console May Feed Your Nostalgia, if You Can Get One", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byWhen she heard that Nintendo was planning to reproduce its iconic Nintendo Entertainment System video game console for the holiday season, Emily Bradbury put a note on her calendar and set an alarm on her phone.She was not interested in buying it for her children. She wanted it for her husband.\u201cHe\u2019s 40 years old and grew up with a Nintendo,\u201d Ms. Bradbury said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nostalgia thing.\u201dSince its release on Nov. 11, the NES Classic Edition, a smaller version of the original console introduced to North America in 1985, has become one of the hottest gift items of the year. It has struck a chord especially among older millennials and younger members of Generation X, who may have found in it a video game system to share with their children \u2014 if they don\u2019t just keep it for themselves.It retails for $60, with one original controller, and comes preloaded with 30 classic games, including Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Tecmo Bowl.But this trip down memory lane has not been without headaches. Nintendo has been sluggish in responding to the demand, resulting in huge markups on the secondary market, including on sites like eBay, where the consoles were being resold for as much as $390. Those higher prices are sure to stand out even more on Monday, when many other brands and retailers cut prices for Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday.On the release date, most retailers, including Amazon and GameStop, sold out almost immediately. (Pre-orders had sold out over the summer.) Walmart kept a very limited supply in stock that it trickled out in online flash sales over the last two weeks. The consoles sold out within two minutes each time.Heeding her calendar warnings and alarms, Ms. Bradbury tried to order the NES online through Amazon and Walmart but could not act quickly enough. She even enlisted friends to visit nearby Target and Best Buy stores in Wichita, Kan., the closest big city to her home. But they, too, returned empty-handed.\u201cI thought it would be a bunch of us 40-something people going after it, but it won\u2019t be much of a big deal,\u201d said Ms. Bradbury, the member services director for the Kansas Press Association, a trade organization for Kansas newspapers. \u201cI was shocked.\u201dBut Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst, said he was not surprised by the intense demand or the low supply, which he considered an intentional move by Nintendo to garner attention, knowing that it could restock before the holiday shopping season was over.\u201cThe Classic is sold out for three reasons: It\u2019s nostalgic, it\u2019s cheap and Nintendo clearly didn\u2019t ship enough of them,\u201d Mr. Pachter said in an email, adding: \u201cThere is plenty of time to stock the channel. They may miss Black Friday, but they won\u2019t miss Xmas.\u201dIn a statement, Nintendo said that it was \u201cworking hard to keep up with consumer demand.\u201d\u201cThere will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year,\u201d the statement read. The company declined to comment further.Mr. Cole said buyers were pursuing the NES Classic Edition mostly for nostalgia, but he thought the console could potentially make older customers interested in future Nintendo products.\u201cThey had really lost their brand identity the past two years,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThis was the kind of thing that was perfect for bringing that back.\u201dBut such a plan will work, Mr. Cole added, only if Nintendo manages to restock before the holidays are over.\u201cIf they don\u2019t, they really miss out on an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat demand might not carry over into 2017.\u201dJim Silver, editor of TTPM, a toy review website, says that nostalgic items have been big this year, and that retailers are recognizing that many of the children who grew up in the 1980s are starting families of their own. He noted that Stretch Armstrong figurines, and Strawberry Shortcake and Teddy Ruxpin dolls have all begun making comebacks. The NES is no different.\u201cThis is not 8-year-olds saying, \u2018I need to have Zelda,\u2019\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cThis is adults saying, \u2018These were my favorite games. I get to play them again.\u2019\u201dBut shopping for a hot holiday item, even online, is hardly simple today. And those who have managed to acquire the new NES at the retail price seem to have benefited from extensive planning, research and luck \u2014 even strategizing since July, when Nintendo announced its plans to release the NES.Michael Salazar, from Sacramento, Calif., managed to place a request to pre-order a console on July 22 through Amazon\u2019s British website. When it arrived last week, shipped directly from Edinburgh, Mr. Salazar was elated.He then used a secondary site, which tracks inventory at Target stores, to monitor whether any consoles had arrived locally. When he saw that a nearby Target had received three, he rushed there at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday to buy one as a present for his brother-in-law.Now, he is looking for a third to give as a gift.\u201cI\u2019m 38; that\u2019s my childhood,\u201d Mr. Salazar said. \u201cNintendo was always a very important piece of my life.\u201dAmanda Schluer, of Rocklin, Calif., had the foresight in July to set an alert on Amazon for one minute before the release date. Then she watched the seconds tick down.\u201cI\u2019ve sat and waited for Garth Brooks tickets the same way,\u201d Ms. Schluer said. \u201cJust wait until the second they go on sale and push the button.\u201dBy acting quickly, Ms. Schluer, 38, managed to buy a console. She and her husband even took their NES to Los Angeles to play with family over Thanksgiving.\u201cWe have a Wii, and my kids never play it,\u201d said Ms. Schluer of her two daughters, ages 6 and 10.\u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about the old retro games,\u201d Ms. Schluer added. \u201cThey are fun, they\u2019re age-appropriate, and it\u2019s something we can all play together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philanthropy in Silicon Valley: Big Bets on Big Ideas", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byGiving Special SectionSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The founders of Silicon Valley\u2019s technology companies, many of whom have amassed huge fortunes at a young age, tend to look at their philanthropic giving much as they do their companies: They study a problem, explore a number of ways to attack it and eventually invest heavily to scale up the ideas they think will be winners.The couple eventually made substantial donations to programs identified by GiveWell, including nearly $30 million to the Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes mosquito nets to reduce malaria infections among children in Africa, and more than $47 million to GiveDirectly, a program that gives cash directly to extremely poor people in Kenya and Uganda.More recently, Ms. Tuna and Mr. Moskovitz have chosen to fund projects intended to mitigate potential global catastrophes, like an epidemic of a deadly disease, biological warfare and the threats posed by advanced artificial intelligence.Those risks receive little attention from other philanthropists, Ms. Tuna said, which is one reason Good Ventures decided to focus on them.\u201cWe think internally about worldview diversification,\u201d she said.Many of the projects funded by Good Ventures will not succeed, but she and her husband are comfortable with that. \u201cI actually expect that most of our work will fail to have an impact, and that is part of doing high-risk philanthropy well,\u201d Ms. Tuna said.This methodical approach is characteristic of tech-industry philanthropists, said Emmett D. Carson, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which has advised about 2,000 donors in the region on their giving.\u201cThey talk to people themselves. They read the material themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are willing to make very big bets on very big ideas, provided that they learn something.\u201dAmir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University, said that in analyzing the philanthropic approaches of big donors, it helped to consider how they made their money. \u201cWealthy folks tend to use their experience and say, \u2018How can I apply that to solve the world\u2019s problems?\u2019\u201d he said.Data on different donation styles is scarce, but some general trends are apparent, according to those who study philanthropy.\u201cTech people tend to be interested in more early-stage start-ups,\u201d said William Foster, head of consulting at the Bridgespan Group, which works with nonprofits and philanthropists on high-impact social change projects. These philanthropists typically support disruptive new ideas, get more directly involved in their giving and show a willingness to move quickly to another approach when one fails.The couple, who made the pledge after years of conversations with scientists and other philanthropists, did not donate the money to a leading medical institution or university. Instead, they said they intended to invest the funds in efforts to build basic tools to help the whole scientific community make breakthroughs in research.Some of the $3 billion will be spent advocating for more public and private money to attack disease. As they have done with their education initiatives, the couple is also likely to take ownership stakes in for-profit companies that are doing promising work.The Omidyar organization\u2019s efforts to bring financial services to underserved populations, for example, include all three types of contributions. Early on, Omidyar financed BRAC, a nonprofit that makes microloans in Africa, Asia and Haiti. It has also invested in for-profit companies like Prosper, a peer-to-peer lender, and MicroEnsure, which provides insurance to low-income people in emerging markets.\u201cWe have a motto here: Problem first, tool second,\u201d said Matt Bannick, a former eBay executive who is managing partner of the Omidyar Network. The approach appeals to Silicon Valley\u2019s pragmatism and has since been widely adopted by the region\u2019s philanthropists.The Omidyar Network, which focuses on early-stage projects, also takes board seats and provides networking opportunities and training to the organizations it finances. \u201cHalf of the organizations report that our nonmonetary assistance to them was as valuable as our monetary assistance,\u201d Mr. Bannick said.Measuring the precise impact of any particular gift or investment is more difficult. You can count the number of solar lanterns distributed or the number of mosquito nets handed out, but how do you measure the impact of those on a child\u2019s life?\u201cThere are a lot of people who have tried to figure out whether you can boil down impact to a number,\u201d Mr. Bannick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dStill, principles like focusing on underfunded yet highly effective charities can be helpful for any donor, no matter how small.\u201cThe biggest piece of advice I would give any donor is to be proactive,\u201d Ms. Tuna said. \u201cFind the best charity for your values. The charities that are the most aggressive and best at marketing aren\u2019t necessarily the ones doing the most good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
