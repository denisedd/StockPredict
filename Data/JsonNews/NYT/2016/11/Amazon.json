{"Headline": "An Anthropocene Journey", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "In the essay, I explore the host of meanings and debates that have emerged around the word, saying, \u201cAfter 16 years of percolation and debate, anthropocene has become the closest thing there is to common shorthand for this turbulent, momentous, unpredictable, hopeless, hopeful time\u00e2\u0080\u0094duration and scope still unknown.\u201dIn 2000, after a century of earlier efforts by scholars, scientists, and at least one journalist (me) to give a name to humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emerging role as a planet-scale force, one word emerged in a heated moment at a global change conference in Cuernavaca, Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0094anthropocene.It appears to be here for the long haul. After 16 years of percolation and debate, anthropocene has become the closest thing there is to common shorthand for this turbulent, momentous, unpredictable, hopeless, hopeful time\u00e2\u0080\u0094duration and scope still unknown.The word is still so novel that no one has even settled on how to pronounce it; the British stress the second syllable and Americans the first. That seems appropriate, given that reactions to the emergence of the term\u00e2\u0080\u0094let alone the actual environmental changes it aims to describe\u00e2\u0080\u0094have come in all colors and flavors. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even been a spirited push for alternatives, some rather biting.The anthropocene (both the word and the unfolding age) has so much Rorschach-like plasticity that all I can offer as guidance are my informed but subjective reflections based on what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned and unlearned in my long, quirky journey. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that what matters most is not resolving some common meaning so much as engaging in deeply felt discussions, fresh lines of inquiry, and new proposals for sustaining the human journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which have been sparked by the emergence of this concept.To navigate this terrain,\u00c2\u00a0it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to start with the foundational anthropocene idea, as blurted out in February 2000 during a scientific meeting on human-caused global change. A prominent participant was Paul J. Crutzen, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d won a Nobel Prize for helping identify the threat certain synthetic chemicals posed to the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protective ozone layer. At the meeting, his frustration grew as peers described momentous shifts in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating systems, but always anchored them in time by mentioning the Holocene. Holocene is the formal name for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwholly recent\u00e2\u0080\u009d epoch of planetary history that began at the end of the last ice age 11,700 years ago.At one point, Crutzen couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold back. He interrupted a colleague, as the scientist Will Steffen later described: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop using the word Holocene. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in the Holocene any more. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 (searching for the right word) \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the Anthropocene!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cConsidering these \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 major and still growing impacts of human activities on Earth and atmosphere, and at all, including global, scales, it seems to us more than appropriate to emphasize the central role of mankind in geology and ecology by proposing to use the term \u00e2\u0080\u0098anthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for the current geological epoch.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCrutzen and several collaborators refined the concept in subsequent papers. The term quickly spread, propelled in a dizzying array of directions as if filling a linguistic vacuum. It began popping up in peer-reviewed literature in a variety of disciplines and eventually spawned at least three scientific journals (and one magazine) using \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d in their titles.But a long road lay ahead. The following year, Zalasiewicz and some colleagues began assembling a working group on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the invitation of one of the 16 subcommissions of the International Commission on Stratigraphy. Those quotation marks around \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappear until some final judgment on the validity of a new epoch is reached.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps earth scientists of the future will name this new post-Holocene era for its causative element\u00e2\u0080\u0094for us. We are entering an age that might someday be referred to as, say, the Anthrocene. After all, it is a geological age of our own making. The challenge now is to find a way to act that will make geologists of the future look upon this age as a remarkable time, a time in which a species began to take into account the long-term impact of its actions. The alternative will be to leave a legacy of irresponsibility and neglect that will manifest itself in the fossil record as just one more mass extinction\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the record of bones and empty footprints left behind by the dinosaurs.\u00e2\u0080\u009dReflecting on this now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite certain that when I wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cearth scientists of the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was thinking generations, if not centuries, into the future. But it took just eight years for scientific rigor to be applied to the idea of an anthropogenic geological age. We do live in fast-forward times.~~According to the dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition, the Anthropocene is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe era of geological time during which human activity is considered to be the dominant influence on the environment, climate, and ecology of the earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore including it, the OED editors had wisely let the word percolate for 14 years after it first entered widespread discourse. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that they jumped the gun in one important technical way and missed the main, grander meaning of the word. That second point is not a criticism; it just reflects the plasticity and richness of this still-emerging neologism.The technical problem with the definition? The word, despite having roots springing so directly from stratigraphic nomenclature, could still end up rejected as a formal \u00e2\u0080\u009cera of geological time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u2026Many influential stratigraphers have expressed deep skepticism that the Anthropocene deserves formal standing. For one thing, any new addition to the time scale must be useful to science. Calling an abrupt end to the Holocene could achieve the opposite, creating confusion in the literature. There are significant debates over when to mark the starting point or lower boundary of the Anthropocene in the time scale.Now in its seventh year, the working group has been under pressure to complete its formal recommendation to the stratigraphic commission. Almost daily, emails fly back and forth among its 35 members, refining drafts of papers (including a response to Finney and Edwards) and planning next steps. There have been three face-to-face meetings of the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s members, most recently in Oslo in April 2016.Coincidentally, that meeting kicked off on the 46th Earth Day. We gathered around a long table in an ornate room at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in a mansion built a century ago by the famed Arctic explorer for whom the institute was named. For two long days, discussions led by Zalasiewicz and Colin Waters of the British Geological Survey centered on a review of the \u00e2\u0080\u009carguments against formalization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The 17 bullet points ranged from the technical and straightforward\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cstratigraphic record is minimal \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 based on predictions \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the testy and provocative\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c[T]he Anthropocene is political, not scientific.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As if to remind participants of the gravity of the task, there was a plastic-laminated copy of the scale itself at each seat, along with the usual array of writing pads and pens.And now the revolutionary genetic editing tool CRISPR is poised to imprint humans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambitions on that tree at least as profoundly as fossil fuels have changed the physical world. I also noted that the sparring in the stratigraphy community strongly echoed fights that had first erupted in meteorology and climate science 25 years ago, as new lines of evidence and new tools, such as global climate models, pointed to a growing and disruptive human warming influence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. But I stressed, using climate change as an example, that it is possible to separate the \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\u00e2\u0080\u009d of science from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cought\u00e2\u0080\u009d of society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices. With some bumps and bruises, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had found a way forward. Now it was geology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn.There was some irony in the stroll each day between our hotel and the Nansen Institute. It took us along the shore in front of a giant Jenga-block scramble of horizontal white towers that belong to Statoil. Norway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly state-owned oil company has contributed substantially not only to Norway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy but also to global climate change. Even as Norway was adding incentives for drivers to buy electric vehicles to take advantage of ample domestic hydro-electric power, the company announced plans to expand drilling in the Barents Sea to boost fossil-fuel exports. One got the impression that decisions made in that building would have a bigger impact on world affairs than any conclusions we produced.But there was a second layer of irony there on the windswept shores of the fjord. The grassy stretch along the sinuous path was also a sculpture park. A vertical slab rose from the grass directly in front of the Statoil building, imprinted with an image of one of Easter Island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moai\u00e2\u0080\u0094the haunting stone figures carved at the potent pinnacle of the great, but vanished, Rapa Nui civilization.While many geologists worry that a human-etched epoch grants us too much power on the basis of too little evidence, a few think the proponents of the geological Anthropocene are thinking way too small. One such expert is Jay Quade of the University of Arizona. After decades of fieldwork and lab analysis on six continents, Quade\u00e2\u0080\u0094whose father and grandfather were geologists\u00e2\u0080\u0094seems to live, breathe, and eat insights from ancient rock. I met him in June at a Santa Fe, New Mexico, gathering of scientists focused on the Quaternary Period. He credited the efforts of Crutzen and scientists such as those in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u009d working group for all that they were doing but said his reading of the evidence pointed to an even more massive unfolding geological transition. It could, he believed, be akin to\u00e2\u0080\u0094if not bigger than\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Permian-Triassic mass extinction 250 million years ago and the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction that cleared out the dinosaurs and led to the Age of Mammals\u00e2\u0080\u0094and us.Time will tell.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the End, Divide Between Clinton and Trump Is Only a Mile", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byJust one mile. That was all.After the most divisive presidential campaign in living memory, a cross-country melee for the ages, the two warring camps pitched their election night tents and waited to hear the nation\u2019s agonized decision. All that separated them, as the bird flies, was a single mile across the midsection of Manhattan.The Republican Party of Donald J. Trump prepared to cheer or cry at the New York Hilton Midtown, a spacious establishment along the Avenue of the Americas, between 53rd and 54th Streets. Meanwhile, to the southwest, the Democratic Party of Hillary Clinton braced to celebrate or concede at the glass-encased Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, on 11th Avenue and 34th Street.And geographically, at least, only a mile of New York City pavement divided them.It seemed odd at first, even tone deaf, for the two candidates to have chosen to end their races in Manhattan. This was, after all, evil Gotham, supposed home of liberal elites so out of touch with \u201creal\u201d Americans everywhere else.The easy explanation is that Mr. Trump is a born New Yorker, while Mrs. Clinton is a former United States senator from New York who has adopted the Westchester County town of Chappaqua as her home. They are the first New Yorkers to represent the two major parties in a presidential election since Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) defeated Thomas E. Dewey (R) in 1944.But back to that mile of pavement. Suppose a line were drawn between the Javits Center and the Midtown Hilton on a map of Manhattan. What would be seen? What would it say about a country on the cusp of new leadership? And what would be found in the exact middle, between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump?The Javits Center gleamed a frozen-blue in the distance, a cube-stacked glass structure that conveyed the proverbial ceiling that Mrs. Clinton intended to smash. It seemed unattainable \u2014 the building, at least \u2014 given the many police barricades. At every turn, it seemed, a police officer holding a cup of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee pointed to a distant entrance, on 40th Street.Here, a stencil in the street of a Clinton silhouette, accompanied by the words \u201cMadam President.\u201d There, a street vendor, selling red-white-and-blue Clinton flags to be worn like shawls, or superhero capes (\u201cBig flags are $20, little flags are $10.\u201d). And above it all, a billboard for an Amazon program called \u201cGood Girls Revolt.\u201dMeanwhile, at the Midtown Hilton a mile away, security was looser, as hotel guests tried to wheel their luggage past the formally dressed Trump supporters gathering on the lobby\u2019s marble floor. If some women heading for the Clinton party wore white, to honor suffragists, some women bound for the Trump gathering were wearing fire-red, the chosen color of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.Heightened security also tied the two camps together. Orange sanitation trucks filled with sand served as barricades, while police officers with \u201cCounterterrorism\u201d emblazoned on the backs of their blue shirts kept watch. It was one of many reminders of the America that the night\u2019s president-elect would be inheriting.Heading northeast from the Javits Center, that diagonal path passed Clyde Frazier\u2019s Wine and Dine, where the many televisions meant for sporting events now displayed the slow tally of electoral votes \u2014 a scene that recalled how the three presidential debates were often promoted with the hyperventilated fervor of a football game.It passed the concrete road loops leading to the Lincoln Tunnel, leaving the Empire State Building \u2014 aglow in lights of red, white and blue \u2014 in the small of many rearview mirrors. And, in the shadows of the underpass, stood an unkempt man with a thin mattress at his feet, carrying on a solitary conversation.The complex issues of the homeless and mentally ill \u2014 this too shall be inherited.The path also crossed Covenant House, an eight-story shelter for homeless youth that was a polling place for the night. Busy, the poll workers said. Very busy.Now, heading southwest from the Midtown Hilton, the diagonal path cut across restaurants rare and routine, Le Bernardin and Sbarro\u2019s, the Capital Grille and T.G.I. Friday\u2019s. It sliced across the eternal brightness of Times Square and past a homeless man who pitched for donations \u2014 \u201cMy name is William and I\u2019m a good guy, not a bad guy\u201d \u2014 while a tourist recorded the desperate street performance without reaching into his own pocket.It passed, too, the Engine Company 54/Ladder Company 4 firehouse on Eighth Avenue that lost 15 firefighters in the World Trade Center attacks. Their names and photographs are on display, but a sign says, \u201cPlease No Photos.\u201d The raw aftermath of that day will also be passed on to the new president.So where, then, do these two paths meet? The one coming from the Hilton Midtown to the north and the other from the Javits Center to the south? The meeting point is, roughly, at El Rancho Burritos, a small Mexican restaurant near the corner of Ninth Avenue and 45th Street, between the Westside Deli and Cleantopia Cleaners.There, the owner, Manuel Gil, was working the counter, taking orders for burritos and enchiladas and steak ranchero. A short man of 54, wearing a white paper hat and a white apron over a dark T-shirt, he agreed to sit for a minute and tell his story.Mr. Gil came to New York from the Mexican city of Puebla more than 30 years ago, joining his father. He worked as a dishwasher at a fancy restaurant, a worker in a garment factory, and an assistant in a burrito restaurant, all the while saving his money for one day.That day came 20 years ago, when he rented out this cramped space and opened his restaurant. It has room enough for only five tables, each adorned with a small vase of plastic tulips. Stacks of Jarritos soda, mango and lime, take up what little room is left. On the far wall hangs an oval portrait of the Virgin Mary, a poster providing instructions for the Heimlich maneuver (\u201cChoking Victim\u201d), and a television that on this night was broadcasting election coverage in Spanish.Mr. Gil, who lives in Queens and works 60 hours a week, became a citizen 15 years ago. He and his wife, Carmen, who often works beside him, have four children: an accountant, a photographer, a student at Ithaca College and a student at the High School of Fashion Industries.In the late 1940s, shortly after Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were born, this part of Manhattan, called Hell\u2019s Kitchen, was mostly Irish and Italian. But now here was Mr. Gil, representing the ever-changing city, the ever-changing country.This flow of change will also be inherited.Mr. Gil removed his white apron to reveal a Hillary Clinton shirt that his daughter Leslie, the photographer, had bought him. He had voted for Mrs. Clinton, he said, because she was more capable. Mr. Trump, he said after a long pause, was not yet ready to be president.The reports in Spanish that emanated from the television behind him were suggesting that the rest of the country disagreed. But this is how it goes. And no matter who won, come late morning he\u2019d be back behind the counter of his restaurant, greeting the new, uncertain day.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the owner of El Rancho Burritos. He is Manuel Gil, not Miguel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Six Designers Take On Some of the World\u2019s Toughest Redesign Challenges", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.There was \u2014 and is \u2014 always room for improvement. The litmus test is urgency: Is a redesign really necessary? Is there such a thing as a perfect thing? The original Gem paper clip, for example, a paragon of design virtue, is still safely beyond reach. We can count copies and variations in the hundreds \u2014 from the spiral to the owl\u2019s head and the inverted triangle \u2014 but no matter how compelling these formal riffs are, they cannot be called redesigns. I\u2019ll bet you the paper clip will not last forever, however. In the design cycle of creative destruction, it, too, will one day meet a new maker.Design experts or not, we can all think of a long list of objects that are calling out for review. Chances are that at least one of the six objects reimagined in the pages that follow \u2014 the cell tower, the hospital gown, the toilet, the airport baggage-delivery system, the bike lock and the prescription-medicine label \u2014 have led you to howl in despair more than once.The six designers and teams we approached all rose to the occasion, each displaying different design muscles \u2014 from the mastery of complex systems (Raffaello D\u2019Andrea) and self-assembly (Skylar Tibbits) to a passion for clothing differently-abled bodies (Lucy Jones); from a knack for making information clear and engaging (Periscopic) to a metaphysical appreciation of bodily functions (Mathieu Lehanneur) and the ability to infuse objects with elegance and intelligence (Rinat Aruh).Redesign is a positive and constructive act, one of adaptation (to new technologies, to changing mores, to new legislation, and so on). It can bestow blessings not only of form but also of function and even meaning. The best sort of redesign is a substantial and welcome addition to the world. \u29ebPaola Antonelli is a senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art.Redesign by: Rinat AruhText by: Daniel DuaneThe rack positions the lock as an additional carrying surface for excess cargo. A GPS chip inside allows for tracking in case of theft.The mobile alarm lets you bolt outside before a thief can cut through the lock and \u2014 given how well thieves tend to know their locks \u2014 makes your bike even less attractive.An internal cavity lined with titanium holds the lock\u2019s circuit board, battery, accelerometers, siren and electric motor for the locking mechanism.\u201cYou can\u2019t solve for everything,\u201d says the designer Rinat Aruh, a co-founder of the firm Aruliden. \u201cIf a thief wants to steal a bike, they\u2019re going to find a way. So we decided to make it annoying.\u201d Aruh did more than that. She borrowed the elongated-oval shape of a classic link of chain to create a timeless form that feels inevitable, as if bike locks were always meant to look this way. The rack, fixed to the seat post, floats her lock over the rear wheel, making it look less like an anti-theft device than a natural design extension of a well-made frame.Anyone who has ever locked a bike outside a restaurant or a bar and then jockeyed for a window seat to keep a watchful eye will appreciate the additional deterrents hidden inside: tamper-sensitive accelerometers that trigger a sonic alarm and a smartphone alert at the instant a thief gets to work. And even if a thief manages to get away with your bike, a GPS chip embedded in that lock\u2019s rack means the cops will know where to find him.\u201cThe idea is that if I\u2019ve got five bikes in front of me, I\u2019ll steal this one last,\u201d says Aruh, who may be underestimating the good taste of the average bike thief. \u29ebAruliden is a New York-based brand strategy and design agency.Daniel Duane is a regular contributor to The New York Times.Redesign by: Skylar TibbitsText by: Jon GertnerBut rather than continue the strategy of concealment and disguise, Skylar Tibbits, at M.I.T.\u2019s Self-Assembly Lab, wants to rethink the tower\u2019s essential infrastructure. Tibbits\u2019s work focuses on programming building materials \u2014 wood, textiles, synthetic fibers \u2014 to respond automatically to external stimuli like heat, cold, light, wind or water. Tibbits asks of the next-gen cell tower: \u201cHow can we make it change shape, bend, twist, twirl, expand, so the cell tower can adjust to the weather, time of use, time of day \u2014 or if there\u2019s a big event nearby?\u201dThe tower is constructed from biaxially braided composite tubes. The biaxial braid, much like a Chinese finger trap, allows the tower to expand, contract, twist and bend like a very large textile structure, yet be self-supporting and stable.The answer, he argues, could involve a composite material, like carbon fiber or fiberglass, which in combination with the structure\u2019s shape and weave would enable a new range of motion. Small forces at the base of the structure \u2014 heat, wind, even an electronic signal \u2014 could effect large transformations up above, he says, making the tower move \u201clike a large puppet.\u201d And to what end? By reconfiguring itself, he says, a next-gen cell tower might gain in flexibility, strength and perhaps even functionality. In addition, the tower can dance; the tower can perform. No longer an eyesore, Tibbits says, \u201cit has personality and an aesthetic of movement.\u201d \u29ebFrom a taller tower to a squat canopy, the tower can transform in various ways, physically stretching toward zones of higher usage or shying away from inclement weather.Skylar Tibbits is an assistant professor of design research at M.I.T.Jon Gertner is a Cullman fellow at the New York Public Library.Redesign by: PeriscopicText by: Thomas GoetzThe most useful information here is probably the \u201cWhat you can expect\u201d timeline, which shows how typical side effects usually go away over time, as the body gets used to a drug. This is common knowledge to pharmacists, but it\u2019s rarely communicated to patients. In the future, because the pharmacy most likely knows the age and sex of the patient, it could be possible to tailor the information to display the actual experience of people like them, as well as to identify any possible interactions between drugs that might arise based on their other prescriptions. The beauty of this label is that it doesn\u2019t pretend to be an exhaustive list. It\u2019s suited to a quick glance, which is all that most people would afford it anyway.

That company was acquired by Amazon in 2012 to supply its warehouses with turntable-like mobile robots that can carry more than 750 pounds. D\u2019Andrea\u2019s solution for baggage claim is not just to fix the carousel, he says, but also to redesign \u201cthe experience of having luggage at the airport.\u201d While his vision is not quite possible with current technology, he proposes replacing the whole system with a swarm of autonomous robots within the next five years.Similar to D\u2019Andrea\u2019s Amazon warehouse robots, the luggage bots are simple in the extreme, with a flat platform to scoop up the bag at check-in and keep it stable.It works like this: When you arrive, you head straight to an array of check-in stations, where a horseshoe-crab-like robot arrives for each bag. The robots carry them to an inspection area, where they are scanned, and if necessary, examined by T.S.A. agents. This would substantially simplify airport entry halls. \u201cComplexity is thus shifted from physical infrastructure to algorithms,\u201d D\u2019Andrea says. The swarm then brings the checked luggage to the tarmac, to be loaded into the plane by humans.Once you arrive at your destination, your smartphone tells you which pickup station your bag is being delivered to, as well as when it will show up. A vertical locker system, taking advantage of often-unused space in cavernous airports, dispenses luggage one at a time while the robots circle back for more. That means no waiting at the carousel, but you\u2019ll still have time to kill. There\u2019s always Cinnabon. \u29ebThe redesign stacks bags vertically, like at a city car park, while they wait to be picked up. Your phone or luggage tag will tell you when your bag is coming out of the tower. Use it to verify your identity, and you\u2019re off.Raffaello D\u2019Andrea is a professor at E.T.H. Zurich.Kyle Chayka is a writer living in Brooklyn.Redesign by: Mathieu LehanneurText by: Jamie Lauren KeilesIt seems odd, with this in mind, that the standard Western toilet has evolved so little beyond just water down a hole. The designer Mathieu Lehanneur says, \u201cIt\u2019s treated as a functional room, not a place for pleasure or thinking.\u201d Lehanneur endeavored, in his toilet redesign, to connect the fixture to its metaphysical function. His free-standing commode \u2014 less outhouse, more chapel \u2014 forges quiet space for us to come and meet ourselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a philosophical room,\u201d he says, \u201ca factory for ideas.\u201dBeneath an LED skylight and fan, Lehanneur calls us to claim our place in the scheme of things. A wall-mounted glass tank, reminiscent of a cloud, suggests the integration of body and environment, as rain in the ecosystem turns into water, then turns into urine, then turns back to rain. \u201cWe are still highly primitive,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven in this highly connected world.\u201dIf technology distracts in the space outside the bathroom, then Lehanneur\u2019s new toilet would channel it toward focus by cutting the glare with natural materials. A green onyx monolith with a digital display tells the results of on-the-spot urinalysis \u2014 less for the purpose of data-harvesting or diagnosis and more as a reminder that we, too, contain ecosystems. When the moment of reflection (and defecation) has passed, the user need not reach for an aerosol air freshener. A ceramic rock, offsetting the toilet, serves as a natural diffuser of scents.If it all seems extravagant, then it\u2019s only because Lehanneur\u2019s new toilet is suggesting a church where we\u2019ve long since made peace with praying in squalor. \u201cEven in the most beautiful residences, all over the world,\u201d he says, \u201cyou will never be able to get a photo of the toilet.\u201d \u29ebMathieu Lehanneur is a designer whose work aims to promote human well-being.Jamie Lauren Keiles is a freelance writer living in Los Angeles.Redesign by: Lucy JonesText by: Jaime LoweHere, Lucy Jones, who was named Parsons Womenswear Designer of the Year in 2015, reimagined the hospital gown with a comfort-based approach and an emphasis on modesty. \u201cIt is all about patient dignity,\u201d Jones says. \u201cYou\u2019re already having your environmental space interrupted, your body prodded. The hospital gown is a contributor to that treatment.\u201d You should feel warm and safe, she says, not exposed. Jones replaced the traditional open-backed, tie-fastened garment with snap-closure flaps at the chest, sides and back to provide access to areas examined most frequently by nurses and doctors. The flaps also prevent accidental exposure, which is an especially humiliating situation \u2014 so much so that many patients wear two gowns, one in the front and one to cover the back.Based on patient surveys and hospital needs, Jones reimagined the gown\u2019s back opening. She specifically targeted the areas of the body most frequently examined by doctors and nurses.Part of Jones\u2019s redesign is an attempt to make the gown feel more like a T-shirt. Her gown would incorporate Tencel, a sustainable, stretchy jersey material, made partly from recycled wood pulp. Because of its superior moisture management, the fabric has a built-in antibacterial element. \u201cThere were certain expectations for how the patients should be dressed,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHospitals don\u2019t feel like they should be spending more on gowns, but people don\u2019t understand the importance of dress on the personal psyche.\u201d \u29ebLucy Jones is a New York-based fashion designer from Wales.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Insure This Business? Start-Ups Face Challenges", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byIn the competitive start-up world, even the shrewdest entrepreneurs \u2014 with the latest and greatest gadgets \u2014 can find themselves thrown unexpectedly into legal quagmires that could derail or blow up a dream before it gets off the ground.Sometimes it\u2019s a simple oversight. Other times, a fresh-faced business owner tries to save a few dollars by ignoring such issues as liability, patents, copyright and taxes. But many of these business-killers are not only foreseeable, but preventable as well, experts say. And several who have paid heed have avoided potential business land mines. \u201cI didn\u2019t start training anyone until I had the insurance,\u201d said Mr. York, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University.But getting insurers on board wasn\u2019t easy. He contacted five companies before finding one that would sign him on. Mr. York had to demonstrate that he could strap down the equipment in the van to reduce the risk of road accidents and that his certification as a personal trainer reduced the chance that clients would be injured.Initially, he tried to save money by not insuring his equipment, thinking that it would be safe while locked in a van. Nevertheless, after one van was vandalized in 2014, he started insuring the equipment as well.Insurance to cover liabilities is often an afterthought for many start-ups, but it should often be at the top of the list. A manufacturing defect, an injury to an employee or customer, or even a hacker breach of a payment system or website could lead to a lawsuit and kill a budding start-up.\u201cSometimes a lot of start-ups don\u2019t want to hear about the coverages because they think it will cost them money,\u201d said Melnora Cruz, a vice president at MOC Insurance Services, based in San Francisco. But they cannot afford not to protect themselves, she said: \u201cThey could have a claim that costs $1 million and could put them in bankruptcy.\u201dOther legal issues can also trip up companies. Mr. York, for instance, got a trademark on his logo right away and bought both spellings of the domain name \u2014 GymGuyz and GymGuys \u2014 to protect himself from copycats.\u201cPeople laughed at me and told me I was crazy,\u201d Mr. York said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why would you do that?\u2019\u201dUndaunted by the skeptics, Mr. York pushed ahead. His company will have franchises in 100 markets in 18 states by year-end, up from one location eight years ago. Its revenue, which totaled $101,000 in 2008, is on track to reach $5.5 million this year from the company-owned business and franchise fees.When would-be underwriters heard the word trampoline, many conjured up visions of 1960s-style backyard trampolines, where reports were rampant of people tumbling off and being rushed to hospitals with broken bones.\u201cWe went to six to 10 insurers\u201d before finding one that would provide coverage, said Jeff Platt, chief executive of Sky Zone. It took considerable time to educate insurance brokers about the netting, safety guards, rules and monitoring staff before he could convince a company that the injury risk at his parks was low.\u201cThe only way to fall off of our trampolines would be to climb up a trampoline wall, then climb up about seven feet of netting and then literally jump over it,\u201d Mr. Platt said.Mr. Platt said he was constantly learning about new liabilities and addressing them. In 2012, he installed cameras inside and outside the parks after a break-in. In 2014, Sky Zone faced a security breach of one park\u2019s pay systems, where a small number of credit card numbers were stolen. Mr. Platt quickly brought in security experts to fix the breach and monitor the systems at all the parks.His vigilance has paid off. Sky Zone owns four parks and holds franchises in 175 locations in six countries. Its revenue, which stood at $800,000 in its first full year in 2005, rose to $54.1 million from company-owned parks and franchise fees in 2015. It is on track to reach $60.1 million this year.Mike Howell, 38, a Seattle resident with a degree from the London School of Economics, is a co-founder of Dolly, which began in 2014. He said insurers were initially reluctant to sign on, fearing that the risk of damage or injury would be high for a business that relied on someone with no moving expertise to transport furniture and other items from one location to another.But Mr. Howell said underwriters misunderstood the business. Dolly is aimed at consumers who want a fast, cheap and easy way to move a small number of items from one apartment or store to another. It is not competing with moving companies that deal with the entire contents of a house.Most moves involve fewer than five items and cost an average of $80. Dolly picks up a 15 percent to 25 percent commission on each move. Damage has been reported in fewer than 1 percent of the 100,000 moves Dolly has done, according to Mr. Howell.\u201cWe now have an investor who\u2019s a big-time insurance broker\u201d and advises the company on insurance matters, Mr. Howell said.Dolly has raised about $10 million in financing, with Jeffrey A. Wilke, chief executive of Amazon\u2019s worldwide consumer unit, among the investors.Patent, ownership and copyright issues could also sink a company if not addressed.Some cash-short entrepreneurs opt to skip the search for patents and trademarks to save money \u2014 and that\u2019s a mistake, warned Allan H. Cohen, managing partner at Nixon Peabody\u2019s Long Island law office.He recalled one client who built a health care app, adopted a name, and then spent tens of thousands of dollars developing a logo, website and marketing materials using that name. However, when a trademark search was later conducted, the company discovered that the name was already being used by a small firm in another state.The client, however, did not want to change the name, and is now gambling that the company will not be sued.But company owners who want to be a huge success should pay heed, Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThey could get a cease-and-desist order and have to stop using the name or be sued,\u201d he said.Taxes are also often overlooked out of concern over costs \u2014 but some tax provisions can actually be beneficial. Some programs, such as the angel investor tax credit available in some states, can make raising money easier. And the federal research and development tax credit can save money on a start-up\u2019s tax returns, said Mitchell Kopelman, a certified public accountant and a partner at HA&W, a business advisory firm in Atlanta.All of these crucial issues should be addressed early and re-examined as a company grows.\u201cEven today we learn about new liabilities with our business,\u201d said Mr. Platt of Sky Zone. \u201cRisk management doesn\u2019t end; it is an ongoing process that is living and breathing every single day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transgender on Tinder? Now You Can Identify Yourself That Way", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byTinder, the popular dating app, has updated its options to allow users to choose transgender or gender-nonconforming identities.The move, part of a push against persistent harassment against transgender people on the service, was hailed by community advocates as an important example for other social media platforms.Executives became aware of the harassment problem seven months ago, according to Sean Rad, the chief executive of Tinder. He said the abuse took two main forms: transgender users being verbally attacked by people they matched with, and transgender users being reported as abusive themselves by people \u201con the merits of who they were and not necessarily what they were saying or doing.\u201dThose abuse reports meant that transgender people were often blocked from the service by the site\u2019s algorithm. \u201cIf you\u2019re reported a certain number of times, you\u2019re in the penalty box,\u201d he said.The move to let transgender users identify themselves as such is meant to let them \u201cinteract with people who are more accepting of who they are,\u201d Mr. Rad said.The company has taken other steps, too, including training its staff in how to deal with reports of harassment of transgender people.The company previously allowed users to pick from one of two genders \u2014 either man or woman \u2014 but will now let them choose from almost 40 options, including Transgender Woman, Transgender Man, Transmasculine, Two-Spirit, Neutrois, Non-Binary and Other. If none of those fit, users can write in their own.The update, which was released on Tuesday, was designed in consultation with transgender community leaders and other prominent transgender people, including the activists Andrea James and Nick Adams and several entertainers connected to the award-winning Amazon show \u201cTransparent,\u201d like the actress Trace Lysette, the musician Our Lady J and Zackary Drucker, a producer on the show.\u201cGender categories are expanding,\u201d said Ms. Drucker, who called the update a reflection of changing social attitudes toward transgender people. \u201cWe are a part of the world, and we date.\u201dMs. Drucker and Ms. James said they hoped the update would make it easier and safer for transgender people to look for love. Transgender people face far higher rates of violence than the general population, in particular transgender women of color, and Ms. James said that in romantic situations \u201cthere\u2019s a stereotype that we are trying to deceive people.\u201d\u201cDating for trans people is generally safer via an app like Tinder,\u201d Ms. James said. \u201cI find it much safer to make connections online versus having a stranger approach me in a cafe or bar.\u201dMs. Drucker said \u201cdisclosing one\u2019s trans status is always stressful\u201d because of the fear of rejection or violence. That is why some people prefer to come out as transgender via text message rather than face-to-face, she said.\u201cCreating a safe space where a person can swipe right or left, seems like a hassle-free and safe method of allowing trans people to exist without being shamed for their difference,\u201d Ms. Drucker said.Mr. Rad said the \u201cleast visible but most impactful\u201d element of the update was one he hoped could also be used to crack down on other forms of harassment on the service, especially the sexual harassment of women. He described that goal as \u201cending locker room talk.\u201d\u201cWe completely rewrote and reworked out entire user moderation algorithm and tools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now more than ever able to detect harassment and prioritize the queue and inquiries about harassment and react very quickly to ban users who are being harassing.\u201dThe push against harassment on Tinder comes as other social media platforms have struggled to respond to abuse on their services. Twitter, in particular, has been increasingly criticized by users as a den of anti-Semitic, racist and misogynist abuse.Ms. Drucker called the monthslong project of responding to Tinder\u2019s problem of harassment against transgender people \u201can example of inclusion\u201d and said she hoped it would serve as a model for other technology companies.Tinder is the world\u2019s most popular dating app \u2014 it bills itself more chastely as an app \u201cfor meeting new people\u201d \u2014 and says that 26 million new matches are made each day, for a total of 20 billion matches since it launched in 2012. As such, Mr. Rad said he thought the company had a responsibility to shield its users from vitriol.\u201cPart of the problem is a lot of tech platforms try to stay out of complex issues because they don\u2019t want to alienate any of their users,\u201d Mr. Rad said. \u201cFor us it\u2019s very important to come in and particularly now given what\u2019s going on in the world, with all the division in the world, it\u2019s particularly important to step in and make a statement of inclusivity and acceptance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Earnings Show It Again Defying China\u2019s Slowdown", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Amid concerns about a slowdown in the growth of the Chinese economy, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company is showing that \u2014 for now \u2014 business on its platforms is holding steady.Alibaba Group said on Wednesday that its revenue grew strongly in the three months through the end of September, as the myriad brands and small-time vendors on its online shopping sites kept spending heavily on advertising. Although Chinese economic growth has slowed, more shoppers are also turning to Alibaba sites while abandoning physical retail outlets like malls.Alibaba said its sales rose 55 percent to $5.14 billion in its second quarter from the same period a year earlier. Net profit dropped 69 percent from a year ago, to $1.06 billion, because of a one-time accounting gain that had raised last year\u2019s bottom line.While the company has been mostly immune to China\u2019s slowing growth \u2014 gross domestic product expanded 6.7 percent in the past three quarters, down from 6.9 percent for all of 2015 \u2014 the value of goods sold on Alibaba\u2019s online platforms had begun to plateau. While it has a strong hold on the online market for China\u2019s middle-class shoppers, almost all of them already own a smartphone, so growth through new customers is harder to achieve.To compensate for slowing sales growth on its platforms, Alibaba \u2014 which makes money on advertising and fees paid by the vendors that set up virtual stores on its platforms \u2014 has been doing more to improve targeting of advertisements. It is also seeking to bring in new international brands that pay a fee to sell on its platforms.Given the slowdown, analysts have focused more on other businesses that Alibaba has been building up in recent years. But those businesses, like cloud computing and digital entertainment, all posted losses during the quarter. As Alibaba\u2019s profit margins shrink, investors will put more pressure on the company to extract profit from its newer business.During a conference call with analysts, Joseph Tsai, the company\u2019s executive vice chairman, said that its cloud computing and digital entertainment units were \u201ccoming into their own in terms of scale.\u201d Still, he warned that the company viewed its investments in new businesses as projects that may not yield profit for the next five to 10 years.Many have particularly focused on Alibaba\u2019s cloud services which, much like Amazon Web Services, provide easy-to-use, back-end computing power for a wide range of companies.Revenue from the cloud service more than doubled from a year earlier, to $224 million in the most recent quarter, but posted a $60 million operating loss. Alibaba said it had added 74,000 subscribers to the service over the quarter, raising its total paying users to 651,000. Analysts have predicted that the business could begin producing profit for Alibaba in the coming few years.\u201cAlibaba has gone beyond the position of an e-commerce play,\u201d said Jessie Guo, an analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank, citing its cloud computing and logistics arms as well as its electronic payments affiliate, Ant Financial. \u201cWe see it as an ecosystem. That means its model is going to be more sophisticated.\u201dA new spate of public listings by Chinese logistics firms could help Alibaba, Shi Jialong, a technology analyst at Nomura, wrote in a recent note to clients. These firms, which deliver goods ordered online to customers, have risen on the back of Alibaba\u2019s success, and they could use proceeds from those share sales to expand their networks and enhance delivery capabilities, \u201cwhich eventually would help improve the quality of services for Alibaba\u2019s customers,\u201d Mr. Shi wrote.Alibaba\u2019s logistics unit is part of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company\u2019s accounting. In part because of that investigation, short-seller interest in the company has risen near peak levels in recent days, according to data from Bloomberg. Alibaba has said it is cooperating with the inquiry and has begun to disclose more information about those operations to investors.For many, earnings are simply a prelude to Singles Day, an intense shopping holiday on Nov. 11 engineered in part by Alibaba, in which the company\u2019s vendors offer major discounts. Growth in sales on the day of the event has slowed, and Alibaba is pulling out all the stops this year, featuring a slew of entertainment features including a concert by the American pop star Katy Perry.Advertisement"}

The spiffy, fiddle-happy arrangements are pure pleasure. The revelation, though, is Carmen Cusack, the show\u2019s once unknown star, whose big numbers (\u201cIf You Knew My Story,\u201d \u201cI Had a Vision,\u201d \u201cAt Long Last\u201d) announced her as a smashing discovery and a sure bet for other rich Broadway roles in the future.SCOTT HELLERSCOTT HELLERResuscitating interest in Off Broadway shows is the point of Encores! Off Center, and this joyous album \u2014 which features Jonathan Groff and 15 more minutes of material than on an earlier recording \u2014 is a two-disc reminder that William Finn\u2019s 1998 autobiographical musical deserves more life. Mr. Groff is winningly neurotic as a cranky composer facing mortality when hit by a brain malfunction. (Sample song title: \u201cCraniotomy.\u201d) Sweeping ballads like \u201cI\u201dd Rather Be Sailing\u201d and \u201cHeart and Music\u201d have become the show\u2019s standards, but the comic ensemble numbers (including \u201cAnd They\u2019re Off\u201d and \u201cGordo\u2019s Law of Genetics\u201d) really make this production sing.SCOTT HELLERAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Save Money (and Hassles) on Your Black Friday Shopping", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byIf the idea of Black Friday shopping gives you the blues, cheer up.A few innovative approaches can help you find lower prices without having to camp outside a big box store.Instead of buying a gift card before shopping, add up your purchases in the store and use an app from the site to download the amount you need. This will help curb overspending, she said.The sweet spot for the best bargains is Dec. 10-18, but, she warned, shopping from Dec. 19 onward is not good because retailers know you are desperate, and they are less likely to cut prices.She added that 95 percent of the Black Friday bargains to be found in brick-and-mortar stores \u2014 with the exception of \u201cdoorbusters,\u201d those deeply discounted items intended to draw shoppers in \u2014 can be found online. If you are not keen on crowds, shop online.\u201cBy doing so, in many cases, it will trigger an automated coupon sent to your inbox pleading for you to come back and complete your purchase with the coupon,\u201d Mr. James said in an email.The coupon offers may be for free shipping or discounts of up to 20 percent off a purchase, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a passive-aggressive way to get a deal.\u201dSometimes getting a price break can be as simple as asking.Activate the live chat feature that many online retailers have and politely ask for a coupon for free shipping or a percentage off your purchase.\u201cThese live chat operators are trained to see this person has stuff in their cart and they\u2019re prepared to make a purchase \u2014 let\u2019s throw them a bone,\u201d Mr. James said in a telephone interview.Doorbuster merchandise is usually in such limited supply that only the most dedicated shoppers \u2014 those who camp outside the store to be the first ones in at opening hour \u2014 will get what they want. The remaining shoppers become a \u201ccaptive audience, and now they\u2019ll go out and buy a bunch of stuff at near full price or full price,\u201d Mr. James said.Many of those people will turn around and sell the heavily discounted items on eBay, he said. Because they are looking to turn a profit quickly, their markups will be modest.Downloading the Amazon app can be a useful way to compare prices in stores against the online retail giant. \u201cIt\u2019s a good tool to make sure you\u2019re not making a stupid purchase,\u201d Ms. Demer said.Many big box stores will match a lower Amazon price if you present proof of the lower price at the customer service desk. That rule is in place year-round, but many stores make an exception for Black Friday. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Bed Bath & Beyond are among the few retailers who will still honor the price match on Black Friday, she said.Skip the shopping cart, because navigating crowded store aisles with one will only prolong your visit, Ms. Demer said. She recommended taking an oversize reusable shopping bag instead.It\u2019s also best to avoid bringing your spouse and children to the store, she said.\u201cThe more people you bring, the more money you\u2019re going to spend and the more angry you\u2019re going to become,\u201d she said. \u201cChaos and impulse buying, it\u2019s all much worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking Back on the Making of \u2018The Godfather\u2019 With Francis Ford Coppola", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported by\u201cOh, gosh, am I bleeding?\u201d Francis Ford Coppola bleated out while ambling around his Napa Valley home, talking on the phone to a reporter.The book shows how he brought Mario Puzo\u2019s 1969 novel to life in a film that would go on to win the Academy Award for best picture in 1973, excising whole portions of the story and highlighting what he believed was a flawed novel\u2019s essence: a narrative of capitalism in America, as seen through the spilled blood and guts of one family.But for a moment, the topic was blood \u2014 his own.\u201cBroke a glass,\u201d he said, explaining that he had been watching a sports event, went to grab the remote control, and then knocked over the glass.The cut wasn\u2019t so bad. He felt fine, he said, save for the fact that he was bleeding, and knew there might be consequences if the blood ended up on anything valuable.\u201cMy wife will kill me,\u201d Mr. Coppola said. \u201cHold on.\u201dSo he put the phone down, went off to dress his wound and then returned for an hour\u2019s worth of questions about the movie he would sort of like to forget, the career he\u2019s mostly left behind and the non-film empire he\u2019s subsequently built.First, he made it clear that the book was a fairly low-profit venture that he did largely because people around him told him it was time. Then, he carped about his publisher.\u201cThe amount of work that company made me do,\u201d said Mr. Coppola, who has an unusual ability to turn complaining into a joyous experience. \u201cI could get that from a speaking engagement. And it\u2019s constant. I have to do this. I have to do that. I have to write the foreword.\u201dAs well as do this interview. Oh, well. What else was there to do but make the best of it? (The interview has been edited and condensed.)When was the last time you watched \u201cThe Godfather\u201d?Oh, I don\u2019t know, years ago. For me, the memory of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d brings great unhappiness. That movie took 60 days, and it was miserable, not to mention the months after of jockeying over the cut. So my reaction is usually of panic and nausea, but that has nothing to do with how it is for the audience.Something I liked about reading your book was finding out how methodical you were. There\u2019s a presumption that all great art is the result of a boundless imagination. This book shows that it\u2019s a slog.It was insecurity. I was so young. I was hired because I was young. A lot of important directors turned it down. Elia Kazan turned it down. Costa-Gavras turned it down, a whole bunch of important directors. So the philosophy was, let\u2019s get someone young, who could presumably be pushed around. Also, I was Italian-American, and that was good, because it meant if the studio got flak they could simply say, \u201cBut it was an Italian-American director.\u201d And I was someone they could get for a good cheap price. How much were you paid?They offered me two fees: either $75,000 and 10 percent of the profits, or $125,000 and 6 percent of the profits. I had two kids and a third one on the way, so I took 125 and 6 percent. I think I asked for 7 percent and didn\u2019t get it. When the movie was done, did you immediately know what a hit it was?I didn\u2019t. Bob Evans, the producer, kept it really close to the vest. He hadn\u2019t shown it to anyone. And I had been so browbeaten, heard I was going to be fired, that they were going to send in an action director. I was shellshocked. There was some happiness on set. Diane Keaton has written that she fell in love with Al Pacino making the film. In the auditions, she indicated he was her favorite, but Paramount didn\u2019t want him. I set up an improv where I took a room at the St. Regis Hotel and I had them order room service. Then I left them alone and I went home, and I\u2019m sure that was the incubation. But it\u2019s tricky. It can backfire. If they break up right during the film. That\u2019s happened to me, too. Do tell. Oh, I shouldn\u2019t say. Another movie. I imagine \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d was easier.Part II was a joy. I had total control. Throughout all this, did you read your reviews?I learned not to, but I did then. I remember when I did \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d Frank Rich said there had not been so big a disaster in years. \u201cSuperman\u201d had just come out. I thought, \u201cThat was about a guy in a suit flying around, and he\u2019s saying \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 is the biggest and worst thing!\u201d What was the most widespread criticism about \u201cThe Godfather?\u201dOf the first? That it was violent and romanticized those guys. Do you think it did?In effect, yes. Because the acting ultimately made those people sympathetic, even though their behavior was so terrible. Real Mafia people are animals. With the third film, the critics really sunk their teeth in.The third part was not something I wanted to do. I was coming out of a bankruptcy. Today you\u2019re the founder of a very successful wine business. You don\u2019t direct movies as regularly. People ask me \u201cWhat do you like better?\u201d I say, \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison.\u201d They\u2019re both very pleasurable, but the cinema remains the most magical thing. Which is why it\u2019s so heartbreaking to see what\u2019s happening to it. If it weren\u2019t for this sliver of independent cinema, there would be nothing left. Doing a movie of more than $3 million on an interesting topic today is nearly impossible. I sometimes say: I didn\u2019t leave the cinema, the cinema went off in its own direction. Meaning?The great Hollywood studios who produced such great films along with great entertainment have now been bought up by telecom companies. So I guess you were not pleased to learn that AT&T was purchasing Time Warner. I do not think it will pass the regulations. Are there movies you liked recently? Many, actually. I loved \u201cSwiss Army Man.\u201d Totally imaginative. I liked \u201cMommy\u201d by Xavier Dolan. \u201cTangerine\u201d was beautiful. So full of life and humor. There is TV now. Many would argue the advent of Netflix, HBO and Amazon in relation sort of make up for the decline of the movie studio. Yes. Cinema and television are becoming the same thing. You can\u2019t say I do this for television or movies. They both can be shown in theaters or at home. It can be one minute or a hundred hours, and you can have a screen that\u2019s big and beautiful like the LG OLED screens, which are a miracle. I noticed recently that you endorsed those. Do you have a deal with them?I kept buying them, so they said: \u201cWould you make a statement about how much you like them? We\u2019ll give you some televisions.\u201d And I said \u201cGreat, because I already ordered them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Energy Giants Turn to Drones and Sensors in New Embrace of the Digital World", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byThe London-based start-up flies unmanned aircraft around offshore platforms, oil rigs and other sites, collecting high-resolution videos and images that can spot potential infrastructure problems and, according to Mr. Blackford, cost roughly 80 percent less than traditional inspections.But for many in the energy industry, the technology was still new and untested. That started to change after Talisman Energy, the Canadian oil and gas explorer, gave the fledgling company a chance on one of its offshore sites in 2012, leading to significant time and cost savings. Other energy companies\u2019 reluctance then quickly turned into interest and, eventually, a growing demand.\u201cIf you name a global oil company, we\u2019ve probably worked for them,\u201d said Mr. Blackford, whose clients include Chevron and BP. Since 2014, the start-up has branched out from mere drone inspections, offering clients access to sophisticated data analytics and algorithms that examine gigabytes of sensor information, for onshore and offshore sites, to flag potential problems that cannot be detected by the human eye.\u201cIn the last six to 12 months, we\u2019ve seen a spike in people\u2019s interest in the data that we can bring to the table,\u201d he said, adding that his team can, for instance, analyze the amount of corrosion to be expected on an oil rig over the coming year. \u201cWe can take the data, measure it and look for trends.\u201dThese tech innovations are part of a renewed push to bring the digital world into the oil and natural gas industry.And more advanced efforts \u2014 like rig-inspecting drones and even autonomous vehicles \u2014 are also being tested as the sector tries to catch up with other areas of the economy that have more readily embraced technological advances. The reams of digital data collected from offshore platforms, refineries and oil rigs, among other sites both onshore and offshore, may better detect energy deposits, find more-efficient ways to produce refined oil products like gasoline and even predict where future breakdowns, which can force costly and unexpected shutdowns, are likely to happen.For many in the energy industry, such predictions may sound all too familiar.Over the last two decades, companies have put hundreds of millions of dollars into new digital technologies, often with limited results. Around 2008, when oil hit a record $147 a barrel, analysts said many oil majors spent big on data centers and advanced software programs, only to see such projects be outpaced by those from IBM, Amazon and Microsoft, which could offer similar computing power at a fraction of the cost.\u201cIn the 2000s, resistance to technology was everywhere,\u201d said Nate Clark, an energy partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, in Houston. \u201cPeople tried to do too much, too fast.\u201dDespite some continuing resistance, the industry's technological credibility has been burnished by the recent shale revolution, which is driven by tech advances in drilling techniques, data crunching and other improvements aimed at making the sector more nimble as global oil and natural gas prices fluctuate. Roughly two-thirds of energy companies, according to a recent study by Ernst & Young, the consulting firm, have spent at least $100 million on data analytics over the last two years, a rise over previous years.\u201cThe amount of data is like a tsunami coming at us,\u201d said Keith Grey, who runs BP\u2019s supercomputer center. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining advantages that will be hard for others to try and match.\u201dFinding new ways of using that data also has become a priority.\u201cIt\u2019s easier than ever to leverage this type of data,\u201d said Richard Holsman, global head of the energy, digital and technology practice at the consultancy Accenture, which has worked with Woodside Energy. \u201cWhat they learned is that they can avoid failures by taking a different approach to the data they already have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But his video-game mother is surely Tomb Raider\u2019s Lara Croft, another globe-trotting, puzzle-solving treasure hunter with guns. A new creative team has taken over the fourth game in this highly cinematic series, and has kept the exhilarating action set pieces while adding quieter moments about aging, family and marriage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richard Rorty\u2019s 1998 Book Suggested Election 2016 Was Coming", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIt\u2019s worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs:[M]embers of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers \u2014 themselves desperately afraid of being downsized \u2014 are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else.At that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for \u2014 someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots. \u2026One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. \u2026 All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.Donald J. Trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman. But the essence of Mr. Rorty\u2019s argument holds up surprisingly well. Where others saw positive trends \u2014 say, a full-throated dawn chorus praising the nation\u2019s diversity \u2014 Mr. Rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine.His basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country, for all its flaws, was both perfectible and worth perfecting. Hope was part of its core philosophy. But during the 1960s, shame \u2014 over Vietnam, over the serial humiliation of African-Americans \u2014 transformed a good portion of the left, at least the academic left, into a disaffected gang of spectators, rather than agitators for change. A formalized despair became its philosophy. The system was beyond reform. The best one could do was focus on its victims.The result was disastrous. The alliance between the unions and intellectuals, so vital to passing legislation in the Progressive Era, broke down. In universities, cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice. By 1997, when Mr. Rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d few of his academic colleagues, he insisted, were talking about reducing poverty at all.\u201cNobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies, homeless studies, or trailer-park studies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause the unemployed, the homeless, and the residents of trailer parks are not \u2018other\u2019 in the relevant sense.\u201dDoes this overlooked category sound familiar?Mr. Rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities. But it just so happened that at the very moment \u201csocially accepted sadism\u201d \u2014 good phrase, that \u2014 was diminishing, economic instability and inequality were increasing, thanks to globalization.\u201cThis world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great American capitalists of the year 1900.\u201dAgain: Ring any bells?This group included intellectuals, by the way, who, he wrote, are \u201courselves quite well insulated, at least in the short run, from the effects of globalization.\u201dWhich left the white working-class guy and gal up for grabs \u2014 open to right-wing populists, maybe even strongmen. In Mr. Rorty\u2019s view, no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white working-class anxiety. This was a problem. \u201cOutside the academy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cAmericans still want to feel patriotic. They still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place.\u201dSounds an awful lot like Make America Great Again.At the time, Mr. Rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape. But it wasn\u2019t that different, ultimately. Today\u2019s just has more mature trees.In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d he wrote about the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement; today, he\u2019d probably have cautioned against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d Mr. Rorty railed against the \u201cscurrilous demagogue\u201d Pat Buchanan, who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the Mexican border; today Mr. Rorty would have railed against Mr. Trump and his proposed wall.\u201cWhy could not the left,\u201d he asked, \u201cchannel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed?\u201dIs his analysis a bit oversimple? Yes. Even within universities, there have always been optimistic champions of America, those who ever-passionately believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work ever-diligently on formulating concrete, actionable policies that would make the country more just.By focusing only on his own environment, academia, Mr. Rorty\u2019s arguments also seem strangely parochial. During the 1960s, the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty, but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it: Robert F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia; Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society.But it wasn\u2019t enough, obviously. \u201cUnder Presidents Carter and Clinton,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote, \u201cthe Democratic Party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution.\u201d Mr. Clinton was particularly guilty of this charge, passing Nafta, appointing Robert Rubin as his Treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation. Mr. Obama pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And he was one of those fancy elites.Which brings us to Hillary Clinton. She may have had a plan to relieve the misery of the working class, but she didn\u2019t speak about it much. (Bernie Sanders did. And lost.) She was in favor of the Partnership until she was against it. In a paid speech to a Brazilian bank, she spoke of a \u201chemispheric common market\u201d for energy. And though her slogan was \u201cStronger Together,\u201d her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating difference, in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her.Here, Mr. Rorty\u2019s most inflammatory words are most relevant, and also most uncomfortable: \u201cThe cultural Left has a vision of an America in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized groups.\u201d Mrs. Clinton tried this strategy. It didn\u2019t win her the Electoral College. \u201cThis Left wants to preserve otherness rather than ignore it,\u201d he also wrote. That didn\u2019t work either.People are furiously arguing about what played a key role in this election \u2014 whether it was white working-class despair, a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change. It seems reasonable to think that all three played a part.What\u2019s so striking about \u201cAchieving Our Country\u201d is that it blends these theories into a common argument: The left, both cultural and political, eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity politics, leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored.\u201cIt is as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote. \u201cAs if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money, or vice versa.\u201dYou may quarrel with his argument; you may say that he was projecting onto the larger world what was happening within his own cloistered, ivied walls. But Mr. Trump is now our president-elect.Achieving Our CountryLeftist Thought in Twentieth-Century AmericaBy Richard Rorty159 pages. Harvard University Press. $23.50.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Can Latin America Move to Low-Carbon Energy?", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 Climate negotiators convened in Morocco, this month to discuss how to turn the Paris climate accord into action. The accord, signed by almost 200 countries last year, came into force on Nov. 4. Many questions persist about how each country can move toward the zero carbon-energy target that experts say is necessary to avoid destructive climate change. Some parts of the world are better positioned than others to take this test. Latin America is a good example.To reduce per capita emissions consistent with this goal, by 2050 Latin America would not only have to stop deforestation and reduce emissions from agriculture and other non-energy sources, it would also have to cut consumers\u2019 energy use by 40 percent through huge improvements in efficiency. The region would also need to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d 90 percent of its power sector and electrify its entire transportation sector, according to a study by the Inter-American Development Bank. Decarbonization would require replacing high-carbon energy sources like oil and gas with zero carbon sources, like solar or wind energy.As middle-income economies, the region\u2019s countries have among the highest growth rates of car ownership in the world. In lower-income countries, like many in Africa and South Asia, only a small portion of the population owns cars, while in high-income countries like the United States car ownership has already peaked.However, hydropower has become less reliable because of increasingly frequent droughts and social opposition to new projects. As a result, several countries are expanding natural-gas-fired power to provide a reliable source of baseload power. While this helps meet short-term emissions targets because natural gas is cleaner than coal or oil for power generation, these investments will encourage the use of fossil fuels for decades, making it more difficult to reach long-term goals.Cutting energy emissions is increasingly important for reducing Latin America\u2019s total carbon footprint. Historically, two-thirds of the region\u2019s emissions have come from land-use changes and one-third have been energy-related \u2014 the reverse of the world average. But more recently, deforestation has fallen, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, and energy has emerged as one of the primary drivers of emissions growth in the region.To meet the ambitious Paris agreement Latin American countries would have to build infrastructure that supports low-carbon energy systems. At the same time, they will need to increase hydropower generation to ensure more sources of baseload power and expand electrical grid integration, both domestically and regionally, to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy.Enormous investments must also be made in electric vehicles and public transportation. Consumers should be encouraged to adopt these cleaner options through incentives like tax breaks, congestion charges and preferential parking and driving lanes. Capacity for electricity generation will also need to expand substantially to accommodate increased electricity demand for transportation. The low cost of renewables in Latin America could help accelerate its transition to sustainable energy.Many of the commitments that Latin American countries made under the Paris agreement include conditional pledges dependent on international finance and technology transfer. This month\u2019s climate talks are expected to clarify access to such assistance.The climate goals for the next decades will require major transformations in the way people consume energy as well as technological breakthroughs to find new energy uses and sources. In Latin America, countries will have to define their own paths, but they all need to start planning their long-term climate change strategies today.Lisa Viscidi is the director of the Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program at the Inter-American Dialogue, where Rebecca O\u2019Connor is a program assistant.Advertisement"}

But on Thursday, the American search giant tried to portray itself as a stalwart of online competition as it responded to European antitrust charges that it had restricted consumers\u2019 choices and hamstrung its competitors.Google responded on Thursday to two European antitrust charges, saying that its services helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find the digital information they seek online. The company said that the strength in Europe of other American technology companies, like Amazon, showed that Google had not restricted the local digital market.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cWe\u2019re confident these cases will ultimately be decided based on the facts,\u201d he wrote, adding that Google\u2019s products \u201cbenefited consumers and merchants, and expanded competition.\u201dGoogle worries that Europe\u2019s antitrust efforts may eventually hurt its lucrative business model, particularly if it is forced to open up some of its dominant digital services to rivals.For the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, the standoff with Google has become a litmus test for its ability to rein in a dominant technology company, one that has a roughly 90 percent market share in online search in the region. A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment on Google\u2019s antitrust response.The end to the back and forth will not come overnight.

The company can then appeal, prolonging the legal wrangling.But for Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, an online marketplace for Android smartphone apps, who has filed a complaint against Google, the antitrust cases are necessary to give European companies the space to compete against their much larger American rival.\u201cOur growth is being slowed down because of Google\u2019s dominant position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s at stake.

{"Headline": "A Reporter Retraces His Steps Through Trump Country", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byAbroad in AmericaFrom the start, the central enigma was Donald J. Trump. How did this loose-lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far? Who were the Americans supporting him and why?When I started my unusual assignment of covering the American presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent \u2014 for this, an American news organization \u2014 one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers. The bulk of them revolved around Mr. Trump, whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the party\u2019s nomination \u2014 and ultimately to the presidency.Going back through my monthslong journey across America, there were many clues to Mr. Trump\u2019s rising tide, although not all were easy to read. I drank with Trump supporters in bars and casinos. I approached them at rodeos. I chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies.The broad topography of Trump country is, in many respects, easy to trace. It is a place of anger and frustration, gripped by a feverish anti-establishment sentiment. People wanted change \u2014 and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life.Yet other factors were at play, too, in this unruly insurgency, factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly: racism, xenophobia, bigotry, talk radio, social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country. It wasn\u2019t always clear which elements were powering the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d as the movement called itself, and which were being buoyed along.In Williamson, I also saw how Mr. Trump\u2019s message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on Sunday, many Christians glossed over the candidate\u2019s three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. (\u201cIt\u2019s scary, like Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Trump told Howard Stern in 1997.)It was hard to square, but perhaps that was the lesson: that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election, one in which outrageous rule-breaking might offer a route to success.Around that time, Apple released its seventh iteration of the iPhone, that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every iPhone are the words \u201cDesigned in California. Assembled in China.\u201d As if California is a separate country. And that\u2019s how many in Trump country saw it \u2014 that instead of being part of the iPhone economy, they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas.One thing that I, like many Europeans and other foreigners, had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate self-belief. Mr. Trump, though, traded on pessimism. His slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the country\u2019s military and business, but also scapegoated immigrants, minorities and Muslims.At Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about \u201cthe blacks.\u201d Broad-brush prejudice toward Muslims was openly expressed: Danny Popma, a factory owner in Michigan, told me that children in Dearborn, which has the country\u2019s largest percentage of Muslims, had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks.The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or loutish, there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding twist, a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat categorization: a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami; a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas; a Guyanese doorman in Queens, N.Y.What was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating. Maybe these were just the hard-core loyalists. State-by-state polls suggested that Mr. Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political professionals, including Republicans, dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters.\u201cIt\u2019s like the hunt for the lost tribes of the Amazon,\u201d was how Stuart Stevens, a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, put it early on. \u201cIf you paddle your canoe far enough up the river, and bang your drum hard enough, they will come to the riverbank. But they\u2019re just not there.\u201dBut when I mentioned the polls showing Mr. Trump lagging to his supporters, they snorted derisively.Everyone they knew was voting Trump \u2014 colleagues, relatives, children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who hadn\u2019t voted for decades. The polls, they said, were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media \u2014 the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow.At the time, I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the Facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad terms, the Trump supporters were right \u2014 in key states, their votes were undercounted by pollsters.The winning margin in many states, like Michigan, was tight, and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. Daryl, the Uber driver who took me from a Trump rally to the airport, was a case in point: he was an African-American, a registered Democrat, and he did not intend to vote.\u201cNone of them look any good to me,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump, then, benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international readers: Why did so many Americans seem to hate her so much?The answer had many dimensions: Fatigue from her decades in public life, unfinished business from her husband\u2019s time in power in the 1990s, distaste for how she had handled his sexual escapades, outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street bankers, unfiltered sexism.And Mrs. Clinton simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it.In San Francisco, while I was visiting my brother, one of his friends offered an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting socks for Christmas \u2014 again \u201d he said. \u201cSocks, socks, bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like that.\u201dMr. Trump, in the end, found the \u201clost tribe\u201d of white voters. They heard his drumbeat, and voted as a bloc like never before.Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning victory echoes jolting changes in Britain, France and other countries where a new brand of right-wing politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of forces, or represented a more fundamental shift, may now be answered under the Trump presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $28,000 Mystery: Will the Real Toner Supplier Please Stand Up?", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byThe HagglerEmails to Taco Bell with this perfectly reasonable question were not returned.Some consumer mysteries have solutions. Some of them do not. In this episode, an example of the latter:Q. I work at a nonprofit in Manhattan. Toward the end of May, I received a bill from a company called IDC Servco for $7,000 worth of printer toner. Less than a month later I received another bill for $9,000 worth of the same product. Historically we have paid $1,000 to $2,000 a year for toner, though to a different company. As I later learned, we had never hired IDC Servco.When I got the second bill, I called the company. A representative was very apologetic but basically made it seem that we had, in fact, ordered $16,000 in toner. This guy agreed to lower the price of the second shipment to $5,000. At the time I assumed we had a deal with this operation. So I wrote a check and thought that was that.But the weirdness was just starting. Soon after, I got a call from a man at a company I\u2019d never heard of. He said he worked with IDC Servco and would cut the cost of the second shipment to $3,419 if I paid his company via credit card and canceled the check for $5,000 to IDC Servco. I gave him our company\u2019s credit card number, I canceled the $5,000 check to IDC Servco, and thought, once again, this is over.Of course, the guy from IDC Servco called and he asked why the $5,000 check had been canceled. I really thought we were caught in the middle of a fight between two companies. A few weeks later, a man named Jim Snodgrass from IDC Servco called me and said the people from the other company were crooks and that I needed to report fraudulent activity on my card.(Haggler interruption: This tale goes on and on, right through September.)It turns out that we had been sending money to IDC Servco as far back as 2014. In all, we spent $28,694 and wound up with 48 cartridges. If you do the math, we paid about 10 times the price charged by Amazon.We used 18 cartridges. I\u2019d happily send back the remaining 30 for a refund. Can you try to arrange that deal?Susie Polsky, New YorkThe toner swindle has been around for years, and IDC Servco sounds like a classic example. Inflated prices were just part of it. Prosecutors said IDC Servco would pose as the regular toner suppliers of its victims, which turned out to be a very effective sales strategy. From the time it began operating in 1988, IDC Servco netted about $126 million from 50,000 companies, the authorities said, mostly small businesses and charities.So why is IDC Servco still, apparently, in the toner business? What connection does this company have with the one that prompted the arrests?The Haggler called Jim Snodgrass \u2014 Ms. Polsky had his number \u2014 and he sounded like a perfectly reasonable guy. He offered to answer questions via email.Unfortunately, neither the Haggler nor Ms. Polsky could fully make sense of Mr. Snodgrass\u2019s account of this $28,694 misadventure. The clear part was that Mr. Snodgrass thought IDC Servco had done all that it could to help Ms. Polsky\u2019s nonprofit organization. He also said that IDC Servco had begun winding down operations and ceased taking new orders in June.In a follow-up, the Haggler asked about the June arrests. Though Mr. Snodgrass\u2019s name was not on the list of those arrested, an obvious question presented itself: Why did IDC Servco appear to be in business as recently as September?\u201cI have referred this to upper management, who will refer it to the company\u2019s attorneys,\u201d he replied the next day. \u201cThat is the extent of the response that I can give you.\u201dNo lawyer from the company has contacted the Haggler. When the Haggler suggested the swap requested by Ms. Polsky, Mr. Snodgrass did not reply.The Haggler was still left wondering about the peculiar resilience of IDC Servco. So he contacted Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. In an email, Mr. Mrozek wrote that the operator of IDC Servco, Gil Michaels, was told to shut down the company as a condition of his release on bond this summer.\u201cWe recently spoke with his attorneys, who informed us that the company was no longer doing business,\u201d Mr. Mrozek continued. \u201cWe will look into this matter in an attempt to determine if the same company, perhaps operating under different operators, is still in business.\u201dSo it\u2019s a mystery to the authorities, too. If any answers emerge, rest assured, they will be shared right here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stalking Black Friday Bargains", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byRIVERDALE, N.J. \u2014 With a baby strapped to her front, a knapsack on her back and a Donald Duck coffee mug in one hand, Christi Mulder arrived at the Target here, about 30 miles northwest of Manhattan, early Friday morning. She and her sister, Erica Renaud, who brought her 7-week-old son, were on the hunt for holiday gifts for the 11 children they have between them.The New York Times followed Ms. Mulder, 36, and her sister for a closer look at how Black Friday, as the day after Thanksgiving is often called, plays out for families on the ground. The retail business, upended by online shopping, is still struggling to figure out just to lure shoppers off their couches and into stores. But even as people grow increasingly used to shopping a seemingly endless stream of bargains online, millions of Americans still rely on Black Friday discounts in stores, braving the cold and the crowds to find them.Each sister works part time \u2014 Ms. Renaud is a blogger and Ms. Mulder is a lacrosse coach \u2014 and was on a budget. Ms. Renaud, 30, wanted to spend no more than $200 on gifts for her children, plus maybe a little extra for stocking stuffers. Normally, she spends closer to $300. But this year, alarmed by growing discussions about credit card debt, student debt and national debt, Ms. Renaud \u2014 who does not use credit cards \u2014 decided she would try to cut back.Other factors contributed to that decision. Ms. Renaud and her sister grew up in an observant Christian family, and both say that religion plays a big role in their lives. Their husbands work at local churches \u2014 Ms. Renaud\u2019s is a prayer leader, Ms. Mulder\u2019s is a pastor \u2014 and Ms. Renaud wanted to focus less on gifts and more on the holiday itself. Instead of tablets or video games, her children will receive homemade \u201ctickets\u201d to family activities, like movies or other outings.The budget outlined by Ms. Mulder was larger, about $600 for her six children. But she, too, was hunting for deals.Neither woman was looking for gifts for herself, although Ms. Mulder\u2019s husband was keen to get a television. Electronics prices had fallen so much so quickly, Ms. Mulder said. The TV they bought for $800 two years ago was already selling for $200.\u201cIt used to be like, \u2018Oh, my whole bonus check is going to my TV,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mulder said.Ultimately, they decided to spend their money on the children.\u201cWhen you have a family with a lot of kids, or anybody with a budget, you\u2019re constantly balancing needs and wants,\u201d she said.To get the best deals they could, both women regularly pulled out their smartphones to look up the prices of what they were finding in the store. Ms. Renaud had even come prepared with a virtual cart full of products on Amazon.\u201cIn the back of my mind, I\u2019m comparing to what\u2019s in my cart,\u201d she said. Doing that ahead of time, she said, made it easier to stick to a budget. \u201cOn Amazon, I\u2019m watching my total change.\u201dAnd sure, things were often cheaper online. Ms. Mulder even has a subscription to Amazon Prime, the site\u2019s service that comes with free two-day shipping. But there were advantages to coming to the store, not all of them having to do with shopping. The outing was a chance for the sisters to spend a couple of hours catching up, away from their other children and family. Ms. Mulder lives in nearby North Haledon, N.J., while Ms. Renaud lives in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., more than 150 miles away.Coming to the store also allowed them to examine products that could be deceiving online.\u201cYou can\u2019t look at all of the Legos altogether at once,\u201d Ms. Mulder said, eyeing an aisle full of Star Wars-branded Lego sets. \u201cThis little Lego box could look way better online, and then you get it and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s tiny, it\u2019s supposed to be a big gift.\u2019\u201dAt Target, Ms. Mulder found a set of hardcover Harry Potter books. The set was $5 cheaper on Amazon. She thought about it, and put the books back. \u201cThat five or 10 dollars adds up,\u201d she said.But the sisters did not just compare Target\u2019s products to what was available online. When they arrived in the doll aisle, Ms. Mulder took an American Girl catalog from her knapsack. American Girl dolls can retail for more than $100, and Ms. Mulder wanted to compare the items her daughter wanted \u2014 an American Girl brand brush, wheelchair and bathrobe \u2014 with Target\u2019s Our Generation collection, where dolls cost $22.\u201cThe wheelchair for American Girl dolls is like 80 bucks,\u201d Ms. Mulder said. \u201cI can kind of look and see if I can find something similar.\u201d Alas, they did not find a wheelchair at Target.Even though they had come with a mental list of Amazon\u2019s prices, both sisters said they normally would have done even more homework before hitting the stores on Black Friday. But like many people, they were distracted this year by the election, reading news articles instead of scouring retailers\u2019 circulars.\u201cI don\u2019t remember an election trickling all the way into Thanksgiving,\u201d Ms. Renaud said as she eyed a pair of shoes.\u201cI definitely feel more behind than I would usually be,\u201d her sister said. \u201cUsually, by now, I\u2019ll have like a good list for each kid. I\u2019ll have all the fliers for Black Friday. I didn\u2019t have any of that this year.\u201dBy about 11 a.m., the sisters were almost finished. One of the babies was getting fidgety, and the sisters had seen most of the store. Much to their surprise, Target was not nearly as crowded as they had expected.But while shopping had gone fairly smoothly, there were a couple of stumbles at checkout. A book was not marked down as much as they had thought. One of the Lego sets did not ring up as being on sale.In the end, Ms. Mulder spent $78.18 on an assortment of dolls and other gifts. Ms. Renaud spent $92.13 \u2014 nearly half her budget. But she also left without half of the toys on her list.\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to be meticulous, online shopping,\u201d Ms. Renaud said of how she would buy the rest of her gifts. And if better deals for what she had bought popped up on Amazon, she would not hesitate to return items.\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to keep my receipt,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Target\u2019s Turnaround Still Faces Challenges", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTarget\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye will be hard to repeat.After a big miss over the summer, the American retailer improved its marksmanship with an impressive jump in online sales and raised its 2016 profit forecast. Even so, Target needs more customers wandering its aisles over the holiday season and a sustainable plan to compete with Amazon.By most accounts, Target turned things around in its latest quarter. Although overall revenue tumbled nearly 7 percent for the three months ending Oct. 29, to $16 billion, the company surpassed profit and sales forecasts. More high-margin apparel, home and baby items flew off the shelves. E-commerce revenue also grew a healthy 26 percent.The results, which sent Target shares up almost 7 percent on Wednesday, represent a stark turnaround from the previous quarter, when the company blamed a drop in demand for Apple iPhones and such for its weakness. A rocky grocery business and management shake-ups augured more challenges. In August, it cut its full-year earnings expectations.This latest improvement may be short-lived, however. The retailer\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell, was peppier about the final months of the year but not especially cheery. Target expects comparable-store sales to be flat this quarter. Restoring growth in foot traffic is a priority.Marketing its more than 1,000 retail locations as pickup destinations for online orders can help. So, too, should opening stores in cities like New York. Amazon\u2019s product breadth and ever-speedier home delivery are formidable, however. Walmart also is plowing headlong into digital with the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. Trading at just 13 times earnings, below many of its peers, could make Target a mark for investors. It is just not clear yet whether the company can maintain a steady aim.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Expected to Seek Deep Cuts in Business Regulations", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe unwinding of Dodd-Frank. The firing up of shuttered coal plants. The rollback of rules that increase overtime pay for low-wage workers.Hours after Donald J. Trump won the race for the White House, scores of regulations that have reshaped corporate America in the last eight years suddenly seemed vulnerable.While many questions remain about how Mr. Trump will govern, a consensus emerged Wednesday in many circles in Washington and on Wall Street about at least one aspect of his impending presidency: Mr. Trump is likely to seek vast cuts in regulations across the banking, health care and energy industries.\u201cThis is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan,\u201d Stephen Moore, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThere are just so many regulations that could be eased.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump is a maverick politician, his anti-regulation stance is that of an old-school Republican. It is driven by a belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from the long arm of the federal government.Or at least that is what some analysts and economists say they think is Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale. Even after a long campaign of endless rallies and debates, Mr. Trump and his closest advisers have disclosed relatively few specific economic policy proposals.And some of what he has proposed seems contradictory. For example, he has said he would roll back the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, while his party platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Trump will probably find common ground with many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, on cutting regulation. They clashed during the campaign over Mr. Trump\u2019s past conduct toward women and inflammatory statements about ethnic groups, and many Republicans do not see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on immigration and trade.\u201cBut Ryan and Trump are like-minded on regulation in a way they are not on trade and immigration,\u201d said Ted Gayer, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThat is red meat for both of them.\u201dHere is a rundown on how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could gut regulations from Wall Street to Silicon Valley:A clean Republican sweep of the White House and Congress would normally be greeted by loud cheers across Wall Street.But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is not a clear boon for bankers and financiers in the way that past Republican wins have been.On paper, many of his campaign proposals appear to favor banks and investors, including a promise to undo Dodd-Frank, which was passed after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet repealing the law and its many rules seems unlikely to gain much traction in Congress. And even many banks admit they have spent so much time and money complying with the law, they would rather keep it.Several Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that they did not expect Congress to completely repeal Dodd-Frank. Instead of undertaking such a costly and controversial effort, one likely possibility is that the Trump administration and Congress would take aim at a handful of specific rules that most irritate the banks, including what is known as the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of Dodd-Frank that prohibits banks from placing risky bets with their own money.Otherwise, many of the expected changes would benefit small and midsize banks rather than Wall Street banks. Regulators, for example, could raise the size at which a bank is subject to Dodd-Frank\u2019s enhanced oversight.Other pieces of Dodd-Frank could be picked off, like reining in the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a hallmark of the Obama administration.Mr. Trump could prune other low-hanging financial regulations, including a newly enacted Department of Labor rule that holds investment advisers liable for certain advice to their clients.He also promised on the campaign trail to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that increases the wealth of private equity executives.And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign took aim at the honey pot of global banking revenue: free trade. For decades, banks have benefited from facilitating deals and lending to companies worldwide.\u201cProbably more so than any president in modern history it will be difficult to predict what issues he latches onto,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official in the Obama administration, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.MICHAEL CORKERY, BEN PROTESS and LESLIE PICKERIn the energy industry, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first targets, according to Mr. Moore, an economic adviser, is President Obama\u2019s effort to limit carbon emissions at coal-fired utilities.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say the rule drove coal companies into bankruptcy, even though the industry says that its problems are mostly caused by waning demand.It is unclear whether the election of Mr. Trump can help struggling coal miners get back their jobs, but it will almost certainly upend the world\u2019s efforts to curb the impact of global warming.While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete dismemberment of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, a Trump administration could significantly weaken or slow them.Mr. Trump has said that he would do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. The rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and not arguing for the rules, Mr. Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.A Trump administration could weaken, or even repeal, the rules governing fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for new cars and trucks.Oil and natural gas executives are hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver for them, too. They want a loosening of methane emission standards for existing oil wells and the opening of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a big difference,\u201d said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, an Oklahoma company.CORAL DAVENPORT, CLIFFORD KRAUSS and HIROKO TABUCHIAs income inequality and stagnant wages became a major preoccupation among voters, the Obama administration brought regulations and enforcement actions intended to increase the leverage of workers. Most of these efforts are now endangered by the prospect of a Republican president and Republican Congress.In theory, the regulation could be undone by the Trump administration through a rule-making process similar to the one that produced it. But this could take months, if not years. Instead, some lobbyists expect Congress to pass a legislative compromise that would rein in the overtime rule, by phasing it in over a number of years, and by limiting or undoing the automatic upward adjustment in the salary threshold every three years.Mr. Obama enacted a number of other policies through executive order rather than a more involved rule-making process, and these could be undone by a President Trump almost immediately, with the stroke of a pen. These include rules that increased the minimum wage and granted paid sick days to workers hired by federal contractors.Trump administration appointees could quickly reject such interpretations and enforce the law differently, said Marc Freedman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the N.L.R.B. could easily reverse such rulings.NOAM SCHEIBERThe idea of a Trump presidency triggered a sense of dread among many people in the liberal-leaning technology business.Mr. Trump is seen as less favorably disposed toward the concentration of power among the handful of large companies that dominate the internet, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate firm\u201cI think Donald Trump may be facile with Twitter but mostly feels hostility towards these companies and their size,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.During the campaign, Mr. Trump told an audience in May that \u201cwe\u2019re going get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\u201dMany technology executives have called that idea far-fetched since most of Apple\u2019s supply chain, including many of its parts makers, are in Asia.Mr. Trump also blasted Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, saying that he was using the political influence of The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns, to discourage government action against Amazon on tax and antitrust issues.And Mr. Trump has called for the rejection of AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner.Still, analysts expect that he will appoint antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department who will largely follow traditional Republican approaches to the free market.Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment.Mr. Trump will be under pressure by major telecom and cable firms to roll back aspects of net neutrality. The rule inhibits how broadband providers manage traffic on their networks to ensure any website is equally accessible to consumers.Telecom and cable firms continue to challenge the rules in court and Mr. Trump, with the encouragement of Republicans in Congress, may seek to abandon the regulation.NICK WINGFIELD, VINDU GOEL and CECILIA KANG\u201cThe truth is, who knows?\u201d said Ron Cohen, chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics and the chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry trade group. \u201cWe still have to deal with the basic issues that are confronting us as an industry, and those have not changed just because of an election.\u201dOutrage over the rising cost of prescription drugs has spiked in recent years as Americans struggle to pay for their medicines. Egregious examples of price increases, like those on Mylan\u2019s EpiPen and older drugs sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, prompted congressional hearings and investigations.At the same time, the drug industry has gone to war with insurers and employers who pay for their workers\u2019 health coverage. Those dynamics, several people said, have not changed, and outrage over high drug prices is seen as a bipartisan issue.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump placed less emphasis on the issue than Mrs. Clinton did during the campaign.KATIE THOMASAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byIt was a rough night for number crunchers. And for the faith that people in every field \u2014 business, politics, sports and academia \u2014 have increasingly placed in the power of data.Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory ran counter to almost every major forecast \u2014 undercutting the belief that analyzing reams of data can accurately predict events. Voters demonstrated how much predictive analytics, and election forecasting in particular, remains a young science: Some people may have been misled into thinking Hillary Clinton\u2019s win was assured because some of the forecasts lacked context explaining potentially wide margins of error.The election prediction business is one small aspect of a far-reaching change across industries that have increasingly become obsessed with data, the value of it and the potential to mine it for cost-saving and profit-making insights. It is a behind-the-scenes technology that quietly drives everything from the ads that people see online to billion-dollar acquisition deals.But data science is a technology advance with trade-offs. It can see things as never before, but also can be a blunt instrument, missing context and nuance. All kinds of companies and institutions use data quietly and behind the scenes to make predictions about human behavior. But only occasionally \u2014 as with Tuesday\u2019s election results \u2014 do consumers get a glimpse of how these formulas work and the extent to which they can go wrong.This year, Facebook\u2019s algorithm took down the image, posted by a Norwegian author, of a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs. The software code saw a violation of the social network\u2019s policy prohibiting child pornography, not an iconic photo of the Vietnam War and human suffering.This week\u2019s failed election predictions suggest that the rush to exploit data may have outstripped the ability to recognize its limits.\u201cState polls were off in a way that has not been seen in previous presidential election years,\u201d said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who is a co-founder of the Princeton Election Consortium. He speculated that polls may have failed to capture Republican loyalists who initially vowed not to vote for Mr. Trump, but changed their minds in the voting booth.Beyond election night, there are broader lessons that raise questions about the rush to embrace data-driven decision-making across the economy and society.The enthusiasm for big data has been fueled by the success stories of Silicon Valley giants born on the internet, like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The digital powerhouses harvest vast amounts of user data using clever software for search, social networks and online commerce. Data is the fuel, and algorithms borrowed from the tool kit of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, are the engine.The early commercial use for the technology has been to improve the odds of making a sale \u2014 through targeted ads, personalized marketing and product recommendations. But big-data decision-making is increasingly being embraced in every industry, and to make higher-stakes decisions that crucially affect people\u2019s lives \u2014 like helping to make medical diagnoses, hiring choices and loan approvals.The danger, data experts say, lies in trusting the data analysis too much without grasping its limitations and the potentially flawed assumptions of the people who build predictive models.Mr. Brynjolfsson said that people often do not understand that if the chance that something will happen is 70 percent, that means there is a 30 percent chance it will not occur. The election performance, he said, is \u201cnot really a shock to data science and statistics. It\u2019s how it works.\u201dSo, what happened with the election data and algorithms? The answer, it seems, is a combination of the shortcomings of polling, analysis and interpretation, perhaps both in how the numbers were presented and how they were understood by the public.Mr. Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, and Mr. Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium said state polling errors were largely to blame for the underestimates of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning.In addition to the polling errors, data scientists said the inherent weakness of election models might have caused some forecasting errors. Before an election, forecasters use a combination of historical polls and recent polling data to predict a candidate\u2019s chance of winning. Some may also factor in other variables, such as giving higher weight to a candidate who is an incumbent.But even with decades of polls to analyze, it is difficult for forecasters to predict accurately a candidate\u2019s chance of winning the presidency months or even weeks ahead of time. Dr. Mutalik of Yale compared election modeling to weather forecasting.\u201cEven with the best models, it is difficult to predict the weather more than 10 days out because there are so many small changes that can cause big changes,\u201d Dr. Mutalik said. \u201cIn mathematics, this is known as chaos.\u201dBut, unlike weather prediction, current election models tend to take into account only several decades\u2019 worth of data. And changing the parameters of that data set can also significantly affect calculations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Helped Create Trump, and That\u2019s Bad for It", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the election of Donald J. Trump, technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency.Facebook and Google, for example, have both carried fake, frequently incendiary, articles that were highly shared by their users; Twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well, while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far-right hate groups organize and recruit, frequently targeting women and minorities on the site.The leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldn\u2019t try to police political debates. Facebook explains that it can\u2019t be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization.Nice try. These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels. They see America as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The American auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia. Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, said on Twitter that \u201cDetroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity. That is what is to be avoided.\u201dHere is the explanation from Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn\u2019s founder and a Clinton supporter, for Detroit\u2019s failures: \u201cThe overriding problem was this: The auto industry got too comfortable,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cThe Start-Up of You\u201d (the title alone speaks volumes). \u201cThe moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular.\u201d He also attacked any notion of continuity: \u201cInstead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst, they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism.\u201dMr. Hoffman goes further, arguing that it\u2019s not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world. People must harness them, as well.\u201cThe conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Information is limited. Resources are tight. Competition is fierce. The world is changing. And the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking. This means you need to be adapting all the time. And if you fail to adapt, no one \u2014 not your employer, not the government \u2014 is going to catch you when you fall.\u201dIt\u2019s an exhausting, Darwinian life he is describing \u2014 endlessly adapting to a changing, pitiless world. And it\u2019s precisely the opposite kind of life that Mr. Trump was espousing. His voters wish to return to the inefficient, enthusiastically nepotistic (you might call it family-based) factory life of the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 when America was great. Mr. Trump promised to bring his supporters\u2019 jobs back; the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy.It\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy. But at least he wasn\u2019t publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working Uber driver.There is one final irony. Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals. In the election, the biggest beneficiary of disruption was Mr. Trump, who defied all rules around decency, responsibility, truthfulness, consistency and even social custom, like releasing tax returns. And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied. Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalism also threatens the global consensus that is so important to the expansion of the tech giants. Yesterday, Russian authorities blocked LinkedIn over a data storage law.How do you like your disruption now?Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

They rummage through the greenery. They cart away branches.It\u2019s no cleanup, though. It\u2019s the first small step in a big show of gratitude.The branches go into a vase inside. Nearby are leaf-shaped pieces of paper in yellow, orange, red: the archetypal colors of the season if not the actual ones on the Southern California coast, where autumn isn\u2019t such a fiery showboat. People write concise missives on the leaves, then affix them to the branches, and what Ms. Christopher calls the Thankful Tree takes blazing form. It claims the center of the table, a reminder of what this holiday is really about.There will be a thank-you for someone\u2019s professional opportunity. A thank-you for someone else\u2019s recovery from illness. A thank-you for the comfort of kin, not just on this day, but on the many days surrounding it.And, possibly, a thank-you for this tradition itself. \u201cIt focuses us,\u201d she told me, adding that her family needs that. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of a rowdy group.\u201dI nodded and smiled.

And in her Thanksgiving, I recognized ours \u2014 and, really, everyone else\u2019s, because while the rituals vary, the attachment to them doesn\u2019t, and all of them follow the set of instructions spelled out bluntly in the holiday\u2019s very name. They express gratitude. It turns out that there are infinite ways \u2014 succinct and expansive, subtle and fanciful \u2014 for turkey-minded Americans to do that.My relatives would never consider a Thankful Tree, for one simple, unimpeachable reason: It would take precious real estate on the table away from booze, condiments and other items integral to our gorging.But we, too, insist on the moment of calm that Ms. Christopher described. Someone, usually my Uncle Jim, says a grace of greater length and intensity than the ones at other holidays. He speaks of God and gratitude, demonstrating that if we look at our lives through the right lens, we see blessings everywhere, and they outnumber obstacles.Gratitude is a feat of perspective. When I talked with other people recently about their ways and whys of giving thanks, I was most struck by how often their rituals arose from travails, not triumphs. Hardship was handmaiden to an examination of all that remained good, all that they should cling tight to.Tim Shiley, a manufacturing-plant manager in Buffalo, mentioned a profound loss when I asked him about the origins of his family\u2019s habit of making everyone at the Thanksgiving table talk about what he or she is grateful for. His parents, he said, both died before their 50th birthdays, and that has encouraged him, his siblings and his own children to huddle tight and not overlook \u2014 or take for granted \u2014 the importance of their solidarity.\u201cIt\u2019s not religious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the bonding of family.\u201dThe Times asked 15 American families to talk about the dishes on their Thanksgiving tables that speak best to their heritage and traditions, and to who we are. These are their stories.Those turnips, she noted, are more than a companion to turkey, stuffing and such. They\u2019re thanks for the sacrifice and suffering that paved the way to better times.\u201cHe makes these goofy comments about how fortunate we are to be descendants of his gene pool,\u201d said Mr. Gertzog, a senior executive for a nonprofit medical society.One grandchild has red hair, like her granddad\u2019s, and he solicits thanks for it. Another has an especially nimble mind: He wants credit for that, too, and for another\u2019s athleticism. He does this with more humor than arrogance, Mr. Gertzog said, and it\u2019s infused, in the end, with his own gratitude for having them in his life.So many kinds of rituals, so many offers of thanks: Jean Vintinner, who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, shows her gratitude for how much she has by giving some away. She, her husband and their daughter have turned Thanksgiving into a pre-Christmas pruning: Before they get new stuff for that holiday, they give away old stuff on this one, dropping off toys, clothing, art supplies and more to local charities.He noticed that the children and guests could become stiff and shy if they were expected, one after another, to make some profession of what they were thankful for. So, a few years ago, he bought tiny, empty journals and put one at each person\u2019s place.\u201cThey\u2019re gratitude notebooks,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey take away the performance anxiety.\u201dGuests write in them and keep them, but Mr. Bucatinsky always finds that a few notebooks, including his children\u2019s, are left on the table.\u201cI collect them to make sure the right person gets them back,\u201d he said, \u201cand \u2014 it\u2019s terrible to say \u2014 I look!\u201d What does he find in the notebooks of his children, now 11 and 9 years old?My family says everything through food, and on Thanksgiving, our tendency toward excess takes exaggerated, almost satirical form: four kinds of pie along with three kinds of cookies, not to mention several kinds of cake and various kinds of ice cream.But that overflow exists partly because everyone who walks through the door wants to emphasize his or her thanks for being there, and does so in calories.And when I reach for yet one more sweet, I\u2019m not just revealing my gluttony. I swear. I\u2019m showing my gratitude \u2014 that my Thanksgiving is an occasion of plenty, with an abundance of everything that matters most: wine, whipped cream, love.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Need to Pick an Insurance Plan? Start Here", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthPresident Obama once promised that the Obamacare exchanges would make buying insurance as easy as selecting a TV on Amazon. Just a few clicks, and you could comparison-shop and pick the plan that\u2019s right for you.In a way, the president was right: The marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act make a really confusing and expensive purchase a lot easier. But insurance remains a complex financial product. Making the best choice is going to depend on your values and preferences, and some good luck in predicting your future health.That\u2019s why, even three years into Obamacare, many customers are still relying on one-on-one meetings with experts, who ask the right questions and help steer people to the plan that\u2019s likely to be best for them. And it\u2019s the reason I still get calls every year from friends and colleagues asking me which employer plan they should choose.We wanted to try to help make a tricky choice a little easier. Obamacare customers can start selecting their 2017 plans today, and fall is open enrollment season for a lot of companies, too.We made flow charts to explain how to choose, one for people buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplace, another for those choosing an employer-sponsored plan. We got advice from groups that provide in-person assistance, economists who have studied insurance choices and executives at companies that are devising products to help make choosing easier.Insurance can be expensive, and some people still struggle to afford it. But if you can squeeze a health plan into your budget, our advice is: Do it.Our questions are intended to help you think about three key issues in choosing insurance. The numbers are devised for single people buying coverage for themselves. Payment and income cutoffs will be a little different for people shopping for family coverage.This can be a tough question to answer, because health emergencies often come without warning. But some people know ahead of time that they are going to use a lot of health care services. If you have an expensive chronic condition that requires a lot of drugs and doctors\u2019 visits, or you have a planned surgery or will be having a baby, you are better off buying more generous insurance that will pay for more of your health care.For Obamacare shoppers, there is one exception to this advice: people who earn incomes less than twice the federal poverty level. A single person earning less than $24,000 or a family of four with an income less than $49,000 is nearly always best off buying a \u201csilver\u201d plan. Because of extra subsidies, you\u2019ll end up with the equivalent of a more generous \u201cgold\u201d plan without paying extra.If you\u2019re healthy, something bad might still happen to you, but it might make more financial sense to take a gamble and buy a cheaper, high-deductible plan, rather than pay for extra protection you might not need. That plan will still protect you from really high bills, but you\u2019d have to dig out several thousand dollars from your pocket first for a big emergency. For people with employer coverage, these plans are often called \u201cconsumer-directed\u201d or \u201cH.S.A.\u201d plans. In the Obamacare markets, they are called \u201cbronze.\u201dMost insurance products \u2014 like car insurance or homeowner\u2019s insurance \u2014 aren\u2019t set up to pay for every last service. Instead, they are intended to protect you if something goes really wrong. Your car insurance doesn\u2019t pay for oil changes, but it does replace your car if it is totaled in a crash. Some people think about health insurance in the same way, as a protection from financial catastrophe. The Obamacare law makes every plan cover preventive health care like checkups, flu shots and mammograms at no charge.But, beyond that, plans that ask you to pay out of pocket for the first few visits and prescriptions tend to be cheaper than plans that have you pay a portion of every single bill. If you have savings or the ability to easily borrow some money, it often pays to buy a cheaper plan with a higher deductible. If you don\u2019t get sick, you\u2019ll save money. And if you do, you will have the financial cushion to pay a bigger share of health care costs that year.If you don\u2019t have any savings or the ability to borrow money, you might prefer to use insurance as a way to smooth out your costs over the year. Buying a more comprehensive plan will cost you more every month, but you might decide it\u2019s worth the extra money to avoid the financial consequences of an unexpected bill.Some of the least expensive plans in the Obamacare marketplace are plans that cover only a limited set of doctors and hospitals. The plans, called narrow networks, can be a good deal. But buying one may mean you have to give up a doctor you already know well, or you\u2019ll be steered away from a hospital you prefer because it is deemed too expensive to use. These are tough trade-offs, and different people will feel differently about what\u2019s important to them.If you have a lot of known health problems, and have strong relationships with doctors and hospitals, you will need to search through the plans\u2019 network listings to make sure you can continue to receive the care you want. The same goes if you have a particular set of medications. This may require some shoe-leather investigation, since the network directories are often confusing and out of date. If there are doctors you can\u2019t live without, call to make sure they are covered.You may be able to get a more affordable plan if you\u2019re willing to use a plan that covers a particular set of doctors and hospitals. Plans that do this are often called H.M.O.s or E.P.O.s \u2014 though other types of plans are also increasingly limiting their list of covered doctors.Even some people who don\u2019t currently have doctors might want to have a broad choice if they do get sick. Plans that allow patients to get coverage for so-called out-of network providers, generally called P.P.O.s, tend to be more expensive. Look at the plan summary to see what these plans will pay for a doctor who is \u201cout of network.\u201dIdeally, health insurers would be competing on the basis of customer service, and not just price. But the experts I talked to said there\u2019s still no good way to compare the plans on the basis of quality. So, if you have found a plan that\u2019s a good deal, has a deductible you can afford and covers the doctors you care about, it\u2019s probably a solid choice. There\u2019s still a chance that you\u2019ll end up having to fill out annoying paperwork or get stuck on hold for hours to make an appointment. But that might have been true with another insurance company, too. .An earlier version of this article misstated the determining characteristic of the silver tier in Affordable Care Act plans. The difference between bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans is related to the co-pay, not the deductible.Advertisement"}

Big Star\u2019s \u201cThird\u201d was the bewildering and later beloved (particularly by indie-rockers) album recorded in 1974 by the songwriter Alex Chilton at a druggie, drunken, experimental extreme. Radiant melodies grappled with clutter and noise; longing and reverence collided with snark and despair. Rightly considered uncommercial, it wasn\u2019t released until 1978, and its assorted versions have no definite sequence or even an official title. \u201cComplete Third\u201d joins the album\u2019s 20 final masters with Mr. Chilton\u2019s gleaming, open solo demos for the songs, along with out-on-a-limb mixes by its producer, Jim Dickinson, and more straightforward mixes by the engineer John Fry. It reveals the choices behind a ramshackle landmark.JON PARELESMusic is only half of \u201cBobo Y\u00e9y\u00e9,\u201d a box featuring 1960s and \u201970s recordings by four bands from Upper Volta (which became Burkina Faso in 1984). It\u2019s also a comprehensive portfolio of photographs by Sory Sanl\u00e9: studio portraits and casual images of a vital, bygone African era. The music is what made Sanl\u00e9\u2019s subjects dance. Orchestre Volta-Jazz pulls Afro-Cuban music and American soul back toward Africa. Dafra Star (founded by Volta-Jazz\u2019s star singer, Coulibaly Tidiani) brings out African rhythms, often with a balafon (marimba). Echo Del Africa National and Les Imbattables L\u00e9opards, which share the third CD, are smoother; though their ballads sag, they also find some funk.JON PARELESPresent ideas, from technology to home goods, to make shopping easy this season.JON PARELESJON PARELESJON PARELESJON PARELESJON PARELESIn the 1960s, even a soul hitmaker like Otis Redding \u2014 \u201cRespect,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t Turn You Loose,\u201d \u201cSatisfaction\u201d \u2014 had a grinding schedule. He played seven sets in three days at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles in 1966, a gig that moved him up out of the R&B circuit. Redding had hits to perform, but he didn\u2019t go for routine; he constantly changed up set lists. His nine-piece road band (horns and all) hit the arrangements as hard as the nonpareil Stax studio band, but with variations: fast and indomitable one night, slower and bluesier on another. And Redding used his velvet-lined growl of a voice to capture pride, desire, exultation and pain \u2014 just a great soul man, hard at work.JON PARELESJON PARELESJON PARELESThree solo careers aligned just twice \u2014 with sessions in 1986 and 1994 \u2014 for Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt to record two albums of luminous, largely acoustic Southern California country-pop together as Trio. They harked back to Appalachian tradition even in nontraditional songs like Neil Young\u2019s \u201cAfter the Gold Rush\u201d and Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cTo Know Him Is to Love Him,\u201d and their mutual respect shines through performances that were all about shared vocal harmonies. A third disc, of 20 outtakes, includes some alternate versions with more extroverted lead vocals in the spotlight. But at the time, Trio chose closer blends instead.JON PARELESBlonde Redhead released its first two albums in 1995, part of a downtown New York indie-rock moment still preoccupied with Sonic Youth\u2019s muscular and meditative dissonance and the long tail of no wave. But what\u2019s clear in this collection of early work \u2014 those first two albums, along with demos, outtakes and radio performances from the same era \u2014 is not just how this band smartly mainlined those ideas, but also its quirky sweetness. Here was a group that had cool reserve, nimble tension and an elegant warmth spread across it all.JON CARAMANICABefore gangster rap became the ubiquitous soundtrack of Los Angeles, Egyptian Lover\u2019s sensual electro-rap was one of the defining sounds of the city. Honed at live parties, his style was flamboyant and loose, and also comic: He was a hilarious character and a fountain of over-the-top dirty talk. But while his rhymes could be elemental, his zippy, throbbing production \u2014 an unending pulse that verged on the erotic \u2014 felt like the future.JON CARAMANICADeath by Audio, the warehouse venue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was raucous and communally inclined, and in the summer, woefully under-air-conditioned. For nearly a decade, until its eviction in November 2014, it was one of that neighborhood\u2019s essential listening posts, especially as the area began to coalesce around tense, frustrated, sloppy punk. That\u2019s the prevailing ethos of this exuberant collection of recordings made during Death by Audio\u2019s final month, one song per show. It intends to be a sort of Festschrift for one special venue, but ends up one for a sound that\u2019s evaporated, and a neighborhood that doesn\u2019t remember.JON CARAMANICAIn 1979, after \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d forced rapping out of park jams and block parties and onto records, the scramble to capitalize on that budding genre was fast, with a gaggle of small labels emerging to sate the hunger. This smart anthology captures that moment via songs that follow the template of that foundational hit: casual, slick boasting over live bands playing disco licks. Some of these songs, like \u201cRappers Convention,\u201d are part of the era\u2019s primary narrative, but here they share space with worthy peers who have largely flown below the historical radar: Count Coolout, Mistafide, Mr. Sweety G.JON CARAMANICAGiven how quickly hip-hop moves these days, the peak Bad Boy era of the mid- to late-1990s \u2014 the Notorious B.I.G.! Mase! Puff Daddy learning to rap in public! \u2014 feels like 10 lifetimes ago, but therein lay almost all the blueprints for what came next: melody\u2019s full absorption into hip-hop, followed by hip-hop\u2019s full absorption into pop. This thorough collection is arranged in loose thematic groupings, not chronologically, to emphasize a label that was tough when it wanted to be, tender when it wanted to be, and most of the time, preferred not to choose.JON CARAMANICAThe incandescent brilliance of Charlie Parker\u2019s output on Savoy Records, well burnished in other boxed sets, has often obscured the work of bebop\u2019s other early adopters, who receive their proper due here. Highlights include the earliest sessions by the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon and sparkling work by the trombonist J. J. Johnson, the trumpeter Fats Navarro and the baritone saxophonist Leo Parker. The sound restoration is superb, and an extensive booklet sheds light on both the sessions and their roguish producer, a self-described \u201cjazz hustler\u201d named Teddy Reig.NATE CHINENThe Miles Davis Quintet of the mid-1960s has often justly been hailed as one of the great small groups in the history of jazz. It has also been exhaustively chronicled, which makes this set feel like a fait accompli. A fly-on-the-wall glimpse into the recording studio, it traffics in alternate takes, rehearsal material and intra-band discussion, including every second of tape from the sessions for the album \u201cMiles Smiles.\u201d Only serious obsessives need inquire, but for anyone fitting that description, it\u2019s a motherlode.NATE CHINENKeith Jarrett became the most celebrated improvising solo pianist of the modern era on the basis of \u201cThe K\u00f6ln Concert,\u201d a wildly successful album of long-form inventions from 1975. This engrossing set consists of four previously unreleased concerts from an Italian tour in 1996, the last of his solo tours to adhere to a similarly sprawling format. Each concert has its own arc and character, balancing deep rhapsody against thorny dissonance. By Mr. Jarrett\u2019s own estimation, writing in the liner notes, this body of work represents a pinnacle of his career.NATE CHINENSo many of the factors that sealed Kris Kristofferson\u2019s granite reputation as a songwriter and outlaw-country hero \u2014 his knack for aphorism, his stoic eloquence, his tender empathy \u2014 can be clearly identified on \u201cKristofferson,\u201d his arresting debut, released on Monument Records in 1970. It\u2019s the first disc in this collection, which includes all his albums for the label, up to the 1981 masterwork \u201cTo the Bone.\u201d There\u2019s also a hit-or-miss assortment of newly unearthed demos; a compilation of nonalbum tracks, including some duets with Willie Nelson; and three riveting concert recordings, the first of which, \u201cLive at the Big Sur Folk Festival,\u201d is a previously unissued portrait of the artist as a young bandleader, already radiating his skeptical, rangy charm.NATE CHINENForty years ago this Thanksgiving, the Band threw itself a farewell party at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Billed as \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d it featured an all-star roster of friends and collaborators, like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters and Neil Young. A dazzling concert film of the same name, directed by Martin Scorsese, gave the evening an aura of legend, which is surely one reason its anniversary has been met with such a grand commemorative ballyhoo. The simplest of these editions is a remastered version of the original soundtrack, on two CDs; the most elaborate is a limited-edition splurge, featuring a faux-leather-bound copy of Mr. Scorsese\u2019s shooting script. A deluxe edition includes the film on Blu-ray, the full concert audio and a handful of rehearsal tracks, like Van Morrison\u2019s easing into ecstatic form on \u201cCaravan.\u201dNATE CHINENThe commercial advent of recorded sound coincided with a boom in mass evangelism in the United States \u2014 not an arbitrary overlap, as this collection definitively shows. A product of many years of scholarship, scavenging and restoration, the collection draws from dozens of rare wax cylinders, sorting them in three categories: commercial recordings, by enterprising souls like the revivalist minister Frank Butts; celebrity recordings, notably those by the gospel baritone Ira D. Sankey; and vernacular recordings, including what\u2019s known as the Heath cache, much of it traceable to a camp meeting on the Jersey Shore in 1897. A handsome hardcover book, packed with context, underscores the magnitude of the effort behind this groundbreaking set.NATE CHINENAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungry Venezuelans Flee in Boats to Escape Economic Collapse", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byWILLEMSTAD, Cura\u00e7ao \u2014 The dark outlines of land had just come into view when the smuggler forced everyone into the sea.Afraid of the authorities, the smuggler refused to land. Ms. Bello said he gruffly ordered her and the others into the water, pointing toward the distant shore. In the panic, she was tossed overboard, tumbling into the predawn blackness.But Ms. Bello could not swim.\u201cIt was worth the risk,\u201d said Ms. Bello, 30, adding that Venezuelans like her \u201care going after one thing: food.\u201dVenezuela was once one of Latin America\u2019s richest countries, flush with oil wealth that attracted immigrants from places as varied as Europe and the Middle East.But after President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez vowed to break the country\u2019s economic elite and redistribute wealth to the poor, the rich and middle class fled to more welcoming countries in droves, creating what demographers describe as Venezuela\u2019s first diaspora.Now a second diaspora is underway \u2014 much less wealthy and not nearly as welcome.Well over 150,000 Venezuelans have fled the country in the last year alone, the highest in more than a decade, according to scholars studying the exodus.\u201cParents will say, \u2018I would rather say goodbye to my son in the airport than in the cemetery,\u2019 \u201d he said.Desperate Venezuelans are streaming across the Amazon Basin by the tens of thousands to reach Brazil. They are concocting elaborate scams to sneak through airports in Caribbean nations that once accepted them freely. When Venezuela opened its border with Colombia for just two days in July, 120,000 people poured across, simply to buy food, officials said. An untold number stayed.\u201cIt has all totally changed,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n de la Vega, a sociologist at Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University in Caracas. About 60 percent more Venezuelans fled the country this year than during the year before, he added.\u201cThe earnings of these people are low,\u201d Mr. de la Vega said of the recent migrants. \u201cThe only option left to them is the nearby countries, ones they can get to on foot, or by rafts, or go on boats with tiny motors.\u201d\u201cVenezuelans like myself are coming to Brazil for a simple reason: It\u2019s easier to survive here,\u201d said Reinier Salazar, 30, an industrial engineer who moved to Brazil last year. Now he cooks at a fast-food restaurant for about $400 a month \u2014 much more than he made back home in Venezuela, he said.The exodus is unfolding so quickly that since 2015 about 30,000 Venezuelans have moved to the border region that includes the Brazilian state of Roraima, officials say. Now the Brazilian Army is bolstering patrols along highways and rivers, bracing for even more arrivals.\u201cWe\u2019re at the start of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in this part of the Amazon,\u201d said Col. Edvaldo Amaral, the state\u2019s civil defense chief. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing Venezuelan lawyers working as supermarket cashiers, Venezuelan women resorting to prostitution, indigenous Venezuelans begging at traffic intersections.\u201dSome are paying smugglers more than $1,000 a person to reach cities like Manaus and S\u00e3o Paulo, officials say, while others just manage to cross the border into Brazil. In Pacaraima, a small Brazilian border town, hundreds of Venezuelan children are now enrolled in local schools and entire families are sleeping on the streets of town.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a solution to this problem because hunger is involved,\u201d said the mayor, Altemir Campos. \u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t have enough food for its people, so some are coming here.\u201dThe small Caribbean islands neighboring Venezuela are far less hospitable, saying they simply cannot absorb the onslaught. The closest to Venezuela\u2019s coast, Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, have effectively sealed their borders to poor Venezuelans since last year by making them show $1,000 in cash before entering \u2014 the equivalent of more than five years of earnings in a minimum-wage job.Both countries have increased patrols and deportations, and Aruba has even set aside a stadium to hold as many as 500 Venezuelan migrants after they are caught, according to the authorities.It\u2019s a dramatic reversal of fortune for Venezuelans, who once went to Cura\u00e7ao to spend money as tourists, not to plead for work.\u201cThey all say, \u2018You are from Venezuela. You are from a rich country that has everything,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Bello said of her encounters on the island. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018No longer.\u2019 \u201dEmpty homes now dot the streets of the fishing town of La Vela, Ms. Bello\u2019s hometown in Venezuela, their owners having set off by sea.They have mortgaged property, sold kitchen appliances and even borrowed money from the same smuggling rings that pack them on the floorboards alongside drugs and other contraband.The journey to Cura\u00e7ao takes them on a 60-mile crossing filled with backbreaking swells, gangs of armed boatmen and coast guard vessels looking to capture migrants and send them home.Then, after being tossed overboard and left to swim ashore, they hide in the bush to meet contacts who spirit them anew into the tourist economy of this Caribbean island. They clean the floors of restaurants, sell trinkets on the street, or even solicit Dutch tourists for sex, forced by the smugglers to pay for their passage by working in a brothel, the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao say.Countless families in Venezuela are like the Bellos now. Unable to scrounge together more than a meal a day, they are scattered across seas and borders.Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Rolando works construction in Cura\u00e7ao and his wife recently joined him, leaving their 7-year-old daughter with relatives back home. An uncle of Ms. Bello\u2019s was not so lucky: He sits in a Cura\u00e7ao prison, accused of smuggling migrants like his relatives.Then there is Wilfredo Hidalgo, Ms. Bello\u2019s 27-year-old cousin, who studied business administration in Venezuela but never found a job. Two years ago, he was deported from Cura\u00e7ao after coming by plane. Now he is trying to return by boat, having saved half of the $350 he needs to pay the smugglers.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he said.There is also Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Roger, whose 19-year-old girlfriend, Yaisbel, is six months pregnant. He, too, said he would go to Cura\u00e7ao to support his child. Yaisbel said she would stay behind but take a loan from smugglers to pay for her boyfriend\u2019s journey, using her mother\u2019s house as collateral. Hopefully, she said, her mother would never find out.\u201cI am just watching her stomach,\u201d Roger Bello said. \u201cBefore the child is here, I will be in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201dAnd finally there is Ms. Bello\u2019s mother, Maria Pi\u00f1ero, who gave her a life vest just before she left, knowing that she could not swim. But the smuggler ripped it off Ms. Bello just before she was thrown into the sea, saying that the swells were so high she was better off swimming under the waves.Now, despite Ms. Bello\u2019s ordeal, her mother vowed to make the journey by boat, too.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m leaving with nothing. But I have to do this. Otherwise, we will just die here hungry.\u201dOne evening at the end of September, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, 47, climbed aboard a boat in a small town on the country\u2019s northern coast. She dropped to her knees, praying to God that she would survive the journey and find a better life in Cura\u00e7ao.The other passengers, tears in their eyes, began to pray too, some joining hands in a circle on the beach. They muttered hopes that the coast guard would not catch them, that they were good people, that they were mothers and fathers.They waded chest-deep into the water, hoisting their few possessions overhead, and climbed into the boat. Its motor started and it steered toward the horizon.Even the smuggler seemed distraught at the misfortune bringing him profits.\u201cI would prefer that the crisis ended and my business was over,\u201d the smuggler said after they had left. \u201cI would prefer a thousand times that there was no crisis and we could live in the Venezuela from yesterday.\u201dJes\u00fas Ramos knew he would have to swim ashore from the smuggler\u2019s boat. So he spent his last weeks in Venezuela doing laps in the sea in front of his home in La Vela, his mother recalls.His friend William Cordero, 29, went too. He spent that month applying for a business license for the salon he planned to open with all the money he expected to make in Cura\u00e7ao. He had already bought a sign.\u201cMy Faith In God Barbershop\u201d it said.But the boat carrying the men never made it.The two friends, along with three other migrants and a captain, vanished somewhere off the coast of Venezuela last year. No wreckage was found. The only evidence that their journey even occurred is a few selfies sent from their smartphones just before they departed. The men posed on the side of the skiff with big smiles.\u201cI try not to cry; I tell myself, \u2018He\u2019s well, that\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201d said Florangel Amaya de Ramos, Mr. Ramos\u2019s mother.The plan had been a simple one: A seven-hour journey in a speedboat. If they were stopped by Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s coast guard, they would pose as tourists. And with their documents in plastic bags, they were ready to swim ashore, knowing that the smuggler wanted to make a quick getaway. Then they could find their contacts using cellphones tucked in empty rice porridge jars.Mr. Cordero already had a Cura\u00e7ao mobile-phone chip. Two years before, he had boarded a plane to Cura\u00e7ao and worked illegally as a barber there, earning several thousand dollars that he sent to his wife and two children in La Vela. But in 2015, Mr. Cordero was deported.He returned to a new, grimmer Venezuela. Long lines for food were becoming startlingly common in La Vela and inflation hit triple digits.Even in big cities like Caracas and Maracaibo, staples like corn flour, the cornerstone of the Venezuelan diet, have become increasingly hard to find, while a growing black market for other goods has driven prices beyond the reach of many. In rural towns like La Vela, residents are even more squeezed, with fewer goods than large cities and a poorer population with less money to pay for them.Mr. Cordero tried to make the best of things by opening a barbershop on his sister\u2019s patio, wearing a white uniform like the one he wore in Cura\u00e7ao. But he earned only about 40 cents per haircut, compared with $35 or more per day in Cura\u00e7ao.The lure of the island grew more intense than ever. But the country had put the new visa restrictions on Venezuelans, and the door was shut behind him. The only way back was with a smuggler by boat.Mr. Ramos, Mr. Cordero\u2019s friend, knew a man who was collecting 200,000 bolivars each, or about $200 at the time, to run a smuggling boat. Mr. Ramos, a lanky 20-year-old, had also been deported recently after working as a gardener in Cura\u00e7ao, but had not managed to find work back in Venezuela. Once the money ran out from his first trip, his wife and three children were spending many days hungry.The smuggler found two other men from the area, and a fifth migrant named Jessica M\u00e1rquez who had come from M\u00e9rida, a city nearly 400 miles away.The five waited anxiously in La Vela for several days as the smuggler got reports from other fishermen in Cura\u00e7ao about coast guard patrols, trying to decide which night would be safest to leave.Mr. Cordero\u2019s sister, Saribeth Cordero, recalled the group sitting in her brother\u2019s barber shop on her porch one afternoon as a movie played on the television about a shipwreck.\u201cWhat if there are sharks?\u201d asked Ms. M\u00e1rquez, Ms. Cordero recalled.\u201cYou can\u2019t be negative like that,\u201d Mr. Cordero said, his sister recalled. But she said her brother was scared too. \u201cHe was nervous about the ocean,\u201d Ms. Cordero said.The group finally headed off in good spirits. Mr. Ramos had sold his motorcycle to pay the smuggler, telling his mother he would not need it anymore. She packed him a waterproof bag with some meager belongings: soap, toothpaste, antibiotics and a few clothes. A van arrived and they left.That afternoon, they arrived at the rendezvous point with the smuggler, a town called Tucacas. They stayed the night in a hostel there. The motor of one of the boats had failed recently, something that worried Mr. Ramos when he wrote to a friend who had agreed to meet him in the jungle once he landed in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. man\u2026 just relax, you\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d the friend wrote in Facebook message that Mr. Cordero forwarded to his mother.\u201cYes bro, tomorrow, God willing,\u201d Mr. Ramos wrote back.Mr. Cordero climbed aboard the boat and sent a selfie to his sister. He wore yellow board shorts and no shirt, making a peace sign with his hands.It was the last anyone heard from anyone in the group.The first to know something had gone wrong was Ms. Ramos. The friend in Cura\u00e7ao wrote over Facebook that he had waited all night but her son never arrived.\u201cI cried all night,\u201d she said.Questions haunt the families of the lost migrants each time they look out toward the sea. Could the men still be alive somehow? Will Venezuela ever return to the country that it was, one where it was not necessary to swim to the shore in Cura\u00e7ao after being tossed from a fishing boat?Ms. Ramos is still waiting for her son and speaks of him in the present tense. Each Sunday, she goes to Mass to pray for his return.\u201cI always speak to God,\u201d said Ms. Ramos. \u201cI am always looking up at that picture of the Virgin. I am scared one day she will yell back at me, \u2018Enough, already. That\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201dRolando Bello sat on a pier in Cura\u00e7ao, worrying about his mother. It was September, a week before she stepped aboard a boat to join him in Cura\u00e7ao. He knew the dangers well, having made the journey twice himself.Last year, he says, Mr. Cordero and Mr. Ramos had approached him to join their doomed trip before they set off.\u201cI was this close to going,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see what would have happened to me.\u201dNow his family was being subjected to the dangerous whims of the passage once more.His mother\u2019s boat was getting ready to set off. His sister, who had been dragged ashore by her hair, had been caught by the Cura\u00e7ao authorities and deported back to Venezuela over the summer. Desperate to work, she had sneaked into Aruba instead, taking a loan from a smuggling ring to get there.But at least his wife was with him. She came to Cura\u00e7ao that month under a new scheme. Because she did not have the $1,000 needed to pose as a Venezuelan tourist at customs, smugglers rented her the money to satisfy the new cash requirement, which is imposed only on Venezuelans. The smuggler\u2019s agents in Cura\u00e7ao then quickly approached her at the airport to take back the money \u2014 and to collect the $100 rental fee.Mr. Bello\u2019s wife, Lennymar Ch\u00e1vez, sat next to her husband and the two ate a large lunch. A boat sailed past a row of colonial facades, and Venezuela felt a world away.\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten an arepa for three months,\u201d she said, referring to the Venezuelan staple of corn flour, which has become increasingly hard to find at home. \u201cI ate one here in Cura\u00e7ao for the first time.\u201dThey had left their 7-year-old daughter in La Vela with relatives. Mr. Bello had trained to be an engineer in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. Now he was a construction day laborer, happily earning about $65 a day. Ms. Ch\u00e1vez trained to be a nurse, but held few hopes of working in her profession in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201cI don\u2019t mind cleaning now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe important thing is that I\u2019m working here.\u201dBut the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao, like many tiny islands, fear the immigrants will undercut the local labor force or bring violent crime.\u201cMy preoccupation is what kind of people are entering Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d said Nelson Navarro, the island\u2019s justice minister who argued that the increase in Venezuelans coincided with a 15 percent rise in crime, particularly armed robberies. \u201cIn Venezuela, they don\u2019t hesitate to shoot a police officer, but here, this is news.\u201dAlex Rosaria, a legislator on the island, worries that the migrants will further strain Cura\u00e7ao, where unemployment is at 11 percent.\u201cWe have only a limited capacity to deal with refugees,\u201d Mr. Rosaria said.For now, the task has been left to the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Rob Jurriansen, a Dutch naval officer who heads operations in Cura\u00e7ao, says his small fleet intercepted only a tiny fraction of the migrants, perhaps just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants arriving in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao, the islands the fleet patrols.Now, he says, officials in the Netherlands, the former colonial power that is still formally tied to Cura\u00e7ao within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, fear they will also get stuck with the bill of caring for a migrant tide.\u201cThey want to prevent a situation like Libya,\u201d he said, referring to the much larger flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe.His station is close to Caracas Bay, now the landing point of many who flee Venezuela. Dense, thorny brush covers the island for miles in each direction, forming a maze through which the migrants wander as they enter Cura\u00e7ao.Far across the passage, the seas had calmed and Mr. Bello\u2019s mother was preparing for her second attempt. After nearly reaching the island in September, her boat turned back, fearing it was being pursued by the Coast Guard.It set out again on a clear October night at 9 p.m. Mr. Bello\u2019s mother, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, sent a message to relatives just before taking off. It had been a choppy ride on the first voyage, but this time the 13 passengers glided smoothly over the waves.But the flat ocean also meant they were visible when they arrived early the next morning, before dawn. Somewhere on shore, Coast Guard officials say they saw what they called a \u201cstrange blip\u201d on the water.Ms. Bello was the first in the family to learn what happened next, when a friend called at 6 a.m.\u201cGirl, they got your mother,\u201d the friend said. \u201cThey caught the boat with drugs.\u201dMs. Bello didn\u2019t want to believe the news, but opened her computer to see what she could find online. Already, images were circulating of the passengers being apprehended by the authorities. Ms. Bello recognized her mother.\u201cYes, it was her with the red hair, the one covering her face so she could not be seen,\u201d she said of her mother.Ms. Bello\u2019s mother landed with a dozen other passengers in detention, she said in a brief telephone interview, watched over by guards. She sounded desperate and tired, her voice cracking.\u201cI thought that trying would be worth it, but in the end it wasn\u2019t, because I\u2019m headed back,\u201d she said, before the line clicked and she was gone.Her son Rolando Bello remains in Cura\u00e7ao with his wife, but his mother\u2019s capture casts a heavy shadow in the small home they share with another Venezuelan migrant family. The couple was trying to gather the money for Ms. Pi\u00f1ero\u2019s plane ticket back to Venezuela, which deportees are required to pay. They would send it through a third party to avoid being discovered themselves.One evening last month, Mr. Bello was alone, wondering if the promise of Cura\u00e7ao had been worth the damage to his family.\u201cOnly God knows the sacrifice one makes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut fine. This is life.\u201dHer daughter, Ms. Bello, was angry.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad because we hope we will arrive in one piece,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then suddenly, after a journey so long, they catch you. And just send you back to Venezuela.\u201d\u201cJust imagine the despair my mother is in,\u201d she added. \u201cShe has no money. Now she may have to sell her house. What a crazy thing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Roger Bello and Yaisbel, the woman who is pregnant with his child. Mr. Bello is her boyfriend, not her husband.An article on Nov. 26 about a diaspora of poorer Venezuelans fleeing poverty and hunger omitted the names of two of the three Caribbean islands that a fleet of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard patrols for refugees. Besides Cura\u00e7ao, the fleet also patrols Aruba and Bonaire. In addition, the article paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Rob Jurriansen, a coast guard officer who heads the fleet. Mr. Jurriansen said his fleet had intercepted just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants \u2014 not boats \u2014 coming to those three islands from all countries, not only Venezuela.Ana Vanessa Herrero and Meridith Kohut contributed reporting from Willemstad and La Vela, Venezuela, and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Parallels Between Europe\u2019s Antitrust Cases Against Google and Microsoft", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byThe Silicon Valley company said that customers and cellphone makers could easily switch to competitors\u2019 services and use rival smartphone applications, though rivals have balked at such suggestions.If the charges (and denials) sound familiar, it\u2019s because they are.As in the Google case, Europe\u2019s antitrust officials put themselves at the center of how people, both in the region and farther afield, used digital services. European officials have said the two companies\u2019 practices not only stopped rivals from competing directly, but also limited consumer choice and, in the case of Google, hindered innovation in the fast-expanding mobile world.The cases against Google and Microsoft, however, are not identical.The claims came on the heels of a separate antitrust investigation into whether Microsoft broke European competition rules by unfairly promoting its Windows Media Player over alternatives offered by rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.That included automatically including Internet Explorer with every version of Windows, which was then used on about 90 percent of all computers worldwide. Internet Explorer held more than a 50 percent share of Europe\u2019s browser market when the charges were filed.Google says that people can easily download rival services and that it does not restrict them from using competitors\u2019 applications. The company says its relationships with cellphone manufacturers are voluntary and it does not receive direct payments for these companies\u2019 use of its Android software.If it is found to have broken European rules, the company could face financial penalties, calls to alter its mobile operating system or both.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paint Your Nails With Patriarchy!", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 I\u2019ve never really understood the point of meticulously painting your nails, but even so, I\u2019m surprised by how hard cosmetic companies work to make it sound interesting. From Russia to Brazil, many women have faced tough choices between colors like \u201cRose Petal,\u201d \u201cWedding Pearl\u201d and \u201cPink Champagne.\u201dCreatively naming products is a crucial part of the nail polish industry. Instead of introducing a new color and calling it by its Pantone or hexadecimal code \u2014 \u201cCould you pass me that bottle of #FF001E, please?\u201d \u2014 companies baptize each shade with a poetic epithet, like \u201cDark Cherry,\u201d \u201cCoral Sunset,\u201d \u201cEvening Sand\u201d or \u201cConey Island Cotton Candy.\u201d So far, pretty harmless.However, in my imaginary history of cosmetics, the companies quickly exhausted their lists of common objects with discernible colors, opening the way for a symbolist phase: \u201cFiji Weejee Fawn,\u201d \u201cSeychelles Seashells,\u201d \u201cMoon Over Mumbai,\u201d or \u201cUp the Amazon Without a Paddle,\u201d a pink with coral and orange undertones that doesn\u2019t make any sense for a South American. (Although it\u2019s far better than OPI\u2019s \u201cKiss Me, I\u2019m Brazilian,\u201d which is insulting.)This exotic nonsense was the beginning of a descent to the darkest shades of sexism and misogyny that we see nowadays on the display racks of the nail salon.Eventually, a visionary must have introduced the infamous puns, now a trademark of nail polishes: \u201cMiami Beet,\u201d \u201cHotter Than You Pink,\u201d \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Coal Outside!,\u201d \u201cI Have a Herring Problem\u201d (a dusty steel blue with a hint of sparkle) and \u201cBut of Corpse\u201d (a green metallic base with a golden shimmer that doesn\u2019t remind me, at least, of a dead body). Others veered toward nonsense: There is a red shade called \u201cSnow White,\u201d and a green one named \u201cI Only Eat Salads.\u201d I also found a bright purple with gold shimmer called \u201cAre Mermaids Real?\u201dBut later they abandoned the need to be cute. Instead of choosing \u201cEternal Optimist,\u201d I\u2019d prefer to paint my nails with \u201cShattered Souls,\u201d \u201cGone Grey\u201d or \u201cToday I Accomplished Zero\u201d \u2014 at least they\u2019re honest. Three other depressive colors that perfectly match my soul are Spoiled\u2019s \u201cMy Button Fell Off,\u201d OPI\u2019s \u201cSo Many Clowns \u2026 So Little Time\u201d and Smith & Cult\u2019s \u201cBitter Buddhist.\u201d And that, in my opinion, should be enough when it comes to nail polish creativity.But nothing could restrain the enthusiasm of the nail polish namers, who recently decided to take a more dangerous route. It began with raunchier epithets such as \u201cPhallic,\u201d \u201cSecond Base,\u201d \u201cBetween the Sheets\u201d and \u201cOrgasm.\u201d Then it quickly escalated to Naughty Nailz\u2019s XXX collection, which includes \u201cCreamy Climax Dream\u201d and a host of others, too naughty to print.What those new names seem to imply is that there\u2019s only one reason for a woman to paint her nails: grabbing the attention of a good, handsome man \u2014 maybe even a millionaire. That\u2019s how we arrived in our glittery golden age of misogynist nail polish names that are not only silly, but also reinforce sexist stereotypes.Sephora by OPI is offering a whole collection that I personally call \u201cChauvinist Shades of Winter.\u201d It includes an orange-red color called \u201cLost Without My GPS\u201d and a deep black one named \u201cWhat\u2019s a Tire Jack?\u201d It was also responsible for the outrageously catastrophic \u201cDomestic Goddess,\u201d \u201cIris I Was Thinner,\u201d \u201cHow Many Carats,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m With Brad\u201d and \u201cNever Enough Shoes.\u201dBut they are not alone: The brand Essie has started \u201cNo Pre-Nup,\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s My Chauffeur,\u201d \u201cTrophy Wife\u201d and \u201cShow Me the Ring.\u201d China Glaze has released \u201cMan Hunt,\u201d \u201cLimbo Bimbo\u201d and \u201cMarry a Millionaire.\u201d Deborah Lippmann has \u201cBefore He Cheats.\u201d Color Club makes \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men.\u201d One of OPI\u2019s most popular colors is a shade of red that they have called \u201cI\u2019m Not Really a Waitress.\u201d And Spoiled has a nail polish named \u201cDaddy\u2019s Credit Card.\u201dLast year, one of the top-selling nail polish brands in Brazil decided to contribute to the anti-feminist global movement in nail polish names. The collection is called \u201cHomens Que Amamos\u201d (Men We Love), and it\u2019s distasteful enough to compete with the world\u2019s most famous brands: It celebrates the great deeds of our heroic husbands and boyfriends. There\u2019s a bright orange shade called \u201cAndr\u00e9 Has Made Our Dinner,\u201d a purple one named \u201cLeo Has Sent Me Flowers,\u201d a dark gray one called \u201cZeca Has Asked Me Out\u201d and a silver one named \u201cGuto Has Proposed to Me!!\u201d (with two exclamation points). The collection\u2019s slogan is: \u201cThe No. 1 topic of our conversations,\u201d which is, of course, men, \u201cin six colors that will set tongues wagging.\u201dAfter decades of research, nail polish designers have apparently come to this 19th-century conclusion: Women are vain, daydreaming creatures with a weak sense of humor and no ability to perceive that they\u2019re being manipulated. Our life is entirely devoted to men. We need to hold a guy so desperately that we put all of our efforts in one pricey bottle of a sparkling magic potion that our manicurist applies while casting a voodoo love spell. If we choose \u201cRomantically Involved\u201d or \u201cHappy Ending,\u201d instead of a mere \u201cOrange Orange,\u201d maybe we\u2019ll get lucky tonight.In the spirit of giving, my friends have promptly brought in other suggestions of names for the Men We Love collection. For the next season, the brand could go with \u201cCarlos Has Washed His Own Underwear, Hallelujah,\u201d \u201cPedro Has Recognized His Child,\u201d \u201cLucio Has Paid His Alimony\u201d and, last but not least, \u201cJo\u00e3o Didn\u2019t Hit Me Today (and I Surely Deserved It).\u201dVanessa Barbara is a columnist for the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, the editor of the literary website A Hortali\u00e7a and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Although it was the mid-1970s, ladies with blue-tinted hair ate sandwiches without crusts in the tearoom. And as we shopped, I wandered through what seemed like endless displays of textures, shapes, colors and smells.I was a fearful child from a household with little money and even less attention paid to children. Hutzler\u2019s was the highlight of that year. I have no idea what I bought, but I still remember the experience.Hutzler\u2019s went out of business long ago, and I live in New York City now. When I go shopping, I go to Barneys, ABC, the first floor of Saks. Can I afford to buy most of what these places offer? No. But I\u2019m not there for the purchase, I\u2019m there for the experience.Perhaps I\u2019m shallow, but I\u2019ve always been easily moved by beautiful objects and items. When I was a child, I was obsessed with Faberg\u00e9 eggs, and I cruised the local yard sales for rhinestone necklaces and scraps of velvet and lace.A good department store floor has the same effect on me. I hear myself audibly gasp and sigh at the jewelry on display under glass countertops, and the right fabric draped in the right way over a mannequin makes my heart contract.I try all the clasps on all the purses. I listen to the strangely satisfying clicks of compacts and lipsticks. I smell the perfumes. I finger dresses I\u2019d need a second mortgage to buy.Sometimes I fantasize that I\u2019m the kind of woman who wears these things, who tosses down a credit card without thinking, who scoops up silks and chiffons and exquisite bottles of face cream, and then glides out with big bags swinging from each arm.I\u2019m rarely alone on these excursions. I wouldn\u2019t want to be. My aunt and I have been close all my life, and I have no doubt the relationship was in part cemented by what became our annual trips to Hutzler\u2019s.When my friend\u2019s sister died, I took her shopping for something to wear at the service; when I got pregnant, she took me shopping for maternity clothes. These afternoons of intimacy and friendship will be with me long after the clothes have become stained, threadbare and unwearable.With online shopping, making purchases has become an algorithm-driven, frictionless experience of terrifying efficiency. Amazon allows you to restock your toilet paper by clicking a button. Net-a-Porter delivers Chlo\u00e9 and Balenciaga to your door.It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s fast, and it\u2019s completely devoid of any experiential pleasure.Shopping by phone or computer has always seemed to me depressingly isolated, stripped not only of the potential for human bonding, but also reflecting our culture\u2019s distaste for pleasure and play, its distrust of the sensual. We live in a time of instrumentalization and efficiency, where everything is faster, smoother and more goal-oriented.We eat to get the right nutrients, vacation to be refreshed when we return to work, move our bodies to stay slim. Online retailers cater to this utilitarian drive, and we in turn forget there are other ways, that there is value in a pleasurable experience even if no item is delivered the next day.Of course, these efficient systems make us more efficient consumers. While I won\u2019t claim that hanging out at Barneys or ABC makes me an anti-consumerist rebel, I do feel a sneaky joy in how little I actually buy, even while benefiting so thoroughly from these palaces of consumption. If you can rid yourself of the need to own everything that pleases you, suddenly these palaces become playgrounds: facilitators of tactile delight, not just mechanisms for buying.Certain items have caught my imagination so intensely that I\u2019ve felt the need to see them again and again. I have often found myself saying I was going to visit a purse or a dress \u2014 there was a slouchy leather bag at the Prada store in SoHo that I was essentially dating for several months in 2011.In this way, my relationship to shopping is similar to the way my friends visit museums: the thrill of exposure without the need to possess. Also, I get to touch and smell everything, while they only get to look.I can walk the streets until I drop from exhaustion; pop in and out of the Met; run, sail and people-watch in Central Park; have a picnic on the Brooklyn Bridge; swim at Jones Beach; marvel at the architecture from all vantage points.And who\u2019s to say that Barneys and ABC aren\u2019t also in this vast real estate portfolio of mine? In France, at the time of Louis XIV, anyone who was dressed with a modicum of decency could stroll into Versailles and lounge about the Grand Canal or watch the king dine.So too can we New Yorkers waltz into the most glamorous, supposedly exclusive shopping havens in the world and spend hours in sensory heaven, building our friendships, and without buying anything.There\u2019s an old saying that if you have to ask the price of something, you can\u2019t afford it. My advice: Don\u2019t ask the price. You already own the experience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clicks to Bricks: Online Retailers Find the Lure of a Store", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "An age of online shopping has, surprisingly, led to an exciting time for shoppers to get back out onto city streets to explore new, innovative shops.Supported byOnline shopping gets all the attention these days. But sometimes, there\u2019s still no beating a physical store.The British designer Lee Broom came to that realization last May after opening a monthlong pop-up shop in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo filled with his furniture and light fixtures, including lamps made from hollowed-out marble tubes and cut crystal bulbs recalling cocktail glasses.He had already been selling his products through his online store and about 180 retailers worldwide, including major online players like Lumens. But his temporary store in New York helped his sales in the United States jump by about 50 percent over the 12 months through early October.\u201cIt went incredibly well, and massively exceeded our expectations,\u201d Mr. Broom said. \u201cPeople want to see the pieces in person, get the scale, look at the materials and touch them.\u201dSo, last month, Mr. Broom opened his first permanent American outpost in an 800-square-foot storefront in SoHo, and plans to follow it up with a location in Los Angeles in the coming months.He is far from alone. Rather than crushing physical stores, the rise of online shopping is, in many cases, encouraging the development of new and innovative retail shops.Companies of all sizes that once sold primarily through multibrand retailers are building on their experience running online stores by opening direct-to-consumer brick-and-mortar locations. Established retailers are shifting their focus from basic transactions to offering compelling brand experiences and higher levels of personal service.Design stores that once catered to professionals are welcoming independent consumers, as Houzz, Pinterest and Instagram give rise to a legion of do-it-yourself decorators. And even companies that started as online-only enterprises are increasingly opening physical stores.To understand why, just follow the money.Online sales in the United States will reach about $394 billion this year, according to estimates by the research and advisory firm Forrester Research, a number representing less than 12 percent of total retail sales, which the firm expects will total $3.4 trillion.But web-influenced sales in physical stores (when a consumer researches a product on a smartphone, for instance, and then buys in a store) are expected to account for an additional $1.3 trillion, or about 38 percent of all retail sales.\u201cStores are still vitally important,\u201d said Fiona Swerdlow, a vice president and research director at Forrester Research. \u201cBut the influence of digital touchpoints is huge.\u201dA decade ago, most websites run by designers and manufacturers were essentially digital pamphlets comprising images, descriptions and specifications of products you could buy somewhere else. But the online store soon followed, where the maker could sell direct.Now, pleased with becoming retail players while also establishing stronger relationships with their customers, many companies are taking it a step further by opening physical stores.Herman Miller, a modern furniture giant founded in 1923, is opening its first permanent American direct-to-consumer retail store since 1967 (when it ran a small Textiles & Objects shop) on Nov. 22 in Manhattan\u2019s Gramercy Park. The two-level 6,000-square-foot space will also include accessories from other manufacturers and vintage goods to present a complete lifestyle vision for the contemporary home. It follows the debut of Herman Miller\u2019s online store six years ago.With the online store, \u201cwhat started as a relatively small experiment has grown very rapidly,\u201d said Ben Watson, the executive creative director of Herman Miller. \u201cThe size of the business we do directly to consumers has been growing. That was a hint to us that there is a lot of untapped appetite for products from Herman Miller.\u201dOther companies are discovering the same thing. \u201cIn a lot of categories, you\u2019re seeing a significant shift from wholesale, as a percentage of their total revenue, to direct channels,\u201d said Al Sambar, a managing partner at the management consulting firm Kurt Salmon.In the expectation that digital tools and social media will continue to drive more consumers to individual companies, while bypassing traditional multbrand retailers, \u201cbrands are building their capability to sell direct,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a way to have a personal relationship with the customer, and to have them be really loyal.\u201dThe fashion designer Thakoon Panichgul, who once sold his collections through upscale retailers like Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, switched exclusively to a direct-to-consumer model in August, with a new Thakoon online store and a chic SoHo boutique.\u201cWe saw a shift in the way that the customer was shopping, or the way she wasn\u2019t shopping anymore,\u201d Mr. Panichgul said. \u201cThe customer was shopping online more, and questioning the price of everything. The designer also wasn\u2019t able to control his own vision through and through. All of these components made me question the way we were doing business.\u201dAt the same time, he began presenting collections in a see-now, buy-now format, where ready-to-wear pieces are available to purchase online or in the store immediately or soon after being presented on the runway. The strategy, which capitalizes on the immediacy of social media while reducing the risk of knockoffs, is shaking up an industry where a six-month lag between runway and retailer is common.Many other brands, including Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford and Burberry, have recently been experimenting with the same thing.At Saks Fifth Avenue Downtown, the department store\u2019s 86,000-square-foot women\u2019s store at Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan, which opened in September, product displays are inspired by websites that encourage shoppers to browse. Where traditional department stores keep handbags separate from clothing, at Saks Fifth Avenue Downtown, an edited range of goods is organized by designer label, with handbags, ready-to-wear and jewelry commingling on a circular path intended to inspire surprise finds.\u201cWe wanted to de-compartmentalize the department store,\u201d said Marc Metrick, the president of Saks Fifth Avenue. \u201cThat\u2019s not how she shops anymore.\u201dIn some displays, \u201cwe lay things down flat on tables, just like you\u2019d see on a website,\u201d he added.But Saks\u2019s embrace of technology is about more than mere surface treatment. The company has rolled out applications from the retail technology company Salesfloor that enable online saks.com visitors to live-chat with a sales associate at a nearby physical store.After browsing product suggestions online, shoppers can make an appointment to meet their sales associates in person, to continue shopping. And even after the in-person visit, the shopper can follow up with the very same sales associate again, online.\u201cSaks, overall, is transforming. We\u2019re really pushing this all-channel experience,\u201d which blends the digital and physical, Mr. Metrick said. \u201cThe goal is to keep that interaction going.\u201dOther stores embracing a similarly mixed approach include Rebecca Minkoff in SoHo and the Polo Ralph Lauren flagship on Fifth Avenue, which have smart touchscreen mirrors in fitting rooms that suggest coordinating pieces for items a shopper is trying on, enable alternate sizes to be summoned from staff and can send links to products via text message so customers can purchase them later, online.At Brookfield Place, Saks is also offering highly personalized services, including its new Power Lunch program, which promises to deliver a style consultation, beauty treatment and lunch together in one hour. The service is free, except for the cost of products a consumer decides to purchase.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this convergence where it\u2019s the best of both worlds,\u201d said Steven Barr, the United States retail and consumer leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cIt\u2019s centered around extraordinary technology and extraordinary customer service.\u201dRather than treating online and in-person sales as two separate channels, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re finally entering that state where we can say there is a total retail experience.\u201dOther retailers are focusing on offering shoppers a chance to try products in a way they can\u2019t online. Pirch, a 32,000-square-foot kitchen and bath store that opened in SoHo in May, encourages customers to turn on fully functional faucets and showerheads or take in live cooking demonstrations, rather than merely looking at disconnected fixtures and appliances.Sonos, the wireless-speaker company whose products are widely available through retailers like Amazon and Target, opened its first direct-to-consumer retail store in SoHo in July. Shoppers can stream their own choice of music to test different configurations of speakers in a series of private listening huts.Many home-design showrooms were once the domain of professional designers and architects. Most homeowners either didn\u2019t know they existed, or were purposely excluded. With the widespread availability of designer resources online, that has changed.Showrooms are increasingly fielding requests from individual homeowners who want to buy direct, and many are opening street-level retail stores to become more accessible.Poliform, an Italian manufacturer of streamlined kitchens, closets and furniture, has long had a showroom inside the A&D Building in Midtown Manhattan, where it catered largely to design professionals. But at the end of September, it opened a 10,000-square-foot street-level flagship store on Madison Avenue to have a larger retail presence.While the A&D Building showroom remains, \u201cit\u2019s a destination for people who know we\u2019re there, not really a retail location,\u201d said Laura Anzani, the chief operating officer of Poliform USA.The Madison Avenue store, which is designed to resemble an extravagant, enormous apartment, \u201cis a big billboard,\u201d Ms. Anzani said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different being on the street. Before the store was even open, people came in and bought things.\u201dExquisite Surfaces, a wood-flooring, stone and tile company that was also previously in the A&D Building, moved into a street-level store in Manhattan\u2019s Hudson Square neighborhood last month. The 5,000-square-foot space includes elements to make shoppers feel at home, like seating areas inspired by residential settings.The British designer Tom Dixon opened an expanded 3,000-square-foot store in SoHo in July, after establishing his first 1,000-square-foot American retail store last November. Previously, Mr. Dixon, who produces sculptural copper, brass and chrome light fixtures as well as furniture and tabletop objects, ran a New York showroom for professional designers that was open by appointment only.Perhaps one of the most surprising retail trends is the proliferation of physical stores opened by companies that started out as online-only enterprises.M. Gemi began last year as a web-based, direct-to-consumer business selling its own line of high-end Italian-made shoes that cost about half as much as similar luxury goods. With shoes ranging from about $150 to $600 per pair, the company describes its prices as \u201cpostluxury.\u201dIn September, it opened its first brick-and-mortar store in SoHo. \u201cIt\u2019s to let her try shoes on, feel the fabric and experience the brand in a tactile way that she can\u2019t experience digitally,\u201d said Ben Fischman, the company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder.There is only minimal inventory in the store; the vast majority of purchases are shipped directly to a shopper\u2019s home, just like online purchases. And if shoppers do not want to make a purchase on the spot, store staff can add items to their online shopping carts for later consideration.\u201cWe want the in-store experience to really influence what your digital experience becomes,\u201d Mr. Fischman said. \u201cWhen she goes home and logs on, sitting there in her cart are the shoes she said she wanted to buy.\u201dM. Gemi follows in the footsteps of companies like the eyewear brand Warby Parker (whose latest store is due to open inside Grand Central Terminal this month) and the men\u2019s wear brand Bonobos (which opened its fifth New York store in Midtown in September). Both started out as online retailers, but now have an extensive network of physical stores.None of these stores carry inventory. Shoppers can try products on, but then place orders to have purchases delivered.At Bonobos, \u201cIt was a really humbling discovery to learn that retail stores were going to be one of the core parts of what was originally conceived as a digital-only brand,\u201d said Andy Dunn, the company\u2019s chief executive, who describes his business as \u201cdigitally native.\u201dAfter opening fitting rooms at New York-based Bonobos\u2019s headquarters in 2011, Mr. Dunn said, he was amazed at how they accelerated sales, and hatched the idea of the company\u2019s so-called guideshops.\u201cThe guideshops attract a really high-value customer,\u201d Mr. Dunn said. \u201cHe spends more money, he\u2019s more valuable in the long run, and he\u2019s more engaged with more categories. He\u2019s buying sweaters, suits, dress shirts and outerwear, in addition to our iconic better-fitting pants.\u201dMany new companies are now running with that model. AYR, a women\u2019s fashion brand that Mr. Dunn helped start, opened a showroom on the eighth floor of 648 Broadway in NoHo in June, where customers can drop in or book a champagne-and-snacks try-on session with friends for $100, which can be used as credit toward purchases. Next year, AYR plans to open a street-level store.Other digitally driven companies are opening physical stores that do have products in stock. AHA Front in Dumbo, Brooklyn, offers home and personal accessories, including sculptural ceramic vases and angular beer glasses. Pintrill in Williamsburg sells fashionably whimsical pins. And the outerwear brand The Arrivals is running a pop-up shop in SoHo through the end of this month.Paradoxically, the rise of online shopping may just make this one of the most exciting times in recent memory for shoppers to get back out onto city streets.General FashionWomen\u2019s FashionMen\u2019s FashionHomeAccessoriesEverythingAn earlier version of this article, using information from a publicist, misstated the date of John Hardy\u2019s store opening.

{"Headline": "With Trump\u2019s Election, a Bonanza for Washington Lobbyists", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byHe was not alone. The stunning surprise of the election, and the political chaos it created, is a boon for Washington\u2019s lobbying corridor known as K Street.Corporate America is both excited and anxious about the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, seeing great opportunity to shape the agenda after an extended period of frustration over gridlock in Congress.Across Washington, lobbyists and trade association executives were busy reviewing their priorities, which include repealing financial regulations instituted during the Obama administration, pushing for cuts in corporate taxes, overhauling President Obama\u2019s signature health care plan and spending billions on roads, bridges and other infrastructure.Mr. Lampkin, a former Republican aide on Capitol Hill, had fielded so many phone calls on Wednesday from his clients that his voice had turned raspy with fatigue. \u201cThere is a lot of pent-up demand to break the gridlock in Washington,\u201d he said.Prominent Washington lobbyists also said that Mr. Trump would arrive in the capital with a much smaller contingent of veteran policy advisers than Hillary Clinton would have brought \u2014 and they see that relative inexperience as an opening. So they are prepared to draft legislation and regulations to quietly pass to allies on Capitol Hill and in the White House.Lobbyists will also be leveraging their relationships. Mr. Lott, for example, noted his longstanding friendship with Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, whose name has been mentioned as a possible secretary of defense, as well as his former aides like Rick Dearborn, a senior policy adviser to Mr. Trump, and David Hoppe, the chief of staff to Speaker Paul D. Ryan.\u201cThere are going to be a lot of companies and people looking for guidance in how to deal with the legislative and executive branch,\u201d Mr. Lott said. \u201cI am looking forward to it.\u201dRepublicans have pledged, if necessary, to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act or to pass changes in tax code using a process known as reconciliation that requires only a simple majority and not the 60 votes typically required for contentious matters, making the pitch for lobbyists somewhat easier.\u201cIt is never good when you don\u2019t control the administration or either body of Congress,\u201d he said, having just returned from New York, where he went to what he had expected to be Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory party. \u201cBut as long as you have 60-vote thresholds in the Senate, you need members of the other party.\u201dBruce Josten, the chief lobbyist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said he had already been in communication with members of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, as the chamber pushes its priorities like securing approval for the Keystone Pipeline, the oil pipeline project blocked by the Obama administration, or reopening more federal lands to oil and gas exploration.\u201cIt is going to be nice to get back on game,\u201d Mr. Josten said, who has spent 22 years running the government relations division at the United States Chamber, the nation\u2019s single biggest spender on lobbying.Wall Street banks also will have to approach the Trump administration carefully \u2014 as Mr. Trump won the election in part by criticizing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to players there. But financial service lobbyists are eager to get moving.The first year of any new administration is traditionally a productive period. The challenge is for the corporate consultants to get their wish list included in the rush of action.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Research Center to Explore Ethics of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byCarnegie Mellon University plans to announce on Wednesday that it will create a research center that focuses on the ethics of artificial intelligence.The ethics center, called the K&L Gates Endowment for Ethics and Computational Technologies, is being established at a time of growing international concern about the impact of A.I. technologies. That has already led to an array of academic, governmental and private efforts to explore a technology that until recently was largely the stuff of science fiction.In the last decade, faster computer chips, cheap sensors and large collections of data have helped researchers improve on computerized tasks like machine vision and speech recognition, as well as robotics.\u201cWe are at a unique point in time where the technology is far ahead of society\u2019s ability to restrain it,\u201d Mr. Suresh noted.But at the same time, he said some people are a bit too optimistic about their claims of A.I. advances, particularly when it comes to autonomous vehicles.Mr. Suresh said he personally did not think self-driving cars would be in widespread use in the next three years.The Uber laboratory has been a sensitive spot for Carnegie Mellon. The field of artificial intelligence emerged in part at Carnegie Mellon in the 1950s in the work of faculty who developed software that showed how computer algorithms could intelligently solve problems.University officials said the departing faculty have been replaced and 13 additional professors have been hired since the defections. They also said that between 2011 and 2015, Carnegie Mellon faculty and staff created 164 start-up companies.University officials pointed to a partnership the school entered into last year with Boeing to use machine-learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data generated by modern aircraft such as the Boeing Dreamliner.The new center is being created with a $10 million gift from K&L Gates, an international law firm headquartered in Pittsburgh. It will draw from several academic disciplines and will initially add two faculty and three positions for graduate students. It will also establish a biennial conference on ethical issues facing the field.K&L Gates is one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates\u2019s father, William H. Gates Sr., was involved in the firm until his retirement in 1998. Peter J. Kalis, chairman of the law firm, said the potential impact of A.I. technology on the economy and culture made it essential that as a society we make thoughtful, ethical choices about how the software and machines are used.\u201cCarnegie Mellon resides at the intersection of many disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a synthesis of the best thinking of all of these disciplines for society to define the ethical constraints on the emerging A.I. technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An American Rain Forest and Its Charming Neighbor", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerI was motoring along Route 101 in northwest Washington State in my little rental car, getting a kick out of the fact that I frequently drive the same highway in Southern California, where I live. There were few other similarities, though: The air in Washington had a refreshing bite to it, cold and clean. The sweet smell of wet earth seemed to follow me wherever I went, indoors or out. And soon after I left Port Angeles \u2014 a small town on the 101 that\u2019s a quick 90-minute ferry ride to Victoria, British Columbia, across the Strait of Juan de Fuca \u2014 and entered Olympic National Park, it began to rain and didn\u2019t stop until I left the park seven hours later.Which, in a way, was exactly what I\u2019d hoped for. I was planning to spend a day in the Hoh Rain Forest, one of the only rain forests in the United States. (It was also my way of saying \u201chappy birthday\u201d to our national park system, which turned 100 in August.) Using the small, quirky coastal town of Port Townsend (roughly a two-hour drive from Seattle in my $25 per-day Budget rental) as my base, I set out to enjoy what Washington does best: some good hiking in a beautiful setting paired with an idiosyncratic hospitality. Even better, I was able to do all this without putting too much of a strain on my wallet.I paid the $25 admission, which initially seemed somewhat steep, but less so when I learned the pass is good for one vehicle, and all its occupants, for seven days. (An annual pass is only $25 more.) \u201cBy the way,\u201d the park ranger added, \u201cthis is a primarily coniferous forest. Some people come here expecting the Amazon; I\u2019m not sure why.\u201dPotential visitors to the Hoh should remember to bring proper attire: a reliable waterproof jacket and hiking boots with good, thick socks at bare minimum. Do not underestimate the importance of the socks \u2014 your boots won\u2019t be much use without them. A pair of gaiters, which keep your lower legs dry and keep debris out of your footwear, might be worth it, too (you can get a decent pair for less than $20). I learned these lessons the hard way \u2014 while my boots were solid (I got a great deal on Chaco boots for under $60 on Amazon), my light jacket was worthless. Within an hour in the forest, I was soaked.Fortunately, the hikes themselves were so good, I was willing to work through any physical discomfort. I hiked the Hall of Mosses and Spruce Nature trails, each roughly a mile long \u2014 as well as a portion of the Hoh River Trail, an 18-mile trek to the base of Mount Olympus. The Hall of Mosses was particularly nice. Enormous conifers stretched to the sky, 200 feet or higher.On the forest floor, new trees sprouted out of the moldering logs of their dead ancestors. Nearly every surface, living or dead, was shaggy with moss. That moss, it turned out, is a great sound absorber \u2014 the entire forest had an eerie calm to it.My room, on the top floor of the inn, was cozy with d\u00e9cor befitting its Victorian theme, and a very comfortable bed. There were interesting souvenirs and relics throughout the house: a suit of armor, old books, period musical instruments and a lovely restored pool table in the basement.I got to talking and sharing my food (I had ordered way too much) with Alanna Dailey, a young musician who grew up in town. Port Townsend \u201cis great in a lot of ways, but it can really suck you in,\u201d she said. Indeed, she had felt the need to escape, and had spent the previous year working in France. She added, kiddingly: \u201cBe careful; before you know it you\u2019ll be married and have four kids.\u201dShe and I went to nearby Chetzemoka Park after finishing our drinks and chatted. We talked about the history of the town, and how it is, despite vacationing retirees, and a relatively recent influx of new money, a fairly blue-collar place. We stumbled through the darkened park, using my cellphone for light, down to a big tire swing. We swayed back and forth on it. \u201cWe were originally supposed to be Seattle,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, the main city in the state.\u201d Port Townsend was once a booming 19th-century town, but growth slowed.Advertisement"}

Burrow is selling a couch experience.When customers order a Burrow couch online, the standard model will ship to their apartments in three or four boxes. A human of average size should be able to take those boxes up the stairs (if they have stairs) and build the couch alone, without tools and within minutes.Chopra and Kuhl tell me that for urban professionals between 25 and 35, the physical process of buying a sofa and moving it into an apartment is a series of \u201cpain points.\u201d Some of these points are literally painful, like carrying a large sofa up a flight of stairs. But the term is business speak for any kind of friction, however abstract, between a customer and a new couch. Burrow doesn\u2019t claim to have improved upon the couch itself: It\u2019s a pain-management company.It helps that furniture sales in the United States are unusually fragmented. It\u2019s a $100 billion annual market, but giants like Ashley HomeStore and Ikea take less than 5 percent each, while regional chains like Rooms to Go and Havertys still account for significant sales. Unlike with, say, office supplies, the industry hasn\u2019t become concentrated in a few huge companies \u2014 the field remains competitive.All of which is to say millennial entrepreneurs could pick a worse thing to sell than a deconstructable couch. As they disrupt our living rooms, these businessmen move us one step closer to a different world. But are we sure we want to live there?As they say, however, nothing in this life is free \u2014 certainly not shipping couches. Burrow manufactures its boxed-up sofas-to-be in Mexico City, then freight-forwards them to warehouses in Cincinnati and New York. Because they\u2019re boxes, rather than constructed furniture, they can stack all the way to the ceiling. The boxes are FedEx and UPS compliant, and they ship from the warehouses like normal packages. The process is advertised as free, but the founders estimate that it will cost them $75 per sofa, or about 10 percent of the $745 purchase price for the two-seat base model. Chopra and Kuhl also figure that if they can ease all the \u201cpain\u201d around obtaining and installing a couch, customers will be happy enough with what they get to refrain from sending it back, which Burrow says it will allow them to do for 100 days. It occurs to me that the kind of person who would order a couch online to reduce logistical hassles is also the kind of person least likely to then pack up that couch and send it back. When I ask the founders about this, they offer angelic smiles. \u201cWe think our model works for almost everyone,\u201d Kuhl says, \u201cbut there are some people who like Ikea.\u201dIkea hardly dominates the market from a numbers perspective, but it\u2019s been a cultural phenomenon for as long as Burrow\u2019s target demographic has been alive, to the point that it\u2019s essentially a default furniture-acquisition source. In a case study well known to those with M.B.A.s, Youngme Moon of Harvard Business School described how the company made a home in America. From the 1985 opening of its first American store, Ikea emphasized everything except the attribute that had been the industry\u2019s sole sales strategy until that point: durability. At Ikea\u2019s prices, furniture didn\u2019t need to be seen as a future heirloom; young adults could furnish their homes with new objects, rather than trawling through thrift stores or taking hand-me-downs from upgrading relatives. Attractive Swedish particle board gave Americans an excuse to jettison their parents\u2019 commitment to lifelong furniture and go shopping more often.\u201cIkea is an amazing company,\u201d says Maxwell Ryan, the chief executive and co-founder of the influential interior-design site Apartment Therapy. \u201cThey have great designers, infrastructure, product variety. They\u2019re very hard to compete with.\u201d Ikea furniture also packs into boxes \u2014 the industry term is \u201cK.D.,\u201d or \u201cknock down\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s based on a very different value proposition from Burrow\u2019s. By turning its stores into theme parks and fitting the warehouse right inside, Ikea bet that it could get customers to tote purchases all the way home by themselves. The pain points of couch shopping are still there, but so are the pleasures of dining out and free child care. Burrow\u2019s experience, on the other hand, is online and low-friction.Burrow isn\u2019t the only company that sees an opening here. \u201cTwenty-four-to-33-year-old career-driven, upwardly mobile people\u201d is how John Humphrey \u2014 a founder and chief executive of the furniture company Greycork \u2014 describes his customers. \u201cThey tend to be in the tech and design fields.\u201d With a Greycork living-room set, you can take a space from zero to furnished in five to 10 days, with free shipping. If a consumer\u2019s main complaint with Ikea furniture is the Allen wrenches, the trip to the store or just the fact that it\u2019s identifiably Ikea, Greycork could be a good alternative.\u201cThe way Ikea is based around the shipping container, we\u2019re based around FedEx,\u201d says Brad Sewell, the founder of the furniture maker Campaign. The ex-Apple engineer\u2019s company sells a chair, a love seat and a sofa \u2014 all the same design in varying widths. Based on the online view, they are not especially distinguishable from the Ikea Norsborg line and are a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. This next generation of couches uses web copy that\u2019s heavy in compound adjectives (\u201claser-cut, powder-coated steel frames\u201d) to project a premium feel onto goods that most buyers can\u2019t touch for themselves. The fact that the furniture folds is more than a logistical accommodation; it\u2019s a key feature.Kyle Hoff is a founder of Floyd, a furniture start-up that ships metal legs \u2014 they adjust to turn any flat surface into a desk or a table \u2014 alongside adjustable shelf brackets and frameworks for platform beds. The initial concept was \u201cjust add boards\u201d; Floyd products bind them into functional furniture. \u201cI wanted to make furniture for people like me,\u201d Hoff says. \u201cI was in my early 20s, moving from city to city, and I needed things that could move with me.\u201d Though Floyd is based in Detroit, Hoff says most of his customers are young professionals in New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. And maybe in is the wrong way to think of it; Floyd customers exist between these (and a few other) metropolitan areas. All the furniture is designed to move as part of a roving lifestyle.If a company can get to market first and establish itself as the singular way to buy a particular necessity online, it can clean up \u2014 even if it\u2019s appealing to a relatively small millennial luxury market. Most of the founders I spoke with mentioned Casper as an inspiration, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The venture-funded company was an overnight success in 2014 selling foam mattresses online and delivering them compressed into manageable boxes. Last year the company was valued at over half a billion dollars. It stands out even among Silicon Valley fairy tales, which makes \u201cCasper for couches\u201d a self-explanatory business pitch.The best thing about this whole product category is that it might represent a step away from Ikea\u2019s disposability without going all the way back to Grandma\u2019s antique sofa. If consumers are already thinking about moving, portability is at least as big an obstacle to maintaining furniture as mediocre craftsmanship and cheap materials. These companies want to make a couch that will last for 10 or 20 years, even if the buyers have no idea where they\u2019ll be or what they\u2019ll be doing that far down the line. Buying a piece of furniture that you will realistically hold onto longer is a kind of forward-thinking thrift.But this new approach also hints at something more sinister, more bad-future. Different furniture suggests different ways of being in the world: A heavy table says one thing, and a mattress on the floor beside a folding chair says another. Campaign takes its name from the furnishings that British colonial functionaries would take on assignments, ready to pack up if recalled by the Crown. It\u2019s an apt fit with one version of upwardly mobile millennial living, which involves reducing all \u201cpersonal\u201d needs to an efficient minimum. It\u2019s a style beloved by Silicon Valley \u2014 which finances accessories like the liquid food replacement Soylent \u2014 and exemplified by the Google engineer who blogged about the time he spent living in a small truck near the office.This Silicon Valley lifestyle and the Silicon Valley business model are caught in a chicken-and-egg dialectic. Each holds that whatever work can be automated, eliminated or subcontracted to others should be, thus leaving all our valuable code ninjas and management rock stars free to do more work, pursue expensive enriching experiences and watch Netflix. This is the luxury that some of the valley\u2019s most successful products are offering; there are now niche online services for doing your laundry, chopping your food, driving you around and delivering your toilet paper. The entire app-services economy can serve as a dispersed and techno-mystified mother, a caretaker who dotes on the implied bachelor user.The various furniture founders \u2014 Burrow\u2019s, Greycork\u2019s, Campaign\u2019s, Floyd\u2019s \u2014 experienced the same series of pain points when it came to couch ownership. All are city-dwelling men with at least some postgraduate education; four of them are 29, the fifth is 28. It\u2019s not surprising that they should encounter similar hassles or, because most attended business school, think of comparable entrepreneurial solutions. But given that investors and customers have encouraged them, it\u2019s worth asking exactly what kind of pain they plan to remove from our world.Maxwell Ryan, of Apartment Therapy, is not optimistic about the prospects of companies like Burrow. \u201cThere\u2019s this Silicon Valley mind-set where they solve a problem and so they think they\u2019re going to make a million dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cBut just because it\u2019s a problem for them doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem for everyone. I haven\u2019t seen that kind of thinking translate over well to the design space.\u201d Nor is he particularly impressed with the plain, one-size-fits-all style they tend to adopt (\u201cit\u2019s ugly\u201d). Ryan says customers want a good narrative to go with their furniture, like Crate and Barrel\u2019s origin story of a young couple\u2019s return from their honeymoon abroad with boxes of cheap imported fineries.But not everyone cares that much about expressing individual style, and Ryan could be underestimating how popular it is these days to stay inside and not talk to anyone. In our emerging economic order, the exertion of emotional energy is a kind of pain \u2014 a red entry in the accounting book of our lives \u2014 and there are new services every day to help us avoid it. Soon it will be possible to build and maintain a complete household full of goods without having to look anyone else in the eye.When my roommate and I moved to Philadelphia this year, we left our giant vintage couch in our fourth-floor Brooklyn walk-up. It was a nice piece of furniture \u2014 solid and soft, in light green floral \u2014 and we were sad to lose it. After we moved into our new place, my brother, who lives nearby, showed us to a neighborhood secondhand store called Jinxed. Inside we found a couch that looked shockingly like our old one. A little smaller, in better condition and orange instead of green, but remarkably similar. It\u2019s not what I would have picked online, but the coincidence was too striking to ignore.From a certain perspective, this was all suffering, insofar as it would have been easier not to do it. I\u2019m not unsympathetic; I\u2019m in the target demographic for a product like Burrow. I am a person who has bought flour on Amazon. But risk and hassle and pain are big parts of interacting with other people on terms that aren\u2019t yours alone. There\u2019s value in having to sustain a mind-set that accounts for other humans and their interests and needs, a value to always remembering that there are people between the apps and our fulfilled desires. If there exists a market incentive to smooth every friction a young businessman can think of \u2014 even something as mundane, low-tech and intrinsically social as a couch \u2014 we risk a very slippery world. \u2666Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer in Philadelphia.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What 9 Shoppers Wore While Browsing Madison Avenue", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byLIFE AS A RUNWAYBleecker Street and lower Broadway may get the downtown buzz, but Madison Avenue remains the swankiest of the city\u2019s retail thoroughfares. As temperatures drop and the holiday season approaches, the sedate and stately street gets an influx of energy, with well-heeled shoppers and tourists mixing on their post-brunch strolls. Last weekend, a stylish uptown crowd could be spotted peering through windows and looking to replenish their wardrobes. Here\u2019s what they wore.What are you doing up here? We were just at Barneys, and we always say it\u2019s more like a museum for fashion. Anything in particular you were looking for? Oh, Balmain, Alexander McQueen, Rick Owens, he\u2019s been coming up with some bangers. The hat is from Topman. I wanted a few Off-White pieces. They\u2019re on fire right now. They got the fit right. So what are you wearing today? Dynamic. You\u2019ve got to be able to dress it up or dress it down. You need pieces that can go both ways.A friend and I had lunch, and I had to get a work bag. It\u2019s something that carries a laptop without breaking your back. I don\u2019t even know who designed it. I bought it at Bal Harbor in Miami a couple of years ago. It\u2019s fox, that\u2019s all I know. Tell me about the watch. Oh, this? It\u2019s my favorite piece I\u2019m wearing today: $15, old school Casio. I got it on Amazon.What brings you to Madison Avenue today? We spend most of our time in Sun Valley, Idaho, but we have an apartment here in the neighborhood, too. Do you keep all your winter stuff in the New York apartment? We keep the dressier clothes here. Sun Valley is a ski resort community, so it\u2019s cold there, too. We have a New York wardrobe and an Idaho wardrobe. What are you wearing today? This trend is a Burberry, and I got the hat somewhere in Italy. Are you wearing a full suit today? No, but a sport coat and tie. Do you wear suits often?I used to when I worked, but not so much anymore.What brings you to Madison Avenue today? My mom took me out to lunch. She just arrived from Dubai where she lives. Now we\u2019re just walking around. I just bought a boring pair of jeans. You definitely aren\u2019t afraid of color. Where\u2019s the sweater from? It\u2019s Isabel Marant. I like the earthy colors and the texture. It\u2019s very light but also warm. I like your shoes, too. They\u2019re the Celine Vans. I actually stole them from my mom. Where are your jeans from? These are from Topshop, and I\u2019ve had them for the past 10 years. They\u2019re the best jeans I\u2019ve ever invested in. And you\u2019ve got the \u201cit\u201d bag of the season. It\u2019s very you, though. Exactly.Where\u2019s your coat from? It\u2019s Fendi. It\u2019s double-faced cashmere, so it\u2019s really warm. I got it because I don\u2019t wear fur and I like the color. Aren\u2019t you scared you\u2019ll spill on it? Oh, no. I like lighter colors, bright colors. Where\u2019s your dress from? It\u2019s Dior. And my boots are Stuart Weitzman. What are you doing up here today? Well, I just had lunch with some friends. We were shopping earlier at Tom Ford, and now we\u2019re going to run to the Cavalli store. Are you looking for something in particular? Yeah, I\u2019d love to get a dress to wear to the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show in Paris.What are doing here today? I\u2019m doing some shopping for myself. I was supposed to be in L.A. for the A.M.A. Awards, but I missed my flight. I\u2019m looking for something to wear to that. What are you wearing? My jacket is Off-White, the jeans are Saint Laurent, the little heart shirt [Comme des Garcons Play]. Nothing too crazy. This is just Monty on a Saturday going to the store to get fresher. How would you describe your style? I just like to look fly. I dress myself. I don\u2019t use a stylist. What about your necklace? This right here? This is history, here. It\u2019s our first 1738 chain. I just hold it down. This is Fetty\u2019s chain, but hold it down for him, I rep the set. I\u2019m representing for him. Why are you wearing the Jordans? It\u2019s popular shoes around the whole world. There was a time when we couldn\u2019t afford them, so now that we can, we got a whole bunch of them. They go with anything, and they\u2019re comfortable.What are you wearing today?My coat is actually Zara. I just took off the tags today. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to keep it. I\u2019m dressed very casually today: Uniqlo jeans, Adidas sneakers and an old Valentino bag. The beanie is from one of the PR events my company did a few years ago. The turtleneck is my husband\u2019s. It\u2019s probably like J. Crew. Sorry, this is so not interesting.Why did you go with all gray?Yesterday I wore all black, and my husband asked if I was going to a funeral. Are you ready for cold-weather dressing?I still have some furs I have to get out of storage. I\u2019ve been wearing a fur vest for the past week or two.So are you wearing all Calvin Klein?I am, all of this is, except for the jacket. I got it at a vintage store and then chopped it off because I already have a long one.So do you design clothing, too?Yeah, I have a studio in Bushwick. We do patterning, construction services, alterations. Where are your glasses from?I found them on the ground.Where?A late night in Williamsburg, and I picked them up.When did you grow your mustache?Probably like three or four years ago. I\u2019m for the \u201970s aesthetic. I have a twin brother and he started doing it, so I stole it from him. He tested it.What brings you uptown today? I came up to check out the new Acne store. Now I\u2019m just walking around and miserable because of the election, like everybody else. I love your commitment to burgundy. Are you always so monochrome? No, no. As you know, most New Yorkers are into black. But I\u2019ve just collected some pieces over the years, and now everything seems to be the same color. Where did you get everything? Well, my pants, my tights and my top are from Uniqlo. My boots are from Stuart Weitzman, and the jacket \u2026 I don\u2019t even remember where I got it, but it\u2019s not a big name. I\u2019ve had it for like two years. I made this purse, and the jewelry is mine. Do you think about the jewelry first when you get dressed? I just came back from Berlin and everything was packed up. So I had this jacket and I knew I was going to wear that, and everything else fell into place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ida Lupino, a Woman of Spine on Both Sides of the Lens", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byOn DVDOf all the actresses associated with film noir, Ida Lupino (1918-1995) seems the most complex. Ms. Lupino could be as sultry and sassy as Lauren Bacall while projecting an aching vulnerability. As world-weary as Gloria Grahame, she never came across as fragile, particularly in her subsequent work as a director.Both characters defend themselves against overbearing men: Richard Widmark\u2019s volatile nightclub owner in \u201cRoad House\u201d and Robert Ryan\u2019s violent cop in \u201cOn Dangerous Ground.\u201d These actors were reprising the psychopaths they played in previous movies, yet in each case Ms. Lupino\u2019s character prevails.Born into a family of British music hall stars, Ms. Lupino was a versatile performer who broke into the movies in her early teens. She could play comic ing\u00e9nues, as well as prostitutes and gangster molls but made her mark appearing opposite various Warner Bros. tough guys throughout World War II. Ms. Lupino starred as a hard-luck torch singer in Raoul Walsh\u2019s noir musical, \u201cThe Man I Love\u201d (1947), a model for Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York,\u201d and was cast in a similar role the following year as Lily Stevens in \u201cRoad House,\u201d directed by Jean Negulesco.\u201cRoad House\u201d may be Ms. Lupino\u2019s defining vehicle. Brought to a spiffy nightclub and bowling alley 15 miles from the Canadian border by its owner, Jefty Robbins (Mr. Widmark), Lily is introduced in Jefty\u2019s office with a close-up of her legs provocatively propped on his desk. She enthralls her boss while amazing the locals with her caustic wit and hard-boiled attitude.A sadist who enjoys beating confessions out of suspects, Wilson is akin to Mike Hammer, the toughest private eye of early 1950s paperbacks. \u201cI always make you punks talk,\u201d he snarls during one collar, while an angry superior officer accuses him of wanting to be \u201cjudge, jury and executioner.\u201d Consequently, Wilson is exiled to the mountains to help the local authorities in tracking a mentally disabled adolescent boy who they believe murdered a young girl.Wilson\u2019s professionalism, such as it is, is buffeted by demands for vigilante justice \u2014 mainly from the victim\u2019s father, the ever-bellicose Ward Bond \u2014 even as he is swept up in a snowstorm of ambiguity. Ms. Lupino materializes midway through, voice first, as a blind woman alone in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, presumably protecting her accused brother. Delivered largely in close-up, her subtly tremulous performance is worthy of a D. W. Griffith silent star.Abetted by Bernard Herrmann\u2019s ambitious, elaborate score, \u201cOn Dangerous Ground\u201d is notably kinetic. Reviewing it in The Nation, Manny Farber called the movie \u201ca treadmill of stumbling, fumbling, smooching, hurtling movement,\u201d adding that \u201cthe story is told with a camera and a rather unorthodox one.\u201d The visual style may be unusual, but the conflict is elemental: Mr. Ryan\u2019s character trusts no one; Ms. Lupino\u2019s has to trust everyone.Mr. Ray was evidently unhappy with what he called the movie\u2019s \u201cmiracle ending,\u201d but there\u2019s a hint of the Nordic moralists Carl Theodor Dreyer or Ingmar Bergman in this stark tale of faith and redemption \u2014 and not just because of the landscape.By the time Ms. Lupino appeared in \u201cOn Dangerous Ground,\u201d she had established herself as a filmmaker as well as an actor \u2014 some say she supervised several scenes in \u201cOn Dangerous Ground\u201d when Mr. Ray took ill. Between 1949 and 1953, she was credited with directing five independent productions. Four \u2014 \u201cNever Fear\u201d (1949), \u201cOutrage\u201d (1950), \u201cHard, Fast and Beautiful\u201d (1951) and \u201cThe Bigamist\u201d (1953) \u2014 could be described as hard-boiled women\u2019s films. \u201cThe Hitch-Hiker\u201d (also 1953) is a spare and scary film noir, available from Kino on an excellent Blu-ray and easily found in lesser versions on the web.The \u201cHitch-Hiker\u201d script, written (uncredited) by the socially conscious journalist Daniel Mainwaring, was inspired by an actual case: Two buddies (Frank Lovejoy and Edmond O\u2019Brien) pick up a murderous psychopath (William Talman) who forces them to drive him to Mexico. It\u2019s a brutal story handled by Ms. Lupino, one of Hollywood\u2019s very few female directors, with the same steely determination and emotional sensitivity found in her strongest performances.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Advocates for New York\u2019s Working Poor Push for Discounted Transit Fares", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byAt a time when New York City can seem unbearably expensive, advocates for the poor are targeting a rising cost that many people struggle to afford: a MetroCard.And with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority poised to approve its latest fare increase in January, they are pressing Mayor Bill de Blasio to finance a program that would offer half-price subway and bus fares to New Yorkers living in poverty.One of the authority board\u2019s newest members, David R. Jones, is challenging Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, to support the proposal as part of his re-election campaign. Mr. Jones, who was nominated to the board by the mayor, said Mr. de Blasio\u2019s transportation priorities, from new ferry boats to a planned streetcar line, though fine ideas, did not address income inequality.\u201cThis could have the most immediate impact to help the working poor right now rather than years in the future,\u201d said Mr. Jones, the president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit.The de Blasio administration said it was examining the proposal, but city officials were reluctant to commit to paying for it without the help of the state and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the authority. Given the tension between the mayor and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, Mr. Jones said he hoped the city would act quickly to finance the program itself.But the idea of offering income-based fares in New York would be the biggest experiment of its kind yet. The city\u2019s subway and bus system is vast, with more than 7.5 million daily riders, and the plan would be expensive, especially at a time when the authority is financially strapped and struggling to cope with record ridership.Next week, the authority is expected to release a proposal for a 4 percent increase on fares and tolls across the agency\u2019s network of subways, buses, tunnels and bridges. The new base fare, which may rise to $3 from $2.75, is expected to take effect in March as part of regularly scheduled increases every two years.But the current fares are already too expensive for many New Yorkers. Leslie Wells, a substitute teacher who lives in Harlem, often worries about finding enough change to pay the cost of a ride. After paying for housing and food, there is little left over. She said she certainly could not afford to spend $116.50, the current price of a monthly pass.\u201cI have to think about it,\u201d said Ms. Wells, a member of the Riders Alliance. \u201cWhat if the change doesn\u2019t add up? It\u2019s extra stress added to my day.\u201dMs. Wells said she had sometimes asked her son to duck under turnstiles to avoid paying his fare, even though she knew that doing so was against the rules.\u201cI really didn\u2019t have any other choice than to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought it was an adventure. I didn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201dThe city\u2019s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said the city and the authority had discussed discounts for low-income riders, but that the expense of such a program should not be borne by the city alone because the authority is a state agency.\u201cI do think we\u2019re ready to sit down with the M.T.A. and look at, potentially, are there creative revenue sources we can come up with here, if we all collectively agree that this is an important priority?\u201d she said.Ms. Trottenberg, who serves on the authority board, said the city also wanted to examine a potential expansion of the City Ticket program, which provides discounts to riders traveling on commuter railroads within New York City on weekends, and whether it was fair to be offering discounts only when riders put at least $5.50 on their MetroCards.The authority has been a source of tension between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, who feuded last year over whether the city should pay more for the transit system\u2019s long-term projects. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Freddi Goldstein, said the city already paid a hefty sum toward the authority\u2019s operations and capital budget.\u201cThis proposal will be evaluated as part of the fare-setting process for the M.T.A., as well as the state and city budgets,\u201d Ms. Goldstein said in a statement about the idea of half-price fares.A spokeswoman for the authority, Beth DeFalco, said the agency helped low-income riders in New York City by subsidizing fares for students and people 65 or older.\u201cThe M.T.A. keeps fares as low as possible while providing safe, reliable service,\u201d she said.Though riders have been frustrated by regular fare increases, officials at the authority said its policy was better than those used by other systems, like New Jersey Transit, which has less predictable increases and imposed one of 9 percent last year. The authority has said it plans to stick to a 4 percent increase across its network every two years.In the Seattle area, more than 35,600 people have enrolled in a discount fare program for low income riders that began in March 2015. Riders can qualify for what is known as an Orca Lift card if their household incomes are less than double the federal poverty level.The program addresses inequality in the Seattle area, where residents who work for companies like Microsoft and Amazon can afford to pay full fare, but others with limited education cannot, said Dow Constantine, the King County executive and chairman of Sound Transit, a transportation agency that serves multiple counties in the region.\u201cThe results we\u2019re seeing are that people are actually using transit more frequently now that they have the Orca Lift card, and that is a good thing, because mobility translates to opportunity and productivity,\u201d he said.The costs of the Seattle-area program have been relatively small compared with the projected expense in New York City: $3.4 million for operating and capital costs to start offering discounts, and about $3.9 million in lost revenue in the first year, officials said.When Jonathan Kumar moved to Seattle from Michigan recently, his rent nearly tripled. While trying to establish a start-up to help homeless people, he had little income and qualified for a discount card to ride the bus.\u201cThe savings allow me to better afford rent, to better afford utilities and groceries,\u201d he said.Now that his start-up is doing well, Mr. Kumar said he would no longer need the discount.\u201cNow I\u2019ll be able to better afford to pay a regular fare,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lasting Legacy of a Fighter for the Amazon", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byRetro ReportChico Mendes was hard to kill. No one knew that better than his enemies in Brazil\u2019s Amazon rain forest. They had failed in half a dozen assassination attempts.Over the last half-century, roughly 20 percent of the Brazilian Amazon has disappeared as a result of deliberately set fires and relentless bulldozing to make room for cattle ranchers and to clear paths for loggers, road builders and other developers. Mindful of the international outcry over looming ecological disaster, Brazil has tried to slow the pace of this deforestation, with a commitment to bring it down to zero by 2030. But steady progress has proved elusive; of late, there has been some backsliding. Environmentalists warn that in another 15 years or so, little of the rain forest may be left to be saved.Mr. Mendes\u2019s death at age 44 became a turning point in Brazil\u2019s environmental consciousness.Unable to read until he was 18, he started out as just another guy trying to get by. He worked as a rubber tapper, one of many in the Amazon who cut into trees and collect the latex oozing from the incisions. The methods are a circumspect intrusion on nature, allowing for constant renewal.Deforestation threatened the rubber tappers\u2019 livelihood. With his social conscience aroused, Mr. Mendes helped unionize them. He organized resistance in the form of human chains that blocked developers\u2019 incursions into the forests. Eventually, he came to appreciate that saving the Amazon was a blessing not only for his workers but also for the world.In the aftermath, a movement to save the Amazon gained impetus.Plans were halted for a dam that would have flooded territory occupied by the Kayap\u00f3 tribe. International businesses stepped up as well. Several large beef producers agreed to boycott ranchers whose herds grazed on denuded stretches of the Amazon. Giants like Nike and Gucci, perhaps reacting to customer pressure, agreed to have nothing to do with leather from razed sections of the forest.Latin America is singularly hazardous for activists. Brazil had 50 such killings last year. Colombia had 26, Peru and Nicaragua 12 each, Guatemala 10 and Honduras eight. On the other side of the globe, the Philippines had 33.These setbacks notwithstanding, many Brazilian ranchers seem to grasp the importance of sustainability. Steve Schwartzman, who is in charge of tropical forest policy for the Environmental Defense Fund, told Retro Report that \u201ca basic insight, which goes back to Chico Mendes, has become commonplace \u2014 to make standing forest a real economic asset that benefits the people that are living in it and that creates real growth without environmental disruption.\u201dMr. Mendes understood it decades ago. \u201cAt first I thought I was fighting to save rubber trees,\u201d he said a year before his death. \u201cThen I thought I was fighting to save the Amazon rain forest. Now I realize I am fighting for humanity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s very much like my real life.Call me old, or something, but it\u2019s starting to bore me. Maybe my life isn\u2019t cool enough to broadcast live all the time.All I know is, if it shows me anything like the weird gadgets they have in SkyMall, I\u2019m down.Imagine that: Already serving one fourth of the world and still growing like a weed. I truly don\u2019t understand how that happens. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told me it was because they have a \u201cgreat product\u201d which, uh, simplifies things a bit. I really want to know the secret sauce.But what goes up must come down, and analysts are freaked out about Facebook reaching the limits of \u201cad load,\u201d or how many ads they can jam into the News Feed over time. Which, I think, is a reasonable concern if your main worry is how Facebook is going to keep making more and more money.

{"Headline": "Book Publishers Scramble to Make Sense of Trump\u2019s Rise to Victory", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byIn the summer of 2015, Katy Tur, a London-based foreign correspondent for NBC News, got a surprising offer from the network\u2019s head of news coverage. Would she like to cover Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign? He assured her that it would be a brief assignment \u2014 six weeks at the most.Ms. Tur will recount those experiences in a book, \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d which will also explore Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected rise through the Republican ranks and his ascension to the presidency.Ms. Tur\u2019s memoir, which will be published by Dey Street Books next year, is part of a coming deluge of postelection analysis, as agents, editors and publishers race to acquire books that explain the forces that propelled Mr. Trump to victory and assess the future of American politics after a caustic and polarizing election. It is a challenging task, made all the more daunting by the fact that few in the publishing world foresaw Mr. Trump\u2019s rise.\u201cAs book publishers, we have a responsibility to take two steps back from the nowness of it all and find out what\u2019s going to be relevant five years from now,\u201d said Julia Cheiffetz, executive editor of Dey Street Books. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most extraordinary moments in American history.\u201d\u201cTheir story of what it\u2019s like to be a Muslim in America, it feels even more pertinent after the election results,\u201d said Ben Greenberg, Random House\u2019s executive editor.Other books will examine Mr. Trump\u2019s populist appeal and how he capitalized on voters\u2019 economic and social anxiety, or will try to place the Trump phenomenon within a growing wave of populist and nationalist movements. The journalist David Neiwert\u2019s \u201cMilitialand USA: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump,\u201d to be published by Verso, will examine how Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign helped extreme right-wing voices find a place in the mainstream. This month, Atlantic Books acquired the BBC broadcaster Steve Richards\u2019s \u201cThe Rise of the Outsiders: How the Anti-Establishment Is on the March,\u201d which will look at the populist sentiments that drove Trump voters and the movement in Britain to exit the European Union.A normal election year brings a barrage of books from campaign reporters, political pundits and academics, ranging from autopsies of the inner workings of a campaign to wonkier works that explore policies and social issues. There have been some breakout campaign books in recent years, including \u201cGame Change\u201d \u2014 a juicy post-mortem of the 2008 election by the political reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, which sold nearly 500,000 print copies according to Nielsen \u2014 and books by Obama campaign insiders like David Plouffe and David Axelrod. And an outgoing administration typically produces a flood of memoirs from cabinet members, advisers and, of course, the president and first lady.But this was far from a normal election year. Like many in the media, publishing industry executives were caught off-guard by the results on Nov. 8, and now find themselves scrambling.\u201cPeople are curious, and people are baffled, and from the point of view of a publisher that\u2019s both an opportunity and a hurdle, because you need to find a way to explain what happened,\u201d said Peter Osnos, founder of the publishing imprint PublicAffairs, who has worked on books by Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. \u201cThe big question is who will emerge with something that\u2019s compelling, original, revelatory and provocative.\u201dSome publishers say there\u2019s little appetite for the traditional blow-by-blow account of a contentious campaign that was already the subject of almost nonstop daily news coverage. (Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann declined to comment on whether they planned to write a book about the 2016 election.)\u201cIt was such an exhausting campaign, and it was so exhaustively covered that you would really have to come at it in a different way,\u201d said John Sterling, an editor at large at Macmillan.There\u2019s an evident hunger among readers for thoughtful and nuanced explanations of how Mr. Trump rode a tide of discontent among white working-class voters to the presidency. Immediately after the election, books like J. D. Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d and George Packer\u2019s \u201cThe Unwinding,\u201d which both examine the country\u2019s growing cultural and political divisions and the grievances of the white working class, shot up on Amazon\u2019s best-seller lists. Mr. Vance\u2019s book, which has 570,000 copies in print, sold more than 19,000 copies in the week ending Nov. 13, according to Nielsen. Several editors and publishers said they were eager to acquire more narrative nonfiction books like \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d that take a broader view of cultural and economic forces.Some see an opportunity for writers and publishers to seize on a moment of uncertainty and take stock of the future of the Democratic and Republican parties.\u201cAs surprising as the election was, as gobsmacked as most people were by the results of it, the really interesting part starts now,\u201d Mr. Sterling said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of the NBC News reporter who is writing the book \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d She is Katy Tur, not Kathy.Advertisement"}

They waited and waited and waited to get engaged in this election. And now we have this nightmare.\u201dOthers were more succinct in their devastation. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of the corporate messaging service Slack.For some, buried in the visceral reaction was also a realization that the tech industry\u2019s relationship with government \u2014 not to mention the public \u2014 looks bound to shift in a fundamental way.Mr. Trump\u2019s win promises to rip apart that relationship. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during the interminable campaign that led to his victory. Mr. Trump promised to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon, repeatedly vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States, and then called for a boycott of the company when it challenged the government\u2019s order to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration plans are anathema to just about every company in tech.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft offered no immediate comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s win, or how the new administration\u2019s stated policy goals would affect their businesses.But it seems clear that a shift is in the offing. Leaders of these behemoths have long spoken in ambitious, gauzy sentimentalities about a broadly progressive future. Their goals weren\u2019t simply financial but, they said, philosophical and democratic \u2014 they wanted to make money, sure, but they also wanted to make the world a better place, to offer a kind of social justice through code. Theirs was a tomorrow powered by software instead of factories, and offering a kind of radical connectivity that they promised would lead to widespread peace and prosperity.In private, during the campaign, many tech leaders were positive that their vision would prevail over Mr. Trump\u2019s. When asked about whether they were preparing in any way for a Trump victory, bigwigs at many of the industry\u2019s leading tech and financial firms were bemused by the notion. They thought it would never happen.The deeper worry is that tech is out of step with the national and global mood, and failed to recognize the social and economic anxieties roiling the nation \u2014 many of them hastened by the products the industry devises.And then you get to the economic problems. Unlike previous economic miracles, the tech boom has not led to widespread employment. Much of the wealth generated by the five biggest American tech companies flows to young liberals in California and the Pacific Northwest, exactly the sort of \u201cglobal elites\u201d Mr. Trump railed against in his campaign.\u201cWe need to figure out how to connect more Americans to the economic engine of technology,\u201d said John Lilly, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners.On Wednesday, some in Silicon Valley worried about their disconnection from the mass of voters who chose Mr. Trump.\u201cIn tech, we need scale, so we look at the world through the lens of aggregate metrics like page views, active users and even revenue,\u201d Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of a start-up called Mattermark, wrote in an email. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we understand the people on the other side of the screen as individuals. That\u2019s the danger, and the opportunity.\u201dOthers weren\u2019t as high-flying, but were nevertheless resolute.Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, an online document storage company, suggested that the tech industry promote specific policy issues.\u201cTo shift to an economy driven by innovation from tech-enabled businesses, we need to get ahead on the issues we\u2019ve been talking about in Silicon Valley for years, like education, patent reform and immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, minus taxes and some tax repatriation issues, much about Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been antithetical to most of the big businesses that are driving the economy.\u201dMark Suster, a venture capitalist at Upfront Ventures, echoed the idea.\u201cTech needs to take a deep breath, and then reflect on how this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd have policy proposals that can realistically address the inequality in our country.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.comKatie Benner contributed reporting.Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "FilmStruck Streaming Service Places a Big Bet on Cinephiles", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWhile the cable industry wonders how many of us will be willing to cut the cord and do without a traditional television package, its online rivals have moved on to a more timely question: How many cords \u2014 albeit invisible, cheaper cords \u2014 will we be willing to pay for at once?Jennifer Dorian, general manager of Turner Classic Movies, which developed the site in partnership with the Criterion Collection, said internal research showed that the people most likely to pay for FilmStruck\u2019s offerings of independent and art-house movies were paying for cable TV and another streaming service. \u201cThey\u2019re already very involved in entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s their hobby, and they don\u2019t mind spending money.\u201dBut even with the backing of two heavyweights, the Turner cable channel and the home entertainment company Criterion, both beloved by film buffs, FilmStruck is entering a niche-streaming field that\u2019s already very crowded. Movie sites like Fandor, Mubi, Tribeca Shortlist and SundanceNow already cover much of the same non-Hollywood ground as FilmStruck. And myriad other sites \u2014 focusing on Asian soap operas, animation, Bollywood films, horror, documentaries \u2014 are going after the same discretionary dollars.FilmStruck has one big advantage \u2014 the connection to Criterion, by far the most prestigious name in DVD and Blu-ray distribution, and its 1,500-film catalog of art-house classics. (Criterion films, available on Hulu for the last five years, will be streamed exclusively on FilmStruck, beginning later this month.) The site\u2019s two-tiered pricing reflects the importance of that connection: A FilmStruck subscription is $6.99 a month, but full access to the Criterion Channel within FilmStruck costs $10.99. (An annual subscription to both is $99.)For $6.99, you get some access to Criterion content: About 200 of its films will be part of the general FilmStruck roster of about 500 titles at any given time, according to Charlie Tabesh, senior vice president for programming at FilmStruck and Turner Classic.In the site\u2019s initial incarnation, the Criterion offerings are heavily front-loaded. The most prominent display is a set of thematic clusters \u2014 political documentaries, movies starring Marcello Mastroianni, films that had been banned in the United States \u2014 and about 80 percent of the selections in those groupings are from Criterion.\u201cI think the movies are a solid piece of it,\u201d said Jonathan Turell, chief executive of the Criterion Collection. \u201cBut I think the way they are presented is what we\u2019re spending a lot of time with.\u201d He said that, beginning with the Coen brothers\u2019 \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d the site would present \u201centire editions\u201d of films, with all of the extras \u2014 commentaries, interviews, documentaries \u2014 that were part of the original Criterion DVD package.\u201cIt appears Turner and Criterion are targeting and planning to super-serve the cinephile,\u201d Mr. Aidem said, adding, \u201cTo super-serve the indie-film fanatic is forgoing a ton of people out there.\u201dIf enough cinephiles are willing to spend $99 a year (which, even when combined with Netflix or Hulu, is significantly less than a cable subscription), then it won\u2019t matter how many viewers FilmStruck forgoes. Not all of its movies are hard to find or all that interesting \u2014 \u201cMadonna: Truth or Dare\u201d or a group of 28 Charlie Chaplin films don\u2019t set the heart racing \u2014 but its elegant interface and the Criterion catalog give it a big head start in the battle to be the second buy.Here are five subscription streaming sites that compete with FilmStruck.

{"Headline": "How Not to Overpay on Black Friday? Let the Web Be Your Guide", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byTech FixWe all know the drill by now. Retailers\u2019 sales promotions begin weeks before Thanksgiving, with a smattering of modest deals that eventually build up to the shopping bonanza that is Black Friday \u2014 the day after Thanksgiving. That is followed by Cyber Monday, a so-called online shopping extravaganza that takes place the Monday after Thanksgiving weekend.To whet shoppers\u2019 appetites further, it has become increasingly fashionable for online retailers to build up anticipation for Black Friday with so-called flash deals. These last only a few hours, putting pressure on consumers to make purchases with little or no research.Year round, The Wirecutter tracks product prices across the web to unearth worthwhile deals on high-quality items. Less than 1 percent of the tens of thousands of Black Friday deals online last year were good deals \u2014 that is, discounts on high-quality, well-reviewed and durable products \u2014 and this year the situation is likely to be the same, said Adam Burakowski, The Wirecutter\u2019s associate deals editor.Fret not, frugal shopper: Getting a good deal is still possible. It just takes a bit of forethought and web sleuthing, Mr. Burakowski said.\u201cCome up with a list and ask yourself, What am I interested in and what is the price now?\u201d he said. \u201cJust a slight check in advance would help out most consumers.\u201dThis year, Americans are expected to spend $884.5 billion during the holiday shopping season, a 3.3 percent increase from last year, and Black Friday is expected to be the No. 1 shopping day, according to the research firm eMarketer. Here\u2019s how a bit of research could help prevent you from needlessly burning piles of money.Before we get into sleuthing for good deals, it\u2019s important to understand a bad or mediocre deal. Retailers enjoy exaggerating their discounts for products in the weeks leading up to Black Friday, as well as on the actual day.Sometimes mediocre deals can be tricky to catch. Toward the end of October, Amazon listed a deal for its Kindle Paperwhite e-reader for $100. On the surface, this may seem like a good deal because the retail price is $120. But at the beginning of October, the Paperwhite was discounted to $90 \u2014 a price drop that Camel Camel Camel could not detect because the discount was applied at the end of the checkout process, Mr. Burakowski said.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.The lesson? Make a list of products you want to buy. Then check their Amazon price histories and buy the items if they drop to your desired amount.Daniel Green, a founder of Camel Camel Camel, also recommends this shortcut: Create a wish list on Amazon.com and import it to Camel Camel Camel. That way the site automatically watches all the items and alerts you when the prices drop.The same lessons for shopping wisely online apply to brick-and-mortar stores.Before you line up at Best Buy or Walmart, browse the ads, highlight the products you want to buy and check their Amazon price histories online to assess whether the deals are any good.For example, I used ShopSavvy to scan a bar code for a pack of Swiffer duster refills. Within seconds, the app loaded the price of the refills at various stores: $10.34 at Walmart, $9.97 at Amazon.com and $14 at Walgreens. If I scanned that item at a store, I would put it down and order it on Amazon.There is an easier way to avoid regrettable purchases when shopping in physical stores: Just don\u2019t do it, and shop only online. The good deals at physical stores are as rare as the ones you would find online, Mr. Burakowski said. So before subjecting yourself to the misery of sleeping outside Best Buy, consider staying home and watching the deals roll out on the web.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Playlist: New Songs From Prince and Garth Brooks, if You Can Find Them", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byPlaylistAt the Thanksgiving Day Lions-Vikings football game, Aretha Franklin took the national anthem to church and kept it there for four lavishly unhurried minutes. The instrumental lineup \u2014 Ms. Franklin on piano backed by an organist \u2014 should have been a tipoff that deep gospel was in store. This wasn\u2019t a song to get out of the way before the game could start. This would be an anthem treated like a classic spiritual, taking the time to contemplate every word and every phrase with deep concentration and improvisational abandon. Ms. Franklin made the song a patient, circuitous, ultimately spectacular ascent, from a husky, inward-looking start to an airborne finale, through husky assurances and bluesy sufferings, through grainy determination and powerful purity. The last line of the verse is a question \u2014 \u201cDoes that star-spangled banner yet wave?\u201d \u2014 but Ms. Franklin turned it into a flat-out affirmation: \u201cIt is the land of the free, the free!\u201d she sang, \u201cWe are the home of the brave!\u201d J.P.Of Garth Brooks\u2019s many modes, perhaps his most convincing \u2014 in this, the late middle of his career \u2014 is dad mode. There\u2019s something in the way he declaims: it connotes certainty, sympathy and resignation. This approach is at its most intense on \u201cAsk Me How I Know,\u201d from his strong new album, \u201cGunslinger,\u201d which in the hands of a lesser singer would be a scold, but is instead a reassuring arm around the shoulder: \u201cAnd when you start to fall, you hung on to your pride/Start building up your walls and never let her get inside/You\u2019ll push her away, \u2018cause that\u2019s all you know how to do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m messing up all of Drake\u2019s words/on purpose,\u201d Chance the Rapper sings midway through this cover of Drake\u2019s \u201cFeel No Ways,\u201d a song about feeling the sharp lash of recrimination from someone you once loved. Chance\u2019s version is both brighter and more insular; his band backs him with spare, cushioning synthesizers. When he sings \u201cI had to let go of us, to show myself what I can do,\u201d the exultation, matched by bright synth dollops, is a shift from Drake\u2019s resentment. Chance also changes a few words and adds a few lines that feel, perhaps, aimed at a specific person who\u2019s done him wrong: \u201cWe need to breathe/There\u2019s more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me/We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we could be.\u201d J.C.The experimental alto saxophonist and composer Matana Roberts didn\u2019t release an album this year, but that doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t busy \u2014 touring at home and abroad, organizing residencies, forging new collaborations. Last month she settled in for a few days at Caf\u00e9 Oto in London, working with English partners including the pianist Alexander Hawkins, the trumpeter Byron Wallen and the electronics artist Leafcutter John. The results sparked with exploratory frictions, as you can hear on the sanctioned bootlegs that Ms. Roberts recently posted online: three roughly 40-minute improvisations, all well worth hearing (though maybe not back-to-back). N.C.Tease, come-on and afterglow merge in \u201cManiac,\u201d which finds a percussive path to sensual bliss: \u201cYou just made love to a maniac,\u201d Ms. Aiko reminds a partner. Like a long-evolved descendant of Prince\u2019s \u201cErotic City\u201d by way of Janet Jackson and f.k.a. twigs, the production is all plinks, ratchets, whooshes and twitches; virtually every bit of harmony comes from Ms. Aiko\u2019s many vocals. She raps crisply through verses that hop in and out of double time as they juxtapose desire and demands: \u201cAnywhere, everywhere, you turn me to addict/If you love me like you say you do then get it tatted.\u201d And then she glides into choruses that hover and coo, offering the promise of sweet, proud insatiability. J.P.What sort of suave is Aloe Blacc? On his new single, \u201cReal Slow,\u201d he ventures the most conflicted sort of come-on, proposing intimacy as a shield against worldly troubles. \u201cDo you feel like there\u2019s a place for you and me in the home of the brave and the land of the free?\u201d he asks, in a rat-a-tat stream. (The track\u2019s terse hip-hop background is the work of DJ Khalil, who also produced most of Aloe Blacc\u2019s 2013 album, \u201cLift Your Spirit.\u201d) The silky assurance of the singing helps sell the feeling of a confiding, almost clandestine seduction. \u201cWe can dance with our eyes closed,\u201d the suitor suggests, before spinning out the hypothetical:N.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Is No Longer a Global Emergency, W.H.O. Says", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byThe World Health Organization declared an end to its global health emergency over the spread of the Zika virus on Friday, prompting dismay from some public health experts confronting the epidemic.An agency advisory committee said it ended the emergency \u2014 formally known as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern \u2014 because Zika is now shown to be a dangerous mosquito-borne disease, like malaria or yellow fever, and should be viewed as an ongoing threat met as other diseases are, sometimes with W.H.O. help.Committee members repeatedly emphasized that they did not consider the Zika crisis over.\u201cWe are not downgrading the importance of Zika,\u201d said Dr. Peter Salama, executive director of the W.H.O.\u2019s health emergencies program. \u201cWe are sending the message that Zika is here to stay and the W.H.O. response is here to stay.\u201dLike all mosquito-borne diseases, Zika is seasonal and may repeatedly return to countries with the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry it, Dr. Salama added.Individual countries facing serious new Zika outbreaks could still declare local emergencies, said Dr. David L. Heymann, chair of the advisory committee.But other experts worried that the W.H.O.\u2019s declaration might slow the international response to an epidemic that is still spreading, and lull people at risk into thinking they were safe.Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is funding efforts to find a Zika vaccine, suggested that it was premature to lift the state of emergency since summer is just beginning in the Southern hemisphere.His agency would not slow down its vaccine efforts, he said.Recent outbreaks and related birth defects have also been detected in Southeast Asia, although scientists believe the Zika virus has circulated there for decades.The most severe deformity is microcephaly, a tiny head with a severely underdeveloped brain; but fetuses have also been killed by the virus, and infected infants have been born blind, deaf, with clubbed feet and permanent limb rigidity.Scientists also fear that many infected babies who appear normal now may suffer from intellectual deficits or mental illnesses later in their lives.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expressed no opinion about the W.H.O.\u2019s decision, but noted that it \u201cdid not change the urgent need to continue our work.\u201dWhy scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.Although the virus is not killing or deforming as many babies as originally expected, \u201cthe international response has been lethargic,\u201d Dr. Gostin said.\u201cW.H.O.\u2019s action to call off the global emergency has provided reason for governments and donors to pull back even more,\u201d he said.Even if the outbreak no longer meets the technical definition of an emergency under 2005 international health regulations, there is an important psychological component to declaring an emergency.Headlines suggesting the crisis is over may lead people to take fewer precautions against sexual and mosquito-borne transmission, experts said.\u201cWe are still not out of the woods,\u201d said Scott C. Weaver, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston who was among the first to warn that the virus threatened the Americas.The disaster in northeast Brazil, where more than 2,000 babies have been born with microcephaly, will probably not be repeated, Mr. Weaver said. And he \u201cwould not be surprised if the disease had run its course in Central America and the Caribbean.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cI think the worst is yet to come in southern Brazil \u2014 places like S\u00e3o Paulo. And some places in the Amazon haven\u2019t seen the virus at all yet.\u201dWhen a large portion of a population has been infected with a virus and has recovered, rising \u201cherd immunity\u201d usually ends the transmission of a virus for several years, until enough susceptible victims are born.Dr. Albert I. Ko, a Yale epidemiologist who has worked in northeast Brazil for years, said he understood the W.H.O.\u2019s rationale but felt the agency had acted too soon. The full extent of the damage in Latin America is unknown, he said, because many infected babies are yet to be born.Also, Asian governments are just beginning to realize that they face a crisis, he added, and may now take fewer countermeasures.When the W.H.O. declared an emergency in February, it was intended in part to get scientists to explore the Zika-microcephaly connection and to make countries cooperate in fighting the epidemic.At the time, it was unknown whether Brazil\u2019s surge in microcephalic babies was caused by the Zika virus, which had been discovered in 1947 and was considered a mild disease.Later, W.H.O. officials declared themselves satisfied that Zika was the main cause of the microcephaly outbreak.In a later meeting, officials decided that the risk was not sufficient to justify canceling the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, but was high enough that pregnant women should avoid traveling to the area.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: When the Tech Industry Lives in a Bubble", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byBitsWhy was the turkey not hungry on Thanksgiving?Because he was already stuffed.You and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, the epicenter of the tech industry and also one of the most liberal places in the country. In San Francisco, Trump won less than 10 percent of the vote. In Santa Clara County, home to Google, Facebook and Apple, he got barely over 20 percent.What we should talk about is whether the tech business\u2019s distance from so much of the country is a bad thing, and something that can be solved in some way.For what it\u2019s worth, the so-called secession plan is little more than a few tweets and a website at the moment, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere. But it did create an instant tech angle!Back to tech. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great that so much of the tech business swims in the same waters. I\u2019m not saying people in tech should be more open-minded toward Trump. I\u2019m not saying it would be better if 50 percent of Facebook employees voted for Trump.But I do think this election underscores a problem for the tech industry. It works on scale. The whole premise of a software business is that a few people can make something that the entire world can use. But the flip side of that magic is that the whole world ends up using products that only a small group of people control. It\u2019s not just Trump voters. Tech giants are making products that are being used by subsistence farmers in India, taxi drivers in China, bankers in London and schoolteachers in Brazil, to name a few random people off the top of my head.The election emphasizes how crazy that task is. How can a 24-year-old white male engineer at Google who graduated from Stanford ever hope to empathize with the vast majority of people who use the products he\u2019s working on?There is no way a recent, extremely well-paid Stanford graduate can be expected to empathize with the rest of the country if the extent of his or her worldliness means knowing the best time to cut out of work to beat traffic from Silicon Valley back to San Francisco.Not only do these employees have no personal incentive to travel to the Midwest, but they aren\u2019t forced to do so by those in upper management, who also live in a bubble largely of their own making.By the way, I am self-aware enough to recognize the irony of this criticism coming from a coastal media type who has lived in New York and California while working for The New York Times. But I will say, I grew up all around the country, including largely in the South, so I don\u2019t feel as out of touch as, say, someone who has lived their entire life in the 100-mile radius of the Bay Area.I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think the tech companies are either. The facile answer is to work much harder on diversity \u2014 not just racial and gender diversity, but also geographic diversity and diversity of thought. I hope they do that. But that goes only so far. After all, Apple can\u2019t go out and recruit a bunch of workers just because they like Trump.Why not hire a more diverse candidate pool? Those with liberal arts degrees and students of history? People from across the country? I think that would be a start. And Mark Zuckerberg himself said on Facebook\u2019s earnings call that 2017 would be a big year for recruiting investment.I\u2019ve seen many techies offer to work with the White House to get talented people on board with the next administration. And to the opposite effect, I\u2019ve seen some who will fight the Trump administration tooth and nail, against any injustices they may see.I admire both impulses, though I think what\u2019s most important is to have an actual opinion rather than, I don\u2019t know, blandly letting the next four years go by while doing one\u2019s own thing inside the island of California. Be civic-minded, both locally and nationally. Don\u2019t let public relations and company statements speak on your behalf.That\u2019s what I plan on doing. At least until I get canned someday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 14, 2016Joshua WrightMatt StollerThe proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger is a watershed moment for our political system. Will we continue to allow the further concentration of economic power at the top, or will this be the moment when democracy fights back?ATT-Time Warner would be a giant in pay-TV, wireless service, broadband, news and entertainment \u2014 it could certainly shape the media to its advantage in a myriad different ways. But most people don't need these studies to know they are being ripped off by their cell phone, broadband, and cable providers, and that medicine and air travel, for example, cost too much. But the U.S. has a model for de-concentrating power in order to lift up the middle class. More interesting still: The concentration bill was approved by all parties in Israel, from the extreme right to the extreme left \u2014 a rare feat in a country with fractious politics. Starting with AT&T-Time Warner, perhaps stronger anti-monopoly policy is something all Americans can agree on.\u201cBig is bad\u201d is perhaps the only thing this year's presidential candidates agreed upon.  Too many big mergers, too little enforcement, goes the narrative.Sometimes a concentrated industry is noncompetitive. Consider hospitals, where the Federal Trade Commission has successfully challenged proposed mergers with convincing economic evidence that greater concentration would lead to increases in price and reduced quality of service. What's more, the evidence that supports the conclusion that markets are actually becoming more concentrated is  exceptionally weak.  The Council of Economic Advisors concluded that we have a monopoly problem because, in a handful of industries, the combined market shares of the top 50 firms have seen a modest increase over the past few decades. But a closer look shows that the council found that the combined market shares of the top 50 firms is below 50 percent in nearly all industry sectors.  The average market share for a firm in these industries is less than 1 percent. That is certainly not evidence of a monopoly problem. Economists have long rejected the \u201cantitrust by the numbers\u201d approach.  Indeed, the quiet consensus among antitrust economists in academia and within the two antitrust agencies is that mergers between competitors do not often lead to market power but do often generate significant benefits for consumers \u2014 lower prices and higher quality. Sometimes mergers harm consumers, but those instances are relatively rare. Because the economic case for a drastic change in merger policy is so weak, the new critics argue more antitrust enforcement is good for political reasons. Big companies have more political power, they say, so more antitrust can reduce this power disparity. Big companies can pay lower wages, so we should allow fewer big firms to merge to protect the working man. And big firms make more money, so using antitrust to prevent firms from becoming big will reduce income inequality too.  Whatever the merits of these various policy goals, antitrust is an exceptionally poor tool to use to achieve them. Instead of allowing consumers to decide companies\u2019 fates, courts and regulators decided them based on squishy assessments of impossible things to measure, like accumulated political power.  The result was that antitrust became a tool to prevent firms from engaging in behavior that benefited consumers in the marketplace. The antitrust agencies are full of talented economists and lawyers who use the most up-to-date and sophisticated techniques to identify mergers worthy of challenge on behalf of consumers.  Economic analysis has more often than not trumped ideological politics in antitrust policy for the past 35 years.  Let\u2019s keep it that way.Does the government need to more proactively pursue antitrust cases? Is it time to bring back trust-busting?"}
{"Headline": "A Less Frenzied Black Friday as Millennials Opt to Stay In", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIf you\u2019re in the retail business in the United States, you probably really care about these two things: millennials and Black Friday.But more and more, these two big drivers of the industry don\u2019t mix inside stores \u2014 a dynamic that is reshaping one of the country\u2019s biggest shopping days.Young people of all kinds, a coveted group for retailers because of their free-spending ways, are increasingly turning to their computers and phones to do their holiday shopping, spreading out more widely the days they open their wallets. Crowds on Friday, the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season, will tilt older than a few years ago, and also, it appears, more cautious with their money.As a result, the mix of retailers with high expectations for the day is changing quickly, skewing more toward dollar stores and discount retailers and toward essential products like food and cookware. And it is also making the day itself less and less important for the industry over all.\u201cAs big as the event or the weekend has become, it\u2019s substantially muted for the fact that all of the people are buying online,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.A decade ago, the day after Thanksgiving accounted for 6 percent of all shopping for the holiday season, according to Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm. This year, he expects shoppers to spend $27 billion on Black Friday, but that will account for only 4.3 percent of the spending this season.Over all, people are expected to spend $632 billion this holiday season, up from $607 billion last year, the company estimates. But for the first time, more than half that growth will come from online shopping, Mr. Johnson said.At the same time, there is a distinct division in who is shopping online. More than half of baby boomers surveyed said they would do none of their holiday shopping online, according to a study by CivicScience, a market research company. Nearly 40 percent of those age 18 to 34 \u2014 the group known as millennials \u2014 will do most or all of their shopping on the web, and another 35 percent said they would shop both online and in-store.Televisions, headphones and electronics, as always, are expected to be a big draw at big-box stores like Walmart and Target. Department stores that offer big discounts, like Macy\u2019s, will remain a top destination during the weekend, too. Macy\u2019s website is blanketed with its Black Friday promotions, with ads for everything from coats to Apple watches to blenders. \u201cBlack Friday Starts Now!\u201d declares a big banner at the top.But discount and dollar stores, which generally haven\u2019t been big draws on Black Friday, are also expecting strong sales. Over all, dollar stores will experience one of the biggest rises in turnout this year over last year, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adults by the data company Nielsen.\u201cWhen you think about Black Friday, you don\u2019t think about Dollar General, you think about Walmart and Target and Amazon,\u201d Mr. Dengler said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying a little bit more.\u201dDiscounters like dollar stores and so-called off-price stores like T. J. Maxx and Ross also are different in another way from rival retailers: They have little to no e-commerce presence. That has made them somewhat immune to certain industry pressures, and could give them greater incentive to entice people into stores.\u201cI think e-commerce has allowed for Black Friday to start whenever Amazon wants it to start,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, an analyst with Nomura. For the last few years, Amazon has offered Prime Day, its own annual one-day shopping bonanza. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t exist for T. J. and Ross.\u201dAnother trend working in favor of discount and dollar stores is the rising popularity of food and kitchen items, like mixers and cookware, as holiday gifts. That\u2019s in part because of new fads like \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d and \u201cFriendsmas,\u201d when, you guessed it, friends rather than family get together for a holiday meal.\u201cAs a result, food is going to be more central to the holidays than ever before,\u201d said Jordan Rost, vice president for consumer insights at Nielsen, in an email.Walmart, for example, said it would offer some specials on kitchen appliances for under $10, as well as deals on nonstick cooking sets and griddles.More generally, though, stores at the higher end of the income spectrum \u2014 like Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale\u2019s, for instance \u2014 have continued to more quietly promote their Black Friday sales.\u201cI think the low-end consumer is still looking for the best deal, but I think the higher-end consumers are looking for the best products and the best services,\u201d said Liz Dunn, the founder and chief executive of Talmage Advisors, a consumer and retailing consulting firm.\u201cI think it\u2019s been a consistent theme for many, many years,\u201d she said, \u201cthat these high-end stores don\u2019t necessarily want to participate in the promotion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: A Face-Off of Smart Speakers", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixTO get an idea of how annoying it can be to say \u201cO.K., Google\u201d multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand.O.K., Pepsi. O.K., Chipotle. O.K., Skittles. You get the picture. It\u2019s difficult to utter \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d the phrase used to control Google\u2019s new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool.That is too bad because Google\u2019s Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon\u2019s Echo.So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both Alexa and Google side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories that they shared in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home.What I found was that while Echo is currently more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google\u2019s product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years.Home\u2019s link to Google\u2019s database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase.Just give them both a pop quiz to see. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap?Amazon declined to comment.Occasionally there are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google\u2019s Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent.Most of the time, however, Google has answers when Alexa fails.Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won\u2019t offer a guess.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to presume an answer that may not be right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being really cautious with this feature.\u201dGoogle\u2019s speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone\u2019s residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on Day 1, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies.Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung\u2019s smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue.Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo.With Home, I managed to get Google\u2019s Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn\u2019t able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google\u2019s lack of support for the devices.Google said that for Home\u2019s release, it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come.One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior.For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film \u201cDrive\u201d resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album \u201c2014 Forest Hills Drive\u201d by J. Cole.For podcasts, both speakers were adequate \u2014 but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like \u201cFresh Air\u201d or \u201cRadio Lab,\u201d but it failed to play \u201cThe Sporkful,\u201d a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for.Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf.On the down side, Alexa and Home are fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment.The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino\u2019s, but otherwise can\u2019t do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby.Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants are.One task Alexa can pull off that Google can\u2019t is list showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Mr. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance.\u201cIf you verbally spit out what\u2019s on the screen, then it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said.Echo and Home are largely the same in the basic tasks they can perform. The capabilities that Home currently lacks, like movie showtimes or support for other smart home accessories, will probably show up in software updates or future partnerships.So what really distinguishes one from the other? Right now, Echo\u2019s major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you.But if you aren\u2019t big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google\u2019s speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player. Home, priced at about $130, is also cheaper than Amazon\u2019s $180 Echo.Let\u2019s just hope Google eventually gives people more ways to talk to its speaker other than \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d (The only other option is \u201cHey, Google.\u201d) It gets so tedious that you may eventually say, \u201cO.K., I\u2019m over this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weyerhaeuser Moves Out of the Woods and Into Urban Seattle", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetSEATTLE \u2014 The new headquarters of Weyerhaeuser seem an exception to other office buildings in this waterfront city. Instead of a tower on a busy street, this new corporate base is a horizontal structure with a front door that opens onto a public park.Tucked inside a group of 19th-century buildings, the steel-and-glass home of Weyerhaeuser, a wood products and timberlands company, is almost hidden by a row of trees.Weyerhaeuser, founded in 1900, moved from a forested 400-acre spread in suburban Federal Way, about 22 miles south of Seattle\u2019s central business district. Since October, the company\u2019s 700 employees have worked in the new building, which has a half-acre footprint and is in the historic Pioneer Square district, just south of Seattle\u2019s downtown area.The old building \u201cwas too big for us,\u201d said Jack Evans, a company spokesman. At the same time, he added, the company also recognized the recruitment value of an in-town headquarters. \u201cSeattle is the center of gravity,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Developed by Urban Visions, based in Seattle, the seven-story Weyerhaeuser building is a bit of an outlier in the explosive Seattle office market, which is centered on the downtown area to the north, and a second neighborhood, South Lake Union, a former light industrial area just north of downtown. Currently, at least 13 office buildings are rising in these central Seattle markets.\u201cSeattle is one of the busiest markets in the country right now,\u201d said Jake Bos, an office leasing agent who is a senior associate with Kidder Mathews, a local commercial real estate brokerage firm that is not connected to the Weyerhaeuser development.Central Seattle, in fact, is among the leading markets for new office space in the Western United States. In the first nine months of this year, 822,000 square feet of new office space were completed in central Seattle, and 4.93 million more square feet were under construction, according to Kidder Mathews research. In comparison, the financial district of San Francisco, one of the fastest-growing West Coast office markets, reported 1.07 million square feet of office space completed in the same period, and 3.77 million square feet under construction.\u201cAmazon was the catalyst of the office boom, which has been fueled by tech,\u201d Mr. Bos said.In South Lake Union, at least four new office buildings are expected to open before the end of the year; two of them are fully leased to Amazon. Separately, Vulcan Inc., a company owned by Paul G. Allen, a Microsoft founder, recently received permission to build a four-building complex for Google in the same district. Covering two city blocks, the master plan calls for housing, shopping and 607,000 square feet of office space.The interest in central Seattle is a sign of a changing culture. With natural beauty and plentiful waterways in the region, Seattle has a high hip factor and has long been a magnet for millennials. Corporations are returning to urban markets in part because of the ease of attracting younger workers and city dwellers.Mr. Evans of Weyerhaeuser said the new location was a positive for recruitment. The new neighborhood \u2014 unlike one isolated in the woods \u2014 offers amenities including a bakery, a combined bookstore-gallery and a craftsman bookbinder.Access to public transportation also played a large role in Weyerhaeuser\u2019s choice of the historic district, which is within walking distance of nearly every type of transit available in Seattle, including light rail, regional rail, streetcars and ferries. Ninety percent of the employees are transit users.Within an attractive neighborhood, the building itself is a recruitment tool, said the developer, Greg Smith, the founder and chief executive of Urban Visions. \u201cThe emphasis in this building is on wellness and health, including mental health,\u201d he said.A big attraction is the exterior deck on top of the seventh floor. This green roof has a Ping-Pong table, a fire pit, a barbecue grill and an elevated walking path circling the building. From the roof deck, employees have a postcard-worthy view of Elliott Bay, the orange cargo cranes of Seattle harbor directly ahead and the skyline of the central business district.Replacing a parking lot in Pioneer Square, a designated historic district, required the developer to clear many hurdles. The design went through several versions before it won the approval of city officials, who vetted materials, signage and even color choices. In one concession, the sides of the Weyerhaeuser building were made of hand-laid brick, to help the structure blend with its neighbors.\u201cThe design had to pay homage in the neighborhood without trying to appear to be a historic building,\u201d said Leslie Smith, the executive director of the Alliance for Pioneer Square, a nonprofit group. Ms. Smith, who is not related to Mr. Smith, the developer, said she was pleased with the result: \u201cThe building is beautifully understated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Official: Many Orchestras Are Now Charities", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 There is a stark reality increasingly facing American orchestras: They are now charities, relying more, on average, on philanthropy than on the ticket sales that used to buttress them.Orchestras (and their growing marketing departments), for example, must now spend more to sell single and group tickets \u2014 at a time when it is harder to fill seats. (Attendance declined by 10.5 percent between 2010 and 2014, the study found.) And as ensembles and their development departments work to appeal to philanthropists, many are now going beyond merely making music, offering more educational programs and community engagement initiatives. Finally, there is increasing pressure from many boards and administrators to try to curb growing costs, which can lead to labor disputes like the strike here.The question of how effectively orchestras can attract philanthropic support is increasingly the key to their survival. The report found that in 2014, an average of 43 cents of every dollar orchestras received came from contributions, while 40 cents came from ticket sales, touring, hall rentals, parking and other sources of earned income; and the remainder from investments. (These are averages, and some orchestras still bring in more revenue from ticket sales, but fund-raising is crucial to all.)\u201cIt\u2019s shifting,\u201d Jesse Rosen, the president and chief executive officer of the League of American Orchestras, said in an interview. \u201cIt has been a transactional thing: We put on concerts, you buy a ticket, and we take your money, and that keeps us going, and everything is fine. Now it is: What is the value we make in this community? Because it\u2019s now primarily philanthropic support driving the engine.\u201dMr. Rosen said that the report showed that while contributed income had dipped during the Great Recession, it has now recovered, and even exceeds its prerecession levels. And he said that fewer orchestras were now running deficits than during the recession.But the period since the recession has been unusually tumultuous. Since 2010, labor battles have led to at least 14 work stoppages at orchestras \u2014 half because of strikes, and half because of lockouts \u2014 according to the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, a players\u2019 conference of the musicians\u2019 union, the American Federation of Musicians. A handful of orchestras \u2014 in Louisville, Ky.; Honolulu; and Philadelphia \u2014 have filed for bankruptcy.And marquee orchestras have not been immune to serious pressures: The New York Philharmonic has run deficits every season since 2001-2, orchestra officials said.But others, particularly those that own valuable mixed-genre performance spaces, have shown remarkable strength. The Los Angeles Philharmonic has the Hollywood Bowl; the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Tanglewood \u2014 both robust sources of revenue.Others are working their way back. The Minnesota Orchestra, which endured a bitter 16-month lockout, returned to tour Cuba and Europe. The Louisville Orchestra is playing again with a charismatic young conductor, Teddy Abrams, but its forces have been reduced to 55 musicians from 71. And the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, which locked out its musicians twice in recent years, announced last month that it had raised $25 million to help restore positions that had been left unfilled. (In recognition of a $2.5 million gift from the Delta Air Lines Foundation, its principal tuba player will hold the Delta Air Lines Chair.)Meredith Snow, who was elected chairwoman of the musicians\u2019 conference in August, said that there was concern among players that some boards were trying to use the recent downturn as an excuse to force long-sought cuts in pay and benefits, which would ultimately damage artistic quality. She suggested many would be better off increasing their fund-raising efforts.\u201cI know their job is hard, to go out and raise money,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut you don\u2019t raise it by going around saying, \u2018This is impossible!\u2019\u201dAdministrators note that not all cities can afford the same kind of orchestra, and some ensembles that once played in industrial powerhouses now find themselves in struggling Rust Belt cities.The players, who question management\u2019s forecasts, noted that a 15 percent cut to their current base pay of $107,000 would mean that they were no longer among the 10 best-paid American orchestras. But early on, they did indicate flexibility on the pension issue. (The two sides are not speaking publicly right now, as they have been meeting with a federal mediator.)Outside Heinz Hall one recent morning, the picket line continued. Cynthia Koledo DeAlmeida, the orchestra\u2019s principal oboe, held a sign that said, \u201cI\u2019d Rather Be Making Oboe Reeds.\u201d Inside, the stage was set with empty chairs, empty music stands, and an empty podium. The hall was silent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Los Angeles Auto Show, an Industry Ponders Its Digital Future", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byWheelsLOS ANGELES \u2014 For decades, the car business has been about style, performance, image and fuel efficiency. But suddenly, the industry is in a technological and sociological upheaval that may force automobiles \u2014 and the companies that make them \u2014 to change more in the next five years than they have in the last 50.That was evident in this week\u2019s AutoMobility LA conference, an event held by the organizers of the Los Angeles Auto Show, which will continue over the next two weeks.AutoMobility is an apt name, because much of the innovation seems to involve making the car ever more like a giant smartphone on wheels. But social mobility is a factor, too, as carmakers confront the surging popularity of ride-hailing services, which means fewer people see a need to own a car, while the push toward autonomous vehicles portends a time when many cars will not need people to drive them.Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon that would enable the South Korean automaker\u2019s cars to be remotely started, and the heater or air-conditioner to be turned on, by speaking to an Amazon Echo device inside the home. It was only the latest in a series of car-related apps that Amazon has introduced through Echo and the Alexa personal assistant. Other apps include one that enables Alexa to hail Uber rides.Uber, of course, and other ride-hailing services like Lyft, are potentially big disrupters of the automakers\u2019 conventional business model of selling cars to individual consumers. And new variants are coming along, including See Jane Go, which had a booth at the conference. The company addresses a concern of many women by recruiting only female drivers and accepting only female passengers.Mark F. Fields, Ford Motor\u2019s chief executive, spoke here of the opportunities he saw in selling vehicles to the ride-sharing industry, including, eventually, ones that would drive themselves. But optimism requires the car industry to reimagine itself. Instead of the worldwide automobile industry thinking of itself as the $2.3 trillion business it is now, Mr. Fields said, it should see itself as part of the much bigger global transportation industry.BMW has its own car-sharing venture, ReachNow, which operates in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and will soon be in Brooklyn. It allows members to drive a BMW or Mini vehicle for 41 cents a minute of operation.ReachNow\u2019s chief executive, Steve Banfield, in an interview here, compared the concept to Netflix, the video service that has helped render ownership of DVDs superfluous. That might seem like a threat to BMW\u2019s business of selling cars, but Mr. Banfield described it as more of a get-acquainted marketing approach.Some ReachNow members sign up simply for extended test drives of BMW cars like the electric i3, Mr. Banfield said. And younger members who cannot afford a vehicle early in their careers can become familiar with BMW\u2019s products, making them more likely to become buyers once their salaries catch up with their tastes, he said.For people who do own cars but who would not mind some help paying for them, there are mobile-app services like Turo, which enable car owners to rent out their cars. By renting their vehicles for nine days each month, owners could probably cover their entire car payments and maybe even turn a profit, David Stewart, Turo\u2019s chief business officer, said in a presentation here.Turo is good news for automakers, Mr. Stewart said, because it might help someone wary of owning a vehicle to afford to buy one, or to move up to a more luxurious model as the rental income made it affordable.But the question of who does or does not own a car now might one day seem a quaint distinction when cars start driving themselves. And when that time comes, the companies with the biggest identity crises may be ones like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that have persuaded the public to spend big money on the thrill of taking the wheel.Detlev von Platen, executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, views it as an evolution.\u201cOur cars will always be about the driving experience because that\u2019s what we sell \u2014 experiences,\u201d Mr. von Platen said. \u201cBut we must provide options for our owners, and self-driving technologies that can be activated when desired must be considered.\u201dAnd a self-driving Porsche might be more than a robotic tram. Imagine experiencing the throttle, braking and steering inputs of a professional driver on a racetrack. That could be programmed into the car, said Oliver Blume, Porsche\u2019s chief executive.Porsche might also experiment with new types of sales or leasing options to cultivate loyalty. Mr. von Platen said the company might consider a \u201cflex lease,\u201d under which someone leasing a two-seat 718 Cayman would gain access to a Cayenne S.U.V. for seven days a year, which could be handy for when five seats are needed.The other big technology topic was electric vehicles, which all carmakers have been pursuing as a way to address concerns about the climate, as well as government-mandated rules and targets for lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency.Jaguar announced its I-Pace all-electric S.U.V., a concept car that the company said would be available in 2018.And yet the election of Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic who is widely expected to scale back automotive emission and fuel-efficiency regulations, could alter the industry\u2019s planning for environmentally friendlier cars. The possible relaxation of those regulations was an undercurrent here.And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, recently wrote to the Trump transition team urging a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d to the industry.Mr. Blume of Porsche said his company would stay on its current technology track, even if fuel-economy and emissions standards were relaxed.\u201cWhen we think of new technology, we don\u2019t concern ourselves with political changes,\u201d Mr. Blume said. \u201cWe think electrification is a technology of the future, and we have a responsibility to the environment.\u201dThat debate simply reinforces a characteristic that was fully apparent at AutoMobility LA: The automotive business is not just about moving vehicles; it\u2019s about moving targets.An article on the Automobiles page on Friday 18 about the heavy technology focus of the Los Angeles Auto Show misstated the name of the personal assistant in the Amazon Echo. It is Alexa, not Alexis. The article also gave an incorrect title for Detlev von Platen, who commented on autonomous driving technology. He is executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, not president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other White People", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported bySince the election, the West Coast has been abuzz with talk of breaking away from Donald Trump\u2019s America \u2014 a Calexit, or a linking of the nation\u2019s most populous state with Oregon, Washington and British Columbia to form a Cascadia by the sea.It\u2019s a fantasy, of course, fueled by Trump\u2019s drubbing on the West Coast, where he got less than 10 percent of the vote in some cities. But it would also be a monumental mistake for the most prosperous and progressive part of the United States to even consider abandoning a country that could be dominated by the old Confederacy.A better idea is to reach out across a yawning class divide. People in the West could listen to their fellow Americans in the old industrial heartland. And people in struggling towns could learn something from the workable policies of the left coast. Difficult as that conversation may be, it could start with some white-on-white dialogue.In Portland, Ore., often called the whitest city in America, Trump pulled barely 17 percent of the vote in the county covering most of the metro area, and even less in the city proper. In Seattle, which is nearly 70 percent white, Trump is on track to get only 8 percent of the vote \u2014 a historic low for a major party nominee. Denver, which is 63 percent white, didn\u2019t even give Trump one in five votes. And in San Francisco, with a black population of 6 percent, Trump finished in single digits.This fortress of the forward-looking is not all white, certainly; California, after all, has no ethnic majority. But for the sake of preventing a certain clueless conventional wisdom from taking hold, let\u2019s consider the other white people.This West Coast majority cares about climate change, tech and trade. They care about where their food comes and want family-friendly policies that don\u2019t knock women out of their career trajectories. They aren\u2019t afraid of raising taxes to make their cities more livable \u2014 in fact, they just raised taxes to build new infrastructure. They don\u2019t think lunatics should be able to buy assault rifles. And their issues were completely forgotten in the presidential campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re a nation state,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s lieutenant governor, after the election. \u201cIn so many ways we are America. But we\u2019re just ahead of the curve.\u201dCalifornia, which went Democratic by a nearly two-to-one margin and is one big reason Hillary Clinton will win the popular tally by well over a million votes, feels particularly left out. People in the state are beating drums to the spectral rhythms of the old Bear Flag Revolt, which briefly produced an independent California Republic in 1846.Instead, California should leverage its political clout \u2014 with almost one-in-eight members of the House hailing from the Golden State \u2014 to stop Trump\u2019s backward ideas.The biggest lesson from the West Coast is about job and wage growth. Trump wants to return to the 19th century of dirty energy. But coal\u2019s biggest enemy is cheap natural gas, not environmental regulation. No sane company wants to build a new coal-fired electrical plant.In September, 42 percent of all new jobs created in the country were in California. At the same time, Oregon posted a job creation rate that was double the national average. And earlier this year, Washington State was ranked No. 1 for combined job and wage growth.Yes, wage growth. The West Coast has consistently voted to make minimum wage a livable wage \u2014 something opposed by Republicans in the capital. But even better jobs are there for the making in infrastructure.Trump claims he\u2019ll put people to work building roads, bridges and airports, while lowering taxes on the rich. He can no more make Flint tap water into Trump wine. But there is a simple solution, adopted on Election Day throughout the West Coast: targeted tax increases. Voters approved of them because the money will be dedicated to new infrastructure \u2014 expanded and ambitious light rail systems in Seattle and Los Angeles, for example. No burger flipping there.It was absurd and unpatriotic when Texans talked of secession rather than be led by Barack Obama. Apparently, they couldn\u2019t handle all the job growth that came with his historic presidency. It\u2019s equally absurd for Californians to talk of taking their Macs and walking out after Trump\u2019s barbarians move into the White House. The United States, without the innovative West Coast, would be a yesterday country.Advertisement"}

If you use multiple services \u2014 for example, Hulu, Amazon Video and HBO \u2014 it would be added to each bill.The move in Pasadena, with a population of about 140,000, has drawn consternation from technology companies and consumers who worry that it could be copied across the state.\u201cWebsites and apps are not utilities and it defies logic to tax them like electricity, water or gas,\u201d said Noah Theran, spokesman for the Internet Association, a trade group.Public officials have argued that taxation rules need to be revised to account for changing technologies. It is unfair, some say, that people who get video through cable television are taxed while those who have shifted over to internet streaming services are not.One question officials would need to resolve is where to stop, analysts say. If streaming video is taxable, then what about music, podcasts or video games?\u201cIt opens a big Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research company.Mr. Verna said many of the streaming video tax proposals in California have bubbled up under the radar. If there is to be a larger debate, it will erupt when people start seeing their bills, he said.For now, the proposed tax is \u201cunder internal review,\u201d William Boyer, a Pasadena city spokesman, said in an email.Tyron Hampton, a council member who has opposed the tax, said that with the city\u2019s underfunded pensions, officials were right to be looking for novel ways to raise money.But the web should be off limits, he said: \u201cThe basic tenet of the internet is that the internet is supposed to be free.\u201dInterest in secession got a boost in California this month after the victory of Donald J. Trump.But another sort of rebellion occurred in Northern California long before Election Day.It was this week in 1941 that a group of miners halted traffic along Route 99 in Siskiyou County and handed out proclamations to motorists declaring the formation of Jefferson, a new state named after the author of the Declaration of Independence.With Yreka as its capital, Jefferson would include parts of both Oregon and California where resentments had simmered over the supposed neglect of politicians in the capitals of Salem and Sacramento.\u201cBonfires blazed along the main north-south highway winding through the towering Siskiyous tonight as determined mining men, with pistols in their belts, stopped motorists and distributed yellow handbills proclaiming \u2018independence\u2019 of a group of Oregon and California counties.\u201dThe agitators complained that the region was deprived of proper roads needed to transport their copper ore and timber. They vowed to barricade the highway every Thursday until their demands were met.But the uprising was to be short-lived.Five days after that, Pearl Harbor was attacked. And the mood for rebellion was eclipsed by the war effort.Now, more than seven decades later, the movement for a state of Jefferson remains a hot issue in Northern California. In 2013, the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a declaration that called for breaking away from the state.The complaints echo those of the miners in the 1940s: chiefly, a perceived lack of representation in Sacramento.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Airline Used by Amazon Wins Order to End Cargo Pilots\u2019 Strike", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday ordered striking airline cargo pilots who transport packages for Amazon and other customers to immediately resume work.About 250 pilots for the carrier, ABX Air, went on strike on Tuesday, accusing their employer of forcing them to work an excessive number of flight assignments in violation of their contract. The strike threatened to hold up shipments of Amazon orders, though the internet retailer said it had avoided delays so far.In a hearing Wednesday evening in Cincinnati, Federal District Court Judge Timothy S. Black granted ABX Air a temporary restraining order blocking the strike, according to representatives of the company and pilots\u2019 union.The Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots, started the strike because of what it called significant understaffing problems at ABX Air, which has demanded that pilots fly \u201cemergency\u201d flights to meet the demands of its cargo customers, disrupting the pilots\u2019 schedules.The pilots were picketing outside ABX headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, where DHL, one of ABX\u2019s big customers, has its North American hub.In a statement, the union said its pilots would return to work, but called on ABX to address the staffing shortages that prompted the strike. \u201cABX Air\u2019s failure to address the staffing crisis hurts our families and compromises our ability to do our jobs and meet the needs of Amazon, DHL and other customers,\u201d said Rick Ziebarth, an ABX pilot and a representative of the pilots\u2019 union.Amazon has significantly expanded the number of jets it leases from carriers like ABX over the last year to meet soaring demand from customers for speedy shipment of their orders.As part of their agreement, the carrier granted Amazon warrants to buy just under 20 percent of its stock over a five-year period.Amazon suggested that so far, the strike had not affected its customers. \u201cWe rebalanced capacity across our diverse network of carrier partners, and these adjustments ensure there are no disruptions through the busy holiday weekend,\u201d Kelly Cheeseman, an Amazon spokeswoman, said.ABX said it expected flights to resume immediately. \u201cI am pleased that the court continues to recognize the value to all parties from continuing to work out remaining differences in negotiations and through arbitration,\u201d John Starkovich, president of ABX Air, said in a statement.In a phone interview before the judge\u2019s ruling, Mr. Ziebarth, the ABX pilot and union representative, said that the scheduling demands of his employer had caused considerable strain among pilots, which could become worse as the carrier and its customers head into the peak holiday shopping season.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many birthdays, family events, anniversaries and even funerals our pilots have had to miss because of all these emergency flights,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How LinkedIn Drove a Wedge Between Microsoft and Salesforce", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Once so close they flirted with a merger, the software giants became archrivals when they realized the value of the data amassed by social networks.Supported byThis is a story of love lost after a fight over social media.Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn \u2014 hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople. When Microsoft won, Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European antimonopoly laws.But not long ago, the two software giants were tight. They even talked about merging their businesses \u2014 not once, but twice. The second round of talks hasn\u2019t previously been reported.A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce, which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model, and Microsoft, which is racing to adjust, exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter. The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.There are big personalities behind the battle. At Microsoft, the job of adjusting course has fallen to Satya Nadella, a poetry-quoting chief executive who is trying to aggressively remake the company in hot areas like the cloud business applications where Salesforce is a leader.\u201cMicrosoft decided it could go ahead and recreate the best parts of Salesforce,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures who has spoken with Mr. Nadella and other business-development executives at Microsoft.Marc Benioff, a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, is considered a self-assured visionary. But he had doubts about staying independent around the time he understood that Microsoft was getting serious about competing with his company.At the time, software used by businesses was usually sold through huge licensing deals for software that would be installed directly on company PCs. Mr. Benioff\u2019s idea was to undercut that model: He would offer the same thing over the internet, without expensive installations, and customers would pay by the month.The idea proved prescient. Though it only recently began turning a profit, Salesforce is on track to have more than $8 billion in revenue this year, representing annual growth of about 25 percent. The total market value of the company is over $50 billion. Salesforce is the largest tech employer in San Francisco, and the company will move into the city\u2019s tallest building, Salesforce Tower, when it is completed.It took Microsoft years to see the potential in what Salesforce was doing. Microsoft had its own C.R.M. product, Dynamics, but it took a back seat inside an empire that, under the former chief executive Steven A. Ballmer, was consumed with battling more prominent competitors like Apple, Google and Sony.Mr. Nadella, a longtime Microsoft executive whose career odyssey at the company included overseeing its C.R.M. product, was less combative than his predecessor. He began reaching out to leaders of many rival companies after he became chief executive in early 2014, with a special goal of improving Microsoft\u2019s standing in Silicon Valley.John W. Thompson, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who had recently become chairman of Microsoft\u2019s board, arranged a dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., for Mr. Nadella to meet other tech executives, including Mr. Benioff, the Salesforce chief said in a 2015 interview. \u201cAt the end of dinner, I really gave Satya a number of areas I thought we could work closely on,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in the interview. \u201cHe took me up on all of them.\u201dMr. Nadella and Mr. Benioff declined to be interviewed for this article.At one point, Mr. Benioff offered to buy the Dynamics business that Salesforce competed with, but Mr. Nadella turned him down, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Several people briefed on the talks said that account was accurate, though two of them said another factor was that Mr. Benioff thought Microsoft was not respectful enough of his accomplishments in building Salesforce. It was unclear whether Mr. Benioff would be happy in a subordinate role at Microsoft after building Salesforce from the ground up, and it was equally hard to imagine a successful Salesforce without him.Quickly, there were signs that Microsoft planned to get its act together in the C.R.M. business. As part of a broader shake-up, Mr. Nadella moved Dynamics under Scott Guthrie, one of Microsoft\u2019s most respected engineering leaders. This telegraphed that it intended to go after Salesforce\u2019s business.\u201cThey\u2019re serious in a way they haven\u2019t been before,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, an angel investor in Seattle and a former Microsoft manager who occasionally consults with the company.Salesforce did not sit idle. In November, it hired a former head of Dynamics, Bob Stutz, to oversee its data analytics products.Still, Microsoft and Salesforce had reasons to keep the peace. Mr. Nadella wanted Salesforce to use Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure, called Azure, to run its internet applications. A marquee customer like Salesforce could lend credibility to Azure as Microsoft tried to catch Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure provider.In the months after, Mr. Benioff met privately with Mr. Nadella to talk business. Mr. Benioff discussed using Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens augmented reality headset in a Salesforce presentation; that never panned out. And he again brought up the idea of Microsoft\u2019s acquiring Salesforce, according to several people briefed on the talks.Microsoft seemed less receptive to the idea than before, partly because of Salesforce\u2019s price tag and also because Microsoft had decided to compete more aggressively with its own product, these people said. By last February, the discussions were dead, they said.The conversations became contentious enough to place a strain on the longtime friendship between Mr. Benioff and Mr. Thompson, according to two people with knowledge of the relationship. The two men did not speak for months (although things have since thawed). That\u2019s around the time Mr. Benioff seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by Microsoft \u2014 a well-capitalized competitor, many times the size of Salesforce \u2014 according to people who discussed the issue with him.The most alluring acquisition target for both companies, though, was LinkedIn.The business social networking site has become an indispensable tool for people to advertise their employment histories and professional achievements. LinkedIn\u2019s enormous database of profiles could be coupled more tightly with C.R.M. systems to help sales representatives close deals, both companies believed. LinkedIn\u2019s data could also be used to strengthen Microsoft products such as Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s most lucrative products. And LinkedIn comes with a steady revenue stream.For the next several months, Microsoft and Salesforce privately made competing offers for LinkedIn, each sweetening their bids as the competition increased. Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a board member, wooed Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and chairman, according to the LinkedIn filing. Salesforce code-named its LinkedIn effort Project Burgundy.In mid-June, Microsoft won LinkedIn with a bid of $196 a share, all of it in cash, which provided more certainty for LinkedIn shareholders than the combination of cash and stock that Salesforce was offering. Microsoft has more than $136 billion in cash and short-term investments. Salesforce has less than $1.2 billion.\u201cWe were closer than we realized \u2014 maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it!\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cBut we were definitely over our skis!!!!\u201dAs the prospect of a LinkedIn deal began to dim for Salesforce, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, Burke Norton, sent an email to the board saying the company, as result, could contemplate a number of other acquisition targets, one of which \u2014 Demandware \u2014 it ended up buying. Other possibilities, including Adobe, Box, Tableau and Workday, remain independent, according to a presentation attached to the email, which was published on DCLeaks.com.Mr. Benioff has bought at least 10 companies in all. His most expensive purchase, at $2.8 billion, was Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. One big acquisition, the document software company Quip, took direct aim at Microsoft Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s cash cows.There is, of course, no guarantee that LinkedIn will give Microsoft the edge it seeks in data analytics, machine learning and C.R.M. software. The company has a history of fumbling big acquisitions, including its disastrous acquisition of Nokia, which ended in a $7.6 billion write-off, after which Microsoft backed away from mobile phones.While Salesforce\u2019s acquisitions and war chest are relatively small, the company highlighted in a presentation to analysts this fall that it had acquired Quip in part to land its co-founder, Bret Taylor, a former Facebook and Google executive. Analysts view Mr. Taylor as someone who can weave Salesforce\u2019s pieces into a more competitive company.In the meantime, Mr. Benioff cut a deal in May to use primarily Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, not Microsoft\u2019s. The deal was worth $400 million over four years for Amazon.Microsoft wooed away a big Salesforce customer, HP, in September to use Dynamics.\u201cGiven Microsoft\u2019s history and existing monopolies, it is sometimes necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to intervene to ensure that Microsoft is operating in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\u201d said Mr. Norton, Salesforce\u2019s chief legal officer.It\u2019s not clear if the complaints will be a problem for the deal, which has already been approved in the United States.In response to Salesforce\u2019s complaints, Microsoft has said it will bring more price competition to the market. But neither company is totally estranged from its rival, and they say they must work together. In a statement, Peggy Johnson, an executive vice president at Microsoft, said that \u201cwhile we\u2019ll continue to compete, we look forward to continuing to partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Comcast and NBCUniversal Used Minions to Fuse an Empire", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byMinions, the impish fire hydrant-shaped yellow misfits who exist to serve the world\u2019s most evil villains, would appear to be unlikely mascots for corporate synergy at Comcast, one of the world\u2019s largest media conglomerates.The animated characters made their debut in 2010 in Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d backing up the wicked mastermind Gru in his quest to steal the moon. At the time, federal regulators were reviewing Comcast\u2019s bid to take control of NBCUniversal, the owner of the NBC broadcast network, a bundle of cable television networks, a film studio and theme park business.Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, had long dreamed of building a new industry behemoth that would unite the cable company his father started in 1963 with the flashy world of world of television, news, movies and theme parks.Doing so, he believed, would allow the combined company to lead both the distribution and development of content in an era when people increasingly watched what they wanted when and how they wanted to.\u201cIt started as a concept and a guiding principle, and now it is the secret sauce,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.The story provides a template for looking at AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion takeover of Time Warner, and what might transpire on the consumer, business and regulatory fronts should that deal win approval. AT&T and Time Warner have promised to \u201clead the next wave of innovation\u201d as the worlds of media, communications and technology collide.There are broad similarities. Both deals feature a big TV distributor acquiring a big entertainment company that owns a bundle of television networks, news operations and movie studios. Comcast is the country\u2019s largest cable company, selling television, broadband and phone service to 28.3 million customers. AT&T is the country\u2019s largest television distributor after its acquisition last year of DirecTV, and counts more than 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and TV offerings.\u201cThere are some examples of real concerns about these kinds of consent decrees working, because the company that faces limitations has an arsenal of lawyers and resources to fight against those who seek to take advantage of the consent decree,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge, a Washington-based public interest group, and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department.\u201cOn the other hand, the limitations in the decree have created an opportunity for a variety of online services to grow and expand,\u201d Mr. Kimmelman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is pure market forces that enabled Netflix to explode, Sling TV to grow and companies like Amazon to invest more in online distribution.\u201dStill, AT&T is already facing a regulatory dispute over DirecTV, the satellite company it acquired in 2015. Last week, the Justice Department filed suit against DirecTV asserting that it had colluded with other cable companies in the Los Angeles region over carriage of the SportsNet LA channel, thus preventing Dodgers baseball games from being widely available.There are several differences between the AT&T proposal and the Comcast-NBCUniversal deal. For one, Comcast acquired NBCUniversal when its broadcast, movie and theme park businesses all were struggling. Most stark was NBC, which had been in last place among the four major broadcast networks for seven years in a row.AT&T, on the other hand, is buying Time Warner at what several analysts have called its peak.\u201cThere are definitely a lot of analogies,\u201d Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie Research, said about the two deals. \u201cBut the AT&T-Time Warner deal is as much about the future, with mobility and targeting millennials, as it is about content and distribution coming together.\u201dThat\u2019s a significant contrast to Comcast, which was led by Mr. Roberts and Stephen B. Burke, Comcast\u2019s chief operating officer who went on to become the chief executive of NBCUniversal after the deal. Both men are big believers in collaboration and have a deep understanding of the distribution and the content sides of the media industry.Mr. Burke, the son of a television executive, worked at Disney for more than a decade before joining Comcast, where he ran the company\u2019s cable operations. Mr. Burke\u2019s closest friends and family had questioned his decision to join Comcast in 1998, when it was considered a relatively small, regional cable company. But in discussing the job with Mr. Roberts, the men had agreed on a grand vision: First expand Comcast\u2019s cable footprint, then make a bold move into the content business.Over the years, Comcast famously tried to get into the entertainment business, including with an unsuccessful hostile takeover attempt of the Walt Disney Company in 2004.Immediately after Comcast took control of NBCUniversal, Mr. Burke installed a new leadership team and started working to create a culture where employees would be rewarded for collaboration.Comcast executives say the takeover, which occurred in two steps and was valued at about $30 billion, has benefited both sides of the company. Mr. Burke checked off the successes during a recent conference call: At NBCUniversal, operating cash flow has doubled in the five and a half years since Comcast took control of the company; NBC has started the television season in first place for the fourth season in a row; the film studio has delivered two record years of profits; and the theme park business has quadrupled its cash flow.At Comcast\u2019s cable operations, the company\u2019s third-quarter results for its video business were the best in 10 years, and earnings for its broadband business were the best in seven years.While impressive, some analysts questioned whether they were the result of the combination.Comcast executives would beg to differ, pointing to the results of Project Symphony, a strategy that Mr. Burke created soon after the Comcast-NBCUniversal deal closed to get the company\u2019s units working together. The plan entailed companywide promotion of major projects like the Olympic Games, Jimmy Fallon\u2019s late-night talk show, new cable technologies and the bright-yellow Minions, the product of Universal Pictures\u2019 Illumination Entertainment, which is led by Chris Meledandri.\u201cDespicable Me 2\u201d was identified as a top Project Symphony priority in advance of its opening in 2013. The film received special promotion across Comcast\u2019s businesses and grossed $970 million worldwide, a nearly 80 percent increase from the first film in the franchise.For Comcast, the Minions have become the company\u2019s Mickey Mouse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Fantastic Beasts\u2019 Is a Hit for Warner Bros.", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling pulled off an exceptionally difficult magic trick over the weekend. Not only did they bring the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film franchise back to life, they also did it without Harry Potter.At the weekend\u2019s start, it was unclear how Harry Potter fans would react to \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d which Ms. Rowling (writing her first screenplay) based on her 2001 creature compendium of the same name \u2014 one of Harry Potter\u2019s textbooks, as the mythology goes. But \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d does not feature any of the same central characters, and it takes place in 1926 New York instead of present-day Britain.\u201cThat speaks volumes about the future of this franchise \u2014 about reaching a new generation of fans,\u201d Sue Kroll, Warner\u2019s president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said by phone on Sunday morning.\u201cWe knew we had a lot to live up to with this movie,\u201d continued Ms. Kroll, fresh off a plane from China, where \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d will roll out in the days ahead. \u201cPeople have enormously warm memories of those earlier Harry Potter movies. So we are very, very happy with the way that audiences responded to this completely fresh and original story. We are now set up beautifully for a very long run.\u201d\u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d couldn\u2019t match the heights of a B-list comic book character?Ms. Rowling\u2019s new wizards and witches also faced inevitable comparisons with the eight Harry Potter movies that Warner released between 2001 and 2011. The lowest opening among those films \u2014 each adapted from a smash-hit novel \u2014 was for \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d which collected about $90 million (after adjusting for inflation) over its first three days in North American theaters.Part of Warner\u2019s goal with \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d was to reposition Ms. Rowling\u2019s wizarding world as a limitless movie universe. Ms. Kroll\u2019s team introduced the first trailer for the new film last December. Five more trailers and featurettes followed. Marketing also included extensive partnerships with Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Google, Amazon and China\u2019s Weibo.It was a delicate line to walk: Warner used snippets of music from the original Harry Potter movies and invoked the boy wizard\u2019s name in certain marketing materials, but was careful not to create overt connections that did not exist in the movie \u2014 something that studios often do with franchise spinoffs, much to the displeasure of fans.Ms. Rowling\u2019s publisher, Scholastic, also expects a \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d bump. The screenplay, for instance, was published in book form on Friday. \u201cAny new story from J. K. Rowling is an event, lifting sales and interest in the backlist books,\u201d Ellie Berger, president of Scholastic Trade, said in a phone interview last week. More than 450 million copies of Ms. Rowling\u2019s books have been sold worldwide.The \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d screenplay, Ms. Berger said, should deliver \u201cstrong, sustained\u201d sales. \u201cWe know there is just tremendous interest,\u201d she added.Three other movies arrived in wide release at domestic theaters over the weekend, and each was trampled.Also bombing was \u201cBleed for This\u201d (Open Road), a boxing drama starring Miles Teller that collected just $2.4 million. Open Road paid a reported $4 million for distribution rights. Faring slightly better was \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen\u201d (STX), a teenage comedic drama starring Hailee Steinfeld and produced by James L. Brooks on a slim budget of $9 million. It arrived to $4.8 million in ticket sales.Advertisement"}

Such brinkmanship will serve the acquirer well. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are ahead of Oracle in developing cloud-based services and infrastructure for clients.

{"Headline": "Why Netflix Lets Movie Lovers Down, and What to Do About It", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byStreamingAlmost half a century ago, if you had enough disposable income and a certain amount of technical agility, you could have your own YouTube channel. Sort of. You could share your videos with friends who came over to your place to watch them, or you lend them to pals who had hardware similar to yours.The Betamax format compelled a micro approach: early cassettes could record only an hour\u2019s worth of material. Once the Sony rival JVC introduced the VHS format, which could record two hours on a single cassette, and subsequent refinements yielded variable recording speeds, the idea of Hollywood movies on home video became a practical reality.Movies on home video created a new and highly lucrative revenue stream for Hollywood. But as I learned in the mid-1980s when I worked at the consumer electronics magazine Video Review, as much money as home video made, the movie industry always hated it. The idea of consumers actually owning motion pictures was anathema to them. This never changed; as the DVD format took off in the 1990s, I remember one conversation with an insider, who said, \u201cHollywood can\u2019t wait to stop making little aluminum discs.\u201d Nobody, in my experience, would ever speak of this on the record. Indeed, beating the bushes to even get a home video executive to do so now, I came up with nothing.Which brings us to movies on streaming video, which this new column will be addressing regularly in Arts & Leisure and online. By streaming I mean theoretically unlimited access to movies, in the form of digital files viewable on a wide variety of personal devices, from a home-theater projection system to a phone, accessible to consumers via an ever-growing number of \u00e0 la carte services. Even if you buy titles for permanent use, as several services offer, they\u2019re not physical things that you have in your home; you can\u2019t really lend them out. (Yes, many services allow multiple household members to log in, but it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re going to extend that privilege to a random acquaintance.)This started a still-continuing conversation on and off the amorphous entity known as Film Twitter, yielding observations like \u201cThe film selection on Netflix is much worse than your average Blockbuster. It\u2019s like a gas station DVD collection.\u201dThe service has 47 million subscribers in the United States, and its movie library is affected not only by the limitations of particular licensing deals, which means that the number of titles is constantly contracting and expanding, but also by what subscribers actually watch. To use the contemporary buzzword \u201ccurated,\u201d Netflix would argue that it does indeed take a curatorial approach to movies, but one that\u2019s appropriate to a consumer product rather than a museum. It does not see its mission as a conservational one. And the hard truth about the future of streaming services is that even those with the loftiest stated ambitions will be obliged to balance those ambitions against market demand.Because of Netflix\u2019s interface, its jam-packed welcome menu, and the sheer amount of material that turns up in browsing \u2014 not to mention what Mr. Seitz terms its cultural dominance \u2014 a lot of users have the impression that the service is one-stop entertainment shopping that has everything. That\u2019s simply not true. And Netflix doesn\u2019t aspire, or pretend, to have everything, either.One of the more potentially head-spinning features of streaming video is that this state of affairs could change almost overnight. I won\u2019t ask for any credit should some eager Netflix programming exec put together a \u201cDeeper Into \u2018Stranger Things\u2019\u201d movie package.Advertisement"}

Necessary business-model experimentation, however, works best away from the public markets.The primary reason for the merger\u2019s collapse is instructive. Banks pulled their financing commitments after Gannett turned in weaker results than expected. Investors, too, see little promise in these embattled newspaper empires. Media companies like Gannett, Tronc, The New York Times Company, News Corporation and Lee Enterprises all trade at less than seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.There\u2019s little in the way of good news. Magna, a research firm, forecasts that newspaper advertising revenue in the United States will fall 11 percent from a year ago, to about $13 billion. That\u2019s 20 percent of the sum generated back before internet companies like Craigslist and Alphabet\u2019s Google started devouring market share.Getting readers to buy online subscriptions is helping, but not enough. The Wall Street Journal, one of the strongest in digital publishing, is offering a fresh round of newsroom buyouts and considering closing sections of the paper after falling behind budget by 30 percent, according to a report in Politico.Success will require even more radical ideas. That could mean embracing some combination of what Buzzfeed and Business Insider have made work so far: combining populist headlines, slide shows, video clips, aggregated news stories and serious-minded original journalism.Since acquiring The Washington Post three years ago for $250 million and pulling its finances out of the public eye, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has done something similar in a bid to expand paying readership across the world. Many American newspapers would benefit from a steward willing to sacrifice short-term profit for a longer-term vision.That would herald a return to a bygone era where families like the Chandlers and Bancrofts owned America\u2019s periodicals. It might invite the sort of unseemly situation occurring with the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who bought The Las Vegas Review-Journal.At this point, however, it\u2019s a chance that many ailing publications probably need to take.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s election as the next president risks turning an era of mega-mergers into one of deal breakups by command.Mr. Trump, a self-described deal maker, has already railed against AT&T\u2019s planned $85 billion merger with Time Warner, wants to rip apart the merger of Comcast and NBCUniversal and may have a beef with large banks. Corporate chieftains may have to delay their imperial ambitions.The next commander-in-chief\u2019s campaign rhetoric may, of course, be just that; his apparent lack of ideology makes it impossible to divine. And much of his ire was focused on the media, whose coverage he both craved and loathed. For example, he described Time Warner, the owner of CNN, and its plans with AT&T as a \u201cpower structure\u201d rigged against him and voters and promised that his administration would not approve the deal \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThe nation\u2019s big banks also do not get much Trump love. He aims both to get rid of the changes introduced in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and to reintroduce Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that kept commercial and investment banks apart. His transition website states: \u201cThe big banks got bigger while community financial institutions have disappeared at a rate of one per day.\u201dHe is not the only one who says the current pace of corporate tie-ups should be stopped. Higher prices and fears about many assets in various industries being owned by just a handful of companies fed not only Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign but also that of Senator Bernie Sanders.The biggest sign of whether Mr. Trump\u2019s intent will turn to action will come when he anoints the new heads of the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. All three play roles in reviewing deals. The litigious Mr. Trump could nominate aggressive regulators who are not afraid of bringing anticompetitive lawsuits or being challenged in courts by companies seeking to merge.He may not stop at denying or reversing big deals, either. Mr. Trump singled out the e-commerce retailer Amazon as having a \u201chuge antitrust problem.\u201d The company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Washington Post, which has been highly critical of the president-elect.President Obama\u2019s merger reviewers have hardly been slouches. They are challenging Anthem\u2019s purchase of Cigna and Aetna\u2019s bid for Humana. If Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign remarks are any indication, his picks could be even bigger deal slayers.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s my secret: Every day I anticipate things will go horribly wrong, and when they don\u2019t I am surprised, grateful and a little bit elated. For example, today I don\u2019t have a brain tumor! My children can be obnoxious, but they\u2019re not (as far as I know) plotting ways to trigger my life insurance policy! There\u2019s always tomorrow, of course, but right now things look good. I\u2019m the Queen of Low Expectations, and proud of it.Many of us seem to want much, much more, and the distance between reality and our expectations is making us miserable. So we live in a state of perpetual disappointment, ping-ponging between wild self-blame (\u201cEveryone loves being home with their infant, except me!\u201d) and virulent finger-pointing (\u201cIf my parents just gave me a million for my emu farm, I wouldn\u2019t be living in their basement\u201d).

And I have to say \u2014 and this is just a guess \u2014 there are probably not a lot of these books published in Somalia. Worrying about happiness is a luxury.Lisa Sugar, the founder of the pop-culture/shopping site PopSugar, has a decidedly different approach to happiness: Become Lisa Sugar.She is particularly endearing because she admits to doing such stupid stuff. Selling all her textbooks the first semester of college so that she could fund the little extras, and ignoring plummeting grades? Yes. Shoplifting as a teenager, until her mother busted her, because she always had expensive tastes? Yup. Getting friends to buy product for her \u201cmultilevel marketing business,\u201d while covering the cost of the product herself so that she could look like a hotshot recruiter? Well, sure. Greutman was 40K in debt with no end in sight, when she had a miscarriage. That gave her pause. She already had a child, and she realized if she wanted a bigger family she had to pay for it.

{"Headline": "More Retailers Are Choosing to Close on Thanksgiving Day", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byAfter spending several years rushing to open their doors on Thanksgiving Day, retailers have been hit with a dose of reality: It may not be worth it.Office Depot, Mall of America and the electronics store HHGregg have all announced they will be closed on Thanksgiving. Other retailers like Sears will open fewer stores, and of the locations that do open, many will have shorter hours.The companies give different reasons for the shift \u2014 employees should be able to spend time with family, for one \u2014 but the overriding message is clear: For some retailers, opening on Thanksgiving is too much of a headache.\u201cThose who have opened on Thanksgiving Day have come to recognize that you don\u2019t need to open that early to drive the kind of sales you need,\u201d said Wendy Liebmann, the chief executive of the consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail.The decision to remain closed is the latest evolution in the retail industry\u2019s scramble to figure out how to compete in an increasingly complicated holiday shopping season, which seems to start earlier every year.The day after Thanksgiving, often called Black Friday, traditionally indicated the beginning of the annual promotional frenzy, but that idea became quaint in recent years. In the post-recession age of Amazon, people want the deals they have grown accustomed to finding, especially online, whenever they want them, and the season began expanding.\u201cConsumers now know that they don\u2019t have to line up at five o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d said Joel Bines, a co-head of the retail arm of AlixPartners, an advisory firm.That pressure to cut prices deeper and earlier drove many more retailers to begin opening on Thanksgiving about five years ago. And many are still staying open this year, including traditional department stores like Kohl\u2019s and J. C. Penney. Macy\u2019s, the country\u2019s largest department store, will be open even in shopping centers that will be closed, like Mall of America.Opening on Thanksgiving makes sense for these and other retailers that rely heavily on promotions. Stores like Walmart and Target, which will both open this year, still offer the kinds of door-buster sales on televisions and electronics that rally customers to line up early, even in the cold, Mr. Bines said.\u201cThat is one of the reasons why we took the initiative of giving our associates Thanksgiving off, because we have seen that activity go down significantly on that day over the last couple of years,\u201d Robert Riesbeck, HHGregg\u2019s chief executive, told analysts during a recent conference call.Part of the challenge for retailers is figuring out whether Thanksgiving generates more overall sales, or just takes shoppers, and therefore sales, away from Black Friday. About 18 percent of people who shopped on Thanksgiving did not shop the day after, yet the earlier shoppers generated about 30 percent of all sales during the two-day periods in 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis from the research firm NPD Group.Retailers who generate more sales can expect to earn a profit margin of 16 percent for the weekend, according to AlixPartners. But retailers that just take sales away from Black Friday by opening on Thanksgiving may generate only 3 percent.Retailers are now rethinking whether the potential benefits outweigh other headaches, like the negative publicity that comes with forcing employees to work on a national holiday.Initially, stores that opened on Thanksgiving tried to use the announcement as a way to show consumers that their needs were being catered to. But closing on Thanksgiving is also a way for companies to send the message that they are socially responsible, which could help endear them to the increasingly important millennial consumer.In a separate announcement in October, for example, HHGregg said that it had chosen to close because of its core \u201cfamily-first\u201d values, and that it believed employees should be at home. Office Depot, too, said that its decision to close came after weighing the \u201cbusiness and personal dynamics.\u201d A spokesman for Sears, Brian Hanover, said the company had made a similar evaluation.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion and pushback both ways,\u201d Ms. Liebmann, of WSL Strategic Retail, said.But there are also logistical issues, like keeping shelves fully stocked through Black Friday.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of things that can make it challenging to have two huge days, one right after the other,\u201d said Joel Alden, a partner in the retail practice of A. T. Kearney, a consulting firm. \u201cYou can\u2019t move inventory to the store when you have that much traffic in it.\u201dRetailers also want to use one of the busiest times of years to hook new customers with special promotions and merchandise. But making a bad impression \u2014 tired staff, poorly stocked shelves \u2014 can have the opposite effect.\u201cIf you do a lousy job over the Thanksgiving period, it may be a while before those customers come back and visit you again,\u201d Mr. Alden said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nintendo\u2019s New Console May Feed Your Nostalgia, if You Can Get One", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byWhen she heard that Nintendo was planning to reproduce its iconic Nintendo Entertainment System video game console for the holiday season, Emily Bradbury put a note on her calendar and set an alarm on her phone.She was not interested in buying it for her children. She wanted it for her husband.\u201cHe\u2019s 40 years old and grew up with a Nintendo,\u201d Ms. Bradbury said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nostalgia thing.\u201dSince its release on Nov. 11, the NES Classic Edition, a smaller version of the original console introduced to North America in 1985, has become one of the hottest gift items of the year. It has struck a chord especially among older millennials and younger members of Generation X, who may have found in it a video game system to share with their children \u2014 if they don\u2019t just keep it for themselves.It retails for $60, with one original controller, and comes preloaded with 30 classic games, including Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Tecmo Bowl.But this trip down memory lane has not been without headaches. Nintendo has been sluggish in responding to the demand, resulting in huge markups on the secondary market, including on sites like eBay, where the consoles were being resold for as much as $390. Those higher prices are sure to stand out even more on Monday, when many other brands and retailers cut prices for Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday.On the release date, most retailers, including Amazon and GameStop, sold out almost immediately. (Pre-orders had sold out over the summer.) Walmart kept a very limited supply in stock that it trickled out in online flash sales over the last two weeks. The consoles sold out within two minutes each time.Heeding her calendar warnings and alarms, Ms. Bradbury tried to order the NES online through Amazon and Walmart but could not act quickly enough. She even enlisted friends to visit nearby Target and Best Buy stores in Wichita, Kan., the closest big city to her home. But they, too, returned empty-handed.\u201cI thought it would be a bunch of us 40-something people going after it, but it won\u2019t be much of a big deal,\u201d said Ms. Bradbury, the member services director for the Kansas Press Association, a trade organization for Kansas newspapers. \u201cI was shocked.\u201dBut Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst, said he was not surprised by the intense demand or the low supply, which he considered an intentional move by Nintendo to garner attention, knowing that it could restock before the holiday shopping season was over.\u201cThe Classic is sold out for three reasons: It\u2019s nostalgic, it\u2019s cheap and Nintendo clearly didn\u2019t ship enough of them,\u201d Mr. Pachter said in an email, adding: \u201cThere is plenty of time to stock the channel. They may miss Black Friday, but they won\u2019t miss Xmas.\u201dIn a statement, Nintendo said that it was \u201cworking hard to keep up with consumer demand.\u201d\u201cThere will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year,\u201d the statement read. The company declined to comment further.Mr. Cole said buyers were pursuing the NES Classic Edition mostly for nostalgia, but he thought the console could potentially make older customers interested in future Nintendo products.\u201cThey had really lost their brand identity the past two years,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThis was the kind of thing that was perfect for bringing that back.\u201dBut such a plan will work, Mr. Cole added, only if Nintendo manages to restock before the holidays are over.\u201cIf they don\u2019t, they really miss out on an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThat demand might not carry over into 2017.\u201dJim Silver, editor of TTPM, a toy review website, says that nostalgic items have been big this year, and that retailers are recognizing that many of the children who grew up in the 1980s are starting families of their own. He noted that Stretch Armstrong figurines, and Strawberry Shortcake and Teddy Ruxpin dolls have all begun making comebacks. The NES is no different.\u201cThis is not 8-year-olds saying, \u2018I need to have Zelda,\u2019\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cThis is adults saying, \u2018These were my favorite games. I get to play them again.\u2019\u201dBut shopping for a hot holiday item, even online, is hardly simple today. And those who have managed to acquire the new NES at the retail price seem to have benefited from extensive planning, research and luck \u2014 even strategizing since July, when Nintendo announced its plans to release the NES.Michael Salazar, from Sacramento, Calif., managed to place a request to pre-order a console on July 22 through Amazon\u2019s British website. When it arrived last week, shipped directly from Edinburgh, Mr. Salazar was elated.He then used a secondary site, which tracks inventory at Target stores, to monitor whether any consoles had arrived locally. When he saw that a nearby Target had received three, he rushed there at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday to buy one as a present for his brother-in-law.Now, he is looking for a third to give as a gift.\u201cI\u2019m 38; that\u2019s my childhood,\u201d Mr. Salazar said. \u201cNintendo was always a very important piece of my life.\u201dAmanda Schluer, of Rocklin, Calif., had the foresight in July to set an alert on Amazon for one minute before the release date. Then she watched the seconds tick down.\u201cI\u2019ve sat and waited for Garth Brooks tickets the same way,\u201d Ms. Schluer said. \u201cJust wait until the second they go on sale and push the button.\u201dBy acting quickly, Ms. Schluer, 38, managed to buy a console. She and her husband even took their NES to Los Angeles to play with family over Thanksgiving.\u201cWe have a Wii, and my kids never play it,\u201d said Ms. Schluer of her two daughters, ages 6 and 10.\u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about the old retro games,\u201d Ms. Schluer added. \u201cThey are fun, they\u2019re age-appropriate, and it\u2019s something we can all play together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Suddenly, they woke to find rifles pointed at their heads.The gunmen took cash, jewelry, smartphones, fuel and even food, forcing everyone to lie facedown on the deck. Then they disappeared on speedboats into the Amazon, a waterway so vast that some in Brazil\u2019s frontier call it the river-sea.\u201cEvery riverboat captain knows they\u2019re at the mercy of these bastards,\u201d said the captain, Mr. Paiva, 41, who has been plying the rivers of Brazil\u2019s rain forests since he was a teenager. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky it wasn\u2019t worse,\u201d he added of the robbery in April, listing other attacks in which passengers had been raped, tortured or killed.In October, four masked pirates with rifles took over a fuel ship on the Solim\u00f5es River and stole more than 2,600 gallons of diesel fuel, along with the cash, watches and clothing of the crew. In September, 10 masked men stormed a passenger ship near the city of Bel\u00e9m, robbing 260 passengers at once. The attackers used one woman aboard as a human shield during the ordeal.The month before, the police released a video of men from one crew \u2014 the self-described Pirates of the Solim\u00f5es River \u2014 interrogating a rival gangster next to a dead body, putting riverbank dwellers on edge throughout the Amazon Basin.\u201cI needed the money, so I did what was best for me,\u201d Mr. Paulino, 24, told reporters.The growing alarm over piracy dovetails with rapid changes in the region. Far from an empty expanse of rain forest dotted by tiny outposts, the Brazilian Amazon has nearly 25 million people, with about two million in Manaus alone. The region\u2019s population surged 22 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to census figures \u2014 nearly double the rate of the country as a whole.But the Amazon is also one of the poorest parts of Brazil, and organized crime has spread, feeding a sense of lawlessness in the vast river basin. In remote riverbank villages, residents complain that police boats rarely venture into the waterways where many of the pirate attacks take place.The authorities say they are trying. Here in Macap\u00e1, a city of 370,000 in northern Brazil, an elite squad of camouflage-clad police officers from the Environmental Battalion regularly patrol the Amazon River for pirates, often called water rats in local parlance.\u201cJust as highwaymen prey on road travelers elsewhere in Brazil, pirates are the scourge we face here in the Amazon,\u201d said Lt. Col. Prot\u00e1sio Barriga Caldas, 47, the commander of Amap\u00e1 State\u2019s 135-member Environmental Battalion.These days, with more targets on the rivers and more criminal groups involved, riverboat operators warn that the pirates are growing even more ruthless and sophisticated.Galdino Alencar, the president of the Union of River Navigation Companies of Amazonas State, said that pirates were increasingly targeting ships carrying large cargoes for the growing population of the Amazon, including cooking gas, electronic devices, cement and dried beef. But the most coveted cargo for pirates, he said, is fuel.\u201cIt\u2019s a product they can steal and go on to sell to gold miners operating illegally in the forest,\u201d Mr. Alencar said. He added that pirates were also stepping up attacks on ships docked in large cities like Manaus, spurring calls by his organization to create a federal river police force.Colonel Caldas said the pirates usually traveled on speedboats, giving them a quickness and agility that bulkier riverboats lack. He added that they often came from impoverished urban areas or far-flung riverbank villages, and preyed on forest dwellers who rely on riverboats to purchase food, visit relatives or obtain medical care in Amazon cities.Patrolling the Amazon\u2019s colossal rivers for pirates can resemble a futile game of cat-and-mouse. On one river mission in October, police officers questioned residents of a settlement near the Port of Santana who described living in constant fear of pirates.Catching such culprits involves immense challenges.To start with, the rivers of the Amazon Basin course through a region almost the size of the contiguous United States. Ships on the main waterways can go days without seeing the police or navy boats. Pirates often know the rivers and surrounding terrain better than security forces, and can drop out of sight into far-flung villages.Police officers here in Amap\u00e1 State also complain that pirates often carry out their attacks in one state, only to dart over the border into a neighboring one with a different jurisdiction.\u201cCatching pirates is like waging war against guerrilla fighters,\u201d said Capt. L\u00facio Lima, the chief of a special operations unit of the Amap\u00e1 police force that hunts down river bandits. \u201cThey are elusive foes who make the most of their knowledge of river currents, geography and topography.\u201dStill, they said their scariest moments came when pirates in Brazil approached them on three occasions. Each time, they said, they were able to talk their way out of daunting situations.\u201cIt\u2019s the stuff of a nightmare when a crew in Ray-Bans holding huge guns approaches you on the river,\u201d Mr. Kisinski said. Recalling one episode, he said that he and Mr. Andres had calmly explained that they were traveling without valuable items, and then asked the pirates if they had any beer to relieve the stress of the situation.\u201cThat calmed them down a bit; they even started to laugh,\u201d Mr. Kisinski said. \u201cOne needs to keep a clear head when facing pirates in the Amazon.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
