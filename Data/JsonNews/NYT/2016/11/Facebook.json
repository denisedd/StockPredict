{"Headline": "How You Can Fight Donald Trump Right Now", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byOne day, Americans who were too young to have followed the 2016 campaign will look back and try to make sense of it. They will want to know how such a dangerous person could have gotten so close to the presidency \u2014 a man who spoke of abandoning our allies, admiring foreign despots, weakening constitutional rights, and serially molesting women.Those future adults may also pose a more personal question to their elders:Mommy and Daddy, what did you do in response to Donald Trump?The right response to anti-democracy is more democracy. It\u2019s also the way to defeat Trump. His paths to the presidency depend on large third-party vote shares and low turnout.Fortunately, we know a lot more about how to encourage democratic participation than even a decade ago, thanks to a flowering of research in psychology and political science. Here, then, is a how-to guide for fighting Trumpism:First, obviously, you should vote. You knew that, but many people who intend to vote become waylaid \u2014 by a traffic jam, a sick kid or a work meeting. Make a detailed plan now, about when and where you will vote.You don\u2019t need an intricate effort to influence people, though. Post your own voting plan to Facebook, and ask your friends to reply with theirs. Text or call relatives in swing states and ask about their voting plans. Do the same when you see friends.And when people tell you their plan, don\u2019t just nod and smile. Say that you expect to hear from them after they\u2019ve executed their plan. \u201cSocial pressure is mighty persuasive,\u201d says Carolyn DeWitt, president of Rock the Vote.Third, with the people you feel most comfortable, consider taking the risk of talking politics. I\u2019m well aware of how awkward the subject can be. I come from a close and politically diverse family, and we avoid politics at most gatherings.It\u2019s worth reminding undecided voters in your life about who he is: what he has said about prisoners of war and the disabled, how he has humiliated women, how he has promoted online racism and anti-Semitism. Almost everybody loves somebody who is part of a group that Donald Trump has demeaned.One week from Tuesday night, the often-depressing campaign of 2016 will be over. Before it is, take a moment to imagine how it would feel to live in a country that had voted for and was run by Donald Trump.Then go out and do your part to keep America great.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Election Day, the Hillary Clinton White Suit Effect", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayOne of the more unexpected turns in a very twisted (in all senses of the word) electoral season has been the sudden emergence of a fashion statement that should, if all goes according to plan, reach its apogee on Tuesday, Election Day.A grass-roots movement on social media has been urging women to #WearWhiteToVote in solidarity with the American suffragists, who adopted the color as one of their signatures and fought for what has now come (at least partly) to fruition: the first woman as a major party\u2019s candidate for president.\u201cI was watching the debate with a group of friends, and we all said, spontaneously, \u2018That\u2019s a gorgeous suit \u2014 I want that suit,\u2019 \u201d said Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center in Washington.Debra Katz, a founding partner of the civil rights law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks, was one of them. \u201cShe looked so powerful and smashing,\u201d Ms. Katz said of Mrs. Clinton, \u201cand there was this sense she was speaking for all of us.\u201dMs. Greenberger said she and her friends had started talking about how they should all wear white to a fund-raising dinner for the law center as a \u201csign of solidarity,\u201d and it spiraled from there.The only hitch: No one could get the original Ralph Lauren design, because it had been custom-made for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI went on the Ralph Lauren website hours ago and can\u2019t find it anywhere!\u201d wrote one unhappy Facebook poster in a private chat.Another responded: \u201cLet me know what you come up with \u2014 maybe a discount if we buy in bulk.\u201dThough a brand spokesman acknowledged \u201cthere has been a lot of interest and excitement around her look,\u201d he would not say anything more about whether there were plans to commercialize the suit. That has not, however, deterred the women determined to wear white to honor those who came before.\u201cIt started as fun and moved into having all this meaning, both historic and cultural,\u201d said Lisa J. Banks, Ms. Katz\u2019s law partner and a co-founder of their firm.She is not the only one who thinks so.Since the Democratic National Convention, \u201cwhite pantsuits\u201d have become the most-searched color of pantsuit according to data from Lyst, the global e-commerce platform that acts as a centralized shopping bag for thousands of retailers. Searches for white pantsuits are now 7 percent more prevalent than searches for black pantsuits which, before the convention, were the most-searched color. (Eighty percent of the searches originated in the United States.)Katherine Ormerod, Lyst\u2019s editorial director, said, \u201cThe pantsuit has had a massive resurgence in interest with a 460 percent uplift since January 2016. The interest in white pantsuits in particular has certainly confounded expectations \u2014 especially as we usually see a seasonal dip for white color ways across every category.\u2019\u2019The point is, the women said, that clothing is a symbol that is universally accessible, allowing anyone who can dig up a garment (\u201cOnce all I had was white puffer jacket, but that was fine,\u201d Ms. Greenberger said.) to express their commitment and connection to a story greater than their own.As a result, Tuesday may just be the beginning. Ms. Banks said she and her friends planned to find white suits to wear to the inauguration if Mrs. Clinton is elected. They are hoping that Ralph Lauren might provide some options, but if not, well, given the demand, there is little doubt someone else will.\u201cI\u2019ve never actually bought a piece of clothing specifically for an inauguration,\u201d Ms. Katz said. \u201cI went to Obama\u2019s second inauguration, but was mostly concerned with not being cold. This is a new thing.\u201dAnd then we will see if the area in front of the west side of the Capitol is a sea of white garments once again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Blames F.B.I. Director for Election Loss", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton on Saturday cast blame for her surprise election loss on the announcement by the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, days before the election that he had revived the inquiry into her use of a private email server.In her most extensive remarks since she conceded the race to Donald J. Trump early Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton told donors on a 30-minute conference call that Mr. Comey\u2019s decision to send a letter to Congress about the inquiry 11 days before Election Day had thrust the controversy back into the news and had prevented her from ending the campaign with an optimistic closing argument.\u201cThere are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, according to a donor who relayed the remarks. But, she added, \u201cour analysis is that Comey\u2019s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\u201dHer campaign said the seemingly positive outcome had only hurt it with voters who did not trust Mrs. Clinton and were receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of a \u201crigged system.\u201d In particular, white suburban women who had been on the fence were reminded of the email imbroglio and broke decidedly in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, aides said.After leading in polls in many battleground states, Mrs. Clinton told the donors on Saturday, \u201cwe dropped, and we had to keep really pushing to regain our advantage, which going into last weekend we had.\u201d\u201cWe were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cAnd we were feeling like we had to put it back together.\u201dStill, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instinct to shun any personal responsibility angered some Democrats. Several donors on the call, while deeply bitter about Mr. Comey\u2019s actions, said they believed that Mrs. Clinton and her campaign had suffered avoidable missteps that handed the election to an unacceptable opponent. They pointed to the campaign\u2019s lack of a compelling message for white working-class voters and to decisions years ago by Mrs. Clinton to use a private email address at the State Department and to accept millions of dollars for speeches to Wall Street.Hillary Clinton's campaign staff distributed an internal memo on Thursday detailing why it thought the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had played a role in Mrs. Clinton's loss.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was so confident in her victory that her aides popped open Champagne on the campaign plane early Tuesday. But that conviction, aides would later learn, was based largely on erroneous data showing that young, black and Latino voters and suburban women who had been turned off by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments but viewed Mrs. Clinton unfavorably would turn out for her in higher numbers than they ultimately did.Exit polls conducted by Edison Research found that among people who said they had decided in the final week before Election Day, 47 percent voted for Mr. Trump and 42 percent for Mrs. Clinton.As early as Wednesday morning, aides began to explain to Democrats shaken by the loss that the campaign\u2019s sophisticated data modeling had not taken into account the bombshell F.B.I. announcement.Mr. Comey\u2019s letters to Congress went against the F.B.I.\u2019s longstanding tradition of avoiding decisions that could affect elections, but he told aides that he felt he had no choice because he had already weighed in on the case so publicly. In July, he had taken the unusual step of publicly announcing that the F.B.I. would not charge Mrs. Clinton.At the time, she believed she had finally put the issue to rest. And after the final debate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, she emerged in such a strong position that she began to focus on campaigning for down-ballot Democrats and planned a campaign stop in traditionally Republican Arizona.\u201cWe felt so good about where we were,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told donors. Before Mr. Comey\u2019s first letter to Congress, she added, \u201cwe just had a real wind at our back.\u201dMr. Trump seized on the letter, telling voters in Nevada the Saturday before Election Day that \u201cthe F.B.I. has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d and that the matter \u201cwould grind government to a halt\u201d should Mrs. Clinton win the White House. The F.B.I.\u2019s examination of the new emails did not in fact reopen the investigation.Democratic pollsters attributed Mr. Trump\u2019s laser-thin victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 states that President Obama had won \u2014 largely to a drifting of college-educated suburban women to the Republican nominee at the last minute, because of the renewed focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server.\u201cWe lost with college-educated whites after leading with them all summer,\u201d a Clinton spokesman, Brian Fallon, said on Wednesday. \u201cFive more days of reminders about Comey, and they gravitated back to Trump.\u201dBefore Mrs. Clinton spoke on Saturday, her finance director, Dennis Cheng, thanked the donors on the call, each of whom had raised at least $100,000. The campaign brought in nearly $1 billion to spend heavily on data efforts, to disperse hundreds of staff members to battleground states, and to air television advertisements \u2014 only to fall short to Mr. Trump\u2019s upstart operation.Donors conceded that, ultimately, no amount of money could match Mr. Trump\u2019s crisp pitch, aimed at the economically downtrodden, to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\u201cYou can have the greatest field program, and we did \u2014 he had nothing,\u201d said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat and donor to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou can have better ads, paid for by greater funds, and we did. Unfortunately, Trump had the winning argument.\u201dOn Friday night, Mrs. Clinton thanked volunteers on a nationwide conference call. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cThese have been very, very tough days.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Doctors were unsure whether they would survive, and each spent four months or more in the neonatal intensive care unit.

{"Headline": "YouTube Agrees to Pay Royalties, Ending German Music Dispute", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 For years, YouTube users in Germany have searched for music videos on the online streaming service, only to be confronted with one of the most hated icons on the internet here: a small red TV-shaped symbol informing them they were unable to view the video.On Tuesday, the long-running dispute over royalties between YouTube and Germany\u2019s main music rights organization that set off the error message finally came to an end.Neither side published the details of the agreement.\u201cWe remained true to our position that authors should also get a fair remuneration in the digital age, despite the resistance we met,\u201d Harald Heker, GEMA\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. He added that the agreement covered future royalties, as well as those accrued over the last seven years.The dispute has played out in a series of court cases.In 2012, a Hamburg court ordered Google, YouTube\u2019s owner, to install filters to detect and stop people from watching material to which the internet conglomerate did not own the rights, or face a fine of 250,000 euros, or about $275,000.In January, however, a Munich court ruled against GEMA, which was seeking \u20ac1.6 million in damages over a selection of music that was to be compensated with 0.375 euro cents each time a song was played.Under the deal announced on Tuesday, both sides have agreed to drop all pending court cases.Germany\u2019s justice minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the agreement as a \u201cgreat step forward\u201d in attempts to hold internet providers such as Google, Facebook and Twitter accountable for the content they distribute.\u201cI think it is great that there is finally an agreement between YouTube and GEMA that effectively involves nothing more than consenting to compensate artists whose videos are shown\u201d on the platform, in keeping with German copyright law, Mr. Maas told reporters.Unlike in the United States, where copyright law protects sites like YouTube that host copyrighted material posted by users, in Germany they are considered to be digital forms of traditional companies and, as such, are equally beholden to laws that exist for publishers or music providers.Across Europe, regional authorities are considering giving newspaper and magazine publishers the right to charge Google and others when content is used on so-called news aggregation sites like Google News. The plans are under discussion and will not come into force until 2018, at the earliest.They also may lead to online video services having to pay more to music rights holders when their content is viewed online.European officials and some industry groups say the changes are required to give publishers and music labels greater control over their copyrighted material, though many American tech giants say the proposals go too far and will probably hamper innovation and investment.Mark Scott contributed reporting from RomeAdvertisement"}

Investors who snap up a stake in a start-up they spot on Indiegogo are most likely stuck with it for many years.And the process is more complex and expensive than traditional crowdfunding. It costs nothing to start a regular campaign on Indiegogo. The site takes a 5 percent cut of the funds raised. The people who donate typically get an early version product in question, plus various trinkets or karmic rewards.But for equity campaigns, creators will need to spend about $7,000 on compliance and regulatory costs, Indiegogo estimates, before a campaign is permitted to go live. The site will then take a cash fee of 7 percent on any funds raised, plus an additional 2 percent in stock. Investors will pay a $7 processing fee or 2 percent of their investment, whichever is higher.\u201cThe purpose of creativity is not to become an investment vehicle,\u201d said Justin Kazmark, a Kickstarter spokesman. \u201cWhen creative projects escape the need to generate profit, the result is a more vibrant and diverse culture.

Mr. Dilione was also charged with hindering prosecution. They were awaiting arraignment on Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court.Robert K. Boyce, the New York Police Department\u2019s chief of detectives, said investigators recovered 32 pieces of evidence from Mr. Rackover\u2019s blood-spattered apartment at 418 East 59th Street, including sheets, towels and clothing that belonged to Mr. Comunale. The men had tried to clean up the scene with bleach, Chief Boyce said.The police said Mr. Comunale was stabbed 15 times in Mr. Rackover\u2019s fourth-floor apartment on Sunday, after the three men had met in Greenwich Village on Saturday night. The police did not offer a motive for the killing, and neither suspect was cooperating with the investigation, Chief Boyce said.The three men were part of a larger group that had moved their party from the Village to Mr. Rackover\u2019s apartment early Sunday morning, and Mr. Comunale was last seen entering the building around 7 a.m., the police said. Three women had joined them there, the police added, but left before the attack occurred.After the killing, the police say, Mr. Rackover and Mr. Dilione carried Mr. Comunale\u2019s body out of the apartment, loaded it into a car and drove to Oceanport, N.J., about 50 miles away. There, in a wooded area behind a florist shop, the police say, the men dug a shallow grave and buried Mr. Comunale. Chief Boyce said gasoline found at the grave site indicated that the suspects had tried to burn Mr. Comunale\u2019s body when they buried it in a foot of dirt.Mr. Dilione is listed on his LinkedIn page as the owner of Shore Point Roofing in Long Branch, N.J., near where the police discovered Mr. Comunale\u2019s body.It was unclear how the two suspects knew each other.At the luxury apartment building in Manhattan where the police said Mr. Comunale was killed, residents said they knew Mr. Rackover as the son of Jeffrey Rackover, a well-known jeweler whose clients have included Oprah Winfrey and President-elect Donald J. Trump. Some said the jeweler had introduced the younger man as his long-lost son.Bo Dietl, a friend of Jeffrey Rackover\u2019s for 30 years, said on Thursday that the jeweler had taken on the younger man as a son about three years ago, and in the spring had allowed him to take his name. \u201cHe\u2019s devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cHis heart\u2019s broken for the family of this young man who was killed, and he feels sorry for Jimmy.\u201dMr. Dietl said that the jeweler had gone to the younger Mr. Rackover\u2019s apartment on Sunday to walk his dog and had not noticed anything wrong, and that he learned what had happened when the police arrived the next day.On Thursday, outside the Stamford home where Mr. Comunale grew up, his father, Patsy Comunale, spoke about his athletic son who \u201cwas the life of the party,\u201d loved sports and played baseball and hockey through college at Hofstra University.\u201cThis should never happen to anybody, let alone my son,\u201d he said, standing in his driveway, which was filled with cars as friends and family members came to grieve with the family.Mr. Comunale said his son had gone to New York City on Saturday night, and when he could not reach him on Sunday, he filed a missing-persons report with the Stamford Police Department.\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid,\u201d Mr. Comunale said. \u201cHe kissed you when he came into the house, and he kissed me when he left.\u201d He covered his eyes for a moment, then turned to greet a group of friends.Mr. Comunale added: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, he was universally loved by everybody. You can\u2019t find anybody to say a bad word about this kid. Unfortunately, he ran into the wrong guy at the wrong time. The wrong guys at the wrong time, because if it was just one guy he certainly could have handled himself.\u201dMr. Comunale said he did not know the men accused of killing his son.An aunt of James Rackover\u2019s, whom she knows as James Beaudoin II, instantly recognized a Facebook photo that shows James Rackover holding a puppy, which he had called to tell her.\u201cNo way,\u201d the aunt, Rachel Boyd, repeatedly said during an interview after midnight on Thursday from a hospital bed in Florida. \u201cI love him. He\u2019s not the type of person that could do this.\u201dMs. Boyd said her nephew\u2019s parents and four siblings were in Florida.

{"Headline": "The Women Who Showed Their Breast Cancer Scars", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byThe day after arranging a recent photo shoot, I got one of those emails that reporters dread. The woman who was photographed said she needed to speak with me. Could I call her? It was urgent.Uh-oh, I thought. Was she getting cold feet? Was she backing out of the story, or having second thoughts about the photos?One of the toughest challenges of being a medical reporter is persuading a patient to speak openly about a health issue. In this case, the topic was deeply personal. I was writing about women who had decided against breast reconstruction after mastectomies. They call it \u201cgoing flat,\u201d and I decided to pursue the story after seeing a video on Facebook in which two women bare their flat chests and scars after breast cancer.What was remarkable about the reporting for this story was that every woman I interviewed was surprisingly frank about living life without breasts. Each spoke openly about how the decision changed her personally and how it had affected her most intimate relationships. Not one woman asked me to withhold her name or use only her first name, which was fortunate. Although The Times in some cases will allow a person to remain anonymous to preserve medical privacy, we do our best to avoid using anonymous sources.But we needed photographs. Having seen a video featuring some of these women topless and showing their scars, I knew how powerful the images might be. But without a compelling reason, The Times typically would not publish a photo of a woman with a bare chest. And most women don\u2019t want their chests photographed, fully clothed or otherwise.I thought that I would be lucky to find one or two women to pose for us and that it would require all the cajoling skills I could muster, but every woman I approached agreed immediately. There were no preconditions set on the portraits. The photographer, B\u00e9atrice de G\u00e9a, collaborated with each woman and allowed her to set the terms of the photo.Ms. de G\u00e9a photographed six women, and five of them wanted to be photographed topless to show their scars. One woman asked to be photographed fully clothed, wearing a long-sleeved shirt that concealed her flat chest. Interestingly, she is the one woman we photographed who later changed her mind and asked that her photo not be used. (We did not use it.)And what about the woman who sent me the urgent email after the photo shoot? Her name is Rebecca Pine, and she was not calling to back out. But she was understandably apprehensive, and she wanted to make sure the images weren\u2019t going to be used to shock or sensationalize.The photographs were stunning, but they also triggered a discussion within The Times. After consulting with the standards editor, Phil Corbett, and other top editors at the paper, the consensus was that the photos were respectful to the women involved and essential to telling a complete story. Thankfully our readers seemed to agree. In close to 1,000 comments posted on the story, nearly every reader applauded the photos and the women who posed for them. A small fraction of the comments were from people who thought the photos were inappropriate.Personally, I was relieved about the outpouring of support for these women from Times readers. After the photographs were published, I checked back with them to see how they were feeling about the decision to be photographed. (None of the women had seen the photos before they were published.)In the photo that led the story, Ms. Pine stood in front of a fan that blew her curly hair away from her face. Two tattoos, a dragonfly and a flower, are visible where her breasts once were. But what is most striking about the photo is not her bare chest but the look of strength and defiance on her face.\u201cWe all have scars of one kind or another, visible or not,\u201d says Ms. Pine, 40, of Long Island, who has used photography and writing to come to terms with cancer. \u201cThis is who I am now, physically. The world needs to know that not all women have the same silhouette. Not everybody has two breasts. Some people have one. Some don\u2019t have any.\u201dSurprisingly, Ms. Pine insists that she is shy and that being photographed was difficult for her. \u201cI have always had a strong need to connect with others,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it gives people a lot of hope to see someone who has been through it all and is thriving. We all have a feeling of needing to be seen and heard, and to share our stories.\"Marianne DuQuette Cuozzo, 51, an artist from Long Island, says she was determined from the start to pose shirtless for the Times photographer: \u201cThe whole point of this is to be seen.\u201dAt the same time, Ms. Cuozzo admits she has struggled to come to terms with the new shape of her body. During the photo shoot, she helped the photographer tie black string around her arms and torso to symbolize the surgical stitches that have altered her body. She thinks the resulting photograph captures her feeling of triumph and freedom as the threads were snipped.\u201cThis is what we now look like from cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what happens. I loved my breasts. Now I\u2019m finding new parts of my body to love. I want to feel beautiful and sexy again, but it will take some time. The photos made me feel powerful. Every woman should have a photo shoot.\u201dCharlie Scheel, of Brooklyn, posed wearing only a tie. Since having a double mastectomy, the 48\u2013year-old from Brooklyn has embraced a new identity as gender-queer. Charlie now wears a shirt and tie to work, and says stripping off the shirt for the photo shoot was empowering: \u201cThis was about taking back ownership of my body, and letting go of shame. All my friends struggle with one part of their body or another. But I\u2019m O.K. with it. My body is my body. I want to empower other women to own their bodies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is \u2018Empathy\u2019 Really What the Nation Needs?", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byFirst Words\u201cEmpathy\u201d is one of Facebook\u2019s all-time favorite buzzwords. For years, Zuckerberg has hopped from conference to conference in a selection of muted hoodies and T-shirts, delivering variations on the same pitch. \u201cMore people are using Facebook to share more stuff,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cThat means that if we want, there\u2019s more out there that we can go look at and research and understand what\u2019s going on with the people around us. And I just think that leads to broader empathy, understanding \u2014 just a lot of good, core, human things that make society function better.\u201d If you think Facebook may have had a hand in tipping popular opinion toward Trump, Zuckerberg seemed to suggest at the Ritz, then something was wrong with you \u2014 something that could be fixed by spending more time on Facebook.But there is a curiously strategic underpinning to these calls for empathy, too. Empathy, after all, is not sympathy. Sympathy encourages a close affinity with other people: You feel their pain. Empathy suggests something more technical \u2014 a dispassionate approach to understanding the emotions of others. And these days, it often seems to mean understanding their pain just enough to get something out of it \u2014 to manipulate political, technological and consumerist outcomes in our own favor.A century later, the rise of social networking means our interactions are once again mediated through our relationship with objects. The theorist Marshall McLuhan once assumed this computerization of culture would lead to a rise in empathetic connection. \u201cThe aspiration of our time for wholeness, empathy and depth of awareness is a natural adjunct of electric technology,\u201d he wrote in \u201cUnderstanding Media,\u201d published in 1964; the computer promised a \u201cPentecostal condition of universal understanding and unity.\u201d But it wound up offering something else too: a convenient alternative to costly, messy interactions with human beings. What social networks like Facebook really offer is empathy in the aggregate \u2014 an illusion of having captured the mood of entire families and friend networks from a safe, neutral distance. Then they turn around and offer advertisers a read on more than a billion users at once. Buzz Andersen \u2014 a tech veteran who has worked for Apple, Tumblr and Square \u2014 told me that in Silicon Valley, \u201cempathy is basically a more altruistic-sounding way of saying \u2018market research.\u2019\u2009\u201dAnd in a marketplace, you\u2019re not trying to understand other people out of altruism or moral responsibility; you\u2019re doing it out of self-interest. In the days after the election, many commenters chafed at the idea that they ought to perform the work of empathizing with Trump\u2019s supporters. Shouldn\u2019t they \u2014 the people who elected him \u2014 try a little empathy for the lives that stand to be crushed by his policies? The market\u2019s answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d There is no movement for right-wing Americans to be more empathetic because they won. The nation has already bought what they were selling. The call for blue-staters to cultivate empathy isn\u2019t about finding instructive truths in others\u2019 worldviews; it\u2019s about understanding their motivations well enough to persuade them to vote differently.On a recent rainy day, I left my office to see empathy leveraged in yet another way. Upworthy, a purveyor of feel-good viral content, had constructed a pop-up \u201cempathy lab\u201d in a nearby park. A black curtain was pulled around a chair and a computer outfitted with software that could map the face at 500 points and analyze its emotional expressions. Participants watched a video \u2014 in my case, a short clip about a young boy with Down syndrome.Outside, a crowd watched a Jumbotron, on which squiggly lines tracked the participant\u2019s empathetic expressions against the average reaction. At the video\u2019s conclusion, an \u201cempathy score\u201d flashed on the screen. Upworthy is invested in empathy because it has found that emotionally engaging content shares well on Facebook \u2014 but also, its reps say, because it can prompt real-world action. Upworthy\u2019s business model relies mainly on the former.Shortly after I arrived, a woman emerged from behind the curtain to spontaneous applause. She had received an empathy rating of 98 \u2014 the day\u2019s high score. It was an odd image, like Facebook projected into real life: A woman lauded for sitting alone, watching a video. In the Victorian era, some critics worried that moralistic novels would channel people\u2019s sympathy into books instead of out into the world. Facebook takes it a step further, rerouting our attempts at empathetic connection back at us. When we reach out to one another, we\u2019re often just feeling ourselves.Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A 20-Something American Falls in Love With Ukraine", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the decades since the Soviet fall, Ukraine has vexed many \u2014 most of all, its own people. A vast borderland at the crossroads of Europe, it was hailed a nation reborn, only to reveal an inexorable weakness \u2014 fear of its Big Brother to the north and an inability to escape it. The country has moved forward (and backward) not by design but in tumult. Yet in the heady winter of 2014, a change seemed to arrive: People power swelled in Kiev and toppled a corrupt regime. Vladimir Putin, of course, cut the party short. After the occupation of Crimea came civil war, the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and the rise of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic \u2014 an unraveling that has led to a return to the vitriol of the Cold War.Against this backdrop comes Sophie Pinkham\u2019s \u201cBlack Square,\u201d billed as a portrait of Ukraine \u201cunder the shadow of Putin.\u201d If Kiev was at war, Pinkham writes, the battle was over \u201cEurope,\u201d which was a metaphor. \u201cEurope meant freedom, fairness and transparency. .\u2008.\u2008. It meant an escape from the past, an alternate reality in which Ukraine was never subjugated by the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union but instead became a \u2018normal\u2019 European country like Germany or France.\u201d Pinkham, who first visited Kiev in 2007, a few years out of Yale, for \u201ca workshop I\u2019d organized on health problems for women drug users,\u201d seems to have written two books: one, a memoir of her time in the \u201charm reduction\u201d world, the other, a chronicle of the recent turmoil.Not until the midpoint of this volume do readers arrive at the Ukraine of the headlines, with the protests that began in Kiev\u2019s Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Independence Square \u2014 the Black Square of the title. Until then, readers may feel what they have in their hands is an affecting expos\u00e9 of the nonprofit, do-gooder orbit. Pinkham, whose travels span seven years, offers backstage glimpses that bite: \u201cI was just another girl in a cubicle, doing the usual two years before leaving for graduate school, the standard trajectory for administrative assistants at O.S.I.\u201d \u2014 George Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute. \u201cI had the feeling that I was a mass-produced good. My row of cubicles was almost entirely female, dark-haired and petite. We all wore colorful pashmina shawls to protect us against the air-conditioning, and we got our periods at the same time.\u201dPinkham has an eye for the elegiac, and captures the grim pall of the Ukrainian hinterlands: \u201cThere were balconies without railings, windows without glass, doorways without doors.\u201d \u201cThere were a couple of lonely bus stops, and I wondered what sort of people waited at them: Were they living in huts, in the forests?\u201d Yet too often, the metaphors are left unpacked, and evocative questions unanswered.A glibness, too, can crop up. Pinkham dispenses with the natural-gas wars that have dominated Russo-Ukrainian relations in the post-Soviet era in a half-paragraph \u2014 and, within it, glosses the Holodomor, the murder of untold millions of Ukrainians during the collectivization of the 1930s. What\u2019s more, the prose occasionally suffers from an academic tilt (\u201cfolklore\u201d is \u201cemployed .\u2008.\u2008. as a signifier of its post-Soviet identity\u201d) and betrays a reliance on facile physical descriptions (subjects are \u201ccute,\u201d \u201cpretty,\u201d \u201cgorgeous,\u201d \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201cvery beautiful,\u201d \u201cangelically beautiful\u201d). The generalizations can also sweep wildly: \u201cPeople in Belgorod seemed to devote most of their energy to interior decoration and child rearing.\u201dOddly, the drama that Pinkham did not witness, the months of protest and the crackdown that followed, makes up the more vivid narrative. Writing from afar (by then, she is a graduate student in Slavic studies in New York), Pinkham captures the kinetic turmoil \u2014 the fear, violence, blood lust \u2014 made visceral by live feeds from helmet cameras and dashcam video. She does not shy from the questions that swirled in the wake of Maidan. \u201cWho were the mysterious snipers on the rooftops?\u201d she asks. Yet here as elsewhere, she settles for ambiguity: \u201cSome evidence suggested that there had been antigovernment as well as government snipers.\u201dAn annotated scholarly bibliography runs seven pages, but her best sources are Twitter, Facebook, Skype, blogs and emails, which offer a poignant immediacy to the revolution\u2019s actors. Her friend \u201cJulia Y.\u201d writes of the Maidan: \u201cAfter being there your clothes, hair and skin smell of fire, the smell you remember from childhood \u2014 just plain burning wood.\u201d Two years on, Laima, a \u201clesbian activist,\u201d says of the square, \u201cIt\u2019s like a corpse \u2014 the body is there, but the soul is gone.\u201dIn the end, Pinkham\u2019s two narratives blend into one. \u201cMany of the separatists I saw in pictures and videos looked familiar,\u201d she writes. \u201cThese were the same sullen, sunken-eyed young men I\u2019d encountered at harm reduction centers. .\u2008.\u2008. But now they had guns; now they were heroes.\u201d In such moments, she conveys a hard-earned truth: Ukraine\u2019s victims of substance abuse and civil war inhabit common ground, perhaps too much of it.Andrew Meier, the author of \u201cBlack Earth: A Journey Through Russia After the Fall,\u201d is working on a biography of Robert M.

We\u2019ll be back on Monday.For Thanksgiving this year, many Americans are anticipating turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie \u2014 and postelection combat with relatives.Every election provokes some level of stress among voters, but mental health professionals say that the polarization of this year\u2019s presidential race appeared to have amplified the tension.On Tuesday, we asked readers to tell us whether they expected their Thanksgiving gatherings to provide a stage for potential blowups as seldom-seen relatives congregate for the first time since Election Day.Several people wrote to say they planned to adhere to a no-political-talk rule. Others said they were taking a more extreme approach \u2014 avoiding Thanksgiving get-togethers altogether.For those disappointed by the presidential outcome, much of the anxiety stemmed from concerns that relatives who supported Donald J. Trump might gloat about his victory.Vince Garcia, 48, said he heard rumblings that two relatives were planning to wear Trump gear at their Thanksgiving gathering. \u201cQuite honestly I\u2019m not looking forward to it at all,\u201d he wrote in an email.Martin Johnson, a retired engineer in San Clemente, said he and his wife worried that sparks could fly during their gathering of 18 family members. About half are loyal Democrats, he said, and half dedicated Trump supporters.If things get out of hand, Mr. Johnson, 66, said he planned to tell his guests: \u201cJust put all that stuff in a shoe box and put it on a shelf. Let\u2019s just not get into that topic.\u201dDr. Wright said avoiding politics was sometimes the right approach.If the election outcome is weighing heavily on your mind, Thanksgiving can be a time to talk about it, she said. But if reconnecting with family is what\u2019s most important, it could be wise to just postpone the political talk for another time.Kathy Winter, 61, a reader in San Diego, wrote in with a reminder that Thanksgiving is intended to be a moment to count blessings and connect with family.But, she added, \u201cIf we are all mature adults, we should be able to talk politics.\u201dStill in need of a quick Thanksgiving recipe?Potato and Green Bean SoupThis is a soup to make in late summer, or autumn when the days get shorter and the green beans grow big and tough. It is ideal for those end-of-season beans, which are much better cooked well past the bright green and crisp stage that culinary professionals prize. In this soup, the beans are cooked grandmother-style, until they are quite tender and develop a deep, earthy flavor.The butter that floats on the surface of this soup is essential to the soup\u2019s texture and flavor. We recommend you use cultured butter, which has a subtle tang.

{"Headline": "Waffles and Pancakes, Then Violence, at the \u2018Goodfellas\u2019 Diner", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byCrime SceneDimitra Diamantis recited the breakfast orders from memory a month later, displaying a long-term recall of short-order meals.\u201cThe first guy was pancakes, turkey bacon, extra turkey bacon and scrambled eggs,\u201d Ms. Diamantis, 67, said last week. \u201cThe other guy had waffles, bacon, extra bacon and scrambled eggs. Both had a large orange juice.\u201dIt was Oct. 1, a Saturday morning. The two men had entered the diner in Maspeth, Queens, that Ms. Diamantis has owned for more than 30 years with her husband, Michael, and turned to the left, choosing the middle of three booths.For the Diamantises, that particular booth is a welcome source of notoriety, curiosity and business. But on that morning, the booth was where the trouble began.The couple moved to New York from Athens in 1969. They opened diners in Manhattan and settled into an apartment in Astoria, Queens. They raised a son and a daughter and, along the way, sold those diners and bought another in Maspeth in 1985.That was the Clinton Diner, a classic of space-age design \u201cemphasizing upward and outward mobility,\u201d its menu would later explain. It sat within a triangle formed by three streets, and was popular with local and long-haul truckers.Four years later, a location scout approached the Diamantises and asked if they would allow a film crew to shoot scenes in the diner for a movie with the working title \u201cWiseguy.\u201d They agreed, and the next year the film, directed by Martin Scorsese, was released under a new name: \u201cGoodfellas.\u201dTwo of the film\u2019s memorable scenes were shot there. The mobsters Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) and James Conway (Robert De Niro) wait in a booth for word that their partner in crime, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), has been \u201cmade,\u201d or inducted into a crime family. Conway steps outside to a phone booth and makes a call, and is told, \u201cHe\u2019s gone\u201d \u2014 that Tommy has been killed. In a rage, he smashes the phone and kicks over the booth (a prop, although the phone itself was borrowed from inside the diner, bearing a sticker advertising a former Diamantis restaurant).In a later scene, Conway and Hill sit in another booth, where Hill becomes convinced that Conway plans to kill him. The Diamantises\u2019 son, Nick, 41, said customers had told him that the scene is taught in film classes to show how the camera creates an unreal, shifting sensation by backing away from the table while simultaneously zooming in on the actors.Nick, who was around 15 at the time, watched the scene come together. \u201cDad was cooking,\u201d he said last week. The filmmakers wanted fresh food in front of the actors for every take. \u201cMy father cooked like 40 orders, back to back.\u201dA scene set in the winter was shot in July. \u201cThey had fake snow,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI know, because I had to clean it up.\u201dThe family met the cast.\u201cMr. De Niro, he had his own motor home and you had to make an appointment to take a picture,\u201d Ms. Diamantis said. \u201cThe other guy\u201d \u2014 Mr. Liotta, then lesser known \u2014 \u201cjust went like this,\u201d she said, showing how he put his arm around her for a photo.The film\u2019s success brought fans to the diner who mixed with the truckers. \u201cEven now, they take pictures of the restaurant,\u201d Ms. Diamantis said, reciting their questions: \u201c\u2018Where did they sit? Can you take a picture of me?\u2019\u201d\u201cGoodfellas\u201d would be the first on a long list of films, television shows and ads that have used the diner as a backdrop. So many people knew the place as the \u201cGoodfellas\u201d diner that a few years ago, the Diamantises changed its name to the Goodfellas Diner.Then, on Oct. 1, the two men showed up. They ate and balked at the $31 bill. Ms. Diamantis said she explained how the orders added up.One of the men went out to their car. The other brought the bill to the register, unpaid, and turned for the door. Mr. Diamantis, who is 83 and still cooks, followed him, as did his wife.

{"Headline": "Mets\u2019 Jeurys Familia Arrested in Domestic Violence Case", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byJeurys Familia, the Mets\u2019 All-Star closer, was arrested this week in Fort Lee, N.J., in connection with a domestic violence altercation, according to a complaint filed in the town\u2019s municipal court. Major League Baseball said it was investigating the matter.The complaint said that the police found there was probable cause that Familia, 27, one of the Mets\u2019 most important players, caused \u201cbodily injury,\u201d specifically a scratch to the chest and a bruise to the right cheek, to an unidentified person. The episode apparently took place early Monday.Familia did not respond to messages seeking comment, nor did one of his agents at ACES Baseball.The name listed on the complaint was \u201cJeurys F Mojica,\u201d similar to the \u201cJeurys Familia Mojica\u201d name on a Facebook account that appears to belong to Familia. The date of birth on the police report matched the one on his official M.L.B. statistics page.Familia, a native of the Dominican Republic, is married to Bianca Rivas, and they lived in Fort Lee with their 1-year-old son, Jeurys Jr., during the season.Familia posted a photo Monday of himself and his son on his official Instagram account. Before news of his arrest became public, Familia posted another photo Tuesday afternoon of his son and wife with a caption that read, \u201cCon mis tesoros\u201d (\u201cWith my treasures\u201d).During this past season, Familia was part of a \u201cNot a Fan\u201d campaign by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which featured local professional athletes speaking out about the issue. He was featured in a 30-second ad, which played before Mets games, and said in Spanish: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of baseball. I\u2019m a fan of the Mets. I\u2019m not a fan of domestic violence.\u201dRuth M. Glenn, the executive director of the coalition, said in a statement, \u201cThough we are troubled that yet again a prominent sports figure was arrested for domestic violence, we insist the New York Mets to remain committed in their stance against domestic violence and to adhere to the Major League Baseball\u2019s policy on domestic violence.\u201dFamilia, the Mets\u2019 top reliever, was arrested in Fort Lee, N.J., earlier this week.Familia became the Mets\u2019 closer in 2015, when he took over the role from a friend, Jenrry Mejia, who was suspended 80 games after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. Mejia ended up being suspended twice more for the same offense and is now barred from baseball. As Mejia created trouble for himself, Familia became one of the best closers in baseball.He posted 43 saves in 2015 and 51 this season. It was a standout effort that helped the Mets reach the National League wild-card game against the San Francisco Giants.In that game, Familia surrendered a three-run home run that broke a scoreless tie and ended up eliminating the Mets from the postseason. Despite that setback, Familia, who earned $4.1 million in 2016, was perceived as a pillar of the team, a solid and reliable player popular among his teammates for his consistently cheerful attitude.Now his status for the start of the 2017 season is in question because baseball, under a new domestic violence policy that was enacted last year, has been assertive in suspending players involved in such cases.Three other players have also been suspended under the policy: Chicago Cubs closer Aroldis Chapman (30 games), Atlanta third baseman Hector Olivera (82 games) and the Houston Astros minor league outfielder Danry Vasquez (indefinite suspension pending the completion of a criminal investigation). All but Chapman were arrested by the authorities and later released by their teams.In Chapman\u2019s case, he was traded by Cincinnati to the Yankees, with whom he was playing when his suspension was issued. He was later traded to the Cubs.Baseball\u2019s new policy was enacted in August 2015 in concert with the players\u2019 union in the hope of addressing the issue of domestic violence more adroitly than the N.F.L., which has drawn harsh criticism for its handling of such cases.The policy allows baseball\u2019s commissioner, Rob Manfred, to mete out punishment whether or not there is a criminal conviction. Reyes, for instance, did not go to trial.In addition, the policy requires counseling if it is recommended by an M.L.B.-appointed therapist. Though professionals consider counseling a key component of unlearning abusive behavior, Chapman said in an August interview that he was interviewed twice by a psychologist and attended one counseling session, far fewer than what is suggested by victim advocates.Billy Witz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reflections on True Friendship", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byAt a moment when technology has made cultivating relationships easier, but also shallower, one writer considers the importance of undocumented friendships.Is childhood the golden era of friendship? And can you get those relationships back? The other day, I took down from the shelf a beautiful novel by William Maxwell \u2014 \u201cSo Long, See You Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 and I realized the title alone summons the unspoken bond, the constant availability, the relentless promise that friendship is when you are 12. My great friend at that age was Mark MacDonald. In those early, rain-soaked days on Scotland\u2019s west coast, Mark was my constant companion and my secret weapon: Whatever happened at home, there would always be Mark to brighten the day and spit with style like River Phoenix did in \u201cStand by Me,\u201d via a rolled-up tongue. We would be up at the crack of dawn to wander over the fields, scan the beaches for coins, climb the hills together and sit in the graveyard comparing our plans for world domination. Mark had Crohn\u2019s disease; he was often in hospital, and we\u2019d write to each other planning our adventures for the summer. He told me I was a good writer and I told him he was a great painter, before we disappeared from each other\u2019s lives. I haven\u2019t seen him in 30 years.When I recently tried to find Mark again, he didn\u2019t appear to exist. Like the boys in Maxwell\u2019s novel, he seemed like a figment, or a fragile piece of memory that crumbles when you turn it in your hands. He wasn\u2019t to be found at the old address I had for him in the seaside town of Saltcoats. His name is a popular one on Facebook, but none of the Marks I found was the one I knew, and he wasn\u2019t on Twitter or Instagram either. None of the search engines reveal anything about Mark. I tried death certificates, fearing, as I have for a long time, that my old friend might have died. I asked my mother if any of her friends had kept in touch with the family but none had. I could remember two of his sisters\u2019 names but they didn\u2019t show up on the internet either. When I went back to Scotland recently, I drove to the square where we once lived, and I looked up at the window of my old house, remembering how I used to shine a torch from there to Mark\u2019s bedroom. Two flashes meant good night. Three flashes meant see you tomorrow.I wonder if technology has changed the meaning of friendship. My daughter is 12 and most things that happen to her are photographed. She and her friends get together and spend hours trying out poses, making videos, retouching them, setting them to music and posting them on this or that social media network. I\u2019m sure the girls are bonded in many of the traditional ways, but I also wonder if they\u2019ll ever lose sight of each other, which was always one of the possibilities of friendship, an aspect of its mystery. I think we always knew we would move on in life and that our great friendships would be a matter of memory. I don\u2019t have a single photograph of Mark MacDonald. I don\u2019t think we were ever photographed together, and that adds to the notion that our friendship was a fiction. Social media is a vehicle of self-promotion, a means of fixing an idea of yourself in the social sphere, without people actually knowing you at all. And that\u2019s a change: The thing about friendship used to be that the ideal was shared entirely by the pair of you, or sometimes by a group, yet it remained local, and that was part of its power.It\u2019s the mindfulness I miss. A pair of excellent youngsters in my wider family have over 1,000 Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d between them. They say they don\u2019t know half of them, and that some of them are \u201cfrenemies.\u201d The social network gives them the option of corralling people into \u201cclose friends\u201d or \u201cacquaintances,\u201d and, naturally, they always have the option of clicking \u201cunfriend.\u201d But are the majority of these people friends or are they just names? You can know everything that\u2019s going on in people\u2019s lives without knowing a single thing going on in their hearts. But is that friendship? I\u2019m told that empathy still flowers in the usual way, but I have my doubts. People now in their 20s have a lot of self-advertising talent, but are they, I wonder, close to the point where a bad breakup, say, or a death in the family, isn\u2019t a moment of opportunity for the protective and dignifying balms of old friendship, but simply a quiet day on social media?The times we live in are big on loyalty. Technology has driven us wild with questions of loyalty to flags, to nations, to a \u201cway of life\u201d or to brands who give out \u201cloyalty points\u201d to those who stay tight. But the only kind of loyalty that matters is to know your friends and stick with them. The relationship has nothing really to do with outside people, or with your self-image or with status updates, and perhaps our vision of friendship has been degraded by the instantaneous, relentless nature of our communications technology. Replace \u201cwatch and click\u201d with \u201clisten and feel,\u201d close the curtains and mix two drinks, download nothing, \u201cshare\u201d nothing, but lose yourself in the sort of communication that has nothing to sell.Love gets all the big headlines, but friendship is where the action is, especially if you consider that it is really a lack of friendship that makes an unhappy marriage. Fundamentally, it\u2019s the art of friendship that warms you in the various winters of your discontent, and when you\u2019re in trouble you don\u2019t want 1,000 people, but just one. \u201cFriendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain,\u201d the late Muhammad Ali is thought to have said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you learn in school. But if you haven\u2019t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven\u2019t learned anything.\u201d And that is why I miss my old friend Mark. There was something there that stood outside of achievement or romance, money or technology, religion or reputation. As I say, I was never photographed with Mark MacDonald and I never hugged him or bought him lunch either. But sometimes in a dark hour I\u2019ll look up and imagine I see him, not far distant, a living guarantee that there will always be someone in life who really knows who you are. When all the machines are off and when all the chips are down, I see his light. Three flashes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram Introduces New Features That Mimic Twitter and Snap Tools", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byNow Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, is rolling out two more new features. On Monday, the company is unveiling one feature focused on live video and one on ephemeral messaging. Both tap into a type of sharing popularized in recent years by companies like Snap Inc., which runs Snapchat, and Twitter, in its live-streaming video app Periscope.\u201cWe want Instagram to be a place where you can share all of your moments, to create a pressure-free space to do so,\u201d Kevin Weil, head of product at Instagram, said in an interview. Mr. Weil said this philosophy, and the feature choices that stem from it, would encourage people to use Instagram for more than the selected, highly polished feeds for which it is known.Instagram has steadily been introducing features to compete with Snap. This year, it unveiled a feature called Instagram Stories, which mimics a Snapchat feature called Snapchat Stories, in which people can organize their photos into a story line.Instagram\u2019s live-video feature will be released to a small test group on Monday; a wider rollout is planned for the weeks to come. The feature lets Instagram users broadcast live video to their followers through the Stories section of the app. Much as in Twitter\u2019s Periscope, friends and followers watching Instagram live videos can comment and send cartoon hearts to the broadcaster during the stream.But live Instagram videos are meant to be fleeting and cannot be saved to watch later. That gives broadcasters room to express themselves more fully, Mr. Weil said, without the added pressure of the raw video sticking around indefinitely.Instagram\u2019s other new feature, disappearing photos and videos within the company\u2019s private messaging tool, will be available to all its users. While an ephemeral live broadcast may be seen by many, disappearing messages are for the few, usually friends or family in a tighter circle than the wider audience of followers.Disappearing messages were made famous by Snapchat, which was able to draw a generation of young regular users. Snapchat rose to prominence in a post-Facebook era of social media, one in which people grew fond of the idea that their digital history did not have to follow them around the internet in perpetuity.Mr. Weil defended the company\u2019s move into ephemeral sharing and pointed to improvements and product adjustments that he said highlighted Instagram\u2019s innovation with the format.\u201cThe format is definitely something that Snapchat innovated on,\u201d Mr. Weil said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just like how hashtags started on Twitter and are used everywhere. I think this particular format is one that we will see adopted everywhere else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Media\u2019s Next Challenge: Overcoming the Threat of Fake News", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byMediatorNo doubt about it: Campaign 2016 has been a smash hit.And to the news media have gone the spoils. With Mr. Trump providing must-see TV theatrics, cable news has drawn record audiences. Newspapers have reached online readership highs that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.On Wednesday comes the reckoning.Taken together, it means another rapid depletion in the nation\u2019s ranks of traditionally trained journalists whose main mission is to root out corruption, hold the powerful accountable and sort fact from fiction for voters.It couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse moment in American public life. The internet-borne forces that are eating away at print advertising are enabling a host of faux-journalistic players to pollute the democracy with dangerously fake news items.That contraction in the reporting corps, combined with the success of disinformation this year, is making for some sleepless nights for those in Washington who will have to govern in this bifurcated, real-news-fake-news environment.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest crisis facing our democracy, the failing business model of real journalism,\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a longtime critic of fake news, told me on Saturday.Ms. McCaskill said that \u201cjournalism is partly to blame\u201d for being slow to adjust as the internet turned its business model upside down and social media opened the competitive floodgates. \u201cFake news got way out ahead of them,\u201d she said.It does not augur well for the future. Martin Baron, the Washington Post executive editor, said when we spoke last week, \u201cIf you have a society where people can\u2019t agree on basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?\u201dThe cure for fake journalism is an overwhelming dose of good journalism. And how well the news media gets through its postelection hangover will have a lot to do with how the next chapter in the American political story is told.That\u2019s why the dire financial reports from American newsrooms are so troubling. If the national reporting corps is going to be reduced even more during such an election-driven readership boom, what are things going to look like when the circus leaves town?I surveyed the higher precincts of the industry last week, and what I found wasn\u2019t entirely gloomy; there was even some cause for optimism. But there\u2019s going to be a lot of nail-biting and some bloodletting on the way to deliverance.It\u2019s pretty much taken as a given that the news audience will largely shrink next year, despite what is expected to be a compelling news environment.\u201cIs anything in 2017, politically speaking, going to be as sexy as it was in 2016? I\u2019m not going to play poker at that table,\u201d Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, told me on Friday.Still, though he\u2019s predicting a ratings fall of 30 percent or perhaps \u201cmuch more\u201d at MSNBC, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have financial pressure on my bottom line.\u201dThat\u2019s not only because MSNBC and its competitors earned tens of millions of unexpected election-related dollars this year, but also because they still draw substantial income from cable subscriber fees.Mr. Baker of The Journal said he was confident that newspapers could make the transition but acknowledged a rough interim period that will require cuts and will be even harder to navigate or survive for smaller, regional papers (a practical invitation to municipal corruption).The cause for relative optimism comes from the performance of some of the more ambitious, well-reported newspaper articles of the last year.But in this new era, subscriber numbers are more important than fly-by-night readership.\u201cIt shows people are willing to pay for great, original, deeply reported and expert journalism,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said. \u201cThat will allow great journalism to thrive.\u201dIt could be Pollyannaish to think so, but maybe this year\u2019s explosion in fake news will serve to raise the value of real news. If so, it will be great journalism that saves journalism.\u201cPeople will ultimately gravitate toward sources of information that are truly reliable, and have an allegiance to telling the truth,\u201d Mr. Baron said. \u201cPeople will pay for that because they\u2019ll realize they\u2019ll need to have that in our society.\u201dOr don\u2019t. You\u2019ll get what you pay for.Advertisement"}

At Magdalena, he has thrown that rule book out the window, reaching instead for the childhood recipes he remembers his mother sourcing from their home garden and pairing them with techniques he picked up from Jewish chefs in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv.His food is elevated, but it is also grounded in history. \u201cThis is the idea of my restaurant \u2014 to take the roots of Galilee cuisine, and bring them to the new world of cooking,\u201d he said.Over the course of a month, I traveled across northern Israel to meet a handful of young Palestinian chefs, all born in Israel with the dual languages of Arabic and Hebrew, and the dual culinary heritages of family home cooking and Israel\u2019s far-reaching global cuisine.Drawing as much from their grandmother\u2019s kitchens as they do from nose-to-tail, farm-to-table trends, these men and women are creating a new epicurean movement in Israel, one whose roots come not from the Ashkenazi Jewish shtetls of Eastern Europe or the North African kitchens of Sephardic Jewry, but from the hills and farms of ancient Palestine.The chef and owner, Omar Alelam, opened his doors last year with the goal of merging molecular gastronomy with the flavors his Syrian-born grandmother taught him growing up in Ein Mahil, an Arab village near Nazareth.\u201cArab food in the north was stuck with a stigma that it\u2019s hummus, meat and salad,\u201d Mr. Alelam told us after we worked our way through a bright, fire-roasted eggplant starter, an impossibly buttery lamb neck sous-vide for 72 hours, and a surprising cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in which tahini had been used in place of the traditional egg. \u201cI know there\u2019s more modern, innovative Palestinian food, and I wanted to be the one who brought it.\u201dMr. Alelam, big and burly, is well known to Israeli foodies after appearing on the first season of the cooking competition \u201cGame of Chefs.\u201d Arab food in Israel is modernizing, he said, because the Arab community is modernizing, its once-insular towns and villages slowly expanding toward the Jewish-majority cities that surround them.As for how to categorize his cuisine, however, Mr. Alelam had less to say. \u201cI don\u2019t involve politics with my food. It\u2019s not Palestinian or Syrian, it\u2019s modern Arab food,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem for me, trying to define it, because it\u2019s updated but still very old. I\u2019m still debating with myself how to call it.\u201dJust weeks after Mr. Alelam appeared on \u201cGame of Chefs,\u201d an Arab microbiologist stunned Israeli audiences by winning its competitor cooking program \u201cMasterChef.\u201d Nof Atamna-Ismaeel, a mother of three from the northern town of Baqa al-Gharbiya, wowed the judges in 2014 by creating what she calls \u201cmodern Arabic cuisine,\u201d leaning heavily on her Ph.D. in molecular biology to create precise dishes like a caviar of juiced tomatoes and striped red mullet fish with almond cream.Like Mr. Hanna, Ms. Atamna-Ismaeel says she was initially hesitant to push the boundaries of the Arab kitchen.\u201cIt takes guts, because food is a reflection of society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be brave to say, O.K., I\u2019m twisting the rules, but I\u2019m not erasing Arabic flavors. This food still has identity.\u201dClassifying that identity, however, is a challenge. \u201cThe historical division between Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine is so recent, you can\u2019t really draw a line between the cuisines,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say hummus is Syrian or Lebanese, and you can\u2019t say tabbouleh is Palestinian. So the Arabic cuisine I cook, I call it \u2018Food from the Levant.\u2019 \u201dIn Arabic, the Levant \u2014 the landmass that today is carved into Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories \u2014 is called A-Sham. So in December 2015, when Ms. Atamna-Ismaeel launched the first Arab food festival in Israel, A-Sham felt like the right name to choose.The four-day street celebration of Arabic cuisine took place in downtown Haifa as part of that city\u2019s annual holiday festivities. Twenty-five Israeli chefs, of both Palestinian and Jewish origins, descended on downtown Haifa to showcase their take on Levantine cuisine. A-Sham will return this year from Dec. 7 to 9, with a larger roster of chefs and more local businesses involved.Like all conversations about origin in Israel, the name created controversy. Critics accused Ms. Atamna-Ismaeel of avoiding calling it a Palestinian food festival in a bid not to offend Israelis. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape politics when talking about Arabic food. If you say \u2018Israel\u2019 or \u2018Palestine,\u2019 it\u2019s immediately political. We\u2019re not Switzerland,\u201d she said with a smile.And even among chefs confident that their cuisine falls within the Palestinian lexicon, there are vast differences in taste.Osama Dalal grew up in Acre, a 5,000-year-old port city in northern Israel, and loved to spend afternoons with his grandmother, whose house sat within the sea-battered Crusader-era walls of Acre\u2019s Old City. Her kitchen window jutted directly over the sea, which meant that for Mr. Dalal, going fishing for clams and local cigali lobsters required little more than grabbing a basket and angling his body over the waves just so.Cooking with his grandmother, Mr. Dalal says, was his version of culinary school. The 25-year-old chef and restaurateur has no formal training in the kitchen. But his Palestinian family, whose roots in Acre trace back 300 years, regularly gathered for meals made by his grandmother, and by 16 Mr. Dalal was helping her prepare them: muhammar, a Palestinian chicken dish wrapped in pastry baked with onions and sumac; kubbe, an Arabic spin on the meatball; and maqluba, in which careful layers of meat, rice and vegetables are cooked in a pot and then flipped upside down before serving.There was just one twist to everything they made, however: In true Acre tradition, meat is swapped out for seafood, so the Dalal family feasted on muhammar of wrapped sardines, kubbe balls formed from chopped grouper fish, and maqluba with thick chunks of octopus glistening among the cauliflower, eggplant and potatoes.Not only do most Israelis see Palestinian cuisine as simple street food, they also don\u2019t grasp its regional differences, Mr. Dalal said. So two years ago he opened Dalal, a Palestinian tapas joint in a postage-stamp-size space inside Acre\u2019s old Turkish bazaar, where he reworked his family\u2019s recipes as creative small plates. It was a hit, except for one glitch \u2014 the locals never showed. Ninety percent of his customers, he soon realized, were day-tripping foodies from Tel Aviv.\u201cArab chefs are changing their food, but Arab customers are still not quite going for it,\u201d Mr. Dalal admitted. \u201cIn our culture, people still prefer to eat traditional food, at home with their family.\u201d\u201cTastes develop slowly [in the Arab community],\u201d Mr. Daher told me, \u201cbut in general our food is moving in a more gourmet direction. Now in even smaller Arab villages you can find fine dining.\u201dMs. Atamna-Ismaeel calls the upgrade in Israel\u2019s Arab food a \u201crevolution,\u201d and says that in a few years, she believes it will spread beyond the country\u2019s borders.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re seeing it in Israeli-Arab areas, but soon I think Palestinians [in the West Bank and Gaza Strip] will also be influenced, and from there it will spread to different parts of the world,\u201d she told me.Asked what the movement would be called, she hesitated. \u201cIsraeli-Arab cuisine, or Palestinian-Israeli cuisine, maybe. It\u2019s political, and it\u2019s complicated,\u201d she said.We were walking through Maadanir, and she was proudly showing me the mix of dishes on offer, like Ashkenazi Jewish chopped liver, Arabic stuffed grape leaves, and that Middle Eastern dessert staple, sticky-sweet baklava doused in honey.\u201cBut complicated politics are good. The dishes here are a combination, like me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have Palestinian origins but I am also Israeli. What can I do? This is how you create complex food. It\u2019s all delicious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Triumph of Tracy Flick?", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byDispatchYou go, Tracy Flick.An openly ambitious, doggedly prepared, and hyper-accomplished female former student government president is on the verge of claiming the presidency. Or is she?Then, she was seen as the obnoxious teacher\u2019s pet madly waving her hand with the right answer, the scheming careerist and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-stuffer who would stop at nothing to win. Now, the question is whether Americans\u2019 perceptions of ambitious women have evolved enough to elect one as president.On the surface, at least, much has changed. Political scientists and pollsters have tracked the increasing acceptance of women as suited to politics, including their ability to manage the economy and national security.On the campaign trail and in debates, Mrs. Clinton has not needed to tiptoe around being the smartest girl in class. She did her homework, reeling off her facts and policy positions. She didn\u2019t tame her aggression, taunting her opponent as unprepared and unfit, and bolstered her standing in the polls after the debates.To be likable, Ms. Kimmell said, female candidates have to be prepared but not overscripted; confident but not arrogant. Women are allowed to be ambitious in the sense that they are running for office, but they need to stress that they are doing so on behalf of their constituents. \u201cIt\u2019s socially acceptable for men to display ambition, but it\u2019s not socially the norm for women,\u201d Ms. Kimmell said.Mrs. Clinton has heeded these messages in framing her campaign. Ms. Kimmell noted her frequent references to the Methodist creed as an expression of service to others: \u201cDo all the good you can, by all the means you can.\u201d Similarly, her emphasis on work she\u2019s done for children and families softens the edges of her ambition and places it in a context acceptable for women.Women are also judged more harshly than men for seeming like typical politicians, the research shows. Voters expect women to be more honest than men, and they penalize women more than men when they perceive them to be lying.\u201cWe put women on a pedestal,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as the most honest, the most pure. When that may not be the case, the fall for them is hard and far.\u201dThat explains why Donald J. Trump\u2019s open, repeated disregard for the truth \u2014 indeed, his embrace of it as savvy business practice \u2014 does not seem to damage his candidacy as much as charges of deception have alienated voters from Mrs. Clinton.\u201cThis idea that I\u2019m not going to support Clinton because she\u2019s a liar, but he lies in a different way than she lies\u201d reflects these gendered ideas of how women and men act, said Mirya R. Holman, an assistant professor of political science at Tulane University.So is the specter of Tracy Flick vanquished, or stubbornly persistent?But she thinks that confident and assertive women are still labeled bossy. \u201cYou have these negative connotations to being ambitious,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you lose some of that authority that you\u2019d otherwise have. You approach it in a softer way; you tend to think more about, \u2018How are my actions going to be perceived?\u2019\u201d Wellesley was a haven from such condemnation.In the wider world, however, the verdict is still open.Advertisement"}

He first went to Turkey, then to Yemen, according to the complaint.He appeared in federal court in Brooklyn on Monday night and remained in custody, said Nellin N. McIntosh, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York. She said no bail was set.\u201cAs alleged, the defendant was persistent in his efforts to join ISIL and support its terrorist objectives,\u201d Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney, said in a statement. Prosecutors presented no evidence that an attack in Times Square was actually planned.Mr. Naji\u2019s lawyer, Susan G. Kellman, said in an email that she was \u201cnot sure what can be said\u201d about the case.\u201cMy client has not been formally charged,\u201d she said. \u201cNot much else to say at this stage of the proceedings.\u201dProsecutors based their allegations against Mr. Naji in part on a series of recorded conversations he had both in Yemen and in the United States with an F.B.I. informer.He told the informer the best ways to join the Islamic State, according to the complaint, and described the group\u2019s desire to attack Times Square with a garbage truck, similar to the attack in Nice in July.\u201cI was saying if there is a truck, I mean a garbage truck, and one drives it there to Times Square and crushes them,\u201d he told the informer.\u201cThey want an operation in Times Square, reconnaissance group already put out a scene, the Islamic State already put up scenes of Times Square, you understand,\u201d he added. \u201cI said that was an indication for whoever is smart to know.\u201dIn another conversation that took place over Facebook while Mr. Naji was in Yemen, prosecutors said, he told the informer, \u201cI belong to Islamic State only.\u201dMr. Naji is a legal permanent resident of the United States who was born in Yemen. While there in 2015, he made several attempts to travel to ISIS-controlled territory, according to the complaint.Mr. Naji described his experience in Yemen in frequent emails to his wife, who was not named in the complaint. Several of those emails appeared to demonstrate his support for the Islamic State, and some suggested he might have succeeded in joining its ranks, according to the complaint.One email contained a video of Abu Usamah al-Maghribi, an Islamic State member, reciting portions of the Quran, and another contained quotations from Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born propagandist for Al Qaeda who was killed in Yemen in 2011.On April 15, 2015, Mr. Naji sent his wife an email that contained a picture of himself wearing a tactical vest equipped with a large knife, the lower half of his face covered by a bandanna. He posted similar photos to a Facebook page he registered under a pseudonym, prosecutors said.Six days later he sent his wife an email with the subject line \u201cfirst day on the job.\u201d It contained a video on which gunfire could be heard while men\u2019s voices said, \u201cI think we\u2019re taking fire,\u201d \u201cWhere it\u2019s coming from, I don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cStay down.\u201dHe also asked his wife to wire money to him. Over the course of several months she sent around $5,500 to a man in Yemen, whom the authorities did not name. That money eventually reached Mr. Naji.Mr. Naji returned to New York in September 2015.

{"Headline": "Your Questions About the U.S. Election, Answered", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byAbroad in AmericaThis unsavory choice is a product of many factors, but can be traced most directly to the primaries and caucuses \u2014 the state-by-state voting, early this year, in which Democrats and Republicans chose their parties\u2019 presidential nominees.This time around, Republican primary voters defied all conventional political wisdom in selecting Mr. Trump from a crowded field of candidates, including Jeb Bush, a member of one of America\u2019s dominant political clans, and Senator Ted Cruz, the Tea Party firebrand from Texas.In the Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton got a scare from her more liberal opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who performed better than she expected. But her unpopularity, even among some Democrats, is an enduring problem for her campaign: Some people who supported Mr. Sanders, who is now backing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bid for the White house, have defected from the Democrats and intend to vote for Jill Stein of the Green Party (who has no chance of winning).No matter who wins, he or she will urgently need to establish his or her popular legitimacy. After all, the purpose of an election is to find a leader the people want \u2014 not the one they deem to be the least unpopular candidate.This year that trend may be sharply reversed. As some Republican voters desert their party in disgust at Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the party is hoping to persuade them to stick with it in Congressional races. In recent weeks major Republican donors, believing Mr. Trump is doomed to lose, have started to shift funds toward \u201cdown-ballot\u201d races in a bid to retain Republican majorities in the House and the Senate.In an extraordinary development, some embattled Republican senators have even gone on the campaign trail in support of Mrs. Clinton, encouraging their supporters to split their ballots.Your second question, about the ugly tenor of this year\u2019s campaign, has many possible answers \u2014 celebrity culture, social media and popular disillusionment with politics, among others. But by far the greatest factor is Mr. Trump, whose outlandish statements have loomed large over every day of this campaign.Beyond that, I think it\u2019s simply a measure of the deep polarization of American society. For some people who hate Mrs. Clinton, it seems they would vote for virtually anyone else to keep her out of power.A bigger problem, I think, is that a growing number of Americans voters are losing confidence in major mainstream news sources and turning instead to social media, like Facebook and Twitter. One result is an echo chamber of like-minded views. This can increase the sense of political polarization, as Americans of opposing views desert the common ground where they once held their national conversation. That\u2019s the paradox of this election: Americans have never had more access to so much information about the candidates; the question is whether they believe any of it.The grueling 18-month stretch of debates and campaigning is supposed to produce a pair of battle-hardened candidates who are ready for the rigors of the world\u2019s most powerful elected position. The downside is that, with four-year presidential terms, Americans seem to be almost perpetually in election mode.And Candidates must engage in feverish fund-raising \u2014 about $2.5 billion was spent on the 2012 election, and probably much more this time. This year\u2019s exhausting race has shown that the campaign can test the public\u2019s patience \u2014 and may hurt their faith in democracy itself.Advertisement"}

There are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information.\u201cWhen I use the term \u2018attacker\u2019 I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven\u2019t given express permission to,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a hacker, a corporation or even a government.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended. We added a few of our own, based on additional interviews and news events.Encryption is just a fancy word for scrambling your data so no one can understand what it says without a key. It\u2019s useful for protecting information on your computer, but also for making sure prying eyes can\u2019t snoop on text messages and emails on your phone. But encryption is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around.\u201cYou can be sure by looking at the code that they\u2019re not doing anything weird with your data,\u201d Mr. Larson said.\u201cIn general, the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible,\u201d said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the organization that developed Signal.In May, cybercriminals used ransomware, a type of software that locks down people\u2019s data and threatens to destroy it if the attacker is not paid, to hijack hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.Also, make sure to update your software regularly, particularly your operating system. Frequently, software companies will release updates that patch bugs and vulnerabilities when they are discovered. But outdated or unauthorized copies of the software may still contain the security flaws. This is a particular problem with computers using Microsoft Windows, the most popular operating system in the world and therefore a big target for hackers.Your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket, but Mr. Larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information.Even if your data were password-protected, someone who gained access to your computer \u201cwould have access to all your files if they were unencrypted.\u201dBackups will protect your photos, documents and other data not only from a technical malfunction, but from ransomware and other malicious hacking. Just make sure to test or check your backups periodically.But making up new combinations all the time is irritating and inconvenient, tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple. That is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes. It\u2019s far better to create really strong ones for every login. And new passwords can pose security risks, because it\u2019s hard to remember complex ones, so you are tempted to write them down.That can lead to a lot of hard-to-remember passwords.As far as making passwords up goes: Don\u2019t be precious about it. Use a random word (an object near you, for example), scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks. If you\u2019re writing passwords down or using a password manager, you don\u2019t have to worry about making them memorable.When you turn on two-factor authentication, anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security: a code that is sent to your phone via text message. (Though sadly, not through Signal.)You should also set two-factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites where it\u2019s available. But email is the most important account, since many sites use email for password recovery, a fact that hackers have exploited. Once they have access to your email, they can get access to banking, social media, data backups and work accounts.And this is a good time to note that you should always find out whether the Wi-Fi network you are using is secure. Public networks \u2014 and even private networks without security keys \u2014 often are not.VPNs create an encrypted \u201ctunnel\u201d through which all of your data is sent, meaning other computers or devices on the same network as your computer can\u2019t make sense of it. The only people who have the \u201ckey\u201d in this case is your computer and the VPN provider you connect to when you turn it on. This is especially useful on public Wi-Fi networks, like at the airport or coffee shop, where you don\u2019t know who else is using the same network.This feature, available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, among other browsers, may sound secure, but pay attention to the clear warnings.On Chrome, the second paragraph of the \u201cincognito\u201d home screen spells it out for you.\u201cYou aren\u2019t invisible,\u201d it says. \u201cGoing incognito doesn\u2019t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider or the websites you visit.\u201d In reality, it simply keeps your computer from keeping a record of where you go. It doesn\u2019t stop sites from tracking and collecting data on you, and doesn\u2019t do anything to protect your online privacy or security. It does, however, keep anyone using your computer from knowing where you went.He said, however, that he was not paranoid.\u201cGoogle is built on the hacker ethic, and they have put principle above profits in some aspects,\u201d he said.But he also acknowledged that he meets \u201cpeople all the time who are extremely skeptical of any large software organization, and I think that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d There are trade-offs. Google\u2019s search results are more useful and accurate than competitors\u2019 precisely because of the ways it collects and analyzes information about its customers\u2019 searches.That way, if someone has found a way to compromise your computer, they cannot spy on you.Nicole Perlroth contributed expertise.Advertisement"}

Late Saturday or early Sunday, for instance, Hindu idols were defaced in temples in the north and south of the country, according to the police.Fifty-three people have been arrested in connection with those crimes.India expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the attacks, with Sushma Swaraj, the external affairs minister, instructing Delhi\u2019s ambassador to the country to visit the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina.The violence in Nasirnagar, whose population is about 40 percent Hindu, was set off by a Facebook post published by a Hindu youth. The post included an image of the Hindu god Shiva appearing at a Muslim holy site in the Saudi city of Mecca.Mr. Deb, a Hindu community leader, received a call on Saturday that unknown people had built a fire on the veranda of his home. \u201cThe attackers want to create a panic among Hindus,\u201d Mr. Deb said, adding that the campaigns may aim to strip Hindus of their lands.Human rights and government groups have opened investigations into last week\u2019s attacks, including allegations that leaders from the governing party helped incite a crowd that went on to overrun temples and homes in Nasirnagar.Journalists also questioned why police permission had been given to Muslim organizations to hold a rally over the Facebook post when it was clear that they were bent on violence.Nasirnagar\u2019s top administrator, who had issued permission, was transferred on Sunday, an indication of official displeasure.Mizanur Rahman, the superintendent of the police overseeing the district, said that 500 security personnel had been deployed since the violence on Oct. 30, but that they had been unable to prevent the burning of six more houses on Thursday.\u201cIt is not possible to guard each and every place in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone is smoking or has a matchbook with him, if he drops his burning cigarette, or sets fire to a bunch of dry jute sticks or a bamboo house, that could trigger a fire.\u201d He added, \u201cHow can we stop this type of incident?\u201dOn Saturday, in the northern district of Netrakona, a youth was arrested while trying to set fire to a temple, said Zaydeb Chowdhury, the superintendent of police.In Jhalakathi, a southern district, \u201cunknown miscreants\u201d destroyed Hindu idols either late Saturday or early Sunday, said Mohammad Mahe Alam, the officer in charge of Jhalakathi police station. He said that there were no witnesses, and that he suspected the attack had been motivated by a dispute over the land the temple occupies.On the same night in Sirajganj, in northern Bangladesh, \u201cunidentified miscreants\u201d broke the heads off statues of goddesses from a temple, said Basudeb Sinha, the head investigatory officer at the Sirajganj police station.Julfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

They were crowd-stirring components of a campaign to aid the nascent nation of Bangladesh, still called East Pakistan and ravaged by disasters both natural and man-made. The performances were organized by the former Beatle George Harrison and the sitar master Ravi Shankar, who enlisted top-rung musicians like Bob Dylan, Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston and another former Beatle, Ringo Starr.But Live Aid relied on innovations that far surpassed anything available in 1971. The performances were broadcast via satellite linkups to a huge international audience, in some 150 nations.Activism is now a computer mouse away. With a click, one can register approval or disapproval of a cause, send money, alert Twitter followers and forward a conscience-stabbing video to hundreds of Facebook \u201cfriends.\u201dThe ungainly word \u201cclicktivism\u201d emerged to describe this form of participation. So did an offshoot, \u201cslacktivism,\u201d a portmanteau of \u201cslacker\u201d and \u201cactivism.\u201d By definition, it is not the highest compliment. Does a mouse click constitute true involvement? As Felix Salmon, a business journalist who has examined the issue, said, \u201cIf I retweet your video, is that going to make the world a better place?\u201dThe first was a video at the heart of a campaign to (1) make people aware of the predatory Joseph Kony, whose Lord\u2019s Resistance Army in Uganda turned tens of thousands of girls into sex slaves and boys into soldiers, and (2) raise cash to assist Ugandans devastated by his terror.In the Ice Bucket Challenge, the famous and the not-so-famous poured frigid water over their heads, and posted videos of their antics. The purpose was to promote awareness of \u2014 and to encourage donations for research in \u2014 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., the incurable neurodegenerative malady often referred to as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. The campaign was astonishingly successful. In a matter of weeks, more than $200 million was raised.But, perhaps inevitably, questions arose.For one thing, to what extent was anti-Kony fervor or the challenge a mere passing fancy? A measure of faddishness has long accompanied certain causes. A few decades ago, for instance, considerable attention was focused on sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disorder affecting African-Americans, and on Tay-Sachs disease, an affliction notable among Ashkenazi Jews. Both illnesses are still with us; they just do not get nearly as much attention as they once did.In today\u2019s digital age, when Twitter hashtags come and go, the very nature of social consciousness has come under scrutiny. Raising broad awareness of an issue is surely important. But is retweeting #bringourgirlsback (to show solidarity with Boko Haram victims) or #NotOneMore (to deplore gun violence) really changing the world? The same might be said about shading one\u2019s Facebook photo in rainbow colors after terrorism at a gay nightclub in Florida or in the French tricolor after attacks in Paris. Skeptics have asked if the real motivation behind some of this is to feel good about oneself and impress one\u2019s cyberbuddies.If anything, do-good organizations are ever on the hunt for a way to duplicate the ice-bucket success. Theirs is not an easy task. \u201cNonprofits are really struggling with how to figure out what\u2019s next in the digital world,\u201d Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, told Retro Report.

In Part 2, we talked to Amy and Dawn, dear friends and co-workers from Wyoming.All of them had avoided talking about the election, knowing just how difficult the discussion would be. Until now.\u201cWe\u2019re from two different sides of the wall,\u201d Craig\u2019s father says. \u201cThis gay lifestyle and everything \u2014 I didn\u2019t grow up with it.\u201d He describes once, when he was younger, being followed by a man who was trying to pick him up. \u201cI just wanted to beat the hell out of him,\u201d he tells Craig. And then he and his friends caught the guy to do just that.\u201cI\u2019ve come a long way as far as acceptance and tolerance,\u201d he says, reflecting on that past.When the conversation turns to the Confederate flag displayed in his garage, Craig\u2019s father asks what is probably the hardest of the 19 questions: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a sexist or racist?\u201dAfter a pause, Craig answers. \u201cYeah.\u201dHe brings up the derogatory language that his father used when he was a child, which his father acknowledges was a problem and says he\u2019s working to change.\u201cAt the time I was 75/25,\u201d the father says. \u201cNow I\u2019m maybe 60/40.\u201d\u201c60/40 what?\u201d Craig asks.\u201cI guess 40 racist. And 60, you know, O.K. I feel like I\u2019m progressing with it. I feel like I\u2019m trying.\u201d\u201cThis election was different for me,\u201d Amy tells Dawn. \u201cIf, say, John Kasich won, I would be like \u2018Well, you win some you lose some.\u2019 ... I would not have been as upset as I have been, primarily because of some of the behavior that President-elect Trump has exhibited throughout the campaign.\u201d She continues:It disturbed me not only because of my son, but because of other people in the United States who I feel are somewhat marginalized. And it\u2019s so easy, in general \u2014 and it\u2019s human nature \u2014 it\u2019s easy for all of us to say \u2018that\u2019s not me and that\u2019s not going to ever affect me, and so I\u2019m going to look the other way.\u2019\u201cTrump was not my first choice for the candidacy for the presidency,\u201d Dawn says, though she is a Republican and votes Republican. She says she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by \u201cthe way he acts and the way he thinks he can do and say these things, and can get away with it and it\u2019s okay.\u201d But ultimately, she tells Amy, \u201cI had to refocus and reprioritize the reasons I wanted to vote for him. Not that I condone his behaviors, but the other issues were huge for me.\u201d She explains:I worry about our community in general. It is heavily reliant on the oil and the gas and the mining industry, my husband being included in that. For me and my family, I had to think about that. Listening to Hillary\u2019s stance on these things, wanting to put all these coal miners out of business and wanting to put all these regulations on what they\u2019re doing, it stressed me out. This is our way of life.\u201cI\u2019ve heard race more than anything throughout this whole election, throughout this whole year,\u201d Mr. Ponce Landaverde says. \u201cThis whole year is just race. I feel like there needs to be more unity in this country.\u201d He continues:Mr. Hill explained to his friend why, to him, race was a crucial factor in this election, and is a big part of why he is struggling to understand friends who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cA lot of what he has said, it\u2019s disparaging for marginalized people in this country \u2014 African-Americans, Latinos, gay people, women \u2014 it\u2019s disparaging,\u201d Mr. Hill says. \u201cTo a certain extent, voting for Donald Trump after all he said, after all he\u2019s done \u2014 you have to be somewhat comfortable with that in order to cast that vote for that man.\u201d He continues:When I look at people who voted for Donald Trump and I know they know me, that kind of hurt me, man. You had to be cool with some of the stuff that he was saying, or it didn\u2019t bother you. To me I felt like if you knew me, or knew people who were African-American or people who were Latino or people who were gay, people who were Muslim, who worship Muslim faith, that should have rocked you to your core as far as the things he said, and that should have been unacceptable. A large portion of this country didn\u2019t feel that way. In my opinion, I have to look at those people a different way because there\u2019s a question, as an African-American man, would they have my back in a Donald Trump world? Like I said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a racist, Aaron. I don\u2019t. I could never believe you\u2019re a racist, man, that\u2019s silly, that\u2019s stupid.

{"Headline": "Dancing in a Hurricane", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byBRITAIN\u2019S vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump\u2019s election in America constitute a single giant political event \u2014 one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I\u2019ve been working on a book about what\u2019s been happening beneath the surface \u2014 in the plumbing and wiring of the world \u2014 that\u2019s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007?2007? That\u2019s such an innocuous year. But look again.Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you\u2019ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyze enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable both Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, \u201cthe cloud\u201d really took off in 2007.In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson \u2014 the world\u2019s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around \u2026 2007.The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world\u2019s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide.In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it.Why? 2008.Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what the Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our \u201csocial technologies\u201d \u2014 all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst \u2014 froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process.How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power \u2014 in really differentiated ways \u2014 all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas.What one individual or small group can now do \u2014 the power of one \u2014 to make or break things is phenomenal. When President-elect Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at \u201cJeopardy!\u201d or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans.At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas \u2014 think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights \u2014 can suddenly melt away.So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalization and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore\u2019s Law drives more globalization and more globalization drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration.I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn\u2019t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones \u2014 and they are using WhatsApp to organize vast illicit migration networks to get there.So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world \u2014 their community and their job \u2014 are feeling destabilized. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men\u2019s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there\u2019s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas \u2014 but for many others they\u2019ve come faster than they can adapt.That\u2019s why my favorite song these days is Brandi Carlile\u2019s wonderful ballad called \u201cThe Eye,\u201d the main verse of which is: \u201cI wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you\u2019re standing in the eye.\u201dThese accelerations in technology, globalization and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we\u2019re all being asked to dance. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye.For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them \u2014 but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them. More on that another day.

You know him: He is probably getting ready to mansplain this article to you.The hotline, which is temporary and open to men and women, was set up by Unionen, a trade union that represents about 600,000 private-sector employees in Sweden and describes itself as the largest white-collar union in the world.\u201cOur objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace,\u201d Jennie Zetterstr\u00f6m, a union spokeswoman, said in an email on Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s important to create awareness about how seemingly small things that we do or say add up to a larger issue.\u201dBetween 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. every day this week, members are being encouraged to phone the hotline to talk about mansplaining in their working lives. The calls will be answered by 20 men and women, who are gender experts, authors, academics and others.\u201cThe most important thing when we consulted these people is that they have knowledge and interest in the issue,\u201d Ms. Zetterstr\u00f6m said. \u201cBoth women and men carrying valuable experience for such a type of activity.\u201dSo far, Ms. Zetterstr\u00f6m said, callers have asked for advice on speaking up when they feel run over by male colleagues, and on how to help female colleagues who are being ignored by men in their working groups.Others have asked how to address clients or colleagues who address only the male employees \u2014 even when a woman is in charge \u2014 and how to address men who get credit for a woman\u2019s work.With a knowing roll of the eyes and a deep sigh, women \u2014 and some men \u2014 recognized the experience Ms. Solnit relayed, and a new word was born.\u201cOur intention has never been to point fingers or blame all men, our intention has simply been to spark an interest and start a debate at our work places and in society,\u201d Ms. Zetterstr\u00f6m said. She added that the debate had been \u201clively,\u201d and said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s regretful if someone feels offended.\u201dBut the union says it hopes the hotline raises awareness of gender discrimination in the workplace and, in doing so, perhaps helps to alleviate it.\u201cBut enough women are subjected to it by enough men for it to be a problem that warrants being addressed, discussed and resolved.\u201dChristina Anderson contributed reporting, and Jonah Engel Bromwich and Daniel Victor contributed male opinions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Was Essentially a Third-Party Candidate on a G.O.P. Ticket", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byPolitical MemoHe breezily passed along falsehoods, trafficked in outlandish conspiracy theories, and more or less asked for the scorn he received from the fact-checking guardians of probity in public life.But in running his norm-breaking campaign, Donald J. Trump shined a light on a larger truth: Voters have had it with the artifice, emptiness and elements of corruption that pervade the country\u2019s politics.Mr. Trump ostensibly ran as a Republican, but he was effectively a third-party candidate who happened to campaign under the banner of one of the two major parties. Casting himself as an outsider, he not only savaged leaders in both parties but he made a mockery of nearly all the pieties of the American political system.Mr. Trump was the most unconventional candidate in United States history, but he was a better fit than any of his competitors for this moment. That is because, while he may have represented a jarring change to a decorous political culture \u2014 no modern major party nominee had ever said the things he said \u2014 he reflected a coarser but authentic popular culture that many people have grown used to.\u201cWhether he was right or wrong about what he was saying, he was remarkably authentic saying it,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who saw the depth of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal far earlier than most in his party.In an era when so-called message discipline has been made into a cardinal virtue for candidates, draining much of the spontaneity out of campaigns but lessening the margin for error, Mr. Trump said out loud what was on his mind. He did not have the fear of gaffes that the members of the political-industrial complex often instill in candidates.In this, he was more honest to the realm he had entered than most of the career politicians: Like Mr. Trump, they too are consumed with their standing in polls, given to ridiculing their rivals and the news media and taken with their own talent and charm. They just do not say so in public.The campaign moment that best testified to Mr. Trump\u2019s unfiltered approach may have come when he was briefly relegated to the sidelines during the Republican primaries. It was when Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, under withering attack at a debate from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, robotically repeated criticisms of President Obama that his campaign told him would be effective. In truth, the exchange only illustrated the degree to which Mr. Rubio was the antithesis of Mr. Trump, a slave to talking points.\u201cThere\u2019s a falsity to our politics and Donald exposed that,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who was critical of Mr. Trump but who came to support him and even make commercials for one of the groups backing his candidacy.And at a time when the use of data and analytics has grown so sophisticated that campaigns can pinpoint the predilections of most every voting household, Mr. Trump was an unapologetic wholesale candidate. He based his decisions for much of the campaign on instinct, crowd reaction and media reaction. And, after winning his nomination, he presciently said that he thought his and President Obama\u2019s success was unrelated to the mechanics of their campaigns.\u201cI\u2019ve always felt it was overrated,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the trend toward a data-driven approach. \u201cObama got the votes much more so than his data-processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.\u201dMr. Trump, of course, was not alien to politics. He spent decades observing the sometimes-seamy nature of democracy from a vantage point that afforded him insights on how transactional a business it is: He was a campaign donor.So when he got into the race and faced criticism from rivals and antagonistic interest groups, he was able to exact a revenge that was both vicious and revealing. He recalled all the meetings had and letters received from political figures who were singing a very different tune when they were beseeching him for a contribution. Groups like the conservative Club for Growth, for example, had no trouble overlooking his bombast if he was willing to write them a check.More than anything, though, Mr. Trump was a creature of the news media, a manipulator of its appetite for the new, the controversial and the provocative. While something of a throwback in terms of his reading habits \u2014 he prefers newspaper hard copies \u2014 he adapted to find new avenues in which he could draw attention.\u201cHe used modern media technology to go around you guys on a scale nobody ever dreamed possible,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said in an interview. \u201cIf you think of his 15 million followers on social media times the totality of their followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, that\u2019s the equivalent of a small cable network.\u201dBut while other candidates also exploited the same platforms, they did so only to find a new medium for the same poll-tested bromides that voters have been deluged with for decades on television.Mr. Trump used the platforms to serve up the same stew of the outrageous and incendiary commentary online as he did during his constant stream of rallies.\u201cThat freshness is so hard to bottle and put in a 30-second video,\u201d said Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat who is a businessman-turned-politician and who said he was curious enough about Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal that he picked up a copy of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d this year.Mr. Trump, added Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, is \u201creal and obviously flawed\u201d but voters were willing to tolerate the flaws for what they saw as the real part of the bargain.The question now is whether Mr. Trump has reshaped the conduct of politics in lasting ways, nudging other candidates to take risks that may endear them to voters, or if he is a singular figure of the sort that no campaign shall see his like again. No campaign, that is, other than perhaps his re-election bid.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a senator from Missouri. She is Claire McCaskill, not Clarie.Advertisement"}

Much of the suit is based on a forensic search of emails that it says showed Mr. Kimball\u2019s scrambling to set up his new business before he left the old one, securing copies of his work contacts and packing up his belongings. \u201cWant to get ahead of the partners!\u201d he wrote to his assistant, whose emails show that she used the America\u2019s Test Kitchen name to search for office space for his new venture.Read the complaint filed in Suffolk County Superior Court in Massachusetts.Jack Bishop, the chief creative officer at America\u2019s Test Kitchen, said, \u201cWe were taking the quiet, private \u2018Let\u2019s try to make this work\u2019 approach, and this is where we have now ended up.\u201dHe and Mr. Kimball have known each other since 1987, six years before Mr. Kimball started Cook\u2019s Illustrated, the ad-free magazine that ushered in a new approach to cooking journalism and grew to become America\u2019s Test Kitchen. Mr. Kimball, 65, and the company parted ways last year.\u201cThere is no joy in any of this,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cOther than my siblings and parents, it is one of the longer relationships I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201dMr. Kimball called the lawsuit \u201cabsurd,\u201d saying the filing was meant to generate publicity and to shore up the America\u2019s Test Kitchen brand.\u201cI want to respond carefully to everything factually,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I start getting into the details, it\u2019s just going to be a pissing contest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dThe suit seeks unspecified monetary damages, repayment of some of the compensation that America\u2019s Test Kitchen paid Mr. Kimball and the people who left with him, and asks the court to prevent him and his new company \u201cfrom exploiting information, assets and opportunities stolen from America\u2019s Test Kitchen.\u201dAlthough Mr. Kimball \u2014 always the star and a key creative force of the franchise \u2014 agreed, he said it soon became clear that he was being pushed out. The suit puts it this way: \u201cMr. Kimball secretly resented giving up any control of the business.\u201dBy 2015, the board of Boston Common Press, which owns America\u2019s Test Kitchen, had hired a new chief executive who outranked Mr. Kimball but said he wanted him to stay on in a leadership role and as the face of America\u2019s Test Kitchen. He could even take time to write books.Mr. Kimball eventually stopped coming to the office, telling people there he had been fired. It was a brutal few months of battle, especially for the Kimball loyalists who would eventually leave with him to start Christopher Kimball\u2019s Milk Street, a cooking school, magazine, TV and radio enterprise that has a more global focus than America\u2019s Test Kitchen.Mr. Kimball won the early rounds of the trademark battle. The lawyer for the cafe owner is now representing America\u2019s Test Kitchen in the new suit.But Adam Rapoport, editor in chief of Bon App\u00e9tit, said Mr. Kimball can only be himself.\u201cIf you are a creative person who has done one thing, you do what you do,\u201d Mr. Rapoport said, noting that he was not speaking about the legal issues raised in the lawsuit. \u201cAnthony Bourdain went from the Travel Channel to CNN, and he still did Bourdain. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really possible to change.\u201dMr. Kimball, in an interview Wednesday, cautioned not to read too much into the allegations, saying most were false or twisted interpretations. He was upset that personal information had been made public in the original filing, including his home address and details about his finances, which include just over $1 million he received in salary and bonuses in 2015. In all, Mr. Kimball has made more than $30 million in distributions as a partner, according to the court documents.He and his legal team are preparing a response, which is due to the court this month. Otherwise, he\u2019s turning his attention elsewhere.\u201cThanksgiving\u2019s coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to actually focus on that and Milk Street and everything else we are doing.

He was 80.The death was confirmed by the actress BarBara Luna on a Facebook post.\u201cLand of the Giants,\u201d which ran from 1968 to 1970 on ABC, was a science-fiction adventure about the passengers and crew of a small suborbital aircraft that crash-lands on a planet inhabited by humanoids 70 feet tall and house cats the size of King Kong. Mr. Marshall starred alongside Gary Conway, who played the pilot.The producer was Irwin Allen, the man behind \u201cLost in Space\u201d and other 1960s science-fiction shows and later the mastermind of blockbuster disaster movies, including \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d and \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure.\u201d\u201cIt was a very pleasant set most of the time,\u201d Mr. Marshall recalled in an interview with a fan website years later, \u201cespecially when Irwin Allen wasn\u2019t there.\u201dAt the time, just past the height of the civil rights movement, the only African-American stars on prime-time network series were Bill Cosby on \u201cI Spy\u201d (which began in 1965) and Greg Morris on \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d (starting in 1966).Diahann Carroll joined their ranks when \u201cJulia,\u201d a sitcom on which she starred as a widowed nurse and single mother, had its premiere in 1968. Mr. Marshall appeared on four episodes of that series, as the title character\u2019s love interest.Over three decades, Mr. Marshall appeared in more than two dozen television series as well as television movies and feature films. He was often cast as an authority figure: an F.B.I. agent on \u201cGood Times,\u201d a senator on \u201cCapitol\u201d and a police officer on \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and \u201cThe Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\u201dHe was particularly proud, he said, of his role as a young 19th-century doctor facing frontier bigotry in a 1981 episode of \u201cLittle House on the Prairie.\u201dIn his screen debut, the 1962 film \u201cThe Interns,\u201d he was a physician in training. In \u201cUptown Saturday Night\u201d (1974), starring Sidney Poitier and Mr. Cosby, Mr. Marshall played a henchman. In \u201cThe Thing With Two Heads\u201d (1972), the cult science-fiction hit about a doctor who brings Ray Milland and Roosevelt Grier together with a transplant, he was the surgeon.Donald James Marshall was born on May 2, 1936, in San Diego, where he lived with his mother, Alma Marshall; his maternal grandmother, Leola Williams; two older sisters; and a twin brother, Douglas. He served in the Army and studied theater at Los Angeles City College, where he was also on the track and field team as a pole vaulter and runner. He later said that his sports background had helped him sometimes execute his own stunts as an actor.After he retired from acting, he founded DJR Productions, which specialized in television commercials and other video projects.His brother is among his survivors.Mr. Marshall established his place in \u201cStar Trek\u201d history in a 1967 episode of the original series. As Lieutenant Boma, part of a small shuttlecraft landing party under attack by furry monsters with spears, he was impatient with the half-Vulcan character Spock\u2019s reliance on logic, making that clear with cynical comments like \u201cYou? Err? Impossible?\u201dTwo members of the landing party perished, but, going against all \u201cStar Trek\u201d conventional wisdom, Mr. Marshall\u2019s character was not one of them.Advertisement"}

But the experts we spoke with cautioned against giving dogs as gifts, unless the giver is also prepared to take responsibility for their care.No matter the time of year, though, there are points every New Yorker should consider before bringing a dog into their home:How much time should I spend with a dog every day?Between walking, feeding, exercising, training and other care, you should expect to spend at least five (waking) hours with your dog a day, said Sandra DeFeo, the executive director of the Humane Society of New York. Depending on the breed and the age of the dog, that may vary.How much money should I set aside for the costs of having a dog?Is my apartment too small for a dog?If you\u2019re scared your studio apartment won\u2019t be big enough for the both of you, it\u2019s doable, said Gail Buchwald, the senior vice president of the A.S.P.C.A.

{"Headline": "Movie Awards Season Kicks Off in High Gear", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe CarpetbaggerHello again everybody! Think electioneering this year is over, and campaigns are behind us?Wrong.It\u2019s that time again, now that Thanksgiving is just past and Christmas and Hanukkah are in sight, for the Hollywood movie-awards machine to crank back into gear. It has actually been cranking away for a while now, going back to the late-summer film festivals. But now is the time when yours truly, the Bagger, dips in to report on this high-visibility, low-consequence, mercifully distracting horse race.According to several filmmakers, the election also shaped how audiences \u2014 at least those in bluest of blue New York and Los Angeles \u2014 have been responding to their awards-minded films, and campaigners are taking note.\u201cPeople have been saying, \u2018In this time of unease, the movie really opened me up,\u2019 that it\u2019s an emotionally healing experience,\u201d Luke Davies, the screenwriter of \u201cLion,\u201d a tear-jerker based on the true story of a lost boy seeking his family after being adopted in a far-off land, told the Bagger. Iain Canning, one of the film\u2019s producers, said that while the movie was met with warm enthusiasm before the election, audience members at screenings since then have told him they were left with \u201chope and determination to move forward in a new way.\u201dAnd Jeff Nichols, whose quiet film \u201cLoving\u201d tells the true story of an interracial couple\u2019s successful fight for marriage equality half a century ago, saw audience responses shift in recent weeks, too.\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people come up to me and say, \u2018Wow, we need this so much right now,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nichols said, speaking by phone from Texas. \u201cIt sounds self aggrandizing. But it\u2019s a comment that didn\u2019t happen the same way before the election. It\u2019s a specific reaction.\u201dAll of this might draw eye rolls from conservative readers (are ya out there?). But all of these awards \u2014 which started with the Gothams on Monday and culminate in the Oscars on Feb. 26 \u2014 are largely decided by those firmly ensconced in the coastally elite blue bubbles. And a big question burbling around the awards world is whether academy voters will, in the wake of the election, go for lighter, escapist fare, or a meatier film with a message, especially considering last year\u2019s eruption when all of the Oscar acting nominees were white.But if escapism is what academy members want, both of the docs (admittedly awards long shots) might be hurt by the cold, hard, if necessary, truths that they drive home.By luck or chance, few of this year\u2019s leading features, so far, are especially grueling to watch: all the better for audiences taxed by an ugly political year. There is no \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d brutality, no sadism \u00e0 la \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d nothing as unremittingly frenetic as \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d \u2014 at least not yet. There are of course exceptions: Mel Gibson\u2019s gory \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d has a distant shot, and Martin Scorsese\u2019s coming film \u201cSilence\u201d promises to be, at the least, intense. (The chances of the controversy-ridden film \u201cThe Birth a Nation,\u201d certainly a tough watch, have mightily dimmed.)\u201cThe film is what we believe in, that we are better as a society when we\u2019re looking for similarities rather than differences,\u201d one of the directors, Rich Moore, told the Bagger in a recent phone chat. \u201cWe all want the same things in life \u2014 security, happiness, safety, respect and acceptance. But the paradox is we won\u2019t get those things if we go about painting people different from us as bad.\u201dTo be determined: whether this boosts \u201cZootopia\u2019s\u201d awards prospects. Spoiler alert, if you haven\u2019t seen it, predator and prey once again get along in the end. Fantasy indeed.The Carpetbagger column on Thursday, about the movie awards season, misstated the given name of a director of the animated film \u201cZootopia,\u201d a possible Oscar contender.

Mr. Trudeau\u2019s open approach to immigration and refugees is the inverse of Mr. Trump\u2019s. And Canada will be in a difficult position if it imposes carbon taxes only to find that Mr. Trump undoes all American efforts to mitigate climate change.One of the few positive developments for Canada is Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s decision to block the Keystone XL pipeline.\u2014 IAN AUSTENBan Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said it was \u201cworth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the country\u2019s greatest strengths.\u201dAs if to remind the United States of its role as a guarantor of world stability, he noted that it is \u201can essential actor across the international agenda.\u201dMr. Trump has demanded that the NATO allies of the United States foot more of the bill for their collective defense. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, noted that the alliance comes with legal obligations.\u2014 RICK GLADSTONE and JAMES KANTERLater, however, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, warned that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, and the election of Mr. Trump, should raise alarms. \u201cThe events of the last months and days should be treated as a warning sign for all who believe in liberal democracy,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cWe cannot be dependent anymore on the U.S., we have to take charge of our own destiny. Europe should get its act together, too, and set its internal differences aside.\u201dBritain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, spoke of the country\u2019s \u201cenduring and special relationship\u201d with the United States.President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France noted that \u201csome of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign positions must be put to the test of the values and the interests that we share with the United States.\u201d He added that \u201cdisorders in the world are worrying people everywhere, including the people of America, the first world power.\u201d The French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, asked, \u201cWhat will become of the Paris agreement on the climate, of the nuclear deal with Iran that Donald Trump wants to reconsider?\u201dChancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Mr. Trump and offered her cooperation \u2014 but stressed that it must rest on human rights and nondiscrimination. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said that \u201cif Donald Trump really wants to be president of all Americans, then I think his first duty is to fill in the deep rifts which arose during the campaign.\u201d\u2014 AURELIEN BREEDEN, JAMES KANTER and ALISON SMALETwo anti-immigrant nationalist leaders \u2014 Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Marine Le Pen in France \u2014 cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.\u2014 BENO\u00ceT MORENNE and MARTIN de BOURMONTMr. Trump has called the January agreement between Iran and world powers \u201cthe worst deal ever,\u201d and he has vowed to unilaterally abandon it. Under the agreement, Iran has given up large chunks of its nuclear program in exchange for some sanctions relief.The head of Iran\u2019s atomic energy program told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency on Wednesday that the country would \u201ctry to continue to implement the nuclear agreement.\u201dIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that the presidential debates had illustrated \u201cthe crisis America is in.\u201d Some analysts said the election of Mr. Trump was the result of an \u201cawakening,\u201d Iran\u2019s ideological label for some of the Arab Spring revolts.\u201cPresident-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel, and I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The United States is Israel\u2019s most important ally.The Israeli government, which has often had a tense relationship with the Obama administration, has studiously avoided taking sides, but at the same time, Jerusalem has moved to improve relations with India and Russia, and is in talks to develop economic ties with China.\u2014 ISABEL KERSHNERAcross the Middle East, where the United States has a long history of often divisive involvement, many seemed to have no idea how to react to the election of Mr. Trump.Syrians, too, said they had little inkling what the vote would mean for the civil war in their country, although many in the opposition had expressed hope that a victory for Hillary Clinton would mean more robust support for the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad.Many have expressed worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about Islam and Muslims would translate into aggressive policies in the region, as well as making it harder for displaced Syrians to seek refuge.\u2014 BEN HUBBARD, ANNE BARNARD and HWAIDA SAADPrime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had been planning to meet Mrs. Clinton in Washington in February, tried to calm his country, as the yen surged and stocks stumbled. \u201cHand in hand with Trump, we will try to work together,\u201d he said.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump singled out Japan. He claimed that Tokyo was not paying its fair share to support United States military bases, calling into question the American commitment to defend Japan in case of attack.A rising China could put a check on Mr. Trump\u2019s stated ambitions in Asia. \u201cMaybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,\u201d said Shin Kawashima, professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. \u201cBut if he carries out such a policy, China will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against Trump\u2019s policies. It is a little difficult for Trump to just change all the old policies.\u201dPresident Park Geun-hye of South Korea instructed her government to coordinate closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team to ensure that her country and the United States would maintain sanctions and pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program.\u201cNorth Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond\u201d to provocations, said Jeong Joon-hee, a government spokesman.Mr. Trump unsettled South Koreans when he said that he might withdraw American troops from their country unless Seoul paid more for their presence. He also indicated that he might let Japan and South Korea protect themselves with nuclear weapons and that he might negotiate directly with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Trump\u2019s surprisingly strong performance caught analysts off guard, but it was welcome news for those in South Korea who believe that their country must build its own nuclear weapons to defend against North Korea.\u2014 CHOE SANG-HUNPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia was one of the first leaders to offer effusive praise for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe world has watched this year\u2019s presidential election with fascination,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt almost every turn, media commentators have been proved wrong and the results anticipated by experts have been overturned. Donald Trump was considered a distant outsider when his candidacy was first announced. He beat the establishment consensus by winning the Republican nomination, and did so again with his remarkable victory today. Mr. Trump\u2019s success shows that politicians should never take voters for granted.\u201d\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are alike. We both swear.\u201d\u2014 SEWELL CHAN and RICHARD C. PADDOCKFor India, a central question is whether Washington will reduce its military presence.\u201cIf that is called into question, India will no longer be able to rely on the U.S. to be there as a security provider,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, a fellow at the Brookings Institution India Center.

{"Headline": "Under Trump, Will NASA\u2019s Space Science Include Planet Earth?", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Earth is changing on all spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Earth science program is to develop a scientific understanding of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system and its response to natural or human-induced changes and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards.Earth science is science in the national interest. While scientific discovery from space is inherent in the Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission, NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programs in Earth science also are central to three important Presidential initiatives: the Climate Change Research Initiative, Global Earth Observation, and the Oceans Action Plan. NASA pioneers new global environmental observations and research, and works with other federal agencies to improve the operational services they provide to the Nation. These services include: weather forecasting; climate prediction; natural hazard assessment, prediction, and response; and environmental management, including air quality forecasting and land use assessment.As for NASA\u2019s $19-billion annual budget, most of the money is still spent on space-focused projects, both basic science and technology and existing systems.About $1.5 billion is for (non Earth)\u00c2\u00a0planetary science, including spending on Mars missions and development of a mission to Jupiter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moon Europa.The $2 billion for Earth science\u00c2\u00a0includes vital projects like sustaining the 43-year Landsat record of global land-imaging measurements. Science clarifying human-driven climate change and its impacts of\u00c2\u00a0human communities and ecosystems is a subset of this broader suite of research projects.It seems nearly impossible to break out a budget for NASA (or other agency) research that specifically focuses on climate change driven by greenhouse gases (the main focus of Trump\u2019s advisors). I tried a decade ago and tried again this morning, with no success. (There has to be a grad student who wants to dig in on this?)For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.Before the Trump administration coalesces and locks in views on how to prioritize NASA\u2019s work and budget, not to mention the wider sweep of federal and federally-funded research on planet-scale environmental change and risks, I hope some of the views below are considered.I appreciate many of the points you (Peter N) and Bob Walker have made in recent output (SpaceNews.com) related to NASA\u2019s future and global-change research.For several years during the George W. Bush administration, for instance, I tried to get a consolidated budget across 13 agencies for climate change research and always came up short. It is a bit of a morass.But I find it worrying that the call to shift scientific research on Earth systems and change out of NASA isn\u2019t paired with a call to raise the profile of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, created under President George H.W. Bush in 1989.Why disrupt existing centers of excellence when invigorated cross-agency coordination could assure the goals and efforts in this arena reflect national priorities and are carried out efficiently?Would love to discuss\u2026.I\u2019ll post an update when I hear from them or the transition team (I forwarded the note there, as well).Here\u2019s some of the input I got over the holiday weekend.Yes, Walker makes some good points.\u00c2\u00a0As we noted in the op-ed, U.S. agencies are not optimally structured for the Earth information mission. If Walker were to focus on achieving this optimization, his points might deserve serious attention. But he gives away his bias with comments such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitically correct environmental monitoring.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhatever your perspectives on climate, environmental science/monitoring is foundational to any society.\u00c2\u00a0He seems to suggest it has little inherent value.\u00c2\u00a0What if we applied his logic to other information domains?\u00c2\u00a0Should we complain that economics is so judgmental, and thus subject to being \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical correct,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the U.S. government should refrain from its use in planning future budgets?\u00c2\u00a0As with economics, we need Earth information to plan our future: infrastructure, effective agriculture, efficient supply chains, disaster prevention.\u00c2\u00a0If politics is intertwined, we should unravel it to the extent possible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but not throw out the entire field along the way\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.If the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or National Science Foundation were really better homes for Earth science, it would make sense to adjust agency roles.\u00c2\u00a0But NOAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture and processes are not consistent with exploratory Earth science, and the N.S.F. has no expertise in space.\u00c2\u00a0Moving NASA science to them would involve big commitments to their restructuring and budgets.\u00c2\u00a0Given this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6, it seems NASA is currently the right place.\u00c2\u00a0That, I believe, is the un-politicized answer.When it comes to understanding the home planet, as a whole, as an integrated system that supports life, it seems to me NASA is best positioned to provide this service to humanity.I think Bill said it extremely well.\u00c2\u00a0 The only thing I would add is when it comes to building satellites there is an efficiency/benefit that comes from having the spacecraft development infrastructure for Earth observations in the same organization that builds spacecraft for other purposes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 planetary and astrophysics. There are procedures and practices that have evolved over decades in this pursuit that would have to be reconstituted\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Building spacecraft that work is hard, and it is in the interests of the nation, I believe, to have those engineering capabilities for Earth science in an organization that regularly does this for space exploration as a whole\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.What is really needed is a thoughtful well-integrated Earth observation strategy that goes well beyond figuring out what goes to what agency. At least when the responsibility lies essentially with NASA, strategic planning can occur within the Agency. If it distributed among multiple agencies, or in the hands of an agency that has a mission that is much more focused than the broader understanding of the Earth, we are at great risk.Abdalati also noted that the emphasis on NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role studying Earth dates from the Reagan administration, during which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Act of 1958 was amended in 1985 to add as an objective \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe expansion of human knowledge\u00c2\u00a0of the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u009d along with \u00e2\u0080\u009cphenomena in the atmosphere and space.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat was our initial attempt at defining the issues and questions at least on national security. The document sets up a task force chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Council and requires an action plan by the end of the Obama administration.Of course, it\u2019s not clear what happens to that work on\u00c2\u00a0January 20. But, based on the dozens of interagency meetings held to get to this document (which as with most presidential orders reflects agency consensus), I believe there is deep support among career employees to continue this work. And after decades of government employment, it\u2019s my observation that career employees can often accomplish a lot even in the face of unsupportive leadership. Of course, the urgency with which we must address the climate challenge makes this a very worrisome approach.To answer your question, as with other crosscutting risks such as cyber security and biological threats, no federal agency or entity is well positioned to integrate the risk management challenge. In the federal government, in my experience, agencies often act like humans \u2014 except in a crisis, they prefer to avoid\u00c2\u00a0having to follow another agency\u2019s direction.There seem to be two distinct but related issues here: (1) Maintaining and strengthening data collection, (2) Coordinating and integrating science for managing systemic risks.In both of these, multiple agencies come together to help communities solve problems, draw on their programs and look for synergies and opportunities to leverage non-government efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 When people in agencies are looking to solve problems \u2013 interagency collaboration can really work.I think\u00c2\u00a0Alice\u2019s approach to national security was similar \u2014 get agencies around the table to address a problem \u2014 not simply coordinate programs.On integrating science on systemic risks, the structure for that integration does not exist. I also believe that we may need to approach this through public-private collaborations. \u00c2\u00a0But of course the U.S. government would need to play a pivotal role in this.Science .orgs urge Trump to name cabinet-level science advisor. https://t.co/w9ZS2NPsuA Hard to square with @JJCarafano advisory role?Phil Plait (@BadAstronomer) redoubles criticism of Trump advisor\u2019s disastrous plan to gut NASA Earth science. https://t.co/kIUbvyGuGa @SlateMy thoughts on @NASAEarth funding in a #TrumpTransition https://t.co/ykkwseNclI via @ConversationUSFollowAdvertisement"}

Says", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The student who wounded 11 people this week at Ohio State University, plowing his car into a cluster of pedestrians and then slashing some of them with a butcher knife, may have been inspired by Anwar al-Awlaki, a Qaeda recruiter and propagandist, or by the Islamic State terrorist group, investigators said on Wednesday.Investigators are going through \u201cthe detailed analysis of electronic devices, social media accounts and other materials\u201d related to Mr. Artan, a Somali-born Ohio State student, and \u201chave conducted dozens of interviews with family members, co-workers, neighbors and others,\u201d said Angela L. Byers, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. office in Cincinnati.Ms. Byers cautioned that the investigation would take time and that it was too early to say whether the attack was an act of terrorism.\u201cAt this time, we are not aware of anyone else being involved in the planning of this attack, but the investigation continues,\u201d she said. \u201cIt appears that Artan may have at least been inspired by Anwar Awlaki and the Islamic State.\u201dHere in Columbus, classmates and neighbors struggled to square their recollections of a quiet young refugee with his actions on Monday. Frank Oteng, who said he had taken a statistics class with Mr. Artan last spring at Columbus State Community College, recalled him as a diligent student who sought help on coursework and yearned to transfer to Ohio State.When Mr. Oteng saw Mr. Artan on Ohio State\u2019s campus recently, he recalled, Mr. Artan spoke excitedly about having graduated from the community college and gave no indication of the trouble to come. \u201cI didn\u2019t see this coming,\u201d Mr. Oteng said.Mr. Artan, who arrived in the United States in 2014, lived with a large number of family members in a townhouse apartment southwest of downtown Columbus. He was in his first semester at Ohio State after studying for two years at Columbus State, where he graduated with honors.Most neighbors had only vague recollections of Mr. Artan, but none spoke of anything more sinister than his habit of parking in front of a fire hydrant. Ahmed Johar, 29, one of several other Somali immigrants who live on the block, said he did not know Mr. Artan and did not recall seeing him around.\u201cIt\u2019s just not good,\u201d said Mr. Johar, a truck driver who said he was home infrequently. \u201cWe are surprised. This area, all people are good.\u201dThe Artan family did not seem well known by members of this city\u2019s large Somali and Muslim communities. At a mosque about a mile from his townhouse, leaders said they had no recollection of Mr. Artan\u2019s ever praying there and did not know his family. Horsed Nooh, the mosque\u2019s executive director, said officials there had focused in recent years on cultivating youth programs and connecting with non-Muslims. He said those outreach efforts would increase.Mr. Nooh said the mosque\u2019s members, most of whom are Somali or East African, had come to Ohio seeking jobs and had mostly been embraced by residents here. But many were worried about backlash after Monday\u2019s attack, and Mr. Nooh said some had already been disheartened by recent discourse about Muslims and by the policies of President-elect Donald J. Trump.\u201cSome of the rhetoric from the current president-elect, when he said Muslims should be banned, they were all terrified,\u201d Mr. Nooh said.Mr. Trump weighed in on the Ohio State attack on Wednesday, noting that the Islamic State had claimed responsibility and saying Mr. Artan was \u201ca Somali refugee who should not have been in our country.\u201dInvestigators were continuing to untangle Mr. Artan\u2019s background on Wednesday. He was admitted to the United States in 2014 as the child of a refugee after living for several years in Pakistan. Some records listed his age as 18, but others suggested he was older. He had earned enough academic credits to have senior class standing at Ohio State.News organizations have reported that minutes before the attack, a post on a Facebook page apparently belonging to Mr. Artan, which has since been disabled, called on the United States to stop interfering in the affairs of Muslim countries. The post called Mr. Awlaki, an American citizen killed by a United States drone strike in Yemen, a hero.\u201cWe are looking at the Facebook posts and trying to determine the authentication,\u201d Ms. Byers, of the F.B.I., said. Until Monday, she said, Mr. Artan had not been under investigation by law enforcement.Mitch Smith reported from Columbus, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York. Sheridan L.

{"Headline": "Blockbuster Deals in a Race to Stay Ahead of the Competition", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWorld-changing corporate transactions just seem to keep coming. It won\u2019t last, however.The number of multibillion-dollar deals announced in recent weeks is staggering by any measure, particularly in an election year, when the uncertainty tends to drive away deals.Time Warner\u2019s & AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion proposed tie-up has dominated the headlines as consumers latch on to tales of media dominance, but in October alone, $329 billion worth of deal activity in the United States has been announced, according to Thomson Reuters, a record. The worldwide number, $483.1 billion, is also no slouch and the fifth highest on record.Other gigantic deals include General Electric\u2019s combination of its oil business with that of Baker Hughes, British American Tobacco\u2019s $47 billion takeover offer for Reynolds American and Qualcomm\u2019s $38.5 billion deal for NXP Semiconductors. One of the biggest deals this year is Bayer\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto.Looming in the future are potential other big deals like a recombination of Viacom and CBS.Conventional wisdom is that this activity is all about cheap money. Interest rates are at 400-year lows and the world is awash with liquidity as investors try to find anything that yields a decent rate. Capital markets are so well developed that AT&T can seek to borrow $40 billion to buy Time Warner without missing a step. The days of the financial crisis are well and truly over as lenders are again jumping to lend \u2014 albeit at lower leverage rates. (We did learn something from the crisis, thankfully.)The other broad force driving this merger boomlet is confidence. The worldwide economy is choppy, but we are actually in a period of stability. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has come, and though it may prove to be a disaster for the British economy, it has not brought the trade bloc down with it.Indeed, since the British referendum on June 23, the British stock market is up about 15 percent. The decline in the value of the pound has spurred deal-making, like Softbank\u2019s $32 billion acquisition of the British chip maker ARM Holdings.Forget about shareholder value; the top priority of any chief executive is to remain employed. And in a sluggish economy with few obvious opportunities, a big merger has become the only way to acquire growth or a new product or new technology and ensure that the chief executive holds on to power.The challenge facing chief executives is compounded by the changes wrought by technology. Companies, particularly in technology, media and telecommunications, are racing to keep up and avoid being outmaneuvered. Microsoft\u2019s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn can be viewed solely as a defensive play \u2014 keeping its global reach on the internet.This trend has also been apparent in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology deal making of the past years as companies bought drugs instead of developing them.And tech itself continues to produce new challengers and spur further deal activity. The potential initial public stock offering of Snap at very likely an extraordinary valuation will push other tech companies to go public, generating more money in the pockets of the tech elite to make acquisitions.But the result of all this merger activity is a broad push toward oligopoly, meaning industries are dominated by just a few big players.Take media and telecommunications. We are heading into a world that is focused on video as people spend their lives on their smartphones, at least for now. The AT&T-Time Warner combination is built on this premise as AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, bets that the money in telecom is in content.In this new media world, there will probably be four or five big providers of content, two of which will certainly be Facebook and Google. AT&T is making its play to stay in that elite league through its proposed acquisition.A cynic might see the AT&T deal and others getting ahead of any changes to our inadequate antitrust laws. In a low-growth economy, getting bigger and squeezing out competitors is a clear way to success.Yet the monopolistic power play has changed. In the case of AT&T, its businesses do not overlap with those of Time Warner. This is a so-called vertical merger, which is harder to stop, and there is little history of the government doing so.It is how Facebook has been allowed to preserve its dominance by acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 two emerging potential rivals that were swallowed before they could challenge the Google/Facebook dominance.You may have noticed that the \u201cbigger is better\u201d mantra is not politically popular at the moment. Republicans and Democrats alike have called for regulators to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal.In Washington, you can expect not just greater enforcement but possibly a change in the laws to focus on corporate giants that dominate a market through their immense size.So there is a rush to get deals through before the laws change. Either way, things are not getting better. And the risk of being left behind because of technological disruption and change is driving companies to make acquisitions faster. It is also a trend that, not surprisingly, affects larger companies. Thomson Reuters reports there have been 615 deals year to date, down from 967 in 2014, so the deals are concentrated at the higher end.This trend is spurring the return of the oft-derided conglomerates that came about in the 1960s. As was the case then, instead of growth and survival, we may just end up with bloat.At the moment, it is hard to find anything that can slow the merger train. Everything is going right. But it is in these times that perhaps caution is necessary. The merger market has always been cyclical. The current is moving forward, but sentiment can change. In addition, the risk of disruption still exists, whether it be the United States election, renewed uncertainty in Europe or global turmoil from Russia. And there is the prospect of higher interest rates, and how that will affect cheap deal financing is anybody\u2019s guess.If we have learned anything from more than 100 years of corporate mergers, it is that the lurking influences eventually emerge and the current trends driving all of this merger activity are unlikely to last. Let\u2019s hope it ends slowly and not with a sudden burst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why This Election Terrifies Me", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Tuesday nears, after such epic ugliness. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over,\u201d friends say. \u201cWe\u2019ll finally be done with this.\u201d What a lovely thought. What a na\u00efve fantasy.There\u2019s no end here, just a punctuation mark, a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come. And there\u2019s no way to un-see what all of us have seen over these last 18 months, to bottle up what has been un-bottled.Election Day will redeem and settle nothing, not this time around. No matter who declares victory, tens of millions of Americans will be convinced \u2014 truly convinced \u2014 that the outcome isn\u2019t legitimate because untoward forces intervened. Whether balloons fall on Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, there will be bolder divisions in America than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the country\u2019s most important institutions.After I typed that last sentence, I paused for a sip of coffee and randomly tuned in to the conversation at a nearby table in the lobby of my Hampton Inn. A primly dressed, neatly groomed woman in her early 60s (I\u2019m guessing) was complaining about election coverage: what an incomplete picture the media paints; how uninformed most voters are. If she herself weren\u2019t so alert to a full range of facts, she said, she would never have examined a list posted on a relative\u2019s Facebook page.It named people connected to the Clintons \u201cwho died suspicious deaths,\u201d she told her companions. \u201cIt sounds absurd to us, because we can\u2019t imagine things like that going on, but we can\u2019t dismiss it. There\u2019s too much evidence.\u201d They nodded raptly.These senators aren\u2019t thinking big like that. They\u2019re thinking small, focused on their own rabid fan bases, their invitations to inveigh on the news shows and their Twitter followings, which won\u2019t be fattened by calm and comity.Before James Comey\u2019s reckless disclosure a little more than a week ago, it was clear that Trump\u2019s most passionate supporters, goaded by him, would cry \u201crigged\u201d if he lost. Now Clinton\u2019s supporters are poised to do likewise if she\u2019s defeated.The arc of this election has been one of disillusionment, bending toward disarray. Trump\u2019s initial window of opportunity was so many Americans\u2019 belief that Washington, Wall Street and the media had been irredeemably corrupted by self-interested elites. More than a year later, the number of Americans gripped by such cynicism has undoubtedly grown.I\u2019m not terrified that he\u2019ll win, because I\u2019m stubbornly confident that Americans aren\u2019t that far gone. But I\u2019m terrified by how lost we nonetheless are, by how little clear direction we have.What ideally occurs during an election is that some consensus emerges or is forged. It\u2019s not just a candidate who wins; it\u2019s an argument, a vision. At least that\u2019s the goal.But I can\u2019t identify a single issue like that, domestic or foreign, in 2016, because no campaign in my adult lifetime has turned so little on policy and so much on character.That was perhaps inevitable with nominees as historically unpopular as Clinton and Trump and with an arsonist like him in the equation. But it leaves us \u2026 where? The path ahead is all the trickier because the campaign has widened fault lines not only between Republicans and Democrats but also within each camp.From elections past, I don\u2019t recognize this terrain. How can I assume that it\u2019s navigable?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Said to Create Censorship Tool to Get Back Into China", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byInside Facebook, the work to enter China runs far deeper.The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people\u2019s news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social network has been blocked, these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, the people added.Facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it would offer the software to enable a third party \u2014 in this case, most likely a partner Chinese company \u2014 to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network, the people said. Facebook\u2019s partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users\u2019 feeds.The current and former Facebook employees caution that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering China and, like many experiments inside Facebook, it may never see the light of day. The feature, whose code is visible to engineers inside the company, has so far gone unused, and there is no indication that Facebook has offered it to the authorities in China.A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country.\u201d She added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into China.Still, some officials responsible for China\u2019s tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of Facebook\u2019s operating in the country. It would legitimize China\u2019s strict style of internet governance, and if done according to official standards, would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic. Even so, resistance remains at the top levels of Chinese leadership.Some analysts have said Facebook\u2019s best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor. Finding a partner \u2014 and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in Facebook\u2019s China operation \u2014 would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the Silicon Valley company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company\u2019s government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with Beijing.Facebook and Chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few years about the social network\u2019s entering the market, according to employees who were involved in the discussions, though the two sides have been unable to reach a compromise.Facebook currently sells advertising for some Chinese businesses from its Hong Kong office. Among its customers are state-media sites that act as the propaganda arm of the Chinese government, and that operate official accounts where they post articles. Chinese citizens who wish to gain access to Facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network, or VPN.It\u2019s unclear when the suppression tool originated, but the project picked up momentum in the last year, as engineers were plucked from other parts of Facebook to work on the effort, the current and former employees said. The project was led by Vaughan Smith, a vice president for mobile, corporate and business development at Facebook, they said. Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Smith speaks a smattering of Mandarin.Over the summer, several Facebook employees who were working on the suppression tool left the company, the current and former employees said. Internally, so many employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forum that, in July, it became a topic at one of Facebook\u2019s weekly Friday afternoon question-and-answer sessions.Mr. Zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience about the tool. He told the gathering that Facebook\u2019s China plans were nascent.

{"Headline": "How Do You Tell the Story of the Paris Attacks? You Let Survivors Speak", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byThe terrorists aimed their attacks on the evening of Nov. 13 at everyday French pleasures \u2014 simple Friday night joys like joining thousands of other fans at a soccer stadium, drinking wine with friends at a bar, or going to a rock concert.Many Americans who had visited Paris knew the neighborhoods, if not the streets, where the attacks had taken place. For New Yorkers, the destruction of daily life bore echoes of Sept. 11, 2001, when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Center on a bright Tuesday morning.As The New York Times considered how best to commemorate this shocking and devastating event, senior editors wanted an approach that was different but true to those who had lived through it. The idea emerged of compiling an oral history.As the Paris bureau chief, I was asked to \u201cput the wheels in motion.\u201d At first, I was skeptical. It was a rather vague assignment and it seemed enormous. (It was.)In a widely quoted interview he said: \u201cThe principle is that ordinary people have extraordinary thoughts \u2014 I\u2019ve always believed that \u2014 and that ordinary people can speak poetically. Also that no one else speaks like that and that there is no other person like that in the world.\u201dCould we retell the story of the terrible night of Nov. 13, 2015, in the words of those who survived it and show their courage and their fears, their compassion and their pragmatism?That was my goal. We interviewed people at length, letting them talk as long as they wanted as their minds wandered back to that night. People\u2019s stories were rich and moving. I thought I knew what happened in and around Paris on Nov. 13, but it turned out that there was much I didn\u2019t know.From the Paris fire chief, Gen. Philippe Boutinaud, I learned that in his view the soccer stadium, the Stade de France, was likely the terrorists\u2019 principal target because if the suicide bombers had succeeded in getting inside the crowded arena, they would have wreaked havoc.I learned more about Salim Toorabally, the French-Mauritian security guard who stopped one of the suicide bombers from entering the stadium \u2014 because the man didn\u2019t have a ticket.We learned that emergency workers tried to treat a maimed suicide bomber, not realizing who he was until they tore open his jacket and found wires beneath it.From survivors, we learned that the moments when the terrorists were reloading their guns almost certainly allowed people to save themselves by getting up and dashing for the exits. A number of victims who played dead survived because people who were already dead lay on top of them.There was enormous humanity and kindness, with people trying to pull each other to safety or comfort each other if they had managed to get away from the shooting but were still trapped in the building.Not all of our material made it into the piece; there was simply too much. Some people were not quoted \u2014 only because there was not space to quote them all. But every one of them contributed to our sense that what we were recording was as accurate as people\u2019s memories \u2014 which are never perfect but mix feeling and fact to convey something close to truth.In the vein of Studs Terkel\u2019s observation, each person has his or her own lens through which they see the world. And a single event \u2014 especially one involving so much trauma \u2014 is at once one story, and hundreds of stories.In reporting this piece we wanted to be sure we did not rely only on the recollections of officials \u2014 the police, emergency responders and municipal officials \u2014 because the vast majority of people who were killed, wounded or simply there at the time were from every walk of life; they were Parisians and tourists and bystanders. However, public officials also played a major role and proved to be invaluable guides to the complex chain of events.We started by making a list of everyone we wanted to interview \u2014 about 50 people. Some never responded to our queries, others said no \u2014 but 27 said yes. They included survivors and emergency workers, journalists and fire officials, doctors and the stadium announcer at the Stade de France.Most of those interviewed are French and spoke in French, but a handful are English speakers. When the interviews were in French, we had two bilingual members of The Times\u2019s staff work on the translations.When I say \u201cwe,\u201d it\u2019s important to note that this project was a team effort, involving both French and American journalists \u2014 eight of us \u2014 who work for The Times.We gathered tens of thousands of words of interviews and then culled them. We never changed people\u2019s accounts, but assembled them in the order of the events so that \u2014 as much as possible, the narrative would unfold in the words of those who had lived through the attacks.As our focus was on the events of Nov. 13, 2015, we had to leave out survivors\u2019 accounts of how much they have struggled to recover, and this was perhaps the hardest part of our project. It is extraordinarily moving to hear from victims who have resolved to create something vital and vibrant in the aftermath of trauma.Two days after the attack, he addressed the killers on Facebook. \u201cOn Friday night you stole the life of an exceptional being, the love of my life the mother of my son, but you will not have my hate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gawker and Hulk Hogan Reach $31 Million Settlement", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byIn fighting a lawsuit filed by the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, Gawker Media lost nearly everything \u2014 the verdict, its founder, its independence \u2014 but it maintained its resolute conviction that it would win on appeal.On Wednesday, however, Gawker capitulated, settling with Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, for $31 million, according to court documents, and bringing to a close a multiyear dispute that stripped the company of much that once defined it.All of these developments were viewed by some as the end of an era, and journalists \u2014 not just those who had worked at Gawker \u2014 published articles that often read like obituaries for a media company that had ushered in a certain style of irreverent, no-holds-barred journalism online.Still, those at the company held on to a steadfast belief that it was in the right and that it would be vindicated on appeal. The fight became a symbol of press freedom, pitting a wealthy individual against a take-no-prisoners news organization.But that fight ultimately proved too difficult to sustain.\u201cAll-out legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight,\u201d Mr. Denton added. \u201cGawker\u2019s nemesis was not going away.\u201dMr. Denton did not respond to a request for further comment.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr. Thiel said, \u201cIt is a great day for Terry Bollea and a great day for everyone\u2019s right to privacy.\u201dDavid Houston, a lawyer for Mr. Bollea, said in a statement of his own, \u201cAs with any negotiation for resolution, all parties have agreed it is time to move on.\u201dSome Gawker employees struck a more ominous tone and expressed outrage over what the decision could represent.\u201cThis entire sorry spectacle spells doom for anybody who aspired to do what we aspired to do,\u201d said John Cook, the executive editor of Gizmodo Media Group.The debtors have had settlement discussions with Mr. Denton though they have not reached a final agreement, according to the court documents filed on Wednesday.Gawker Media also settled two other lawsuits, according to the documents \u2014 with Shiva Ayyadurai over a 2012 article about a claim that he invented email, and with the journalist Ashley Terrill over a 2015 article about her efforts to uncover information about a former Tinder executive. Those articles, as well as the one involving Mr. Bollea, will be removed from the internet as part of the deal between the sides.Ms. Terrill will receive $500,000 from Gawker Media, and Mr. Ayyadurai will receive $750,000, according to the court documents. It is not clear if Mr. Thiel was supporting those lawsuits. Charles J. Harder, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who represented Mr. Bollea, also represented Ms. Terrill and Mr. Ayyadurai.\u201cHistory will reflect that this settlement is a victory for truth,\u201d Mr. Ayyadurai said in a statement.If the settlements are approved by the bankruptcy judge, the money would come from the proceeds of the sale to Univision.Founded in 2002, Gawker became a go-to site for New York media gossip and a magnet for young journalists who would later go on to work at places like The New Yorker, The Awl and Time. Mr. Denton was widely known for saying journalists shared their most interesting stories at the bar after work, and his mission was to guide those stories onto his sites \u2014 to entertain and surprise their readers with information that traditional news organizations often shied away from.There had been murmurings for months of a potential settlement between Gawker and Mr. Bollea, but even in the weeks leading up to its sale to Univision, Gawker maintained its typical swagger, hosting parties \u2014 one at a burlesque club in Lower Manhattan \u2014 and publishing articles as part of a \u201csenior week\u201d in August that seemed both to be a collection of pie-in-the-sky stories and a reminder of its brashness.On Wednesday, employees were angry but melancholy. Some wondered why the settlement had come now, after so many months.\u201cObviously, the way that we ran this, we suffered the maximal possible damage and gained the least from it,\u201d said Tom Scocca, the executive features editor of Gizmodo Media Group. \u201cA settlement at this point does nothing to repair any of the harm that was done.\u201dOne longtime employee, Hamilton Nolan, had a more cursory response over email: \u201cUgh.\u201dDavid Streitfeld contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Turning the camera on his fares was a way to displace his rage at the inequities that come with a taxi, where the customer holds all the power and the driver does all the work. Sometimes he snapped people at the beginning of a ride, sometimes after he reached their destination. He mounted a strobe light onto the cab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sun visor using rubber bands.

Trump, with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign slogan, sees an America that has for years been taken for granted by weaker nations and is too quick to intervene in intractable conflicts far away.But in his final news conference on his last foreign trip as president, President Obama argued on Sunday for a foreign policy in which America continues to take on the biggest global problems of the day, lead where others stand on the sidelines and help the least fortunate.Mr. Obama pointed out that before the order imposed in large measure by the United States after World War II, war and famine ravaged the globe. He said that while the United States could not maintain global order on its own, it was the linchpin in ensuring that it continued.China is an important country, he told reporters in Lima, the final stop on his tour, but the Chinese did not organize the Paris climate talks, help write the agreement to reduce global warming or undertake the negotiations ensuring that all parties agreed to it.\u201cRussia is a very significant military power, but they\u2019re not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti.

Peru, like the rest of Latin America, has also been made uneasy by the prospect of a sudden shift in United States immigration policy under Mr. Trump.The atmosphere during this trip has been noticeably different from that of previous ones. Mr. Obama\u2019s schedule has had surprising gaps, when he seemed to have little to do, and staff members \u2014 out of their jobs in two months \u2014 have been unusually somber.Some of the leaders Mr. Obama has met with have grown wistful. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, not known for emotional frankness, seemed genuinely moved when she said Wednesday that \u201ctaking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard.\u201d And on Saturday, President Xi Jinping of China commended Mr. Obama for his intensive focus on their relationship, noting that the two had met nine times, including three times in 2016.But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia betrayed no obvious regret when he met with Mr. Obama for a few minutes on the sidelines of the summit meeting here. Mr. Obama has blamed Russia for deepening the humanitarian crisis in Syria and accused it of meddling in the United States election by hacking into the emails of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has praised Mr. Putin and has openly called for improving ties.Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin looked grim in their brief chat, which Mr. Obama said was \u201ccandid and courteous.\u201d He said he had asked Mr. Putin if they could end the slaughter in Syria or complete an agreement in Ukraine before Mr. Obama left office. At its end, Mr. Obama said, \u201cO.K.,\u201d before a brief and probably final handshake.Mr. Obama ranked the problems resulting from alleged Russian hacking far below those generated by fake news being circulated on social media.\u201cThe concern I had has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that\u2019s put out by any particular party, but a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources, domestic, foreign, on social media, that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Obama said.If elections are \u201cfull of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what\u2019s happening on the outside,\u201d he added. \u201cThe issue is going to be what are we going to be doing to ourselves from the inside.\u201dIn his news conference on Sunday, Mr. Obama suggested, for the first time, that he would continue to be active politically when his presidency ends.He said that at first, he would \u201cget some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking.\u201dBut he added that he reserved the right to speak out.\u201cIf there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislation issue but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think it\u2019s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I\u2019ll examine it when it comes,\u201d he said.Then he said, to laughter, \u201cBut what I do know is that I have to take Michelle on vacation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By 11 a.m., 27,000 election-related posts were swirling across the network every minute.Forget about Snapchat and set aside YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. For all the bluster over the last year about which social media network would dominate the election, 2016 was no different from years past: It was another Twitter moment. From the first presidential debate in September until Monday morning, a staggering one billion-plus election-related posts raced across the network.Election Day was a reminder of Twitter\u2019s influence in media and the distribution of information. While the company is a constant target of Wall Street disparagement for its relatively paltry 317 million monthly users, the site was a go-to for conversation and breaking news about voting activity, malfunctions and results \u2014 with the not-so-periodic joke thrown in. By 10 p.m., 40 million posts had been sent about the election, exceeding the 31 million sent on Election Day 2012.\u201cFor all of its flaws and the badness of the product itself, this election has proven Twitter is vital,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the founder of Stratechery, a technology industry analysis site. \u201cThe immediacy and speed is unmatched by any other network.\u201dTwitter\u2019s Election Day activity was marred by the perception that it has become something of a cesspool for disinformation, intimidation and harassment. Over the presidential campaign, it was criticized as a conduit for anti-Semitic memes, rampant misogyny and racism.\u201cBy allowing everybody equal access, you run the risk that bad actors and hate speech drive out and chill the environment for others,\u201d said Emily Bell, the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.While Twitter has always had its share of users who spread misinformation, the issue has only intensified as the site has grown.\u201cThese are such new technologies in terms of the sweep of history, and this is really only the first election cycle where they\u2019ve been used widely enough to have any insight,\u201d Ms. Bell said.In response, Twitter pointed to its get-out-the-vote initiatives. \u201cOur goal is to increase engagement in the election process and encourage voter turnout,\u201d a Twitter spokesman said in a statement.For Twitter, this Election Day has been a long time coming. The company has been preparing by ramping up its ad sales operation, with teams operating in Washington to sell and fine-tune last-minute ads aimed at undecided voters. Twitter\u2019s Australia engineering team was assigned to support efforts to directly message users with voting information, while the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters was supporting the site long after polls closed.And in one of Twitter\u2019s largest Election Day initiatives, the company last month said it was working with BuzzFeed News on a live video broadcast from New York, alongside a cascade of streaming posts, only on Twitter. Other publishers can embed the broadcast and syndicate it to their websites, complete with the streaming Twitter posts.\u201cThis has been several years in the making, and our whole company is really invested,\u201d said Bridget Coyne, a senior partnerships manager at Twitter\u2019s Washington office. \u201cYou may agree or disagree, but I believe today is a really unifying opportunity to watch.\u201dShe said it was a fitting way to end what she called \u201cthe Twitter election, with every step of the campaign playing out in tweets from voters, candidates and journalists.\u201dMike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}

The Wall Street Journal will publish its final Greater New York section on Saturday, a result of widespread cuts at the paper. The Daily News, whose staff has already shrunk, announced a new round of layoffs this week. The New York Times is rethinking its own Metro coverage as the paper seeks to lure global audiences.Mr. Meyer, who is Mr. Kushner\u2019s brother-in-law, said the decision had been two years in the making and was not related to Mr. Trump\u2019s election this week.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Adds K.T. McFarland to His National Security Team", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump filled two lower-profile but influential White House staff jobs on Friday, while his high-profile candidate for secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, continued to deliberate about whether to join the administration.For the politically sensitive post of White House counsel, Mr. Trump chose Donald F. McGahn II, a Washington election lawyer who pushed to deregulate campaign finance and election laws. The counsel\u2019s job may be even more daunting than it was in previous administrations, given Mr. Trump\u2019s far-flung business empire, with which he shows no inclination toward severing ties.In rolling out the appointments, the Trump transition team lined up testimonials from big names in both parties.Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, regarded as a foreign policy hawk, praised Ms. McFarland, 65, as \u201cone of our country\u2019s most experienced, informed and wise foreign policy and national security experts.\u201d Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat turned independent, was a Yale College and law school classmate of Ms. McFarland\u2019s husband, Alan R. McFarland, a well-known investment banker.Edwin Meese III, an attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. McGahn, who was the general counsel for the Trump campaign, had \u201cdealt ably with the intersection between politics, government ethics and the rule of law.\u201d C. Boyden Gray, a White House counsel to the elder President George Bush, said Mr. McGahn was well suited to the job because of his \u201cserious prior relationship with the president\u201d and his \u201cworking knowledge of government ethics and election law.\u201dA brash, guitar-playing conservative born in Atlantic City, Mr. McGahn learned the fine points of election law from a longtime Republican expert in the field, Benjamin L. Ginsberg.At the Federal Election Commission, where he served five years, including terms as chairman and vice chairman, Mr. McGahn was a powerful voice of opposition to what he often saw as intrusive government meddling in elections. He also spent nearly a decade as the general counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee.Ms. McFarland\u2019s national security experience dates to the Nixon administration, when she was an aide to Henry A. Kissinger. She was a staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, a speechwriter for Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, and the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.She is a familiar presence on Fox News, where she has harshly criticized Mr. Obama over his handling of the Islamic State. \u201cThe president has stuck his head in the sand,\u201d she said in September 2014 after the group had kidnapped and executed two American journalists.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a dereliction of duty,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat was this president doing? Well, he was playing a lot of golf this summer, but he clearly was not attending to the defense of the United States.\u201dIn 2006, Ms. McFarland mounted a bid for the Republican nomination for the Senate in New York. The mayor of Yonkers, John Spencer, defeated her and went on to lose to the Democratic incumbent, Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Ms. McFarland came under scrutiny for gilding her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 claiming, for example, that she had been the highest-ranking woman in the Pentagon when, in fact, two other women outranked her.The deputy national security adviser has one of the most demanding jobs in the West Wing, coordinating meetings of deputies and principals to formulate policies and organizing the vast flow of paperwork from the agencies to the White House.\u201cThat job is the ultimate policy nuts-and-bolts and paper-pushing job,\u201d said Peter D. Feaver, who served in the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt is all about reviewing policies, framing disagreements and teeing up decisions. It is supposed to be the place where bad ideas die, and so places a premium on analytical insight.\u201d\u201cHer early work in the Reagan administration is more important than her recent work on TV,\u201d he said of Ms. McFarland.As Mr. Trumps fills key staff positions, some of his cabinet decisions have become complicated. The search for a secretary of state has bogged down as rival factions argue for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a Trump loyalist, and Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, who stridently opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign.Among those raising questions about Mr. Giuliani is Vice President-elect Mike Pence, according to people in the Trump transition who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. Mr. Pence, they said, has favored Mr. Romney in internal discussions. Reince Priebus, whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff, has said positive things about Mr. Romney but has been more circumspect, and has tried to offer perspective to Mr. Trump on both men.But other people, including Kellyanne Conway, who managed the campaign, have raised questions about Mr. Romney\u2019s loyalty after he became one of the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Mr. Trump has remarked to people that he was surprised by the intense resistance to Mr. Romney.Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump spoke again in recent days, according to people briefed on the deliberations, and plan to speak again early next week. But some of Mr. Romney\u2019s allies, who have no interest in seeing him apologize for criticizing Mr. Trump during the campaign, say privately that his chances of being chosen are dimming.With Mr. Carson, the delay appears to be less about fissures within the Trump camp than within Mr. Carson himself.\u201cHe\u2019s still pondering, believe it or not,\u201d Mr. Williams, his friend, said on Friday. \u201cDr. Carson is very methodical, just like he\u2019s going through a surgery, planning every aspect.\u201dMr. Carson endorsed Mr. Trump after ending his own campaign. But he has appeared conflicted about joining the administration. Last week, Mr. Williams was quoted as saying his friend was reluctant to take a job for which he had no experience and that \u201ccould cripple the presidency.\u201dMr. Carson, however, then took to Facebook, where he has built much of his grass-roots political following, to say his reasons for declining a cabinet job had been misreported. He was on Facebook again on Wednesday, explaining his change of heart.\u201cAfter serious discussions with the Trump transition team,\u201d Mr. Carson wrote, \u201cI feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone.\u201dReporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman and Trip Gabriel from New York, and Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "The Chopped Cheese\u2019s Sharp Rise to Fame", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byThe chopped cheese is a New York success story \u2014 with a somewhat charged twist. The sandwich, also called a chop cheese \u2014 ground beef with onions, topped by melted cheese and served with lettuce, tomatoes and condiments on a hero roll \u2014 has long been a staple of bodegas in Harlem and the Bronx. Now, it has started migrating from grill tops to restaurant menus, from the lyrics of rappers onto the pages of food blogs.But this wider recognition has come with a side of controversy. In June, a video made by a 20-year-old man from Harlem as a retort to a segment about the sandwich went viral, igniting a discussion about culture and privilege. The news that a new restaurant on the Upper West Side would feature a version costing more than $10 provoked another round of criticism. Grab a seat, preferably a park bench. This is a story about how in a country in the midst of a roiling debate about race and class, a sandwich is not just a sandwich. The bodega in East Harlem looks like many others, its awning advertising coffee, candy, and hot and cold sandwiches. But it is the chopped cheese that draws people from far away.This bodega, Hajji\u2019s, is in the midst of a name change to Harlem Taste, an effort, perhaps, to harness its reputation as the birthplace of the sandwich.As with many food dishes, the chopped cheese\u2019s origin is obscured by rumor. Perhaps it was an attempt at a Philadelphia cheesesteak without the right ingredients, or the result of a creative flurry in the hands of an inebriated chef. Whatever it was, it seems to have been born at the intersection of taste and necessity.But talk to some of the workers at Hajji\u2019s and they will tell you about Carlos Soto, a longtime deli man who they said died of cancer in 2014. Carlos created the sandwich at some point during his more than 20 years working at the store, they said. There are a few versions of the story. In one, Carlos chopped a cheeseburger to fit a hero roll after running out of circular buns. Another holds that Yemeni workers came up with the sandwich along with Carlos, perhaps bringing some techniques from their home country. A third posits that Carlos had dental issues and was trying to make a burger easier to chew. For years, the sandwich enjoyed a below-the-radar kind of renown, savored by those who grew up eating it at bodegas across the city, unknown to many others \u2014 and fetishized by a few.Soon as I step out my building, they like I need that / Hajji\u2019s for dinner, them chopped cheese I still eat thatMr. Ramirez said the sandwich was popular with students he used to work with. \u201cYou don\u2019t go out of your way looking for it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable option, and it\u2019s hot and tasty.\u201dWhatever it was, the chopped cheese\u2019s star was on the rise.To many online commenters, the video suggested a kind of imperiousness. Of the sandwich, the reporter, who is white, said that \u201cmost New Yorkers don\u2019t even know it exists,\u201d a slight, it seemed, to many New Yorkers who grew up eating it. It was complimented in a backhanded way as \u201cnothing revolutionary but still delicious.\u201d And it did not help that the reporter called the bread a \u201csub roll,\u201d not a hero, as it is commonly called in New York, revealing herself to be an outsider. But perhaps it was the description of the $4 sandwich as \u201ca steal\u201d that incensed the most. \u201cHate to break this to you Inside Foods, but poor people do exist,\u201d a Facebook commenter wrote.Jeffrey Almonte, 20, a YouTube personality from Harlem, filmed an expletive-laced response in his living room, accusing the reporter of \u201cColumbus syndrome\u201d and comparing her segment to gentrification. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, the chopped cheese made you fear for your life?\u201d he said.\u201cThis is a classic story,\u201d said Michael W. Twitty, a culinary historian. \u201cYou create something in a state of want, a state of necessity, and then it becomes prime real estate in someone else\u2019s hands.\u201dJocelyn Guest, a 32-year-old butcher, said that when she and her business partner, Erika Nakamura, decided to open up a butcher shop and restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan featuring classic New York fare, they had to include the chopped cheese.\u201cIt\u2019s such a huge part of the New York sandwich canon,\u201d Ms. Guest said, who was introduced to it when she lived in Harlem.Ms. Guest and Ms. Nakamura said they could understand the concerns. Ms. Guest, who is from Virginia, said she had watched warily as barbecue took off in popularity in New York. Ms. Nakamura, 36, who was born and raised in Japan, said she noted the ways that Japanese culture, including food, became mainstream. \u201cBut there\u2019s also the idea that this is a celebration,\u201d Ms. Nakamura said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make this sandwich and be billionaires. For us, it\u2019s a genuine and very innocent admiration of what it is.\u201dHajji\u2019s was crowded on a recent Friday night. Femi Agunbiade, 24, had driven an hour from Maplewood, N.J., with his girlfriend to get a chopped cheese. Mr. Agunbiade had first learned about it from a YouTube documentary. \u201cFell in love with it,\u201d he said.At Insider, the reaction to its \u201csub roll\u201d video prompted some sober reflection. \u201cI think we all came to the conclusion that they were right,\u201d said Stephen Parkhurst, a supervising producer. \u201cWe could have approached it with a little more sensitivity.\u201d Mr. Parkhurst said the video team had since adjusted its approach to ensure that ideas were vetted by a diverse group to better filter those that could be \u201cinsensitive or imperialistic.\u201dMr. Almonte, who had harshly responded to that video, was more measured in a later interview. \u201cFor the past few years now, I\u2019ve been seeing this whole thing with the \u2019hood being romanticized or trendy,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t live here want to talk like us, dress like us, act like us, but don\u2019t know the struggle of actually living here.\u201dStill, Mr. Almonte said he enjoyed exploring the city. Lately, he has been spending time in Chinatown, seeking out its reasonably priced foods.\u201cA New Yorker,\u201d he said, \u201cnever stops being a tourist.\u201d Advertisement"}

Mr. Gottheimer declared victory shortly after midnight, although Mr. Garrett did not immediately concede.\u201cThey said this couldn\u2019t happen, that our district was just too partisan, too entrenched,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said at his victory party, which his campaign streamed on Facebook Live. \u201cBut handshake by handshake, call by call, living room by living room, vote by vote, you, all of you proved them wrong.\u201dA ballot measure that would have allowed casinos to be built in the northern part of New Jersey was soundly defeated, while The Associated Press reported that voters approved a second measure that would require the proceeds from a newly increased gas tax be dedicated to the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for infrastructure projects.In races for the state\u2019s other 11 congressional seats, the incumbents \u2014 six Democrats and five Republicans \u2014 were on track to be re-elected.And in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, easily beat Donald J. Trump, a Republican, in the state where he once controlled a casino empire, giving New Jersey\u2019s 14 electoral votes to her. Democratic presidential candidates have won in New Jersey in every election since 1992, when Mr. Clinton was elected.The race between Mr. Garrett and Mr. Gottheimer in a crescent of suburbs and rural communities that runs along New Jersey\u2019s northern border, between the Hudson and the Delaware Rivers, was the state\u2019s most closely watched congressional contest.Mr. Garrett was a founding member of the Tea Party-aligned Freedom Caucus in the House, and is well to the right of the more moderate Republicans that New Jersey has tended to send to Congress.The district is also the only one in the state with relative parity between the two main political parties, with about 140,000 voters registered as Democrats and about the same number as Republicans. About 216,000 voters are registered without a party affiliation.Mr. Gottheimer made Mr. Garrett\u2019s far-right views and votes a key part of his campaign, focusing at times on his opposition to same-sex marriage and reports that he had objected to the Republican Party\u2019s backing for gay candidates to Congress \u2014 reports that Mr. Garrett has denied.Mr. Garrett portrayed Mr. Gottheimer as being too liberal for the district, accusing him of being a typical tax-and-spend Democrat.In the race\u2019s last days, an anti-Semitic flyer emerged showing Mr. Gottheimer with devil\u2019s horns; the flyer had a gothic-style script similar to that used historically in anti-Jewish propaganda. Mr. Garrett\u2019s campaign manager, Sarah Neibart, sent out an email condemning the flyer but also asking whether it was a \u201cpolitical ploy\u201d by the Gottheimer campaign \u201cmanufactured by them to fabricate a hate crime\u201d \u2014 a statement that brought fresh condemnations and counter-condemnations.The gas-tax ballot measure called for amending the State Constitution so that all of the money produced by a recently increased tax would go to the Transportation Trust Fund. Proponents, including unions and many businesses, said it would keep politicians from using the money elsewhere.Opposition to the measure was led by Lt. Gov.

They may have been on the ship. They may have come on later ones, willingly or in chains. They may have come by truck, train or airplane. They came. The journeys play out on the Thanksgiving table as surely as there will be lines to buy television monitors on the morning after the feast.People cook what they like, perhaps especially on holidays. And what they like may be what their parents liked, or their grandparents, their great-grandparents, back before their families were in America, before they were Americans. American tastes arc back over generations. But those same tastes also change over time, especially as hearts swell and new families are born. People cook what the people they love like. That fact changes Thanksgiving. It can make for incredible meals.In the meantime, let\u2019s talk about dinner. Typically on Wednesdays, we don\u2019t cook with a recipe. Instead we go freestyle, off the power of suggestion.Like, for instance: steak tacos. Get some fresh tortillas, some cheese, pick up a couple of skirt steaks. Make salsa: some fresh or canned pineapple, pickled jalape\u00f1os, a healthy couple of shakes of chile powder. Shower the steaks with salt and pepper, and broil them for a few minutes a side until they\u2019re perfect and rare. Warm the tortillas. Grate the cheese. Rest the steak, slice it, and serve with the tortillas, cheese and that (awesome) salsa. Dinner.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.But by coming out of the shadows, undocumented people open themselves to cruelty and threats. Last year, when I helped organize a campus protest to get the University of California to renew funding for some crucial programs for undocumented students, I was called an illegal leech who should be deported. I shrugged it off: I was proud of marching at Berkeley, where the Free Speech Movement started in the 1960s.But looking back, I think I should have made a bigger deal about the maliciousness I witnessed and saw building. A few months later, I received an anonymous email threatening to report my family and me to immigration agents. The threat included details about my actions during the protest \u2014 it seemed to be coming from someone who had seen me on campus. I was so disturbed I stopped attending classes, and even when I returned a week later, my anxiety kept me from engaging in class discussions or focusing on my studies.Soon after that, the Undocumented Student Program began to receive anonymous email threats about students, and a fellow undocumented friend \u2014 a prominent member of the student government \u2014 was told by another student on Facebook: \u201cThanks for identifying yourself as an illegal \u2026 Now get out. I\u2019ll look for you on campus.\u201d All of this information was brought to the administration, but there was no follow-up.Some argue that hateful displays of racism or anti-Semitism are different from the actions of those on campus who yell, \u201cBuild a wall!\u201d But too often, hate speech toward immigrants in this country is written off as political opinion, and school administrators don\u2019t want to side with one political group or another. However, this political issue happens to be our futures, in the country where we grew up.This is not to say that those with conservative opinions should be silenced. But because it is often campus conservatives who complain of the scourge of political correctness, I think it is tempting for college administrators to rally behind conservative students, to see them as the new gadflies, the protectors of free speech. Yet it is comical to think that those of us with lesser rights are somehow infringing on those who have no fear of deportation.What is a matter of political discourse for one group of students can be a threat to the future of another group. The university could best demonstrate its dedication to free speech by dispensing with empty rhetoric and speaking out for undocumented students \u2014 or even by taking a controversial stance on the political issues that affect them.Juan Prieto is a senior at the University of California, Berkeley.Advertisement"}

Trump is provoking a round of backlash on campuses.At the same time, universities are trying to address more generalized fears about the country\u2019s future, organizing campus meetings and counseling sessions and sending messages to students urging calm.\u201cA lot of Muslim students are scared,\u201d said Abdalla Husain, 21, a linguistics major at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who is of Palestinian ancestry. He said some Muslim students on campus were afraid to go outside. \u201cThey\u2019re scared that Trump has empowered people who have hate and would be hostile to them.\u201dAt San Jose State University in California, a Muslim woman complained that she had been grabbed by her hijab and choked. The police are investigating.At Wellesley College in Massachusetts, alma mater of Hillary Clinton, two male students from nearby Babson College drove through campus in a pickup truck adorned with a large Trump flag, parked outside a meeting house for black students, and spat at a black female student, according to campus black student organizations.Incidents were also reported at several high schools. At York County School of Technology in York, Pa., a video circulated of students carrying a Trump sign and yelling \u201cwhite power\u201d as they walked through the hall on Wednesday. \u201cThe whole situation is absolutely horrible,\u201d someone posted on the PTA\u2019s Facebook page.Students at Royal Oak Middle School in Royal Oak, Mich., chanted \u201cbuild the wall\u201d in the cafeteria on Wednesday, according to a statement by Shawn Lewis-Lakin, the superintendent, who said a video was shared on social media.Throughout the week, threatening messages on social media against racial and religious minorities and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have spiked.Racist episodes occur regularly at places throughout the United States, including college campuses. Mr. Trump\u2019s election, though, seems to have worked as an accelerant.But the police said that at least some reported incidents on campuses were fake. A Muslim student at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette who said she was attacked Wednesday by two men \u2014 one wearing a Trump hat \u2014 recanted her story on Thursday, admitting she had made it up, the police said.At Canisius College in Buffalo, in what officials said began as a prank, a black doll was photographed hanging from a curtain rod in a dorm room on Tuesday night. \u201cOne student created a meme with language about \u2018Trump fans\u2019 and sent it to friends,\u201d a university statement said.\u201cIt\u2019s evident that what may have started as a thoughtless, insensitive prank earlier in the evening in the elevator degraded into a very offensive, inappropriate act later that night,\u201d said the statement by John J. Hurley, the college president.Gay, lesbian and transgender students were also concerned, said Patrick R. Grzanka, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee. \u201cOur lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students are deeply concerned about Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter enduring months of homophobic and transphobic rhetoric during the campaign, many of us \u2014 sexual minorities and gender nonconforming individuals \u2014 are asking ourselves, What happens next?\u201dLiberal-leaning college students around the country, in a state of shock over the election\u2019s outcome, gathered in spontaneous protest marches at some campuses and, at others, asked university leaders to schedule meetings across the campus to reflect on the results.Tennessee was among a large array of universities \u2014 public, private, liberal and conservative \u2014 that held meetings for concerned students.\u201cJoin us for a moment of reflection and gathering of solidarity,\u201d the Office of Multicultural Students wrote in an invitation on Wednesday. \u201cCounseling center staff will be available.\u201dThe University of Southern California invited students who had concerns about the election to attend a meeting on Wednesday. About 100 showed up, said Michael Quick, the provost.\u201cWe\u2019re hearing a lot from our students, particularly our Muslim students, given the rhetoric of the campaign,\u201d he said.\u201cGiven the feeling of many students from last year who expressed concerns about diversity and inclusion, now they\u2019re feeling tremendously marginalized,\u201d he added.Stanford University, in a note signed by its president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, said it would offer \u201csupportive resources and opportunities to gather together\u201d in the wake of the divisive election season.Columbia University scheduled what it called a \u201cpost-election conversation and reflection\u201d for its students Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, graduate journalism students at Columbia requested a meeting with faculty members.At Wellesley, which was founded as a safe space for its entirely female student body, the supporters of Mr. Trump driving around campus have rattled students, and administrators have sent a flurry of emails to students this week in response to the episode, which is being investigated by the university police.Wellesley could be considered ground zero for the culture of political correctness that Mr. Trump has criticized; in recent decades, it has introduced guidelines for appropriate language and other protections for addressing racial and religious minorities and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.After the election, even colleges that are unaccustomed to clashes over race or religion struggled to address student safety concerns while fostering free speech. When administrators at Texas State University in San Marcos, which has a mostly minority student body of more than 38,000, learned Wednesday that protests in the campus quad were growing tense, the university president, Denise M. Trauth, tried to head off conflict by releasing a statement to students.\u201cOur aim should be to better understand that which causes divisions among us and to work toward strengthening our bond as a university community. Constructive dialogue is the best way to achieve this goal,\u201d she said.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it would get this bad all of a sudden,\u201d Ms. Cervantes said.Thursday evening, Ms. Trauth issued a stronger statement labeling the pamphlets vandalism and saying, \u201cThreats absolutely have no place on our campus or in a free society.\u201dBut protests continued throughout the day, and students expressed concern about whether the atmosphere on campus would improve. \u201cThis is only two days after,\u201d said Emily Sharp, 21, a senior majoring in communications. \u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019re going to see other people doing these things and thinking it\u2019s O.K.\u201dNiraj Chokshi and Malachy Browne contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

The company said it is expanding its use of metrics services like comScore, Moat, Nielsen and Integral Ad Science, and looking to add others.Facebook said it would form a \u201cmeasurement council\u201d of ad agency executives and marketers to develop metrics suited to the needs of advertisers.\u201cThis is an important evolution for Facebook,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group of media and technology companies, including Facebook. \u201cThis is Facebook saying, Yes, we know that we need to be and are getting more involved in advertising transparency.\u201dThe Facebook data analysts also found that the time spent on what are known as instant articles \u2014 fast-loading news items tailored for easier reading on smartphones \u2014 was overstated on average by 7 to 8 percent, the blog said.But another bug resulted in undercounting a video metric. The Facebook research found that the number of people viewing video ads from beginning to end was 35 percent higher than it had previously calculated.Facebook emphasized that that newly uncovered flaws involve only a few of the more than 220 metrics Facebook deploys.The impact of the disclosure of further calculation miscues, after the September apology, is uncertain. Advertisers and publishers have little choice but to embrace Facebook given its huge audience and its dominance, with Google, of online advertising. Early this month, Facebook reported that its third-quarter profits surged 166 percent from a year ago to nearly $2.4 billion.But analysts said concerns about the accuracy of Facebook\u2019s metrics could prompt some to question whether they should invest so much time, money and resources with the company.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can not use Facebook as an advertiser or as a publisher,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cBut it is a question of who do you prioritize and how many resources do you send that way?\u201dThe moves Facebook has taken are intended to quell such doubts and restore its credibility among advertisers and publishers.\u201cOur goal going forward,\u201d Facebook said in its web post, \u201cis to communicate more regularly about our metrics, so that our partners can focus on doing what they do best \u2014 servicing their customers \u2014 with the best insights possible.\u201dYet a more skeptical view of digital advertising is emerging, not only for reasons of measurement but some major advertisers wonder if it is as effective as they had assumed.\u201cThe ascendant view had been \u2018if it\u2019s digital, it\u2019s better,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cAnd I think with every passing incident, those who have not been appropriately skeptical or appropriately critical have come down to earth a bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking Up With Twitter", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byTwitter, the well-known but less-well-used social network of 140-character quips about the news, is polarizing. You\u2019re either an addict, or you don\u2019t get it.And if you get it, explaining what it is and why you\u2019re on it \u2014 and why you can\u2019t stop looking at it even though you\u2019re supposed to be tending to your 3-year-old at the park, on the swings, where she\u2019s just fallen and hit her face, something that actually happened to me \u2014 can be a challenge even in ordinary times.But the last year and a half were not ordinary times. In the midst of the craziest period of breaking news in recent memory \u2014 not just Donald J. Trump but San Bernardino and Paris and Brexit and Scalia and the Cubs (and did I mention Donald J. Trump?) \u2014 Twitter\u2019s pull grew irresistible, and then overwhelming and then world-swallowing.Historians and media theorists will one day study whether the journalistic corps\u2019s devotion to a platform that prizes cutting remarks over nuance and empathy was ultimately good for the republic. But for news addicts like myself, little of that mattered.The thrill of Twitter in 2016 was visceral and habit-forming. It was the show that never stopped, the fireworks display you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes off even as it grew dangerously bright and transfixing, and then set the whole town on fire and invited floods and locusts and plague, too.But what now? As a business, Twitter had not been having a good run before the presidential election reached its spectacular conclusion. New users aren\u2019t joining the service and longtime denizens have been using it less. When Twitter tried to sell itself this fall, nobody wanted to buy it.Both potential users and would-be acquirers seem turned off by its complexity, its ugliness (Twitter has become a haven for misogynists, racists and other trolls), and most deeply its apparent uselessness for people who aren\u2019t clustered in the bubbles of tech, politics and media.All that considered, Twitter had a good week. On election night, as Americans watched this once-in-a-lifetime election happen, they flooded to Twitter to comment and congratulate and commiserate, sending traffic on the service to all-time highs. On Wednesday, while the shares of most technology companies plummeted, Twitter\u2019s stock rose slightly.Yet it wouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise if this moment turns out to be the peak for Twitter. After the election, a handful of Twitter loyalists confessed to feeling alienation over the role the service played in their lives, and the country, this year.But it was less partisan outrage and more a feeling of exhaustion that inspired a new round of quitter Twitter last week.\u201cTwitter is toxic,\u201d tweeted Steve Kovach, a writer at the Business Insider website who likened the service to an unshakable addiction. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore,\u201d he told me in a private message on Twitter. \u201cI started regularly deleting my tweets this summer and unfollowed everyone and started over. It was driving me nuts and making me sad.\u201d Mr. Kovach said he has had trouble sticking with his self-imposed ban, but that the campaign\u2019s end had strengthened his resolve.Though Facebook is by far the larger and more consequential social network, Twitter functioned as this election cycle\u2019s heartbeat. Just about every story that captivated the campaign either began on Twitter or got its viral energy there; a breaking news event wasn\u2019t really a breaking news event until it was a tweet that could be passed around and commented on, and only then would it hit the wider online and television news circuit.One Friday afternoon near the end of the campaign, exhausted from the constant thrum of news, Ms. Nuzzi said she inadvertently fell asleep at her kitchen table. She woke up to a news release from the Trump campaign defending his words as \u201clocker room talk.\u201dMr. Trump also possessed in spades the primary fuel of every successful Twitter account: a bottomless thirst for promoting one\u2019s supposedly necessary ideas on anything and everything, no matter how frivolous the subject or banal the observation.Though many on Twitter got a laugh out of the president\u2019s line, I suspect more than a few were chuckling inwardly. Mr. Obama\u2019s construction \u2014 \u201cif somebody can\u2019t handle a Twitter account\u201d \u2014 assumed a fact not in evidence: that there are any Twitter users who can actually comport themselves well when presented with the awesome power of an unfiltered text box that instantly goes out to the world.Anyone who\u2019s halfway decent on Twitter lives in constant fear of saying something wrong, and the frisson of danger, the flirtation with getting fired, is both the peril and the promise of Twitter. Perhaps it\u2019s for this reason that Mr. Obama also does not usually handle his own Twitter account; he has the nuclear codes, but Twitter, that\u2019s just too dangerous.The inherent danger of Twitter compounds the mystery of why anyone tweets in the first place. People on Twitter aren\u2019t given to introspection about the service; the things one does on Twitter tend not to be discussed outside of Twitter, for much the same reason that heroin addicts don\u2019t talk with friends and family about their favorite methods of mainlining.When asked in the third presidential debate why he uses the service, Mr. Trump seemed at a loss. \u201cTweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication,\u201d he said. (Fact-check: True!) After reveling in his follower count and the effectiveness of his tweets, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not unproud of it, to be honest with you.\u201dJack Dorsey, a founder of Twitter and its chief executive, declined to be interviewed for this article. But he has often spoken in lofty terms about Twitter\u2019s potential to expand democratic discourse, especially for activists, including the #blacklivesmatter protesters, whom Mr. Dorsey joined on the streets of Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.Over the last few days, I called a number of people who\u2019ve been hooked to Twitter this year to ask why they kept at it, and whether they may stop after the election. What was striking was how many people, unprompted, floated the idea that their use was a result of some kind of addiction.\u201cI think everybody has been really anxious about the election, and for any number of good reasons,\u201d Ms. Jeffrey said. \u201cBut the question we\u2019re not going to have great perspective on is how much social media is the cause of the anxiety, both in a chemical sense \u2014 in the sense of us being addicted to it, like a dopamine drip \u2014 but also because it\u2019s the platform for so much disinformation and hate.\u201dMs. Jeffrey conceded it\u2019s not all anxiety. There have been many moments during the race in which Twitter was collectively thrilling, sometimes even plain fun.When Mr. Trump suddenly announced he\u2019d make a trip to Mexico, or when he set up a table of off-brand raw steaks at one of his campaign events, or when a Twitter user discovered that portions of Melania Trump\u2019s convention speech had been cribbed from Michelle Obama \u2014 at these moments, Twitter exploded in an orgy of jokes. It functioned as group therapy as much as entertainment, a kind of gallows humor in the face of a campaign gone mad.I feel that. Twitter, during this campaign, really did become a second home for me. Sure, it was a home strewn with hot garbage, a haunted house that often pushed me to question my sanity. And one that did little to edify our democracy, that turned every campaign story into a moment for a sound bite or a joke, that promoted the soul-destroying notion that campaign news is best experienced as a kind of spectator sport of warring sides rather than something substantial that, you know, matters to the country and stuff.So it wasn\u2019t a great home. And it\u2019s likely best we all take a break from it for some time. And yet, I\u2019m not unproud of it, to be honest with you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How I Mastered the Art (and Politics) of Cornbread Dressing", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 I just wanted to learn how to make good cornbread dressing. Instead, I stepped on the third rail of Southern home cooking.It started last year, when I tamped down my natural proclivity toward Midwestern bread stuffing in deference to a dish practically every cook here in the South bakes outside the turkey for Thanksgiving. How hard to make could a pan of cornbread dressing be?Very hard, it turns out. My first attempt was lousy. So this year, I got serious. I read every recipe I could find and pinned down the best Southern cooks I know. I asked for help on Facebook, and got more than 100 responses.It wasn\u2019t long before I realized I had plummeted down a rabbit hole. Cornbread dressing is a litmus test on class, race, regional loyalties and grandmothers.The Times asked 15 American families to talk about the dishes on their Thanksgiving tables that speak best to their heritage and traditions, and to who we are. These are their stories.Still, I persevered. The first decision I faced was the cornmeal itself: white or yellow? As with most of my dressing questions, the answer depends on where you grew up.More than a few people told me that white cornmeal is for people and yellow cornmeal is for animal feed. Others were deeply loyal to yellow cornmeal. The regional differences seemed to be based on the kind of corn that grew around you. If the white corn was sweeter, that\u2019s what was ground for cornbread. Same with yellow corn.After running through a couple of recipes with both, I landed on yellow because it gave my dressing a little more muscle and color. Whatever the color, buy the best, freshest cornmeal you can find. A couple of standard grocery-store brands I tried had an oddly pronounced corn flavor that tasted almost artificial.Next came what turned out to be the most divisive issue: whether to use sugar.Jenifer Ward, who lives in Shreveport, La., but grew up in Arkansas, posted an old video on my Facebook page in which her parents stand in their kitchen and repeat a popular refrain about cornbread containing sugar: That\u2019s not cornbread, that\u2019s cake.\u201cCornbread with sugar,\u201d her dad says, \u201cis the kind you get up in Yankeeland.\u201dSweet cornbread, he contends, was indeed part of their food tradition. \u201cA lot of the plantation recipes I\u2019ve uncovered for cornbread often include molasses,\u201d he said, because molasses offered energy and iron to help people get through the day.\u201cThis is political stuff,\u201d he warned.Ms. Lundy, the Appalachian food expert, has been writing about sugar and cornbread since the 1980s. She was reluctant to wade into the mess I had created for myself.\u201cI have black friends who do not put sugar in cornbread and are adamant about it, and white friends in Appalachia who do,\u201d she said, encouraging me to consider instead the effect of generations raised on sweet cornbread from a box.As a white woman with Wisconsin roots raised in Detroit by a mother who rarely made cornbread, I had no stake in the game. I just like my cornbread savory.The next issue is butter or bacon fat. I sometimes bake cornbread in bacon fat, but butter plays better with the other flavors on a Thanksgiving plate.Once I had my cornbread, I had to make a call on texture. Some members of my ad hoc cornbread council pushed me toward a drier, chunkier dressing with a craggy, crisp top. Others insisted I make a batter that bakes into something akin to a souffl\u00e9-like casserole.After a couple of batches, I fell hard for the soft, spoonable Southern souffl\u00e9 style, which doesn\u2019t require cubing and toasting the cornbread. I simply tore it into big chunks and let it dry overnight.Which brings us to the schism over bread. An all-cornbread dressing has its constituency, but I side with those who say dressing requires a little bread to lighten it up.I put all of this in a big bowl, heeding the advice of cooks who suggested adding a couple of beaten eggs. Then I turned my attention to the essence of Thanksgiving dressing: lots of good, homemade turkey stock.The cornbread council was very specific on this point. Add stock until you think you have enough, and then add a cup or two more. The key word is soupy. Massage the mess with your hands. Add more stock, work it in and stop only when the whole thing feels like extra-thick pancake batter with a few chunks. If you have some turkey drippings, stir them in now.This was a perfect base recipe, ready to pour into a buttered baking pan. Those of you who can\u2019t leave well enough alone may brown a little less than a pound or so of spicy Italian sausage or fresh andouille.

{"Headline": "16 Arrested at North Dakota Pipeline Protest", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byTensions continued in North Dakota on Monday afternoon as law enforcement officials arrested 16 people at a demonstration, one day after hundreds clashed with the police over the Dakota Access Pipeline.During a news conference on Monday, officials also defended their use of fire hoses against protesters the night before, despite the below-freezing weather.\u201cSome of the water was used to repel some of the protest activities that were occurring, and it was used at a time where they were aggressive towards the officers,\u201d the Morton County sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, said at the news conference.The statement did not address what dispersal methods the department had used against what it estimated to be a crowd of 400 protesters.The medical teams attributed many of the injuries to rubber bullets, pepper spray and shrapnel from concussion grenades, according to Mr. Goldtooth, and said that water sprayed from cannons caused early signs of hypothermia. The air temperature in the area was about 23 degrees at 10:15 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.\u201cI would love to emphasize here that this entire situation is ripe with irony,\u201d Mr. Goldtooth said, adding that on Friday, Sheriff Kirchmeier had urged the protesters to leave their camps because they might be unfamiliar with the harshness of North Dakota winters.Reports coming out of the conflict have been highly contested, with law enforcement officials and protesters leveling substantive accusations of violence at each other.Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said in a phone interview Monday that the measures law enforcement officials took on Sunday represented a clear escalation of violence.\u201cThe use of water in freezing temperatures just goes to show that they\u2019re being more aggressive and they\u2019re actually trying to hurt people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is far more threatening to human life than any other time of confrontation with law enforcement.\u201dA live video of Sunday\u2019s protests was posted by a demonstrator named Kevin Gilbertt, who identifies himself on Facebook as a poet and videographer. Early Monday morning, the often-grainy and unclear video had been viewed over three million times.\u201cThere\u2019s not another way. We\u2019re building at that location,\u201d Mr. Warren said.Native Americans, environmental activists and others have said that the pipeline, which would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois, threatens the local water supply and would also harm sacred Native American grounds.\u201cOur purpose is to protect the water,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no matter what we do, nobody cares.

{"Headline": "How One Brutal Weekend in Chicago Lives on for Times Team", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byWe had just finished examining all the shootings that took place over Memorial Day weekend, a period often unhappily viewed here as the start of the city\u2019s hottest and most dangerous months. We wanted to better understand the damage for families and neighborhoods \u2014 especially on the city\u2019s West and South Sides, which have been hit the hardest \u2014 and the attempts by the police to slow it. Ultimately, we hoped to gain insight into what is really driving so much bloodshed.Back in New York, designers had created tools to funnel the reporting into a custom interface in real time, allowing for a dramatic presentation that otherwise would not have been possible, and a graphics editor mapped the shootings to show how concentrated they were in certain areas.When it was over, we made plans to keep investigating stories that we thought demanded a closer examination and, crucially, more time spent on the reporting than a single weekend.Around 1 a.m., scanner traffic came in that reported the shooting of a person we would later learn was Veronica. It was sketchy at first: Initial traffic indicated that there was a shooting on the Far North Side of the city. Soon more calls from the police came over the scanners, saying that a victim had been shot on Lake Shore Drive, possibly around the Lincoln Park area, and had been transported to Presence St. Joseph Hospital, a facility close to Lake Michigan. Either way, the location was puzzling; both neighborhoods are typically sheltered from gun violence.Our reporters who went to the scene came away with wrenching details: Ms. Lopez was riding with friends in a Jeep that was driving down Lake Shore Drive when someone pulled alongside them and opened fire. The driver of the Jeep was shot but survived, describing the terrifying scene to Frances Robles, a Times reporter, from his hospital bed. Ms. Lopez, a ninth grader at a Chicago public school, died at the hospital. Megan Specia, a video journalist, interviewed Ms. Lopez\u2019s sister and mother after finding them on Facebook.We were distressed by the violent end of someone so young, a girl who the police said was not in a gang, and we thought Ms. Lopez\u2019s brief life might offer clues for a deeper understanding of the seemingly endless bloodshed in Chicago.Our conversations with Veronica\u2019s mother, Diana Mercado, and often her daughters and other extended family, took place all summer and into the fall. Sometimes we met at a restaurant near her apartment on the Northwest Side \u2014 casual places like Subway or a barbecue chicken chain. Catrin went to a family party one Sunday afternoon where the Mercados celebrated Veronica\u2019s sister Miranda, who was heading off to college in the fall.Almost always, we visited the cemetery. That was where Ms. Mercado spent every Wednesday and Sunday, her days off from work, and she generously allowed us to join her. Sitting on blankets or lawn chairs, notepads and tape recorders scattered around, we talked about Veronica, her four older sisters and Ms. Mercado\u2019s own upbringing in Chicago. Ms. Mercado was a mother in deep grief \u2014 she still is \u2014 but at Queen of Heaven cemetery, she seemed in her most calm and reassured state.videoAdvertisement"}

In 1977, the British publisher Gordon Fraser published Mr. Sykes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos in \u201cOnce a Year: Some Traditional British Customs,\u201d which attracted a small, largely regional following. In the decades since, Mr. Sykes has worked as a magazine photographer and published other books about British culture, including \u201cHunting With Hounds,\u201d \u201cThe Village Pub\u201d and \u201cThe English Season.\u201d A portion of the new photos depict about half a dozen customs that have since disappeared. Farmers in Yarnton, Oxfordshire, for instance, no longer gather on the first Monday following St. Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day to bid on the rights to the hay from the meadows of Pixey, Oxhay and West Mead. In Hartfield, East Sussex, parishioners at St. Mary the Virgin have stopped collecting a dole at the grave of Nicholas Smith on Good Friday. Villagers in Great Wishford, Wiltshire, have abandoned an auction of the Midsummer Tithes, the rights to cut the grass on two parcels of parish lands, on Rogation Monday, one of four days set aside annually to bless the fields and ask for God\u2019s mercy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought it would be a real shame if they were completely forgotten about because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never been published,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sykes said. Still, on trips to re-photograph some of these customs in the 1980s and after 2000,  Mr. Sykes found that less had changed than he imagined. On Boxing Day, in 1971, he was the only photographer to witness five men perform a sword-dance play at various pubs and clubs in Ripon, North Yorkshire. In 2008, when he went back, he was again the only photographer. Some of the customs Mr. Sykes photographed are more popular today than ever, particularly those that have embraced outsiders. In 2009, more than 15,000 people watched a cheese rolling race at Cooper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hill, in Gloucestershire, causing the event to be canceled the following year while local authorities figured out how to better manage the crowds. In Haxey, Humberside, every January, thousands of spectators assemble at a farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s field to follow a scrum as it pushes a leather tube called a hood to a nearby pub. Mr. Sykes hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been back to the centuries-old Haxey Hood game since 1972, he said, as he \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear the thought\u00e2\u0080\u009d of working among throngs of camera-wielding tourists.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the 1970s, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say 99 percent of the time they were very much local events and the people who took part in them were very much part of that particular community. Now, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had publicity on TV and people write about these events in big tourist books,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sykes said.The enthusiasm for local history and heritage has spawned new customs since Mr. Sykes started his project. In the 1980s, in Hastings, East Sussex, Mad Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Morris Dancers revived a local May Day custom, which fell by the wayside in the late 19th century, of parading a heavily garlanded \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack in the Green\u00e2\u0080\u009d character through town. Today, the custom has expanded into a loosely historical four-day Jack in the Green May Day Festival that attracts thousands of people. Organizers call it \u00e2\u0080\u009ca custom for now, not a fossil.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThese events may not be as traditional as those he documented in the 1970s, Mr. Sykes said, but they appeal to the same spirit that most likely inspired all the pole-climbers, bell-ringers and merry-makers of old.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople want to belong, really,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

The company said on Wednesday that sales totaled $6.82 billion for the third quarter, up 59 percent from a year ago. Mobile advertising revenue was particularly strong, accounting for 84 percent of all ad sales. Total profit was $2.38 billion, nearly three times as much as a year ago.Even so, investors were spooked by Facebook\u2019s warning of a likely slowdown in revenue growth next year because of a decrease in what the company calls advertising load, or the number of ads that are inserted into the news feed. Facebook also said 2017 would be an \u201cinvestment year,\u201d with the possibility of increased costs in areas like hiring workers and spending on data centers. The stock sagged 7 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.Much of Facebook\u2019s recent advertising success has been driven by its video ad business, which has experienced tremendous growth over the last year.

Whenever there is a hard problem, but people want to believe in an easy solution, they will be tempted to deny reality and inflate a bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething about the experience of the baby boomers, whose lives have been so much easier than their parents\u2019 or their children\u2019s, has led them to buy into bubbles again and again.\u201dAnd, like speculators in the throes of the dot-com bubble, many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters are mistakenly conflating enthusiasm with success. When faced with bad poll numbers, Republican leaders have responded by citing crowd sizes, \u201cmomentum\u201d and other highly unscientific metrics.The dot-com bubble burst when manic speculation vastly overshot the actual value of fledgling internet companies. The 2008 real estate bubble burst when irresponsible lending, among other factors, led to millions of foreclosures. Whether or not the Trump bubble will burst could remain a political question for decades to come.\u201cNo matter what happens in this election, what Trump represents isn\u2019t crazy, and it\u2019s not going away,\u201d Mr. Thiel said on Monday. \u201cHe points toward a new Republican Party beyond the dogmas of Reaganism. He points even beyond the remaking of one party to a new American politics that overcomes denial, rejects bubble thinking, and reckons with reality.\u201dAfter his talk was over, the journalists in the room were barred from leaving until Mr. Thiel had safely left the building, so as to ensure no pesky follow-up questions.

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s Why You Should Call, Not Email, Your Legislators", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byKara Waite, an English teacher at Bunker Hill Community College in Charlestown, Mass., made a rule for herself: For every political rant she posts on Facebook, she must pick up the phone and call a legislator.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a swear jar for political action,\u201d Ms. Waite said recently.Activists of all political stripes recommend calling legislators, not just emailing \u2014 and certainly not just venting on social media. Several lawmakers, along with those who work for them, said in interviews that Ms. Waite is right: A phone call from a constituent can, indeed, hold more weight than an email, and far outweighs a Facebook post or a tweet.To understand why, it helps to know what happens when someone answers the phone at a legislator\u2019s office.Emily Ellsworth, whose jobs have included answering phones in the district offices of two Republican representatives from Utah \u2014 Jason Chaffetz, from 2009 to 2012; and Chris Stewart from 2013 to 2014 \u2014 said the way your points reach a lawmaker depends on how many calls the office is getting at the time and how you present your story.In some cases, it\u2019s a simple process. When a caller offered an opinion, staff members would write the comments down in a spreadsheet, compile them each month and present reports to top officials, she said. If the lawmaker had already put out a statement on the issue, the staff member would read it to the caller, she said.\u201cIt brings a legislative issue right to the top of the mind of a member,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes it impossible to ignore for the whole staff. You don\u2019t get a whole lot else done.\u201dWhen her branch in Utah received a lot of calls, she contacted the Washington office and coordinated the messaging, involving the communications director, the legislative director or the chief of staff, Ms. Ellsworth said.While scripts found on the internet can be useful for people uncomfortable talking on the phone, she suggested making the phone calls as personal as possible. In some cases, if she was moved by a call, she would pass on the comments to her district director, she said.\u201cWhat representatives and staffers want to hear is the individual impact of your individual story,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t listen to people\u2019s stories for six to eight hours a day and not be profoundly impacted by them.\u201dA New York State Senator, Phil Boyle, a Republican, said that one of his staff members would contact him after a constituent called his office, and that he would try to call everyone back. That\u2019s a perk exclusive to those who call in, since he sometimes gets more than 300 emails per day, he said.\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly do that for emails,\u201d Mr. Boyle said.Most calls can be handled by staff members, said Brian Kolb, the Republican minority leader in the New York State Assembly. Many callers just want to express an opinion and don\u2019t even offer a name, he said.In other cases, callers who want to talk out an issue more fully could be directed to a staff member who has expertise in the area, said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat in New York.Ms. Waite, who has had a calendar reminder for each Monday morning alerting her to \u201ccall party leadership,\u201d said that first-time callers often fear they will be quizzed or interrogated, but that they generally just need to offer their opinion and basic personal information, like name and city.She implored people to be courteous, since the staff members might be getting many calls.\u201cCommunicate in a way that someone can\u2019t ignore,\u201d Ms. Waite said.An earlier version of this article misstated the position of Brian Kolb, a Republican lawmaker. He is the minority leader in the New York State Assembly, not the Senate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion Begins to Speak Out About Dressing and Covering the Trumps", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayNonetheless, last week, Sophie Theallet, a French designer and self-described \u201cimmigrant\u201d to New York who has made a signature out of elegance for all body types and ages, became the first C.F.D.A. member to declare publicly that she would not dress Melania Trump.Ms. Theallet posted an open letter on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter explaining her position and inviting fellow designers to join her.But Ms. Trump has not been associated with any of Ms. Theallet\u2019s looks, and it is unclear whether the soon-to-be first lady had any intention of asking to wear Ms. Theallet\u2019s clothes, so it is possible the stand is less dramatic than it first appears.As of Monday, four days later, no other designer had officially joined Ms. Theallet\u2019s cause, and she was declining all requests for further comment on her stand and on how it had been received.Still, it broke the ice.(Again, Ms. Trump has not been associated with Opening Ceremony or with Kenzo.)\u201cWe plan on having no part in normalizing the Trump family, particularly when it comes to cataloging the first lady\u2019s fashion choices,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAs individuals, we don\u2019t want to contribute to humanizing or making light of an administration that poses such serious threats to women, minorities, immigrants and more, and that has so many other troubling implications that we can\u2019t ignore \u2014 but that we also can\u2019t talk about in sufficient depth, because this is first and foremost a site about fashion and beauty. We won\u2019t go so far as to say we\u2019ll never write about what Ms. Trump is wearing, but we\u2019re going to reserve it for strictly newsworthy occasions.\u201dAs to what those may be: the Met Gala, state dinners, the usual. What they may not be: stepping off Air Force One.It will be interesting to see if such public statements of intent continue. More common, so far, has been the reaction of another designer, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not ready to take an official position, but who told me that he had been contacted by a member of the Trump family who wanted to borrow a dress for a public occasion. The designer said that he simply pretended he did not get the message.In any case, the conversation is heating up and the stakes are rising.One designer, Tommy Hilfiger, who has an office in Trump Tower, told WWD this week that he would have no problem dressing the new first lady.\u201cI think Melania is a very beautiful woman, and I think any designer should be proud to dress her,\u201d Mr. Hilfiger told WWD.Personally, I think it makes more sense for everyone involved to take a deep breath and see what happens when President-elect Trump actually goes to Washington.It is absolutely fair to ask questions and to watch closely: the choices Mr. and Ms. Trump make about how they use (or don\u2019t use) what they wear; whether they support homegrown industry or, as in the past, brands made overseas; what messages they send with their clothes \u2014 if they are about aspiration (the Reagan model), or accessibility (the Carter model), or diplomacy (the Obama model), or something altogether different (given the campaign, very possible).And it is fair to ask whether \u2014 if American fashion designers want to make a statement \u2014 it is ultimately better to reject an American president or to try to effect change from within, in whatever way the industry can.There will be plenty of time to judge, and plenty of evidence to judge by, when Mr. Trump actually takes office. That judgment will start with what is worn to the inauguration, an event that will send a very clear signal about his and his family\u2019s intentions when it comes to sartorial semiology: whether it will be full of content, or simply style and fancy, signifying nothing.Then we can all stop guessing, and start assessing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good at Skipping Ads? No, You\u2019re Not", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I don\u2019t often watch late night television, which may be why I was caught unawares. Jimmy Fallon\u2019s opening monologue began hilariously enough, when abruptly he pivoted to a series of inexplicably weak jokes centered on a forthcoming football game. It slowly dawned on me that I was watching a commercial for NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d albeit one baked right into the opening monologue and delivered by Fallon himself.The realization that something you thought to be \u201creal\u201d is actually an advertisement is an increasingly common, if unsettling, sensation. Mara Einstein calls it \u201ccontent confusion,\u201d and if her book, \u201cBlack Ops Advertising,\u201d is right, we\u2019re in for even more such trickery, indeed a possible future where nearly everything becomes hidden commercial propaganda of one form or another. She forecasts the potential of a \u201cworld where there is no real content: Everything we experience is some form of sales pitch.\u201dEinstein, a former advertising executive turned media professor (who, among other things, worked campaigns for Uncle Ben\u2019s and Miller Lite), makes it clear that things were not always this way. Once upon a time the line between editorial and advertising, if not exactly a Chinese wall, was somewhat clearer. Einstein\u2019s well-researched and accomplished book is mainly about the effort to tear down that wall. The sledgehammers and pick axes in this case are things like \u201csponsored content,\u201d \u201cnative advertising\u201d and \u201ccontent marketing\u201d designed to fool you into thinking they are real. Such stealth advertising may entertain or inform, yet it also brands, or more cleverly, facilitates a later branding exercise or sales pitch. The handoff can be smooth enough that you don\u2019t notice you\u2019ve been steered to exit through the gift shop.\u201cBlack Ops\u201d presents some startling examples of stealth advertising. Remember that guy who in 2012 jumped out of a helium balloon at 128,000 feet for a new world record? Covered widely in the media, it was all, according to Einstein, a disguised Red Bull marketing campaign, but one where Red Bull\u2019s role was so discreet as to be almost invisible. You may also recall the audacious \u201ctagging\u201d of Air Force One by a graffiti artist named Marc Ecko, which has been viewed nearly a million times on YouTube. It was a hoax intended for the branding of a clothing and accessories label. That \u201cad\u201d fooled so many members of the public and press that it was awarded the top prize for digital media at the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival.The book is slightly guilty of exaggerating the novelty of present-day advertising techniques. Content that doubles as brand advertising is not exactly new. In the 1980s, \u201cThe Transformers\u201d and \u201cG.I. Joe\u201d were popular children\u2019s cartoons but also advertisements, and so of course was the much beloved \u201cMickey Mouse Club\u201d back in the 1960s. The idea of inventing media stories for commercial purpose also has a long pedigree, dating to at least the late 1920s, when Lucky Strike staged a protest (the \u201ctorches of liberty\u201d) featuring attractive women demanding the right to smoke outdoors as a part of suffragist liberation (yielding, ultimately, an equal right to lung cancer). Subliminal advertising, perhaps the blackest of all black ops, was popular in the 1950s, until it was banned.The difference, Einstein argues, lies in how much effort is going toward the dark arts. It is, she suggests, for one simple reason: that we, the public, are so good at avoiding or ignoring traditional advertising. We are fickle fish, cynical creatures who have already been hooked so many times that the simpler lures no longer work.We avoid ads using devices as simple as the remote control (originally conceived as an ad-avoidance technology) and as sophisticated as ad-blocking phones (thanks, Apple). Many of us have developed a mental blindness that helps us see through advertising as if it were not there. Indeed, ad avoidance has become a lifestyle, so much so that some people will simply declare, \u201cI don\u2019t watch advertising\u201d the same way one might declare adherence to a gluten-free diet.Einstein\u2019s book wanders from its main topic into a fuller review of contemporary advertising practice, including pseudo-engagement on social media, mass harvesting of private data and other unappealing practices. Perhaps the most important contribution she makes is providing a clear sense of what free content actually costs. There was a time when the idealists among us prophesied that the 21st century would be a golden age of free stuff, powered by a culture of sharing, and that targeted advertising would be a blessing for consumers. Today that vision has soured and even seems like a bad joke given how plagued we are by the rise of stealth advertising, the invasions of privacy, the proliferation of clickbait and stalking advertising, and the general degradation of much of the web.Einstein is not enthusiastic about contemporary advertising practice, and few of us are likely to regard constant deception as attractive. But what\u2019s the remedy? One, briefly mentioned by Einstein, is legal. The Federal Trade Commission regards advertising posing as legitimate content to be an illegal form of \u201cconsumer deception.\u201d Einstein calls for more enforcement, but admits that it\u2019s not easy. What does one do, for example, about the many movies (like \u201cThe Transformers\u201d) and reality shows (\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d) that are simultaneously entertainment and advertisement?Einstein is not the first former marketing executive to turn on her profession; James Rorty, in 1934, wrote of his colleagues: \u201cThey are dead men. Their bones are Bakelite. Their blood is water, their flesh is pallid \u2014 yes, prick them and they do not bleed.\u201d But unlike Rorty, who wanted to destroy advertising, she would prefer to save it: She is nostalgic for the recent past, when audiences sitting through commercials made deception unnecessary. But if that\u2019s the remedy, it is a lost cause: No one who figures out how to avoid advertising willingly goes back.Einstein too quickly discards the most important remedy for advertising\u2019s abuses: paying for content. A broader historical view can remind us that ad-supported media competes with paid media (like HBO, film, books). Those who don\u2019t want to live in a world constantly trying to trick us into watching ads may have the most impact by voting with their dollars and starving the beast of the attention it needs to survive. Paying for things (Facebook, if it let you pay, Einstein tells us, might be $12 a year) strikes at the heart of the business model, and indeed a partial revolt is already underway, as suggested by the popularity of advertising-free subscription services like Netflix.It is a reminder that advertising- supported entertainment is hardly indelible or eternal, but a relatively recent invention whose future is insecure. From this perspective, the rise of black ops advertising may be less a sign of power than of desperation.Tim Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside our Heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A Hindu tailor was killed in April, and a Hindu priest was hacked to death in July. A terrorist attack in Dhaka in July left 22 people dead. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her governing Awami League party have accused the Islamist opposition of fomenting this terrorism. In this context, the news that Awami League politicians may be implicated in recent attacks on Hindu homes and temples is profoundly disturbing.Rasraj Das, a Hindu man, was accused of posting the image and arrested. But, on Nov. 6, Bangladesh\u2019s minister of fisheries and livestock, Sayedul Hoque, said: \u201cRasraj Das didn\u2019t upload that image demeaning religion in Facebook. According to an intelligence report, it was posted from Dhaka,\u201d though by whom is not clear.A Bangladeshi Supreme Court lawyer and civil rights activist, Jyotirmoy Barua, has warned that social media is being used in Bangladesh to foment violence against minorities and that \u201cusers who are not very tech-savvy\u201d are susceptible to having their accounts hijacked. Mr. Rasraj, who is illiterate, appears to be a pawn in someone else\u2019s dangerous game.Dozens of suspects in the attacks have been arrested, and the police officer in charge in Nasirnagar has been suspended from his duties. Bangladesh\u2019s National Human Rights Commission has begun an investigation into the attacks, calling them a \u201cpreplanned conspiracy.\u201d While the Awami League has suspended three local leaders for their involvement in the attack, a thorough investigation must determine who exactly was responsible for posting the offending image, and to what end.The Awami League prides itself on being the party of pluralism in Bangladesh.

Women with terminal diseases cast their votes with hope, saying that at least they would live to see the election of a female president.Throughout the day Tuesday, many women supporting Hillary Clinton said they could already hear the sound of glass shattering.Instead, Donald J. Trump won the presidency, beating the only woman to ever come close to the Oval Office. The success of the Republican real estate mogul left many American women in a state of shock over a victory they had counted on belonging to them, their sisters, aunts and girlfriends. Late into the night, mothers said they were not sure how they were going to break the news to their sleeping daughters in the morning.At what was supposed to be the Pennsylvania Democratic Party\u2019s celebration in Philadelphia, several devastated women were lying on the carpeted ballroom floor, tears welling.

Throughout the campaign, plenty of Democratic-leaning women said they never felt much enthusiasm for her candidacy. On Tuesday night, many female Trump supporters began to rejoice with the gusto that Clinton supporters thought they would feel.But as the campaign drew to a close, many women had allowed themselves to imagine what a first female president would look and feel like. Five-star generals saluting a female boss. An empty spot at the first lady\u2019s inaugural gown exhibit at the Smithsonian. A resonant handoff in January, with the first African-American president passing the baton to the first female one. In the days before the election, a private Facebook group of Clinton supporters, called Pantsuit Nation, grew to three million members, an online hotbed of anticipation and premature triumph.As Mr. Trump pulled ahead in the Electoral College count, many female Clinton supporters said they were experiencing a depth of loss and frustration that some of the women, especially the young ones, had never felt before.\u201cWas excited and ready for history to move forward tonight, not 100 years back,\u201d Maggie Kyle, a 19-year-old student at Emory University in Atlanta, said in an email.

What were they to make of the election of a man many considered an open misogynist, who had bragged of groping women and made disparaging comments about their bodies?Sitting on the floor at what was supposed to be the Philadelphia celebration, Tanisha Humphrey, 26, clasped her hands in front of her face and looked stricken as she watched the returns on a big-screen television. \u201cI\u2019m a gay woman, I\u2019m a black woman, I\u2019m a woman. I just wonder what kind of future there is for me,\u201d she said. She volunteered at age 15 for Barack Obama, then a state senator in Illinois, and later moved to Washington to work for his Labor Department and came to Philadelphia to canvass. To see Mr. Obama replaced with Hillary Clinton would have been one thing, she said; to see him replaced with Mr. Trump is quite another.Late Tuesday, the mood in the Pantsuit Nation Facebook group swung quickly from celebration to pained examination. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? Who will we be for the next four years?\u201d someone asked. When one woman said she would never vote again, the others rallied with reassurances. They would organize and resist, they said.

{"Headline": "Long Island Village Votes to Disband 6 Years After Incorporating", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byBut now, after an experiment in municipal governance that spawned political infighting, fear of rising taxes and lagging services, residents have voted to abolish the village.\u201cIt sounded good, but ultimately the village government wasn\u2019t working,\u201d said Harry Janssen, an airline mechanic who grew up here and voted on Nov. 16 to disband.Proponents of the village government six years ago had pledged that the 13,000 residents would receive better services, especially in the area of code enforcement, and would pay no additional tax, since the town taxes would fall as village taxes rose. But critics, including the current village mayor, Maura Spery, said residents were sold a bill of goods.\u201cThe village was created on the lie that it would be tax-neutral,\u201d Ms. Spery said in an interview in her cramped office this week. \u201cBrookhaven has the advantage of economies of scale in carrying out services.\u201dLast spring, Ms. Spery proposed a $4.7 million budget that would have raised taxes by 125 percent, resulting in an annual increase of $250 to $300 per household. Instead, she said, the village board rejected the plan, passing a $3.8 million budget that involved layoffs and cuts in services.\u201cA village can be a very effective form of government, but it costs more than being an unincorporated hamlet within the town,\u201d said Ms. Spery, who remained publicly neutral on the issue of dissolving the village.The results of the referendum were somewhat lopsided, with 1,922 residents voting to eliminate the village and 1,215 to keep it. The Town of Brookhaven, which had been widely criticized for ignoring Mastic Beach\u2019s illegal rentals and quality-of-life issues, has promised to work with the village government on the transition of power.Rather than gloat, the town supervisor, Edward P. Romaine, said in a statement that he and other town officials would soon meet with the village board to start transferring responsibility, a process that could take up to two years.\u201cDuring that time, the town will reach out to the residents and community leaders to address their concerns and put together a plan to improve the community of Mastic Beach,\u201d Mr. Romaine said.Some residents expressed mixed feelings about giving up local control, pointing out that the village government had cracked down on unkempt properties. \u201cThe village was good in a lot of ways,\u201d said Angela Nuccio, the owner of John\u2019s Pizzeria, located in the small business district along Neighborhood Road here. \u201cBut people got scared about the taxes.\u201dMrs. Nuccio, who has lived in Mastic Beach for 43 years, did not reveal her position on the referendum. \u201cPeople would be in here yelling and screaming,\u201d she said, \u201cso I tried not to talk about it.\u201dHelen Lefkowitz, a 74-year-old retired home health aide, voted to disband the village but now has some trepidation about returning to Brookhaven. \u201cIt\u2019s an unnecessary layer of government,\u201d she said, referring to the village. \u201cBut I hope the town doesn\u2019t neglect us.\u201dDespite its proximity to the water and its million-dollar views, Mastic Beach has remained a modest community where people can still snap up a house for under $200,000. It was settled after World War II primarily by residents of Brooklyn, in particular working-class Italian-American families from the Bensonhurst neighborhood.There were pleas from both sides, with some, like Nicole Chakmakian, saying that she was willing to pay higher taxes in order to correct the blight that had crept over Mastic Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we remind ourselves why we created our village in the first place,\u201d Ms. Chakmakian posted. \u201cStated simply, it was formed for our survival, as the Town of Brookhaven was slowly destroying our home.\u201dSome residents in favor of abolishing the government criticized village cronyism and renegade operations. They cited the actions of a former village administrator who had conducted illegal background checks on nearly 500 residents.Mr. Janssen, the mechanic who voted to disband the village government, cited the illegal background checks as the final indignity. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were getting our money\u2019s worth,\u201d he said dryly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Democrats, a Last Faint Hope to Gain a Senate Seat", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 The punk club was dark and packed, the lead singer of the band Hurray for the Riff Raff warming up a crowd of the young, the bearded and the well-tattooed. A little after 9 p.m., in came the headline act: a necktie-wearing cattle rancher, public service commissioner and United States Senate candidate from Elm Grove, La., who owns a half dozen hunting dogs and five times as many shotguns.Because of Louisiana\u2019s curious election process \u2014 a nonpartisan, free-for-all primary on Nov. 8, leading to a runoff of the two top finishers on Dec. 10 \u2014 the race to replace Senator David Vitter, a Republican, is the last major national vote of the season. The stakes are lower than they might have been, with Republicans holding a majority of at least 51 seats in the Senate no matter what happens here.\u201cHonestly it doesn\u2019t look like Campbell has much of a path to victory,\u201d said Gregory C. Rigamer, a pollster in New Orleans who has done analysis for a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Kennedy.Still, Mr. Campbell does have one thing on his side: panicked urgency among Democrats nationwide.\u201cAt this moment I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to feel like our entire democratic institution is potentially under threat,\u201d said David Skeist, 37, an actor in New York, who donated several hundred dollars to the Campbell campaign after reading about it on Facebook. Mr. Skeist knows that Mr. Campbell does not see eye to eye with him on some issues he considers important, like transgender rights or reproductive choice. But at the moment, Mr. Skeist is not alone in seeing full agreement as an unaffordable luxury.The actress Rosie O\u2019Donnell has highlighted the Campbell campaign on Twitter. The actor John Leguizamo urged people to donate, as did the comedian Patton Oswalt, who reposted an appeal for campaign donations with the words, \u201ceveryone please.\u201dMr. Campbell spoke at the punk club rally of \u201cover a million dollars\u201d in donations, made and pledged to his campaign in just a few days. The money has been accompanied by offers of assistance, including from a group of dejected Clinton backers in Portland, Ore., who will be working the phones for Mr. Campbell in the coming days.\u201cI think people feel pretty helpless,\u201d said Susan Feldman, 68, who helped organize the Oregon group. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Look, there\u2019s still a little bit of something that we can do.\u2019\u201dAs with practically everything else in politics this year, the dynamic in Louisiana would baffle a time traveler from the not-too-distant past. Mr. Kennedy began his political career as a Democrat who supported abortion rights; he supported John Kerry for president only 13 years ago. But he moved right, the party moved left, and like most white politicians in the Deep South, he eventually switched parties. Now known for his high-profile attacks against government spending, Mr. Kennedy describes himself as a rock-ribbed conservative, as different from Mr. Campbell \u201cas gumbo and grits.\u201dMr. Kennedy\u2019s previous left-of-center history has not been ignored by Mr. Campbell, a man who, according to Donald G. Kelly, a former Democratic state senator, \u201cprobably owns more guns than half the people in the state of Louisiana.\u201d That each candidate has been accused of being liberal would mystify anyone from New York City.\u201cLook, I know them both,\u201d said Elliott Stonecipher, a political consultant from Shreveport, La., who first met Mr. Campbell when they were both public schoolteachers in the 1970s. \u201cThe three of us could sit around in a living room and talk politics and as long as Foster Campbell doesn\u2019t have a chance to attack oil and gas, there\u2019s not going to be a smidgen of difference.\u201dThat is a bit of an overstatement: Mr. Campbell was alone among the major Senate candidates here talking openly about human-caused climate change; he also supports an increase in the minimum wage and promises to vote against any repeal of the Affordable Care Act.But Mr. Campbell\u2019s fondness for bashing the oil and gas companies, along with the railroads, the tobacco companies, the payday loan companies and a long list of other corporate targets, makes him an interesting figure in a party suddenly trying to figure out how to regain support among the rural working class.\u201cI see all the great things the Democratic Party has done in the past: Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Truman,\u201d Mr. Campbell said in an interview in Baton Rouge, La., which ranged in topic from rural phone lines to his yearning for a processing tax on oil and gas. \u201cIt concerns me when country people all across America vote for Republicans, and by and large, they don\u2019t help those people,\u201d he said.On certain matters, like border security, trade deals and a desire for big infrastructure projects, Mr. Campbell does not sound terribly different from the president-elect. His sworn enemy is not Trumpism per se, but the business-cozy politics of either party: corporate subsidies, tax loopholes and the tendency of \u201ctap dancing politicians\u201d to do the will of big companies. The news of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to investment banks made him \u201csick to my stomach.\u201dThat may not be precisely what his new, Trump-dreading fan base wants to hear. But he is a Democrat and math is math.\u201cO.K., so he\u2019s an older white man from northern Louisiana,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. He\u2019s not for everything she wants. But she liked what she read of his views on equal pay legislation and climate change. And at the moment, \u201cIt is, in some ways, \u2018What are the choices?\u2019\u201dAn article on Sunday about the Louisiana Senate race misspelled the surname of the actor who donated money to the campaign of one candidate, Foster Campbell. He is David Skeist, not Skeits.Advertisement"}

Dealing with angry or impatient clients, they sometimes had to endure abuse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if not outright racism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of their accents, he said. Yet little by little, he was able to not just get into the call centers but also into the home lives of the workers, for whom the job provided not just much-needed income, and a window to the world on the other end of the line.Mr. Sarmento Matos worked for a while at the London call center because it gave him flexibility to take on assignments. But his time there piqued his interest. His bosses gave him permission to take pictures at the office, which would turn out to be a dry run that let him figure out how to photograph inside less-than-picturesque workplaces. He started reading up on the industry, learning that while it had first boomed in India, the Philippines now led the world in such centers. Still, he noticed that there wasn\u2019t much photographic documentation of the workers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find anything about their lives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much do they earn? How important is this job for them? Does it help their families or not? I wanted to have answers to this.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat curiosity led him to embark on a continuing project on call centers, which he hopes to ultimately expand to other countries.Getting in was not easy. In India, none of the four centers that had agreed to participate would let him in. Part of the reason, Mr. Sarmento Matos said, was not only did they not understand the nature of his project, but some of them also handled sensitive information, like credit card numbers. It took almost three weeks before he was finally let inside a center.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to do something to humanize these people we speak with, not anything about bad job conditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople think that in India you were going to find some hole and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be bad. Actually, I was impressed. The new call centers are in new buildings. I have seen worse conditions in Europe.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHis goal, to get inside the lives of the workers, took more time. But as they got used to him being in the office, they slowly let him tag along when they went home or out socializing. The people he photographed in Mumbai and Pune, India, earned anywhere from $200 to $800 a month, he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a country where people have problems finding jobs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about engineers, people with degrees who do not have a job, and they find that working at a call center lets them have some money and help their families. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best career in the world, but it helps.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe scene in the Philippines was different, with a flourishing industry and higher wages, which Mr. Sarmento Matos said could have some families earning as much as $1,400 a month. That, and their daily exposure to another culture every day, allows them to travel abroad.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become trendy to work there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem for the future because people won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finish their education because they know they can get twice as much in a call center than working as a nurse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Among their new targets: working-class Americans frustrated by an economy that is no longer producing the middle-class jobs they or their parents once held.Many of these workers voted for Donald J. Trump.\u201cA whole bunch of us out there are not doing well,\u201d Scott Courtney, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union and one of the chief architects of the Fight for $15 campaign, said in an interview last week.\u201cIn red states, blue states; black, brown, white \u2014 people are hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cSixty-four million of them don\u2019t make $15 per hour.\u201dAs part of the push, thousands of workers turned out in dozens of cities on Tuesday to demand a $15 wage, better working conditions and the right to unionize. Thousands of airport workers, including baggage handlers, cabin cleaners and wheelchair attendants, loomed at the center of the protests, demonstrating and even walking off the job at some of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, like O\u2019Hare International in Chicago.Leaders of the Fight for $15 highlighted the symbolic importance of the airport workers, whose jobs decades ago paid a living wage. More recently, the jobs have become a source of financial hardship as outsourcing to nonunion contractors has taken its toll \u2014 a dynamic arguably central to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.In other cases, blue-collar workers have lost high-paying union jobs at factories and replaced them with lower-paying jobs at nonunion factories or e-commerce fulfillment centers.\u201cWe\u2019re shining a light on a part of the economy that used to be living-wage work,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which has spent tens of millions of dollars on the Fight for $15 campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re joining with fast-food workers, child care, home care, which have never been living wage work.\u201dOrganizers said that in addition to extending the movement to a different profile of job, they believed the Fight for $15 campaign had to become more disruptive to achieve a new round of victories. The campaign had already planned Tuesday\u2019s protests before the election, but leaders say the imperative for sowing chaos became all the more urgent after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.For example, the idea of workers striking at airports, as opposed to just protesting there, came about after the election.In Chicago, hundreds of demonstrators representing labor unions, churches and community groups converged at O\u2019Hare. Stretched along the walkway between Terminals 2 and 3, the protesters chanted, sang, beat drums and blasted trumpets.In Los Angeles, several thousand workers turned up to protest around noon on a major airport access street, including Ashley Adams, 25, who had been arrested earlier at a rally outside McDonald\u2019s on accusations of stopping traffic and disturbing the peace. \u201cWe really need to fight for this,\u201d said Ms. Adams, who takes orders at a pizza restaurant and makes a bit more than $8 an hour. \u201cI want to see my baby grow up being able to afford basic things and survive.\u201dThere is no question that the incoming Trump administration presents obstacles to the Fight for $15 movement. In recent years, the Service Workers and other unions helped change labor law doctrine as it relates to employers like contractors or franchisees that have a relationship with larger, more profitable companies.Under Mr. Trump and his future appointees to the labor board, this so-called joint employer doctrine is almost certain to be undone, making organizing fast-food workers through traditional means nearly impossible.In other ways, however, the Fight for $15 movement is very much built for the Trump era, having never relied excessively on the Washington power structure to sustain itself.Many of the movement\u2019s successes came in cities and states, where its pressure helped enact new minimum wage laws, and with individual employers whom the movement helped persuade to lift wages voluntarily.\u201cIf a messiah was going to save us, that person is in the White House right now,\u201d Mr. Courtney said. \u201cBy himself or herself, no president can make this happen.\u201dJanice Fine, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, said one possible animating principle for the organizations that emerge from the Fight for $15 could be enforcement of minimum wage laws, and other laws affecting paid leave and scheduling, once they are enacted.None of these innovations \u2014 whether the uniquely public form of bargaining or the creation of worker organizations focused on enforcement \u2014 require the assent of officials in Washington or the blessing of federal labor law.Not all of the recent gains for workers are the doing of the Fight for $15 and other advocacy efforts, of course. Some of the changes, particularly in the private sector, simply reflect employers\u2019 need to raise wages to fill jobs in a tightening labor market.Critics argue that while the Fight for $15 has engineered significant wage increases for many workers, the movement will be harder pressed to notch victories in the future.\u201cThey used low-hanging fruit to create a sense of momentum, but it was always limited\u201d to certain states and jurisdictions, said Michael Saltsman of the business-backed Employment Policies Institute.Mr. Saltsman said he expected a backlash to the recent minimum wage increases as \u201cthe bill starts to come due for the policies over the next year,\u201d by which he meant the possibility of layoffs and the outright failure of businesses as wage increases take effect.Other critics have pointed out that whatever the gains for workers, the tens of millions of dollars the Service Employees have poured into the campaign has netted the union little in the way of new members (although existing members have been beneficiaries of the recent wage increases).But Ruth Milkman, a sociologist who studies labor at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York, rejected that analysis. She said unions simply had a different calculus than corporations, which are more focused on the bottom line, and called the Fight for $15 campaign \u201cthe single most important initiative on the labor front in the last few years.\u201dReferring to the tens of millions of dollars that the union spent on the recent presidential election, Ms. Milkman added, \u201cI suppose they could have given more to Hillary Clinton, but that might have been a worse investment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a wheelchair assistant who protested on Tuesday at O\u2019Hare Airport.

{"Headline": "Time to Dump Time Zones", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byOpinionWe will awaken Sunday to yet another disturbance in the chronosphere \u2014 our twice-yearly jolt from resetting the clocks, mechanical and biological. Thanks to daylight saving time, we get a dose of jet lag without going anywhere.Most people would be happy to dispense with this oddity of timekeeping, first imposed in Germany 100 years ago. But we can do better. We need to deep-six not just daylight saving time, but the whole jerry-rigged scheme of time zones that has ruled the world\u2019s clocks for the last century and a half.The time-zone map is a hodgepodge \u2014 a jigsaw puzzle by Dal\u00ed. Logically you might assume there are 24, one per hour. You would be wrong. There are 39, crossing and overlapping, defying the sun, some offset by 30 minutes or even 45, and fluctuating on the whims of local satraps.Let us all \u2014 wherever and whenever \u2014 live on what the world\u2019s timekeepers call Coordinated Universal Time, or U.T.C. (though \u201cearth time\u201d might be less presumptuous). When it\u2019s noon in Greenwich, Britain, let it be 12 everywhere. No more resetting the clocks. No more wondering what time it is in Peoria or Petropavlovsk. Our biological clocks can stay with the sun, as they have from the dawn of history. Only the numerals will change, and they have always been arbitrary.Some mental adjustment will be necessary at first. Every place will learn a new relationship with the hours. New York (with its longitudinal companions) will be the place where people breakfast at noon, where the sun reaches its zenith around 4 p.m., and where people start dinner close to midnight. (\u201cMidnight\u201d will come to seem a quaint word for the zero hour, where the sun still shines.) In Sydney, the sun will set around 7 a.m., but the Australians can handle it; after all, their winter comes in June.The human relationship with time changed substantially with the arrival of modernity \u2014 trains and telegraphs and wristwatches all around \u2014 and we can see it changing yet again in our globally networked era. We should synchronize our watches for real.I\u2019m not the first to propose this seemingly radical notion. Aviation already uses U.T.C. (called Zulu Time) \u2014 fewer collisions that way \u2014 and so do many computer folk. The visionary novelist Arthur C. Clarke suggested a single all-earth time zone when he was pondering the future of global communication as far back as 1976.Perhaps you\u2019re asking why the Greenwich meridian gets to define earth time. Why should only England keep the traditional hours? Yes, it\u2019s unfair, but that ship has sailed. The French don\u2019t like it either. \u201cThe U.K. would turn into a time theme park,\u201d suggested an English Twitter user, John Powers, \u201cwhere you could experience 9 o\u2019clock as your grandparents knew it.\u201dPeople forget how recent is the development of our whole ungainly apparatus. A century and a half ago, time zones didn\u2019t exist. They were a consequence of the invention of railroads. At first they were neither popular nor easy to understand. When New York reset its clocks to railway time on Sunday, Nov. 18, 1883, this newspaper explained the messy affair as follows:\u201cWhen the reader of The Times consults his paper at 8 o\u2019clock this morning at his breakfast table it will be 9 o\u2019clock in St. John, New Brunswick, 7 o\u2019clock in Chicago, or rather in St. Louis \u2014 for Chicago authorities have refused to adopt the standard time, perhaps because the Chicago meridian was not selected as the one on which all time must be based \u2014 6 o\u2019clock in Denver, Col., and 5 o\u2019clock in San Francisco. That is the whole story in a nut-shell.\u201d\u201cThere was much talk of relative time, physiological time, subjective time and even compressible time,\u201d wrote the French novelist Marcel Aym\u00e9 in \u201cThe Problem of Summer Time,\u201d a 1943 time-travel story. \u201cIt became obvious that the notion of time, as our ancestors had transmitted it down the millennia, was in fact absurd claptrap.\u201dAym\u00e9 was reacting in part to the politicization of time zones: The Nazis imposed Berlin time on Paris when they occupied it in World War II. It is no less political today, no less arbitrary, and no less confusing. Last year North Korea set its clocks back 30 minutes to create an oddball time zone all its own, Pyongyang time \u2014 just to show that it could, apparently. China has established a single time zone across its breadth, overlapping six time zones in its northern and southern neighbors.It might seem impossible to imagine all the world\u2019s nations uniting behind an official earth time. We\u2019re a country that can\u2019t seem to get rid of the penny or embrace the meter. Still, the current system is unstable, a Rube Goldberg contraption ready to collapse from its own complexity.The human relationship with time is changing again. We\u2019re not living in the railroad world anymore. We\u2019re living in a networked world \u2014 a zone of experience where the sun neither rises nor sets. What time zone governs Twitter? What time is it on Facebook? There\u2019s plenty to argue about in cyberspace, as in the real world. We could at least agree on the time.James Gleick is the author, most recently, of \u201cTime Travel: A History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Schools That Work", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byBOSTON \u2014 Alanna Clark still remembers the stress of third-grade reading time. When her class read books together aloud, Alanna would often become confused. She didn\u2019t understand how her classmates could answer the teacher\u2019s questions about the book so quickly. As they did, Alanna was still just trying to take in the words.\u201cIt was frustrating, because I used to think, maybe I\u2019m reading the wrong part,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t.\u201dAlanna had a reading disability, and she was falling behind. Her mother repeatedly asked the school for help, without success \u2014 and then began to fear that a pattern was repeating itself. Alanna\u2019s sister, who was 12 years older, had also struggled in school. But schools kept promoting her, until she eventually made it to community college, where, unprepared, she flunked.Charter schools \u2014 public schools that operate outside the normal system \u2014 have become a quarrelsome subject, of course, alternately hailed as saviors and criticized as an overrated fad. Away from the fights, however, social scientists have quietly spent years analyzing the outcomes of students who attend charter schools.The findings are stark. And while they occasionally pop up in media coverage and political debates about charter schools, they do not get nearly enough attention. The studies should be at the center of any discussion of educational reform, because they offer by far the clearest evidence about which parts of it are working and which are not.The briefest summary is this: Many charter schools fail to live up to their promise, but one type has repeatedly shown impressive results.Hannah Larkin, the principal at Match, refers to such schools as \u201chigh expectations, high support\u201d schools. They devote more of their resources to classroom teaching and less to almost everything else. They keep students in class for more hours. They set high standards for students and try to instill confidence in them. They focus on giving teachers feedback about their craft and helping them get better.\u201cMy mother has been teaching forever. My father has been teaching for 10 years,\u201d Christopher Perez, a physics teacher at Match, told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t get observed. I get observed every week and have a meeting about it every week.\u201dWhile visiting Match, I was struck that teachers hardly seemed to notice when I ducked into their rooms, midclass, to watch them. They are obviously used to having observers. They welcome it, as a way to improve.Crucially, the researchers took several steps to make sure the findings were real. They compared lottery winners with losers, controlling for the fact that families who applied for the lotteries were different from families who didn\u2019t. They also counted as charter students all those who enrolled, including any who later left.When you talk to the professors about their findings, you hear a degree of excitement that\u2019s uncommon for academic researchers. \u201cRelative to other things that social scientists and education policy people have tried to boost performance \u2014 class sizes, tracking, new buildings \u2014 these schools are producing spectacular gains,\u201d said Joshua Angrist, an M.I.T. professor.Students who go to Boston\u2019s charter schools learn reading and math better and faster than students elsewhere. They are more likely to take A.P. tests and to do well on them. Their SAT scores are higher than for similar students elsewhere \u2014 an average of 51 points higher on the math SAT. Many more students attend a four-year college, suggesting that the benefits don\u2019t disappear over time.The gains are large enough that some of Boston\u2019s charters, despite enrolling mostly lower-income students, have test scores that resemble those of upper-middle-class public schools. The seventh graders at the Brooke Charter schools in East Boston and Roslindale fare as well on a state math test as students at the prestigious Boston Latin school, the country\u2019s oldest public school and a school with an admissions exam.A frequent criticism of charters is that they skim off the best students, but that\u2019s not the case in Boston. Many groups that struggle academically \u2014 boys, African-Americans, Latinos, special-education students like Alanna \u2014 are among the biggest beneficiaries. On average, notes Parag Pathak, also of M.I.T., Boston\u2019s charters eliminate between one-third and one-half of the white-black test-score gap in a single year.When I spoke with Alanna, she told me she aspired to go to Johns Hopkins and become a surgeon. \u201cSince people didn\u2019t want to help me,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to help others.\u201dSo why isn\u2019t there a national consensus to create more of these schools?Because the politics of education are messy.First, no school can cure poverty on its own. At Match, for example, only about 55 percent of students go on to graduate from a four-year college. That\u2019s much higher than at most public schools, but I\u2019ll confess I still find it a bit disappointing because it means some charter graduates still struggle. And when we journalists write about schools (or most anything else), we often emphasize the negative. We have paid more attention to controversies \u2014 like harsh suspension policies in some places \u2014 than to an overwhelming pattern of success.Finally, no matter how successful charters may be, they undeniably make life uncomfortable for some people at traditional schools.But it would also shrink traditional public schools, and many school boards and teachers unions around the state are fighting the ballot initiative. Elizabeth Warren, the state\u2019s senior senator, opposes it, too. The critics argue that Massachusetts should instead focus on improving traditional public schools.For anyone who sees some merit on both sides, I\u2019d encourage listening to Susan Dynarski, one of the researchers who conducted the Boston study.A University of Michigan professor (and Times contributor), Dynarski is a proudly progressive former union organizer. She told me that she had agonized over being on the opposite side of an issue as some of her friends and usual allies.\u201cThe gains to children in Massachusetts charters are enormous. They are larger than any I have seen in my career,\u201d Dynarski wrote. \u201cTo me, it is immoral to deny children a better education because charters don\u2019t meet some voters\u2019 ideal of what a public school should be. Children don\u2019t live in the long term. They need us to deliver now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Move to another country.After the news of Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election was confirmed early Wednesday, many Americans apparently considered doing just that.Remi Lariviere, a spokesman for the Canadian immigration agency, confirmed Wednesday morning that the cause was \u201ca significant increase in the volume of traffic.\u201dBy then, the site was taking about half a minute to load but was accessible shortly before 8 a.m. Eastern. \u201cMove to Canada\u201d remained among the top trending search topics on Google.There is no way, of course, to be sure how serious these queries are. And experts point out that anyone seeking refuge in another country would be hard-pressed to escape the global effects of a new American administration or outlook on the world.Stephen J. Farnsworth, a co-author of the 2013 book \u201cThe Global President: International Media and the U.S. Government\u201d and a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, said that escaping to Canada would not shield you from the influence of a President Trump.\u201cAmerica\u2019s global reach being what it is, the impacts that America has in the world will also follow you wherever you go,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions that the U.S. makes with respect to NATO policy, for example, would be part of your experience if you move to say, a NATO country.\u201d(Canada is one of the founding members of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.)Of course, many of those exploring their options would be fleeing not just the new president and his policies, but also the America that voted for him. And Canada was not the only country people appeared interested in checking out.Many people who already have or are close to achieving dual citizenship in other countries and the United States said they were considering staying in, or leaving for, their alternate homelands.And some of those without citizenship considered returning to one of the many nations \u2014 including Israel, China and Ireland \u2014 that offers \u201cright of return,\u201d an easy path to citizenship for those with some form of heritage related to that country.(For Jews, moving to Israel is known as making Aliyah.)Julian Edward Toles, 27, an essayist living with his girlfriend in Barcelona, said that while he had already started to look into the benefits of Spanish citizenship, which he could obtain were he and his girlfriend to marry, he was now thinking \u201cmuch more seriously\u201d about getting residency rights.\u201cTrump and his promises to uphold \u2018law and order\u2019 frankly scare me,\u201d Mr. Toles, who is black, said in a Facebook message. \u201cI fear for my personal safety as the worst of what we\u2019ve seen from his campaign becomes a daily reality.\u201dOscar Barajas, a 36-year-old with Mexican citizenship living in Chicago, said that while he was about to get his American citizenship, he \u201cwas not so happy to join after Trump\u2019s election.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t plan to leave because Trump won, but I can say I at least would be fortunate to go back to my country if he makes the U.S. a place where I wouldn\u2019t like to start a family,\u201d he said. \"I know so many people who are noncitizen and are scared about this situation.\u201dOthers advised that those upset about the election stay and ensure that their rights are upheld.Asked about what he would tell a Muslim mother of three who was worried about her future in the United States, Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights group, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think leaving the country is what anyone would recommend.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re Americans like all other Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re not going anywhere, and we\u2019re going to defend our rights and the rights of all Americans regardless of who\u2019s in the highest office in the land.\u201dHe did say, though, that he had been getting emails of friendly concern from Muslims in Canada.They\u2019re \u201csaying, \u2018what\u2019s going on down there?\u2019 \u201d he said, chuckling at the emails. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s chillier up here but it\u2019s nice.\u2019 \u201dAlexandra Andreeva, 27, a dual citizen of Bulgaria and the United States, said that her \u201cfirst instinct after learning the results of the election\u201d was to return to the European Union. But she said her strong identity as an American made her feel responsible to the United States, where she moved from Bulgaria when she was 6 years old.\u201cBecause I was born under communism, which is the opposite of liberal democracy, I would say that I feel even more compelled to stay here and to continue the fight,\u201d she said.Mr. Farnsworth said, \u201cEvery four years, people talk about leaving the U.S., but it\u2019s really striking how few do.\u201dIt is not necessarily easy to become a Canadian citizen, despite the country\u2019s reputation for niceness. The country is in search of university students and highly skilled workers; for those who do not fit into those neat categories, it would be far more difficult to find a place in the country.\u201cI\u2019m often amazed by people who describe themselves as patriotic being so willing to move away if they don\u2019t like the outcome of a presidential election,\u201d Mr. Farnsworth said. \u201cThe consolation for losers every four years is the recognition that there is no permanent majority and no permanent minority in American politics.\u201dIf you don\u2019t like the political outcome, it\u2019ll probably change in two years or four, he added. \u201cAnd then a whole \u2019nother set of people can talk about moving to Canada.\u201dFollow Jonah Engel Bromwich on Twitter @Jonesieman.Advertisement"}

It called Mr. Justice \u201cthe best of a questionable lot.\u201dWhen is a Tea Party candidate not a Republican? When he runs as a Democrat.Pennsylvania\u2019s Ninth Congressional District, in the central and southwestern part of the state, has long been a safe Republican seat. Bud Shuster held it from 1973 to 2001; his son, Bill, has held the seat since then. That is more than four decades of single-family Republican control.Some members of the party \u2014 including Art Halvorson, a retired Coast Guard captain who calls himself a \u201cconservative Christian, Tea Party-backed Republican\u201d \u2014 are unhappy about this. Mr. Halvorson lost to Mr. Shuster in a primary, but 1,069 ticked-off voters wrote his name in on the Democratic side. So the Tea Party Republican is the Democratic nominee.Voters are confused.\u201cSome of Halvorson\u2019s own voters may abandon him, because they can\u2019t stomach voting for a Democrat,\u201d said David Wasserman, who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cBut he\u2019ll win some Democrats, who don\u2019t know he\u2019s a Tea Party candidate.\u201dMr. Morrissey, a former Virginia state lawmaker, is running for mayor of Richmond.He has been able to draw from a strong base of support among black and working-class voters, driven by his charisma and familiarity, and is a top contender in a crowded field.\u201cYou start to say, my gosh, how does this guy keep coming out of the ashes?\u201d said Dan Palazzolo, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond.But Richmond\u2019s odd election rules could favor a candidate with localized support, which Mr. Morrissey has. A candidate must win five of the city\u2019s nine districts to declare victory on Election Day. If that does not happen, there is a runoff.\u201cIt\u2019s astounding,\u201d Mr. Palazzolo said. \u201cHe could be our mayor.\u201dThe wife of a candidate for county commissioner in Travis County, Tex., looked at the camera dryly as her husband nattered incessantly about details of county policy.\u201cPlease re-elect Gerald\u201d to get him out of the house, pleaded Charlyn Daugherty. \u201cPlease.\u201dIt was a strategic gambit for a down-ballot Republican in unfriendly territory, since Travis County, which contains Austin, is reliably Democratic.

A picture is an act of speech, and given our modern reliance on social media sites to disseminate all human information, a picture is among the only speech acts people will actually pay attention to.Or at least \"like.\"The people most inclined to take ballot selfies are exactly the kind of social media \"influencers\" for whom documenting their vote is more powerful than any stodgy, written endorsement. The people following Justin Timberlake on social media might not be reading the Tennessean, scanning to see if J.T. has weighed in. But they will notice his ballot selfie on Instagram, and they may be inspired to bring participation back.Given the importance of the speech act, the state needs a compelling reason to take it away. But let's remember, right now, it's perfectly legal to tell everybody who you voted for. It's also perfectly legal to lie to everybody about who you voted for. In this election especially, I expect there will be a lot of the latter. A ballot selfie is just a neat way to show you're not a hypocrite. I wish Paul Ryan had taken one. The state shouldn't prevent people from being proud of who they voted for, just for the sake of those who are not.\nWhoa, how did we go from a shameless attempt to get noticed on social media to a dystopian vote buying regime? Donald Trump hasn't won anything, yet. The mere fact that ballot selfies could be used inappropriately doesn't mean that they will be.We have laws against voter fraud, and laws against voter intimidation. Rick, you know that those laws generally work. You know that we should be more worried about people who seek to suppress voting than we are about actual voters using their power unethically. It seems to me that the amazing benefit (or great danger) of ballot selfies is that they can be used to facilitate \"vote swapping.\" Vote swapping is when you live in a safe state and you \"pair\" or \"trade\" your vote with a person supporting a nonviable, third-party candidate who lives in a battleground state. On Facebook, I myself suggested pairing my vote with a friend in Nevada: I would cast his ridiculous protest vote in New York, he would cast his vote for the candidate I want to win in a state that matters. We could record our votes and put them on Facebook, to ensure no funny business. If ballot selfies are used to encourage young people to vote, I'm O.K. with them. If they're used to subvert the disenfranchisement inherent in the Electoral College -- potentially bringing about the needed revolution in our national elections -- I'm in love with them. If they're used to intimidate voters or buy votes, I'm confident that we can bring the abusers to justice, without harshing on a millennial's freedom of expression.\nMy 20-plus years of studying elections and election law has convinced me of the virtues of the secret ballot. If we are really concerned with the integrity of elections, as we all should be, we should do what we can to make sure people cannot prove how they\u2019ve voted. We know vote buying and coercion were problems before the secret ballot, and we know that they can be a problem with absentee ballots.

I had essays to write and Italian vocabulary to learn. Sure, I kept New York Times and Wall Street Journal tabs open on my laptop, but I was uninterested in indulging in conversation about an election that most everyone could agree was a time bomb.As a student at New York University and the daughter of a civil servant at the United States Department of State, I am familiar with political unrest and its potentially disastrous outcomes in the arms of ignorance and hysteria. I did not hold any particularly strong opinions about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. If I had voted, however, I would have picked Mr. Trump. I was focused on school. I had no idea that a few days later I would be dismissed as a \u201cTrump supporter\u201d and a person of \u201cprivilege\u201d who \u201creflected an us versus them mind-set\u201d in an essay by my college roommate in this publication \u2014 an essay that would go viral and change my life.I did not feel that I should lie to my new college friends, especially at N.Y.U., where we are supposed to be open to hearing opposing views, able to discuss them and put any bias aside. I never tried to persuade my roommate to accept my side, my choice or my views. I even agreed with some of her opinions about Mr. Trump, who has said divisive things about Muslims and other minority groups. As an independent, my feelings toward the campaign were very mixed. I felt strongly that as a country we needed to focus on domestic issues, and for me, the Republicans were more prepared to do that.My roommate has since apologized to me, but in the meantime I have felt the glare of her friends and been heckled on campus by other students. I have been labeled \u201cracist,\u201d \u201csexist\u201d and \u201cxenophobic\u201d on Facebook. I have been called a \u201cwhite without a conscious,\u201d a \u201cmisogynist,\u201d a \u201cbigot\u201d and a \u201cbarbarian\u201d online by people all over the country.Here\u2019s my story. My father is Hispanic. My extended family lives in Southern California and New Mexico. Many of my family members are not native English speakers. My maternal grandmother is an Italian immigrant who holds a green card. Her husband died after struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism; she had to work two jobs to make ends meet. My mother was raised by her stepfather, who is African-American and the only maternal grandfather I have known. He is a kind, devout man whom I love dearly. My family and friends come from all ethnicities, religions and sexual orientations.Attending New York University was my dream. My dad grew up in a trailer home, and my mom was homeless for a period of time. My parents were the first in their families to graduate from college. They have struggled to provide the best for me and my brother. They have sacrificed financially and worked hard to give us a good life. I came to N.Y.U. partly on scholarship and am accruing debt to pay my tuition.As minorities, my mother, father, grandparents and I have experienced racial hate. My skin may be light, but I understand discrimination. I may not know each person\u2019s individual experience, but am able to empathize with others.On Election Day, as it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the next president, I tried to reassure my roommate that I was sensitive to her politics and personal concerns about a Trump administration. I sent her lengthy texts trying to express my hope for reconciliation.I know the fear that the election has inflicted. I comprehend the hurt that people feel. We all have reasons for casting our votes. What I do not understand is hatred toward one another. Supporters of both parties have misunderstood and fueled hate out of reckless emotion and ignorance.The answer is not to further the divide by labeling and dehumanizing one another. We should fight the \u201cus versus them\u201d mind-set. We have spent too much time in our own bubbles, and we need to begin a dialogue that will allow us to understand one another.Blind fear and hatred are far more powerful than any candidate. How can we assume we know someone based on the color of their skin, their religion, or their political choices? Why should we be afraid to express our opinions? If we see one another not as a Clinton supporter or a Trump supporter, but as human, perhaps we can discover empathy in the troubled nation in which we exist.K.N.

Like this: \u201cLady Gaga Protests on Sanitation Truck Outside Trump Tower,\u201d read Breitbart\u2019s headline for its article on her tweet.And when Vice President-elect Mike Pence caught a performance of the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton\u201d on Friday, one of the show\u2019s stars addressed him on behalf of \u201cthe diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us.\u201dPostelection, Breitbart may appear little different from any celebrity-news aggregator. But the site\u2019s greater political context, as a breeding ground for extremists, adds another layer. Breitbart is the site that boosted Stephen K. Bannon to a thought leader. (Once the site\u2019s executive chairman, he took a leave of absence to steer Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and now has a top White House position.) With that in mind, an article calling attention to Ms. Dunham\u2019s Jewish faith feels like a bone thrown to the site\u2019s white nationalist readers. And the catalog of slighted celebrities starts to read like something of a star-studded enemies list.These right-wing aggregators make sure that any leftist celebrity\u2019s political reach will be neutralized by a backlash from people who don\u2019t idolize and agree with them. None of that is likely to stop celebrities from using their own soapboxes to promote their politics. But they would be smart to consider how their words will play on other platforms, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "One hundred years ago today, Jack London died in Sonoma County, Calif., at the age of 40. He was famous for novels, like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Call of the Wild,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which were based on his adventures, trekking through the Klondike or sailing the South Pacific. He was the archetype of the macho writer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before Ernest Hemingway \u00e2\u0080\u0094 having been, among other things, a Socialist, a hobo, a sailor, a war correspondent and an oyster pirate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey would steal the oysters that other people had caught,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his great-granddaughter Tarnel Abbott said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was rough. He could have been killed anytime during those escapades. His boat eventually was ransacked and burned. He had to give that life up and straighten out.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor work from the early 20th century, the writing feels strangely contemporary. The first-person narration could be straight from a blog post, and his language, both flowery and direct, easily holds our attention. While researching \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe People of the Abyss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his nonfiction book about living in London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s then-notorious East End in 1902, he tried without luck to hire a fixer from the travel agency Thomas Cook, then donned lower-class attire to blend into the area (which is now the trendiest part of the city).\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d London wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctottery old men and women were searching in the garbage thrown in the mud for rotten potatoes, beans and vegetables, while little children clustered like flies around a festering mass of fruit, thrusting their arms to the shoulders into the liquid corruption, and drawing forth morsels but partially decayed, which they devoured on the spot.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Abbott, who has performed a version of her great-grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Iron Heel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which she said predicted the rise of fascism, agrees that his work has a particular resonance today.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn many ways he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still very modern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a harsh, harsh world. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy from it, either, with the camera or the writing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The photographs in London are compelling: from a drunken girl fight and food lines, to people sleeping on benches with cricked necks. Later, while serving as The San Francisco Examiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correspondent to the Russo-Japanese War, he had his camera confiscated by the Japanese military and was detained because he broke protocol and photographed some local boys in the street.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his photographs of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, however, that are perhaps most gripping. He had been hired by Collier\u2019s magazine to document the disaster, as he lived just north of the city. He described the obliteration, which was total.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d London wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSan Francisco is gone. Nothing remains of it but memories and a fringe of dwelling-houses on its outskirts.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe told tales of fortunes that vanished in an instant, and a man who offered $1,000 for a team of horses, yet found no takers. His presence as observer and commentator, not to mention local resident, gives today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s viewers a sense of how it must have felt. Those are the photographs that most affect Ms. Abbott, who fears the Bay Area \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where she also lives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is overdue for another big one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose earthquake photos are stunning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsolutely magnificent. It kind of gives me goose bumps to even be thinking of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSeeing refugee camps in the middle of one of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important cities is also a reminder that other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suffering is not that far removed from our own, a valuable lesson in the midst of the 2016 European migrant crisis. San Francisco may have been razed, but it has fought its way back, 110 years later, to be wealthier and more powerful than ever before. And like the England of Jack London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, the problem of homelessness seems to be overwhelming San Francisco at present.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so reminiscent of what we see today. There are so many homeless people sleeping on our streets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Abbott said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI look at pictures of London in 1902. It could be Oakland or San Francisco in 2016. These are haunting images, as they should be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Google Rebuts Antitrust Claims in Europe", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTo many Europeans, Google represents Silicon Valley\u2019s perceived stranglehold on the digital world. But on Thursday, the American search giant tried to portray itself as a stalwart of online competition as it responded to European antitrust charges that it had restricted consumers\u2019 choices and hamstrung its competitors.Google responded on Thursday to two European antitrust charges, saying that its services helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find the digital information they seek online. The company said that the strength in Europe of other American technology companies, like Amazon, showed that Google had not restricted the local digital market.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cWe\u2019re confident these cases will ultimately be decided based on the facts,\u201d he wrote, adding that Google\u2019s products \u201cbenefited consumers and merchants, and expanded competition.\u201dGoogle worries that Europe\u2019s antitrust efforts may eventually hurt its lucrative business model, particularly if it is forced to open up some of its dominant digital services to rivals.For the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, the standoff with Google has become a litmus test for its ability to rein in a dominant technology company, one that has a roughly 90 percent market share in online search in the region. A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment on Google\u2019s antitrust response.The end to the back and forth will not come overnight. The European authorities must now review Google\u2019s rebuttals, and decisions in the cases are not expected until early next summer. The company can then appeal, prolonging the legal wrangling.But for Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, an online marketplace for Android smartphone apps, who has filed a complaint against Google, the antitrust cases are necessary to give European companies the space to compete against their much larger American rival.\u201cOur growth is being slowed down because of Google\u2019s dominant position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s at stake.

{"Headline": "Seattle Seahawks Stave Off Late Rally to Beat Buffalo Bills", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported bySports BriefingJimmy Graham needed only one hand to catch two first-half touchdown passes from Russell Wilson, and the Seahawks held off a late rally for a 31-25 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Monday night in Seattle.The Seahawks won their 11th straight Monday night game behind a huge game from Graham, a tight end. Still less than a year removed from a major knee injury, Graham used his right arm to catch a 17-yard touchdown pass from Wilson on the first play of the second quarter and later used the same arm to cradle an 18-yard touchdown pass in the final moments of the first half.But the Seahawks had to hold on as quarterback Tyrod Taylor led the Bills inside the Seattle 10 in the final seconds.Taylor was sacked by Cliff Avril on a third-and-goal from the 8, and on fourth-and-goal, Taylor\u2019s pass into the end zone fell incomplete.Jets Coach Todd Bowles said he needed to see how Fitzpatrick, who sprained a knee ligament in the third quarter of the Jets\u2019 27-23 loss at Miami, fared at practice before deciding who would start against the Los Angeles Rams at MetLife Stadium on Sunday. Bowles emphasized that Fitzpatrick\u2019s health \u2014 and not any desire to gauge Petty\u2019s viability at quarterback \u2014 would be the determining factor.\u201cWe\u2019re 3-6: We\u2019re down, not out,\u201d Bowles said in a teleconference Monday. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not worried about turning the page. I\u2019m worried about who gives us the best chance to win. Right now, Fitz gives us the best chance to win if he\u2019s healthy.\u201dIn Sunday\u2019s loss to the Dolphins, Fitzpatrick threw two interceptions, including one in the end zone in the fourth quarter, to run his league-worst total to 13. Benched before reclaiming his starting job when Geno Smith hurt his knee, Fitzpatrick is unlikely to be demoted again unless the coaching staff determines that it should begin evaluating Petty, a fourth-round pick in the 2015 draft who completed both of his pass attempts in Fitzpatrick\u2019s absence.The Jets\u2019 chances of making the playoffs are minuscule; with seven games remaining, they trail Denver, which is line for the A.F.C.\u2019s second wild-card berth, by three games. But Bowles has been adamant that the team is focusing only on the present. He said Fitzpatrick would have to practice at least on Friday and reveal a strong understanding of the game plan to warrant consideration for Sunday. BEN SHPIGELCal Clutterbuck and Andrew Ladd scored 1 minute 39 seconds apart midway through the third period to lift the Islanders over the Vancouver Canucks, 4-2, at Barclays Center.It was the Canucks\u2019 ninth straight loss.Jason Chimera and Nikolay Kulemin also scored, and Jaroslav Halak stopped 30 shots for the Islanders, who won for just the second time in seven games (2-3-2).Daniel Sedin scored and Ryan Miller had 28 saves for Vancouver, which is 0-8-1 since opening the season with four wins.Rafael Nadal expects to return from a wrist injury to play in an event in the United Arab Emirates in late December.The event is not connected to the ATP Tour and will be held in Abu Dhabi from Dec. 29 to 31.Last month, Nadal had said he was cutting short his 2016 season to fully recover from an injured left wrist that sidelined him for more than two months this season.Gary Cohen, a voice of the Mets for the past 28 seasons, first on radio and then on television, was named one of eight finalists for the Ford C. Frick Award, which is presented annually to a broadcaster by the National Baseball Hall of Fame.Among the other finalists are Ken Harrelson (Chicago White Sox), Pat Hughes (Chicago Cubs), Mike Krukow (San Francisco Giants) and Dewayne Staats (Tampa Bay Rays).This is the first year with a new nominating procedure for the award.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When August Sander conceived of the structure of his ambitious portrait series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople of the Twentieth Century,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his goal was to document the German people in a way that rejected the era\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social divisions. Starting in the mid-1920s  and through the rise of Nazism, he became keenly aware that the notion of cataloging a people sometimes took on different meanings.He documented people from all classes and backgrounds in a similar manner, including those whom the Nazis did not consider Aryan. In 1929, he published \u00e2\u0080\u009cFace of Our Time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a preview of his intended larger project, but the Nazi regime later confiscated the remaining books (eventually destroying the plates) and barred him from publishing in the future. His son Erich was jailed for anti-Nazi activities in 1934 and died in prison 10 years later.A look back at August Sander on Lens.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would argue that this is the single most important body of work of the 20th century in its richness and the way it evokes the German people at his critical moment in that history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a work of art that has served as a point of departure and inspiration for so many. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be hard pressed to point to anything that compares.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLast year MoMA acquired a complete set of 619 prints from \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople of the Twentieth Century\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Gerd Sander, his grandson. Ms. Meister, along with Prof. Noam M. Elcott of Columbia University, has undertaken an unusual five year re-examination of the work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 printed from Sander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original glass-plate negatives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that will enlist dozens of experts, including artists, curators, scholars and scientists, to examine Sander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 49 portfolios from the project.The first of five planned annual conferences took place at MoMA with presentations from the artists Tina Barney and Walead Beshty, the MoMA curators Quentin Bajac and Roxana Marcoci and the professors Carol Armstrong of Yale, Deborah Willis of New York University, Olivier Lugon of the University of Lausanne and Mr. Elcott.Sander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great-grandson Julian Sander read his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper on the portfolio \u201cPolitical Prisoners,\u201d which comprised photos taken by Sander\u2019s son Erich while he was imprisoned by the Nazis. The negatives were smuggled out of the prison and prints were given to the inmates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 families to reassure them they were still alive. They are included in the project, the paper said, because Erich Sander is seen as his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apprentice.Although \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople of the Twentieth Century\u00e2\u0080\u009d itself is rigidly conceived and organized, Mr. Elcott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople Who Came to My Door\u00e2\u0080\u009d portfolio revealed an unexpected and bold embrace of chance. Ms. Willis examined the circus portfolio, which she pointed out included black people and others who would be targeted just a few years later under Nazi rule.By enlisting practicing artists and experts from different disciplines and scheduling annual sessions, MoMA has committed \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the value of reflection, in an era when everything seems to be accelerating, when a first response might be mistaken for the best one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Meister said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think this will both enhance and expand upon people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of Sander and provide a new way to think of portraiture in the 21st century,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said."}

As a private company, Twitter is not itself considered a public forum regulated by the First Amendment.

In a democratic society that values transparency and accountability, keeping the social media account of a president open to all ought to be part of these customs. Twitter and other social media platforms are part of the new normal, a shared reality that demands new best practices about press freedom and good governance.The president of the United States is free to decide whom to listen to, whether online or offline. If the president tunes out advice from strangers or intimates, then that is his choice. Blocking followers on Twitter is not a matter of government censorship, but rather of expressive freedom to listen and speak. The president can decide if he wants to hear out the public in person, on the phone or online. The choice to block is no different from a decision to decline an invitation to a conference.

{"Headline": "Charlotte Officer \u2018Justified\u2019 in Fatal Shooting of Keith Scott", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 There is no doubt that officers surrounded him. That they shouted at him. That they shot him. But a crucial question about the fatal confrontation between Keith L. Scott and police officers in Charlotte, N.C., has always been whether Mr. Scott was wielding a gun.On Wednesday, in a 40-minute news conference that at times took on the feel of a courtroom argument, R. Andrew Murray, the district attorney for Mecklenburg County, laid out a case that Mr. Scott, who was black, had a gun in his hands and had not heeded warnings to drop it when he was shot and killed.\u201cIt\u2019s a justified shooting based on the totality of the circumstances,\u201d Mr. Murray said. No charges, he said, will be filed against the officer, Brentley Vinson, who is also black.Mr. Murray made his case with an elaborate presentation of videos, enhanced digital images and other evidence, a reflection of the increasing sophistication of prosecutors who must also sway a public skeptical of police accounts of fatal shootings.The Sept. 20 shooting of Mr. Scott was one of several deadly police interactions with African-Americans that have sparked waves of street demonstrations and an impassioned national conversation about race and the use of deadly force by police officers.Mr. Murray\u2019s announcement came as a jury in Charleston, S.C., about a three-hour drive southeast of Charlotte, was preparing to hear closing arguments in the case of Michael T. Slager, a former North Charleston police officer who was on duty when he shot and killed Walter L. Scott, a black man who was not related to Keith Scott, during a traffic stop and foot pursuit.Members of Mr. Scott\u2019s family had claimed he had no gun at the time of the shooting, or they were unaware that he owned one. And when the recordings were released, they did not conclusively show whether Mr. Scott had a gun, as the police had asserted.But on Wednesday, Mr. Murray laid out the most detailed case yet that Mr. Scott, 43, was armed when officers confronted him while he was in his parked S.U.V. at his apartment complex in Charlotte\u2019s University City neighborhood.Mr. Scott\u2019s gun, a Colt .380 semiautomatic, fell to the ground after he was shot, Mr. Murray said. It was later determined that the gun was cocked, with the safety off. Subsequent analysis found Mr. Scott\u2019s DNA on the weapon.Mr. Murray said the authorities traced the gun and discovered that it had been stolen from a home and then illegally sold to Mr. Scott 18 days before the shooting.At the news conference, Mr. Murray exhibited a Facebook conversation he described as involving the gun\u2019s seller and a third person, and said that the seller appeared to admit the transaction had occurred. The authorities, Mr. Murray said, also found records at a sporting goods store that suggested Mr. Scott had purchased a magazine and ammunition for a .380 caliber handgun. Mr. Murray said some ammunition was found stuffed in a cigarette box in Mr. Scott\u2019s vehicle.Mr. Murray also played a surveillance video that showed Mr. Scott outside a convenience store just before the shooting, with a bulge in his pants near the ankle. Mr. Murray said it was consistent with the officers\u2019 assertion that Mr. Scott was wearing an ankle holster.Mr. Murray said that Mr. Scott never raised the gun at officers. But in a letter to the State Bureau of Investigation and the Charlotte police, Mr. Murray said that an officer, like any other person, is \u201cjustified in using deadly force if he reasonably believed, and in fact believed, that he or another person was in imminent danger of great bodily injury or death.\u201d\u201cSomeone with a gun in his hand who does not comply with police commands to drop the gun can be reasonably considered to be an imminent deadly threat to officers,\u201d Mr. Murray wrote, \u201cand reaction-time studies show that a person can raise his gun and harm or kill officers before an officer could react to the threat.\u201dMr. Scott\u2019s family released a statement on Wednesday that thanked Mr. Murray and other officials for meeting with them, and explaining how they decided not to charge Officer Vinson, who was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. The family also said they were \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d that Officer Vinson was not criminally charged.A sequence of events in the fatal shooting in Charlotte, N.C., based on what can be seen in four videos.\u201cAll our family wanted was justice and for these members of law enforcement to understand that what they did was wrong,\u201d the family statement said.Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said on Wednesday that prosecutors most likely felt the available evidence would not earn a criminal conviction. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high standard to indict a police officer for a criminal action in the line of duty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that has nothing to do with the righteousness or appropriateness of the shooting.\u201dA successful prosecution would be even more difficult, Dr. Alpert said, because the evidence indicated that Mr. Scott was armed, and that he did not comply with orders from the police to drop his weapon. But Dr. Alpert said he expected there would be a lawsuit, in which the legal standard is lower \u2014 a preponderance of evidence in civil actions versus evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases.While the issue of criminality has been resolved, Dr. Alpert said questions remained.\u201cShould they have called him out of the car? Should they have taken cover? What did they know about him at the time?\u201d he said. \u201cThe question becomes: At what point does the officer feel threatened?\u201dLawyers for Mr. Scott\u2019s family held a separate news conference in Charlotte on Wednesday. They called for peace in the streets and said they hoped to eventually obtain justice for Mr. Scott.What happened in recent cases where blacks were killed by the police or died in police custody.\u201cWe\u2019re still in the process of investigating this case,\u201d said Eduardo Curry, one of the lawyers.Just after the shooting, several people in the apartment complex gave accounts that differed from the police officers\u2019 version. In some cases, they shared their versions of events with the news media.Some of the witnesses said Mr. Scott was shot by a white officer. Some of them said Mr. Scott was reading a book at the time he was confronted.Mr. Murray said subsequent interviews showed that a number of these witnesses had not, in fact, seen the shooting. He also said there was no evidence of a book.Mr. Murray also noted that Mr. Scott\u2019s wife, Rakeyia, had said that she was \u201ccertain\u201d her husband did not have any guns after January 2016.\u201cHowever, text messages between Mr. and Mrs. Scott the month before the shooting included an argument about a gun in Mr. Scott\u2019s possession,\u201d Mr. Murray said.Richard Fausset reported from Raleigh, and Alan Blinder from Charleston, S.C.

{"Headline": "Californians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California, Massachusetts and Nevada legalized marijuana on Tuesday in what advocates said was a reflection of the country\u2019s changing attitude toward the drug.Leading up to the election, recreational marijuana use was legal in four states: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, along with Washington, D.C.With the addition of California, Massachusetts and Nevada, the percentage of Americans living in states where marijuana use is legal for adults rose above 20 percent, from 5 percent.Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon and a supporter of legalization, said Tuesday\u2019s votes would add to the pressure on the federal government to treat cannabis like alcohol, allowing each state to decide on its own regulations.\u201cThe new administration is not going to want to continue this toxic and nonproductive war on drugs,\u201d Mr. Blumenauer said.The federal government\u2019s ban on the drug precludes the interstate sale of cannabis, even among the states that have approved its use. But Tuesday\u2019s votes created a marijuana bloc stretching down the West Coast, and Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, said he saw an opportunity for the states where recreational marijuana is now legal to \u201ccoordinate and collaborate\u201d on the issue, including applying pressure in Washington to relax the federal ban.Support is rising even though some public health experts warn that there have been insufficient studies of the drug\u2019s effects and that law enforcement agencies lack reliable tests and protocols to determine whether a driver is impaired by marijuana.Supporters in California portrayed legalization as both a social justice and a criminal justice issue, saying the measure would help redress the disproportionate numbers of arrests and convictions among minorities for drug crimes.\u201cI think of this victory in California as a major victory,\u201d said Lauren Mendelsohn, the chairwoman of the board of directors of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, a group that has campaigned against the government\u2019s war on drugs. \u201cIt shows the whole country that prohibition is not the answer to the marijuana question.\u201dMs. Mendelsohn spoke at a celebration in Oakland for the passage of Proposition 64, as California\u2019s legalization measure was known.As of Nov. 6, pro-legalization committees in the state had raised around $23 million, according to the California secretary of state\u2019s office. Chief among the backers were marijuana companies and tech entrepreneurs, including Sean Parker, a founder of the file-sharing service Napster and a former president of Facebook, who was the single largest donor to the campaign. The anti-legalization campaign had spent less than $2 million in California.Kevin Sabet, the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, one of the country\u2019s major funders against marijuana legalization initiatives, attributed the imbalance in campaign spending to investments by marijuana companies hoping to profit if the industry was legalized.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made if marijuana is legal, not a lot of money to be made if it remains illegal,\u201d he said.Opponents of legalization say the adoption of medical marijuana laws in more than 25 states has led to a popular perception that cannabis is good for you. They have called for more studies on the drug\u2019s long-term effects, particularly on the developing brains of young people.\u201cThere is likely medical promise in the marijuana plant, but that is different than saying smoked marijuana is medicine,\u201d Mr. Sabet said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t smoke the opium plant to get the beneficial effects of morphine.\u201dA bill to legalize marijuana in Vermont, supported by Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, failed earlier this year. But in Massachusetts, public support for legalization rose during the fall, even with bipartisan opposition from the state\u2019s top elected officials \u2014 including Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, and Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat \u2014 and an organized anti-legalization campaign.Lawmakers in Rhode Island were watching Massachusetts closely, and they are expected to take up a legalization measure of their own now that one has passed there.Two other states \u2014 Arizona and Maine \u2014 were voting on recreational marijuana legalization Tuesday. Arizona voted against the measure. In Maine, a state with a libertarian streak that began decriminalizing marijuana decades ago, the referendum on legalization drew scant funded opposition.Still, proponents of legalization said California would represent the biggest victory because of its huge economy and population and also its fertile soil and amenable climate.Tuesday\u2019s vote reinforced the state\u2019s position as the epicenter of marijuana cultivation for the country, a role it has had illicitly for decades. Marijuana companies have been positioning themselves for the prospect of interstate commerce, buying large plots of land in areas that now grow vegetables and other crops.The California measure, which passed with 56 percent approval, allows people over 21 to possess limited amounts of marijuana for personal use and also permits the personal cultivation of up to six plants in private residences, provided they are shielded from public view. The sale of recreational marijuana will not be allowed until licenses are issued, a process that will take at least two years, said Steve DeAngelo, the founder of Harborside, a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland.California officials expect additional tax revenue of around $1 billion from marijuana sales. The revenue is earmarked for the study of medical marijuana, for the California Highway Patrol to develop procedures to determine driver impairment due to marijuana consumption, for youth education on drugs, and for the prevention of environmental damage from marijuana production, among other programs.A large majority of Republicans in the poll, 65 percent, were against the measure, compared with 72 percent support among Democrats.In addition to Tuesday\u2019s votes on recreational marijuana, Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota had medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot. All four passed the legislation.Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston and Melissa Wen from Oakland, Calif.videoAdvertisement"}

But these performers are segregated into a few performing spots. Politically, of course, Hollywood is very well intentioned and liberal. Culturally, it\u2019s a backwater. In the current setup, black comedians are restricted to black comedy nights in various clubs, like Mo\u2019 Betta Monday. It\u2019d be funny if it weren\u2019t so pathetic.

Hip-hop music rescued and revitalized rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the music industry in the \u201980s and \u201990s, then quickly did the same for the fashion industry. In politics, hip-hop not only brought millions of otherwise alienated young people into the electoral process, but it was also instrumental in putting a black man into the White House.\u201cDef Comedy Jam\u201d introduced the world to Martin Lawrence, Chris Tucker, Bernie Mac, Jamie Foxx, Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey, Tracy Morgan, Kevin Hart, Katt Williams and many others. Mr. Zinoman zeroed in on the genius of black style when he noted that Chris Tucker \u201chad a delivery with such momentum and snap that he made jokes sound like music.\u201dEventually, the movie industry jumped on the bandwagon. For a while, the biggest movie star in the world was a former rapper who began his career as the Fresh Prince.

Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme in accounts offshore.And, it turns out, the funds can stay there.The judge said foreign bankruptcy proceedings blocked the trustee from gaining access to the money.Koch Industries began investing in the Madoff fund well before its collapse and pulled out $21.5 million in 2005.The money went to a fund registered in the British Virgin Islands and then to a Koch entity in Britain.They were not alone.Several European banks also had Madoff money offshore, according to court papers, including HSBC, UBS, Credit Suisse, an international arm of Merrill Lynch and the French money manager Natixis.You\u2019ve probably read about the efforts by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to learn Mandarin, his visits to China and his cultivation of relationships with the country\u2019s leaders.But Facebook has made deeper efforts to get into China, as well.The social network developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people\u2019s news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees.The tool is one of many ideas the company has discussed and may never see the light of day.But it illustrates the extent to which Facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements, \u201cto make the world more open and connected,\u201d if there is a possibility of gaining access to a market of 1.4 billion people.\u201cIt stinks...

Even in death, he is a thief.\u201dMr. Marcos held power for two decades, ruling for nearly half that time under martial law. His government is believed to have killed more than 3,000 political opponents and tortured tens of thousands more while he and his associates stole an estimated $10 billion from the country.After his ouster, he fled to Hawaii, where he died in 1989. Four years later, his remains were returned to his hometown, Batac, in Ilocos Norte Province. A preserved body purported to be that of Marcos was long on public display there, but many speculated it was a substitute made of wax.On Friday morning, his remains were secretly flown by helicopter to the heroes\u2019 cemetery, which is the Philippines\u2019 equivalent of Arlington National Cemetery in the United States. About 100 people attended the funeral, which included a 21-gun salute. Media representatives were barred from the cemetery, and riot police officers stood watch outside.Speaking briefly afterward, Imee Marcos thanked President Rodrigo Duterte for supporting the burial and apologized that the funeral was closed to the public for a \u201csimple, private and solemn ceremony.\u201dThe burial fulfilled the longtime wish of the Marcos family. But opponents denounced the surreptitious way it was carried out and said it could inspire continuing anger and resentment toward the Marcoses.President Duterte has drawn comparisons with Mr. Marcos for the ruthlessness of the current campaign against illicit drugs and for threats to suspend habeas corpus or impose martial law.The president\u2019s press secretary, Ernesto Abella, who was traveling with Mr. Duterte in Lima, Peru, for a conference of world leaders, told reporters that there was \u201cnothing sneaky\u201d about the burial.The president\u2019s office later issued a statement from Mr. Duterte suggesting that the torture and killings committed by the Marcos government were unproven. \u201cWhether or not he performed worse or better, there is no study, there is no movie about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the challenges and allegations of the other side, which is not enough.\u201dThe president also urged the country to move beyond the acrimony over the Marcos legacy. \u201cIt seems to be a very raucous issue for the nation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would like to pray that everybody would find a space in his heart for forgiveness.\u201dBut opponents said the sudden funeral flouted the legal process, because the court\u2019s decision does not become final for 15 days, leaving time for further appeal.\u201cOn the most basic level, this is about his family friendship with the Marcoses, who have been very supportive of his rise to the presidency,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said. \u201cThere also is the broader narrative of the glorification of the authoritarian brand of leadership, which would indirectly benefit Duterte\u2019s own style of governance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How did this loose-lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far? Who were the Americans supporting him and why?When I started my unusual assignment of covering the American presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent \u2014 for this, an American news organization \u2014 one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers. The bulk of them revolved around Mr. Trump, whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the party\u2019s nomination \u2014 and ultimately to the presidency.Going back through my monthslong journey across America, there were many clues to Mr. Trump\u2019s rising tide, although not all were easy to read. I drank with Trump supporters in bars and casinos. I approached them at rodeos. I chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies.The broad topography of Trump country is, in many respects, easy to trace. It is a place of anger and frustration, gripped by a feverish anti-establishment sentiment. People wanted change \u2014 and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life.Yet other factors were at play, too, in this unruly insurgency, factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly: racism, xenophobia, bigotry, talk radio, social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country. It wasn\u2019t always clear which elements were powering the \u201cTrump Train,\u201d as the movement called itself, and which were being buoyed along.In Williamson, I also saw how Mr. Trump\u2019s message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on Sunday, many Christians glossed over the candidate\u2019s three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. (\u201cIt\u2019s scary, like Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Trump told Howard Stern in 1997.)It was hard to square, but perhaps that was the lesson: that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election, one in which outrageous rule-breaking might offer a route to success.Around that time, Apple released its seventh iteration of the iPhone, that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every iPhone are the words \u201cDesigned in California. Assembled in China.\u201d As if California is a separate country. And that\u2019s how many in Trump country saw it \u2014 that instead of being part of the iPhone economy, they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas.One thing that I, like many Europeans and other foreigners, had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate self-belief. Mr. Trump, though, traded on pessimism. His slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the country\u2019s military and business, but also scapegoated immigrants, minorities and Muslims.At Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about \u201cthe blacks.\u201d Broad-brush prejudice toward Muslims was openly expressed: Danny Popma, a factory owner in Michigan, told me that children in Dearborn, which has the country\u2019s largest percentage of Muslims, had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks.The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or loutish, there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding twist, a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat categorization: a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in Miami; a Japanese Uber driver in Las Vegas; a Guyanese doorman in Queens, N.Y.What was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating. Maybe these were just the hard-core loyalists. State-by-state polls suggested that Mr. Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political professionals, including Republicans, dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters.\u201cIt\u2019s like the hunt for the lost tribes of the Amazon,\u201d was how Stuart Stevens, a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, put it early on. \u201cIf you paddle your canoe far enough up the river, and bang your drum hard enough, they will come to the riverbank. But they\u2019re just not there.\u201dBut when I mentioned the polls showing Mr. Trump lagging to his supporters, they snorted derisively.Everyone they knew was voting Trump \u2014 colleagues, relatives, children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who hadn\u2019t voted for decades. The polls, they said, were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media \u2014 the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow.At the time, I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the Facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad terms, the Trump supporters were right \u2014 in key states, their votes were undercounted by pollsters.The winning margin in many states, like Michigan, was tight, and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. Daryl, the Uber driver who took me from a Trump rally to the airport, was a case in point: he was an African-American, a registered Democrat, and he did not intend to vote.\u201cNone of them look any good to me,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump, then, benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international readers: Why did so many Americans seem to hate her so much?The answer had many dimensions: Fatigue from her decades in public life, unfinished business from her husband\u2019s time in power in the 1990s, distaste for how she had handled his sexual escapades, outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street bankers, unfiltered sexism.And Mrs. Clinton simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it.In San Francisco, while I was visiting my brother, one of his friends offered an explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting socks for Christmas \u2014 again \u201d he said. \u201cSocks, socks, bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like that.\u201dMr. Trump, in the end, found the \u201clost tribe\u201d of white voters. They heard his drumbeat, and voted as a bloc like never before.Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning victory echoes jolting changes in Britain, France and other countries where a new brand of right-wing politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of forces, or represented a more fundamental shift, may now be answered under the Trump presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Family. Six Decades. Myriad Views of Fidel Castro\u2019s Revolution.", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 When Fidel Castro rode victoriously into Havana on Jan. 8, 1959, Juan Montes Torre rushed into the streets to cheer. A poor, uneducated laborer from the eastern countryside of Cuba, he had arrived in the capital a few years earlier and, like most of his neighbors, could hardly believe what was happening.\u201cIt was an emotional shock,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cThese bearded men, poorly dressed \u2014 they won! And on behalf of the lower classes!\u201dBut that allegiance slipped from generation to generation in Mr. Montes\u2019s family, and in Cuba as a whole. His son\u2019s views darkened decades ago, during tussles with the Castro government\u2019s restrictions. His teenage granddaughter, Rocio, has spent most of her youth feeling glum about the conditions in her country.\u201cThere are too many Cubans who get up every day and struggle and struggle, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cMy dream is to leave.\u201dThe Montes family\u2019s story of faith and disillusion is common. Cuban families have been arguing about Mr. Castro since he came to power. His death has again produced an intense clash of emotions for many Cubans who recognize that he was more than just a political figure. He was also a brother, a father and a grandfather to various Cuban generations \u2014 a familiar presence whose ideals, whims and ego shaped everyone\u2019s identity and daily life.His relationship to the country was remarkably personal. Robert A. Pastor, a former Latin America adviser to President Jimmy Carter, used to say that Mr. Castro was one of the few world leaders referred to by just their first names. Many Cubans have grown comfortable with calling him a complicated relative.\u201cYou have to look at this in a very cool way \u2014 this is like the father who has been there all the time that has taken the family through thick and thin,\u201d Carlos Alzugaray Treto, a former Cuban diplomat, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cMaybe at times you don\u2019t agree with him, but most of the time you agree with what he has done.\u201dYet Mr. Castro was not exactly a common loved one. He was also the maximum leader \u2014 charismatic but quick to anger, a guerrilla whose name Cubans were often afraid to utter. Because he ruled for decades, Mr. Castro\u2019s impact \u2014 and the perception of it \u2014 changed over time. Cubans born before the revolution saw him as a transformative force for good or ill. Those born later, especially after the Soviet Union started collapsing in 1989, tend to view him as an obdurate barrier to economic opportunity and to integration with the rest of the world.In life, he was often an enigma; in death, for Cuban families like the Monteses, he is a collage of competing images, from the inspiring young rebel to the out-of-touch old man.Mr. Montes first heard of the barbudos, or bearded rebels, when he was picking coffee and fruit in the fields in Cuba\u2019s eastern province of Guant\u00e1namo. It was the early 1950s, and poor farmers in the area had started banding together, revolting against wealthy landowners. Mr. Castro was among many leaders said to be demanding better working conditions.On July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro staged his first major attack, raiding the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, now the country\u2019s second-largest city. Mr. Castro was caught, and he defended himself in court three months later with a lengthy speech that included the line \u201cHistory will absolve me.\u201d Mr. Montes had decided by then to move to Havana \u2014 and to root for Mr. Castro and his guerrillas.\u201cThere was a lot of injustice back then,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cCoups, crime. The government didn\u2019t care at all for the people.\u201dCompared with its neighbors, Cuba was well off, with a per-capita income in 1958 that was exceeded in Latin America by only Argentina and Venezuela, according to United Nations statistics. But the Cuban economy was essentially stuck in place, with yawning inequality. In rural areas like those where Mr. Montes grew up, more than 90 percent of the homes lacked electricity. In Havana, the streets were clogged with a mix of shark-fin Cadillacs and ragtag beggars.After taking power in 1959, Mr. Castro promised radical change. \u201cWe have fought to give democracy and liberty to our people,\u201d he said days after his triumphant arrival in Havana. He delivered, Mr. Montes said. Over the next few months, the Castro government announced plans for land reform to grant property to the poor, taxes of 80 percent on expensive cars and additional government spending to decrease unemployment.In December that year, Mr. Montes was hired as a police officer. It was his first steady job since his arrival in Havana and came with free schooling, leading him from a fourth-grade education to a high school diploma. The pride he felt at his rise into the middle class can be seen in family pictures from that era, with his wife wearing new necklaces beside her smiling husband. Even in his 80s, he speaks of his first few years on the police force with the excitement of a new cadet.\u201cWhen someone committed a crime, we arrested them, but always with a sense of justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t abuse anyone. It was a process for everyone. It wasn\u2019t just for the upper classes.\u201dFrom the outside, especially in Washington, Mr. Castro seemed to be upending Cuba\u2019s justice system, summarily executing opponents and filling Cuban jails. Mr. Montes, however, said he had seen a police force once viewed as a collection of corrupt thugs becoming professional. From 1959 to 1962, Mr. Montes said, Cubans all over the country were eager to serve Mr. Castro.But there were enemies close by \u2014 mostly wealthier Cuban exiles who had fled when Mr. Castro began nationalizing property. They had the support of the United States, and when their attack came at the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961, Mr. Montes was guarding the home of Celia S\u00e1nchez, a famous guerrilla fighter and Mr. Castro\u2019s longtime lover and confidante.Around 4 a.m., Mr. Montes said, there was a flurry of activity inside. Moments later Mr. Castro emerged, surrounded by armed escorts.\u201cHe looked calm,\u201d Mr. Montes said. \u201cNo one knew what was happening. No one knew they attacked us.\u201dThe Cuban missile crisis and the American trade embargo only strengthened the siege mentality that Mr. Castro relied on for decades, as he argued repeatedly that Cuba must remain under tight control lest the northern imperialists invade and turn the island into an American fief. In an interview in late 2012, Mr. Montes said he had never questioned that assessment, even when he was with critics of Mr. Castro\u2019s authoritarian ways. In 1970, during the government\u2019s effort to harvest a record 10 million tons of sugar, Mr. Montes helped guard 300 political prisoners forced to cut sugar cane.Mr. Montes said they had not seemed to be bad people. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, with what sounded like a touch of disappointment, \u201cthey were wrong.\u201dHe said he had often felt the same way about relatives who at times were critical of Mr. Castro, including some who had moved to the United States. \u201cThe revolution is a process,\u201d he said. Shifting in his seat, on a flowered couch at his home in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, he looked toward his son\u2019s house next door. \u201cThey don\u2019t see things very clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that they have the greatest opportunity in the world; they have the opportunity to study.\u201dHe said he wished younger Cubans in his family could see the broader context. \u201cWe were a poor, uneducated, humble family before the revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there was a change. It\u2019s a radical change that\u2019s still maturing.\u201dThe entrance to Juan Carlos\u2019s home is covered in green vines with bunches of bitter grapes. More than a decade ago, he ran a private restaurant, or paladar, beneath the greenery. He also used to rent rooms to tourists until he developed a new business in which he uses his newly acquired Spanish passport to travel to Panama to buy clothes and other items to sell in Havana.He is a member of what might be called the \u201cresolver\u201d generation \u2014 those who learned to resolve or negotiate their way around the shortages, regulations and inefficiencies of Cuban socialism in its later stages. If his father\u2019s image of Mr. Castro and the revolution was shaped by the changes of the 1950s or \u201960s, his views have been sculpted by the transition from the flush 1980s to the scavenging \u201990s.The shift was significant. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Cuba lost a patron that had provided around $4 billion a year in credits and subsidies. The economy contracted by 34 percent from 1990 to 1993, with chronic shortages of fuel, soap, food \u2014 just about everything.He was 31 at the time and had already become frustrated with the way the Castro government worked. In his 20s, he worked at Cuba\u2019s customs agency, as his father had after his tenure on the police force. What Juan Carlos saw, he said, was an antidemocratic system that rewarded silence instead of initiative.He said his frustration peaked in the late 1980s when he was rebuffed by Communist Party officials for gathering recommendations from colleagues for improving the agency. He believed he was doing what socialism revered: organizing workers.\u201cBut the party guys,\u201d he said, \u201cthey just told me: \u2018That\u2019s not right. Here are the things we are going to talk about, and you, don\u2019t stand up and talk.\u2019\u201dJuan Carlos shook his head and laughed as if expressing a sentiment that Cubans have long relied on to describe run-ins with the government: \u201cNo es f\u00e1cil\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not easy.He left his job just before the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. Over the next few years, he found work in hotels. When Mr. Castro legalized small restaurants, Juan Carlos decided to open one with his wife, but there was a problem: He needed permission from the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, the neighborhood party watchdog, and the group had not met in years. So he nominated himself to lead the group and got his neighbors to support his candidacy.\u201cI became the president so I could open the restaurant,\u201d he said.The Castro government was never far away, however. The 1990s led to relative economic openness, but in fits and starts as Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal, who took over presidential powers in 2006, limited change. Businesses must stay small under laws that restrict how many employees can be hired. Supplies must be bought from the government, and crackdowns are common.\u201cIt\u2019s like an accordion \u2014 they open a little, they close,\u201d Juan Carlos said. \u201cBut they never open it up all the way.\u201dSuccess, then, has tended to play favorites. Economic and racial inequality, after improving in the early years of the revolution, has gotten worse since the 1990s. Cubans with small businesses and more lucrative jobs in tourism are typically lighter-skinned, with advantages built up over time. Some have relatives in Miami. Others have connections in government or, in the case of Juan Carlos, Spanish ancestry and a home in Vedado with extra space.He acknowledged that he had done relatively well through much hard work. During one winter visit, he popped a tape into a VCR, showing his daughter\u2019s quincea\u00f1era \u2014 her 15th birthday party \u2014 at the Hotel Nacional. The girl, Rocio, wore a light floor-length gown and thanked her parents as the guests drank and danced. It looked like a small prom. But for Juan Carlos, and especially for his daughter, one night of fun is nowhere near enough to create contentment.Rocio dreams of becoming an art historian. Tall and thin, she described Cuba with the nuanced sophistication that comes from a good education and plenty of time to think things through. In her eyes, Cuba is purgatory, and even before he died, Mr. Castro was a specter of the past, studied in textbooks more than seen.\u201cFidel had an enormous vision,\u201d she said.And, yes, there a lot of things she said she loved about Mr. Castro\u2019s Cuba: the breezy liberty of the streets, crime-free and rarely snagged with traffic; the emphasis on education and culture. She said she sometimes feared that violence would return once Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro were gone.But mostly, as she has grown from adolescence to adulthood, she has wanted to leave. Her older sister already lives in Spain. Her best friend went to Miami for a vacation one summer and stayed, telling Rocio about the crowded shopping malls and the impressive facilities at her new school. Most of Rocio\u2019s friends, she said, hope to get out of Cuba as soon as they can.\u201cMy generation, we\u2019re not worried about politics or ideals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to get out. Abroad you can achieve so much more. You can be recognized for your work, internationally, by the world.\u201dFidel Castro\u2019s era of speeches, ideology and Cold War standoffs is not what today\u2019s ambitious young people want. Like many young Cubans, Rocio mostly wants Cuba to catch up. Why is there no open and affordable access to the internet? Why can\u2019t she easily get on Facebook to say hi to her sister in Barcelona? Why is it so hard to visit the Louvre, in person or virtually?\u201cI think everyone has a right to get the information they want to think and study,\u201d she said.She said that the American trade embargo clearly did not help, but that most young people considered their own government responsible for creating a society of limits.\u201cFidel and Ra\u00fal started out with a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t achieve what they said they would achieve.\u201dShe wants the same thing her grandfather and Fidel Castro wanted when they were young: radical change and a fair shot at making a life for herself on her terms. The changes of the past few years under Ra\u00fal Castro, allowing more private enterprise and travel, offer some hope, she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not changing at the pace it needs to.\u201dFidel Castro is gone \u2014 \u201cHe was a man of the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Montes said in an interview on Saturday night \u2014 and his granddaughter has long been ready to move on. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The men, members of the Georgia Security Force III% militia, grumbled but laid their weapons down on the red clay earth.The brief standoff ended with an amicable chat, and the men retrieved their weapons the moment the lawmen drove away. But the episode further stoked the militiamen\u2019s abiding fears that their cherished Second Amendment rights were under assault.The Georgia Security Force is one of scores of extremist militias nationwide that have rallied around the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, heartened by his harsh attacks on immigrants, Muslims and Syrian refugees. But no single issue motivates militiamen more than guns \u2014 and the enduring belief that Hillary Clinton, despite her insistence that she is not anti-gun, is plotting to take them away.The Georgia militiamen mobilized in the woods here last weekend to fire weapons and train for the day when, they believe, they will be forced to defend what they call \u201cour way of life.\u201d Two dozen armed men and women conducted live-fire search-and-destroy drills, pumping out enough rounds to saw through and topple a loblolly pine.\u201cWe thought it was bad under eight years of Obama, but the gun-grabbing is going to get a whole lot worse if Hillary gets elected,\u201d said Chris Hill, 42, a blond-bearded paralegal who goes by the code name Blood Agent and commands the militia. He wore combat fatigues and packed a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol on his hip.When Mr. Trump says he wants to make America great again, a message that has appealed to a broad segment of the electorate, Mr. Hill and his roughly 50 local militiamen are particularly enthralled. They long for an America they believe has been stolen from them by liberals, immigrants and \u201cthe P.C. crowd.\u201d Their America is one where Christianity is taught in schools, abortion is illegal and immigrants hail from Europe, not faraway Muslim lands.These weekend warriors form the obdurate bedrock of Trump Nation: white, rural and working class. They vote, and they are heavily armed, right down to the .22-caliber derringer fired by Nadine Wheeler, 63, a retiree who calls her tiny gun \u201cthe best in feminine protection.\u201dDuring two days of conversations, grievances poured forth from the group as effortlessly as bullets from a gun barrel. On armed excursions through sun-dappled forests, they spoke of a vague but looming tyranny \u2014 an amalgam of sinister forces to be held at bay only with a firearm and the willingness to use it.They are machinists and retirees, roofers and factory line workers, all steeped in the culture of the rural South. They say Mr. Trump, a Manhattan billionaire and real estate tycoon, speaks for them.\u201cWithin the extreme right, many of Trump\u2019s most passionate backers come from the militia movement,\u201d said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cThe militia movement is overwhelmingly behind Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201dFor militias, Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-establishment views \u201cplay right into their paranoid style of politics,\u201d said Ryan Lenz, editor of the Hatewatch blog at the Southern Poverty Law Center.The Georgia Security Force is noteworthy among militias for its acute Islamophobia, Mr. Pitcavage said. Its members are so-called 3 percenters, who believe that only 3 percent of colonists fought in the Revolutionary War. That is \u201ca historical myth,\u201d said Mr. Pitcavage, a historian, but useful for those who believe a few people with guns can defeat tyranny.At least 330 such 3 percenter groups have formed, in all 50 states, by Mr. Pitcavage\u2019s count. There were 276 active militias in 2015, Mr. Lenz said. The number includes some 3 percenter groups.Teresa Bueter, 41, worked for 26 years behind a grill at a Waffle House while raising three children. Now she is an active member of the Georgia Security Force, decked out in military fatigues. She owns a .32-caliber pistol and a German-made sniper rifle.Mrs. Bueter said Syrian refugees entering the country \u201cscare the crap out of me.\u201d With her guns and the militia\u2019s weekend paramilitary drills, she said, she is prepared to fight for the values she has instilled in her children and three grandchildren.\u201cDonald Trump would fit right in with our little group,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants America the way we want it, back like it used to be.\u201dThe militia members seem comfortable inside the same sort of echo chamber of self-confirming arguments they ascribe to the liberal elites they say denigrate and demean them. They repeat tropes gleaned from militia websites and social media. They seem convinced that either the Islamic State, or agents sent by Mrs. Clinton, or both, may soon descend on the woods of central Georgia.In separate interviews, various militiamen shared the same conspiracy theories, almost word for word: Muslim refugees have established terrorist training camps on American soil. The liberal billionaire George Soros has rigged voting machines for Democrats.\u201cWe\u2019re like a small military of like-minded people,\u201d said Donald Ensey, 44, a father of four and grandfather of two, who wore fatigue pants and a black T-shirt bearing a profane depiction of an Islamic State fighter and a goat.Mr. Ensey, who has a 3 percenter logo tattooed on the back of his hand, said training with the militia was essential to securing everything he had worked for in his lifetime. Even if Mrs. Clinton is not elected, he said, surely someone else will come for his guns.Mr. Hill, a Marine veteran, holds FTX sessions, or field training exercises, roughly once a month. Otherwise the members communicate via regular posts on Facebook. Prospective members are approved by a \u201creview board\u201d of current members who vet them on their compatibility with the militia\u2019s beliefs. This session was held on 14 acres owned by Devin Bowen, a machinist who was having a miserable day even before the deputies forced him to drop his pistol.The door of his trailer \u2014 the one with a sign that reads, \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Live Here, Don\u2019t Come Here\u201d \u2014 was smashed in that day. Three rifles, a crossbow, 13,000 rounds of ammunition and an 800-pound gun safe were taken \u2014 not by federal agents, but by local thieves. Worse, Mr. Bowen was coughing up blood from an unknown malady. He soothed his throat by chugging cold Coca-Colas.Mr. Bowen\u2019s comrades urged him to see a doctor, prompting a sour discussion about yet another conspiracy they see: the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Bowen waved them off. He was more concerned about Muslim immigrants\u2019 imposing Shariah law. \u201cYou cannot come to my country and shove your religion down my throat,\u201d he said, coughing.Phillip King, 25, who builds ductwork for a living, was outfitted in camouflage fatigues and a tactical vest holding ammunition clips. Mr. King, code name Cowboy, is the only African-American member of the Georgia Security Force.He said he was not offended by the militiamen\u2019s affection for the Confederate battle flag. He shares their love of guns, their conservative values and their view of Mr. Trump as someone who will insulate them from the tyranny of the political left. \u201cThis is my family \u2014 a brotherhood,\u201d he said.For Daniels Potts, 21, owning a gun and learning to use it as part of a well-trained militia are essential to halting what he calls \u201cthe spread of radical Islam.\u201d He appreciates Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce opposition to Muslim refugees. \u201cNot every Muslim is ISIS, but a lot of them are,\u201d Mr. Potts said.He proudly calls himself an infidel and a deplorable. His arms bear tattoos of the 3 percenter logo and of the Kuntry Krackerz, a group affiliated with the Georgia Security Force.Mr. Potts earns $16 to $18 an hour as a commercial roofer. He considers himself the type of law-abiding, hard-working American he said is belittled and marginalized by coastal elites. \u201cWe\u2019ve been forgotten,\u201d he said.Mr. Hill, the militia commander, led Mr. Potts and two dozen other members through a boot camp-style obstacle course carved out of the woods.

{"Headline": "What Impact Will Trump Have on Tourism?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayWith Donald J. Trump set to become the 45th president of the United States, the spirit of openness that has permeated everything from our increasingly global economy to how we travel may be poised to change.Less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, travel experts and economists were asked to try and read the tea leaves. Below, they offer some early thoughts about how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency might affect tourism, including foreign travel to the United States, Americans traveling abroad, access to Cuba, the cost of airfare, and, of course, Trump Hotels.TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATESYet experts say that how attractive the United States continues to be to foreign tourists will depend on how affordable it is to visit; what, if any, policies the Trump administration puts into place (new immigration procedures that make the customs and border process harder, the scrutiny of particular groups of people); and the perception of how welcoming and safe (or not) the United States is.\u201cThere are people in Mexico, Latin America, the Middle East who view Trump with suspicion and concern,\u201d continued Mr. Harteveldt, who is also a former marketing director for Trump Shuttle, an airline that Mr. Trump used to own, \u201cand I think he is going to have to show that he can be magnanimous and can have a broader vision, which will be very important for international trade and inbound tourism.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether those sentiments last, and if there will be actual policy changes that help or hurt travel to the United States.Mr. Sacks of Tourism Economics said policy proposals that would undermine longstanding alliances, along with Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could certainly hurt tourism to the United States. But by how much?AMERICANS AND THE COST OF TRAVELING ABROADWhether Americans travel internationally depends largely on the health of the U.S. economy. A weaker dollar could hurt outbound tourism.\u201cTravel is a discretionary product,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt. \u201cIf the economy isn\u2019t good, travel is always one of the first areas where consumers start to cut back.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group said that if high-earning Americans end up seeing tax cuts under Mr. Trump, they might decide to travel more.While that would be a boon to travelers, Mr. Leff said that the legacy airlines are hoping to prevent it by capitalizing on Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cprotectionism\u201d to keep their competitors at bay. If that protectionist attitude prevails, options will continue to be limited and prices will continue to be high.Still, the decision to travel will ultimately be about more than money. It will also hinge on how Americans think they will be treated when they go abroad, something people typically gauge based on what they\u2019re seeing in State Department reports, news media and on their fellow travelers\u2019 Facebook and Twitter feeds. They will ask themselves whether they feel it\u2019s safe to travel, or whether they think, by virtue of their president, they will be targets of anti-American sentiments. \u201cWe are all ambassadors of our country,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be attacked or harassed or looked down upon as an American.\u201dTRAVELING TO CUBACuba is only just opening up to the United States, yet it is already on many travelers\u2019 bucket lists.\u201cThere\u2019s some risk to Cuba policy changing,\u201d said Mr. Leff, because Mr. Trump could issue his own directive. Additionally, Mr. Leff said that the uncertainty surrounding Cuba could delay investment there in terms of new hotels and other travel-related infrastructure, slowing tourism.Mr. Harteveldt, however, thinks that Mr. Trump won\u2019t necessarily back off international trade with Cuba and other places because four years from now, \u201che probably would like to see Trump-branded hotels open in more cities and more countries.\u201dTRUMP HOTELSBut now that Mr. Trump will be the next president of the United States, things could be looking up.Brand Keys, a customer loyalty research consultancy based in New York, seemed to underscore that notion in a report the day after the election, saying that Trump, \u201ca brand that was once deemed toxic by many consumers is now seen as not only a safe option, but an emotionally desirable option.\u201dNEW INFRASTRUCTURE\u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d Mr. Trump said during his victory speech. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201dChange is one thing the industry can be sure of when Mr. Trump takes office.\u201cHe could be one of the most travel-friendly presidents in modern history,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt, noting that Mr. Trump has long been part of the travel industry and was deeply involved in the marketing of the Trump Shuttle in its early days \u2014 experience that could he put to use thinking of ways to make the United States a more welcoming and appealing destination. Or, Mr. Harteveldt continued, Mr. Trump could be one of the most travel-unfriendly presidents. \u201cHe has the potential to be at either end of the continuum.\u201dThe only unlikely outcome, Mr. Harteveldt added, is that Mr. Trump will be in the middle.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s win foreshadowed an America more focused on its own affairs while leaving the world to take care of itself.By challenging every norm of American politics, Mr. Trump upended first the Republican Party and now the Democratic Party, which attempted a Clinton restoration at a moment when the nation was impatient to escape the status quo. Misogyny and racism played their part in his rise, but so did a fierce and even heedless desire for change.That change has now placed the United States on a precipice.\u201cWhat are the most important qualities of a national leader?\u201d Seventh-grade students in my World Cultures class wrote for ten minutes about that prompt as soon as they walked into the room today. One of the essential questions around which I build my course is, \u201cWhat makes a good leader and how do leaders come to power?\u201d Situating the election results within that framework made sense. After students wrote about the prompt, we went around the room and shared one quality each. We used those qualities to write a letter to the president elect, expressing our hopes and dreams for the United States over the next four years and letting Mr. Trump know the kind of president we hope he will be. Tomorrow, we\u2019re diving back into Ancient Egypt, considering the same qualities as they regard the pharaohs of Egypt.My junior AP Language class, here in California, had a class discussion about empathy, and perspectives that are so different between the two parties, as well as in America as a whole. Many of my students were grieving, as supporters of Clinton, and confused. We cited quotes from the TED talk that we felt were important this morning, and the students gave their perspective on what ideas and issues were important. We will continue our discussion next week, and work to write research papers on understanding what divides our country in regard to race, gender, politics and such. We also talked a bit about how our current media and culture encourages each of us to surround ourselves with like-minded people, and are often unaware of those who have a different view.Rachel Piven, a teacher in New York City, tells us:In my Bronx classroom, we used Nov. 9 and 10 to process. I gave students prompts, they wrote, and then they shared words, lines, or phrases (which naturally led to more responses). Then we wrote some more, talked some more, etc. The questions included:Round 1: How are you feeling now? You might feel proud or you might feel scared; you might feel excited or you might feel sad; whatever you\u2019re feeling, let it flow onto the paper so you\u2019re in a place to share, think, and move forward.Round 2: Choice, depending on what you need.a) What do you think may happen? What are you afraid of? What are you looking forward to?b) What does \u201cpower\u201d mean to you? How does this election make you feel empowered or disempowered?Round 3: We all need to remember that as powerless as we may feel as (insert age), we aren\u2019t helpless. We have influence in our homes, our communities, our schools, our neighborhoods. What can we do here and now, and in the future, to make our spaces safe; to make our world a safe place for everyone? To make it what we want it to be? Brainstorm on paper, then we\u2019ll make a class poster.The kids who usually hate to write and talk throughout wrote diligently and with intense focus. While they shared, I used the smart board and computer to pull up graphics or facts, to fact-check, and to illustrate or explain what they didn\u2019t understand. At some point in the discussion, they became aware that at least some of what they said was not borne out by what they were seeing. This led us to discuss the need to question everything; to research and cross-reference; to believe anything they choose, but to look for evidence before they form an opinion. They loved the idea of questioning everything.What are you doing? Tell us in the comments, or write to LNFeedback@nytimes.com._________Published before Nov. 8:Understand the electoral map and make your own predictions._________React to what you see.Here\u2019s when the polls will close across the nation, and how we\u2019ll know who won.For instance, will your students be responding in real time on a class blog or via social media? Will they be keeping track of the math? Will they be preparing for something you\u2019ll do in class the next day? Let us know.Follow the Senate races too.It\u2019s not just the presidency that\u2019s at stake in this election \u2014 control of the Senate is another big story. Going into the election, Republicans hold 54 seats while Democrats hold 44 seats, with two additional senators caucusing with the Democratic Party. The Times has identified seven Senate races that are competitive.Who ends up controlling the Senate? Why does it matter? Why does party control of the majority in the Senate and House have a large say in whether the next president is able to get things accomplished?Evaluate the reporting.On Election Day 2000, television news organizations staged a collective drag race on the crowded highway of democracy, recklessly endangering the electoral process, the political life of the country, and their own credibility, all for reasons that may be conceptually flawed and commercially questionable.How cautious are different news sources being during this election? Do you find that they are pausing to make sure their reporting is accurate, or do you think they are sloppy or even reckless in their reporting? On election night, flip between different sources to see if you notice a difference in the tone or substance of the report. Which do you find most and least trustworthy?Separate fake news from real news.Remember history with 41 elections as reported on the front page of The New York Times.A \u201cRigged\u201d Election?American elections are, unlike those in many democracies, largely decentralized, rendering the possibility of large-scale fraud extraordinarily unlikely. Further, the balloting in many of the hardest-fought states will be overseen by Republican officials, individuals who would be highly unlikely to consent to helping Mrs. Clinton rig the vote.As you watch on election night, and follow the news in the days after, look for and evaluate claims that this election was in any way tampered with. What is the evidence? What can be done if the claim is true?_________Teachers, remember to let us know how you are teaching about the results of this election, and we\u2019ll update this post with your answers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Election Surprise, Marketers Rethink How to Study Consumers", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byThe presidential race was not far from the minds of executives from America\u2019s biggest brands and advertising agencies last month in Orlando, Fla., at the annual conference held by the Association of National Advertisers. The industry leaders had traveled from cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco, and any political conversation seemed to be premised on the assumption that Hillary Clinton would win.There was some talk about how to best market to Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters after Nov. 8 and debate about what a potential Trump media organization might look like. Many were aghast that the race was close at all, criticizing aspects of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s branding and messaging for holding her back in what they thought should have a no-brainer for voters.So when Mr. Trump won the election last week, an industry that prides itself on always knowing what motivates and excites the American public was in a state of shock. Marketers now find themselves asking serious questions about how they study consumers, use data and quantify the value of facts \u2014 questions about the fundamental nature of their business.Advertisers, like many others, \u201cmay have found ourselves in bubbles of our own making,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist for the Publicis Groupe.That information should now be supplemented with \u201csocial listening\u201d on Twitter, Reddit and other parts of the internet, and behavioral data including what people are searching for online, said Ms. Hofstetter, whose agency has worked with brands like Oscar Mayer and Toyota.\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d she said. \u201cOne data set is not going to give you the full picture, because with people, what people say is not always what they think or what they do, whether intentional or not.\u201dAt the same time, advertisers are prepared for a new period of second-guessing any customer data, whether it has been gathered internally or supplied by the brands they work with. Some of that is rooted in recognizing the one-sided nature of the world they experienced on Facebook and Twitter during the election.\u201cIn a world of social and filtered media, we are not getting enough signals that we might be wrong,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said. \u201cAll marketers must actually look for evidence and actually search out why they may not be right.\u201dRob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York, said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be scrutiny on data and a big demand from clients saying, \u2018Yes, there\u2019s data, and what do we really know? Who\u2019s been to Kansas to understand what they\u2019re consuming in Kansas, and is it the same in Nebraska? And don\u2019t just Google it.\u2019\u201dSome marketers have been left wondering if facts and reason matter less than they expected \u2014 a counterintuitive discovery in the age of information.\u201cFacts are sort of, \u2018I might take them or I might not,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly discretionary now, so there is that notion as a marketer and advertiser of understanding we live in a postfactual democracy.\u201dMr. Tobaccowala remarked that \u201cemotion brings people out, reason probably doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou had a candidate who was more experienced and probably had a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 better than anyone to be president of the United States defeated by a candidate with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 who is least likely to be president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cOne spoke to reason and the other spoke to emotion.\u201d\u201cThe story of \u2018I\u2019m taking on big government\u2019 was more compelling at this point in history than the story of, \u2018I\u2019m going to keep this thing going and make it incrementally better\u2019 and the story of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the story of experience can be really soothing for people and really be the thing that captures people\u2019s imaginations. The Bernie narrative and the Trump narrative is the same.\u201dSome see a broader lesson in the rejection of experience by the electorate. Richard Edelman, the chief executive of the public relations company Edelman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter \u2014 which he often used to forcefully attack Mrs. Clinton and the news media \u2014 and reduced reliance on traditional TV ads showed the power of \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d communication.\u201cThe more effective messaging might be from the mass population as opposed to using celebrities and using media and academics,\u201d he said.Ms. Clark said on Thursday that she was eager for people to \u201clean back into being Americans,\u201d especially after \u201cthe level of dialogue that took place,\u201d a reference to the often ugly nature of the campaign. She anticipates more ads highlighting values like the importance of diversity as the nation works to find common ground.\u201cBrands can shape culture, so I think in that sense brands have a responsibility to represent their values and talk about them,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re an inclusive brand \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more democratic to me than inclusion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Actually, Let\u2019s Not Be in the Moment", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byOpinionI\u2019m at the kitchen sink, after a long day of work and kids and chores and the emotional exhaustion of a toxic election season, attempting to mindfully focus on congealed SpaghettiOs. My brain flits to the Netflix queue. I manhandle my thoughts back to the leaky orange glob in front of me. My brain flits to the president-elect.I\u2019m making a failed attempt at \u201cmindful dishwashing,\u201d the subject of a how-to article an acquaintance recently shared on Facebook. According to the practice\u2019s thought leaders, in order to maximize our happiness, we should refuse to succumb to domestic autopilot and instead be fully \u201cin\u201d the present moment, engaging completely with every clump of oatmeal and decomposing particle of scrambled egg. Mindfulness is supposed to be a defense against the pressures of modern life, but it\u2019s starting to feel suspiciously like it\u2019s actually adding to them. It\u2019s a special circle of self-improvement hell, striving not just for a Pinterest-worthy home, but a Pinterest-worthy mind.So does the moment really deserve its many accolades? It is a philosophy likely to be more rewarding for those whose lives contain more privileged moments than grinding, humiliating or exhausting ones. Those for whom a given moment is more likely to be \u201csun-dappled yoga pose\u201d than \u201chour 11 manning the deep-fat fryer.\u201dOn the face of it, our lives are often much more fulfilling lived outside the present than in it. As anyone who has ever maintained that they will one day lose 10 pounds or learn Spanish or find the matching lids for the Tupperware will know, we often anticipate our futures with more blind optimism than the reality is likely to warrant.Surely one of the most magnificent feats of the human brain is its ability to hold past, present, future and their imagined alternatives in constant parallel, to offset the tedium of washing dishes with the chance to be simultaneously mentally in Bangkok, or in Don Draper\u2019s bed, or finally telling your elderly relative that despite her belief that \u201cno one born in the 1970s died,\u201d using a car seat isn\u2019t spoiling your child. It\u2019s hard to see why greater happiness would be achieved by reining in that magical sense of scope and possibility to outstare a SpaghettiO.What differentiates humans from animals is exactly this ability to step mentally outside of whatever is happening to us right now, and to assign it context and significance. Our happiness does not come so much from our experiences themselves, but from the stories we tell ourselves that make them matter.But still, the advice to be more mindful often contains a hefty scoop of moralizing smugness, a kind of \u201cmoment-shaming\u201d for the distractible, like a stern teacher scolding us for failing to concentrate in class. The implication is that by neglecting to live in the moment we are ungrateful and unspontaneous, we are wasting our lives, and therefore if we are unhappy, we really have only ourselves to blame.This judgmental tone is part of a long history of self-help-based cultural thought policing. At its worst, the positive-thinking movement deftly rebranded actual problems as \u201cproblematic thoughts.\u201d Now mindfulness has taken its place as the focus of our appetite for inner self-improvement. Where once problems ranging from bad marriages and work stress to poverty and race discrimination were routinely dismissed as a failure to \u201cthink positive,\u201d now our preferred solution to life\u2019s complex and entrenched problems is to instruct the distressed to be more mindful.This is a kind of neo-liberalism of the emotions, in which happiness is seen not as a response to our circumstances but as a result of our own individual mental effort, a reward for the deserving. The problem is not your sky-high rent or meager paycheck, your cheating spouse or unfair boss or teetering pile of dirty dishes. The problem is you.It is, of course, easier and cheaper to blame the individual for thinking the wrong thoughts than it is to tackle the thorny causes of his unhappiness. So we give inner-city schoolchildren mindfulness classes rather than engage with education inequality, and instruct exhausted office workers in mindful breathing rather than giving them paid vacation or better health care benefits.In reality, despite many grand claims, the scientific evidence in favor of the Moment\u2019s being the key to contentment is surprisingly weak. When the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted an enormous meta-analysis of over 18,000 separate studies on meditation and mindfulness techniques, the results were underwhelming at best.Although some of the studies did show that mindfulness meditation or other similar exercises might bring some small benefits to people in comparison with doing nothing, when they are compared with pretty much any general relaxation technique at all, including exercise, muscle relaxation, \u201clistening to spiritual audiotapes\u201d or indeed any control condition that gives equal time and attention to the person, they perform no better, and in many cases, worse.So perhaps, rather than expending our energy struggling to stay in the Moment, we should simply be grateful that our brains allow us to be elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mother Tried to Escape Gangs. Bullets Found Her Daughter.", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 At Veronica Lopez\u2019s Sweet 16 party, children played among the headstones. Aunts, uncles and cousins sat on lawn chairs and striped blankets on the grass. A few feet away from Veronica\u2019s grave, her four older sisters pressed candles into a red velvet cake and carefully lit them.Veronica\u2019s mother watched them and waited for a sign from the gentle wind. \u201cLet her blow out her own candles,\u201d she directed her daughters, her voice hopeful.Veronica, called Dayday by her family, was buried in this cemetery west of Chicago in June after being shot to death at age 15. She was a friendly girl who loved swimming, labored over science projects and wanted to move away from Chicago\u2019s violence, toward a better life. Instead, she was caught in an onslaught of gunfire here that no one has been able to stop \u2014 not the police, not the mayor, not parents or preachers.Veronica stood out among those killed. She was the youngest, a spunky ninth grader. She was shot in an affluent lakefront neighborhood that is largely free of Chicago\u2019s gang violence. And she was the only female victim killed by gunfire that weekend.Her death was both mysterious and predictable. She was not in a gang, the police and her family said, but gangs were a part of her life. In Chicago, that is not unusual. Many people are intimately connected to gangs over generations, with allegiances woven through families and friendships the way loyalties to sports teams or alma maters are passed down in the wealthier neighborhoods across town.Young women can be drawn in to the world of gangs because of their brothers or where they live \u2014 or by falling in love with the wrong person. They are often more than bystanders, but less than participants.Veronica came from a family of women, the youngest of five daughters, a loyal and loving band of sisters raised by a single working mother. Time and again, they fell into relationships with men in gangs.Veronica tried to be vigilant. She avoided walking down the street with gang members, including friends she had known since elementary school. She rarely went to parties, because she worried about fights and gunfire.But those measures could not stop the barrage of violence that struck close to her again and again in her last year. Tensions from gang rivalries and at least three shootings of people she knew intruded on her teenage life, leading her to dwell on the possibility of dying.Her mother, Diana Mercado, was asleep at 2 a.m. on May 28 when she awoke to her dog barking, then persistent knocking on her apartment door. She opened it to find a cluster of police officers.\u201cDo you know a Veronica Lopez?\u201d an officer asked, sounding to Ms. Mercado as though he delivered such news all day long. \u201cShe may have been shot.\u201dThe first time Veronica\u2019s mother fled gang violence, she did so in the dead of night. In February 2001, she packed a few belongings, jammed them in the trunk of her small white sedan, gathered her five girls and drove them away from Cicero, a suburb on the western edge of Chicago. Veronica was 5 months old.Ms. Mercado had to get her oldest daughter, Samantha, away from the gang she was falling into. She had to leave Veronica\u2019s father, Ricardo, who was being threatened by gang members.\u201cWe packed whatever we could in the car,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to get my kids away from there.\u201dShe drove a mere six miles, to Belmont Cragin, a neighborhood on the Northwest Side of Chicago, but it felt like a world away.Violence in Chicago was difficult to dodge, except for those with the means to live in the city\u2019s wealthier neighborhoods. But Belmont Cragin was affordable and felt safe, a working-class enclave of Latino families, some young professionals and older Polish residents.Ms. Mercado soon had a steady job at an auto-parts store. Samantha, then 16, chose not to return to school, instead helping her mother by caring for her siblings: Amanda, Destiny, Miranda and Veronica.They remember Veronica as a bubbly toddler with a head of dark, springy curls, who would sit in a car seat on the living room floor and fall asleep to Disney movies on the VCR: \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and her favorite, \u201cThe Aristocats.\u201dIn elementary school, she made friends easily and was the stage manager for a school play. \u201cShe liked bossing people around,\u201d one longtime friend, Selena Herrera, said with a smile.Even before joining the cheerleading squad in middle school, she led her nephew and cousins through routines in the backyard. In the summer, she swam in public pools, expertly diving into the deep end.In her class picture from eighth grade, she smiled into the camera, eyes bright, arms folded, fingernails gleaming with red polish. Stephanie Mota, 16, a middle school friend, recalled stuttering nervously during a class presentation that she and Veronica had prepared on how a microwave works.\u201cShe ended up doing the whole thing,\u201d Ms. Mota said. \u201cShe was smart. She really put her mind to it. She\u2019d goof around, but when it was time to work, she got it done.\u201dIn the summer of 2015, before entering ninth grade, Veronica met Jalid Alcocer, a teenager known as JoJo. On weekends, they would take walks on the 606, an elevated park on an old Northwest Side railroad track.JoJo, now 16, said he was drawn to her warmth, her confidence, her determined optimism. On a walk one day, he went in for a kiss. \u201cShe just started calling me her man,\u201d he said.The men in the lives of the Mercado women tended to bring trouble. For Veronica\u2019s mother, there was Miguel, her first real boyfriend, whom she admired for his fearlessness. Guy, her next serious boyfriend, had a sweet way with her. And Jose was smart and attentive. \u201cI loved the way he danced,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was real romantic. I used to love being in his arms.\u201dBut each was also involved in a gang. Or, as Ms. Mercado put it, \u201cWho wasn\u2019t in a gang?\u201dEach relationship brought another daughter, and usually ended when the man went to jail. But even when relationships fizzle, the children resulting from them can knit gang affiliations deeper into families.Three days, 64 people shot, six of them dead: Memorial Day on the streets, and the violence that has engulfed families and neighborhoods.Ms. Mercado tried to warn her daughters. \u201cDidn\u2019t you learn from me?\u201d she asked them. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk the streets with these guys. You can\u2019t go to the movies. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d\u201cBe careful,\u201d she would tell Veronica. \u201cBullets have no names.\u201dThere was a time when Ms. Mercado was relieved that all her children were girls. It made them less likely to be recruited by gangs, to get into trouble, to end up in prison, she thought.But all four of Veronica\u2019s sisters ended up dating men who were affiliated with gangs, and three had children with them.Veronica\u2019s boyfriend, JoJo, also described loose gang ties.\u201cI don\u2019t gangbang,\u201d he said in August. \u201cI chill with them.\u201dIn truth, there is a wide spectrum of gang involvement. While some are members who have joined through formal rituals, others are affiliated because of where they live or the people they spend time with.Trouble escalated for the Mercado family when one sister\u2019s boyfriend defected to a different gang. Remaining in the original gang was another sister\u2019s boyfriend.\u201cNow it\u2019s like a war because they left,\u201d Ms. Mercado said. \u201cThey put us in the middle of it.\u201dIn the last year of Veronica\u2019s life, danger grew steadily closer to the Mercados and their two-bedroom apartment above a cellphone store.But, like any young teenager about to start high school, Veronica was focused on her freshman year. She would be a freshman at North-Grand High School, a gleaming building on the site of an old Schwinn factory. It is considered one of the better, and safer, schools in the area.And she had a new \u201cbrother,\u201d as she lovingly called him: Orlando Calderon, known as Rico, a teenager her mother had taken in when he was kicked out of his own home. Yes, he was in a gang, but Ms. Mercado saw him as a sweet-natured and vulnerable young man, a victim of peer pressure. She was tickled when he cooked dinner for the family and took out the garbage without being asked. For a time, he dated one of Veronica\u2019s sisters, Miranda.But one week before classes were to start, Veronica\u2019s mother called with heartbreaking news: Rico had been fatally shot in a neighborhood park.Veronica took it hard. \u201cShe went crazy,\u201d Ms. Mercado said.Suddenly, friends and family began seeing a despairing side to her. She seemed to fixate on death, telling friends she envisioned being reincarnated as a butterfly.\u201cShe\u2019d always talk about, \u2018I really want to see Rico, I just want to go with him to heaven,\u2019\u201d Gisele Vides, a friend from school, said. \u201cIt worried me when she said that.\u201dThe violence around Veronica continued. In March, the ex-boyfriend of another sister was killed in gang violence. And in April, Veronica was caught up in a shooting herself.She, her sister Destiny and Destiny\u2019s baby were riding in a car with a close family friend when they stopped for gas and were confronted by two men in another car who flashed gang signs.Veronica jumped out of the car. \u201cHe\u2019s not part of that life!\u201d she screamed, ordering the men to leave her friend alone.But one of the men opened fire. Veronica was standing right next to her friend, who was shot. She escaped injury.The police soon made an arrest, and Ms. Mercado was told that prosecutors needed Veronica to testify before a grand jury.She resisted, worried that it would make her daughter a target. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want my child testifying,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mercado said she told the police. \u201cAnd they said the state will subpoena her if they have to.\u201dVeronica, 15, was soon telling the story to grand jurors.Life at school became shaky. Veronica was failing classes. Sometimes she skipped school. On more than one occasion, she was sent home for fighting, skirmishes that her mother said were provoked by other girls. Friends said that she sometimes burst into tears and had to be comforted by teachers.\u201cI know she was angry,\u201d Ms. Mercado said. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Why do they have to keep killing people I love?\u2019\u201dMs. Mercado was growing more worried by the day. But she had always seen herself as a supportive mother, a friend to her girls, and she was reluctant to put too many restrictions on Veronica.More and more, Veronica told friends that she wanted to get out of Chicago. She pressed her mother to let her move to California to live with Ms. Mercado\u2019s brother, a Marine. Then she abandoned that plan and started daydreaming with her mother about the two of them making a new life in Florida.\u201cAfter Rico died, she realized that this was a dangerous city,\u201d said Gisele, her school friend. \u201cShe wanted to get away from here and have a good life.\u201dFriday night of Memorial Day weekend was hot and humid, with a threat of rain. That spring, Veronica had come to enjoy rides along Lake Shore Drive as a passenger in a car driven by a friend, Jose Alvarez, the 28-year-old uncle of a high school classmate.That night, she was again in his Jeep, the windows rolled down to catch the breeze.On their way to Lake Shore Drive, they stopped at a gas station, where Mr. Alvarez exchanged taunts with a couple of strangers. But the carload of people \u2014 four in the back seat, Veronica and Mr. Alvarez in the front \u2014 laughed it off and kept driving.At one point, Mr. Alvarez posted a video on Snapchat, flashing signs disrespecting another gang.Veronica sent a text to her boyfriend, JoJo, wishing him good night. When he didn\u2019t respond, she wrote: \u201cCan you say it back at least. What if I die tonight.\u201dThe beaches alongside the eight-lane Lake Shore Drive are largely empty after midnight. Lake Michigan is an endless, inky expanse. Few lights shine from the stately prewar apartment buildings that line the curving drive north of downtown.Veronica\u2019s friend Jacqui, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she fears retaliation, was in the back seat. She remembers looking out her window and watching the city fly by.As Jacqui recalled, the Jeep reached Lake Shore Drive, and Veronica\u2019s favorite song by Duke Da Beast was playing.I\u2019m riding down Lake Shore Drive / getting high, out of my mind Boy ya blind / so put your feelings to the side / while we ride down Lake Shore DriveThen Jacqui heard a sudden, sharp sound: glass breaking.At first, she thought another car had crashed into them. Then she realized it was gunshots. Shards of glass flew everywhere. She screamed and ducked.Mr. Alvarez said later that he couldn\u2019t see much of the attack. \u201cWe were innocently driving,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m smiling, she\u2019s smiling. I hear boom and another boom, and I see the windshield come in, and bullet holes. They pull right alongside and start shooting, at least 15 shots.\u201dOne bullet struck Mr. Alvarez in his left arm. Another grazed his forehead. Veronica was hit over and over: three times in her left arm, once in her shoulder, once in her torso.As they raced to a hospital, Veronica was bleeding heavily and drifting in and out of consciousness. Jacqui remembers her saying one thing: \u201cI love you guys.\u201dThe walls of the waiting room at Presence Saint Joseph Hospital on the North Side seemed to be closing in on Ms. Mercado. When news came that Veronica was dead, she vomited into a trash can.The police had little to say that morning. She has talked to them only a few times since. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told me that I\u2019ll hear something before they do.\u201dMs. Mercado said she had heard rumors about who was following the Jeep that night and who was the target. A stranger sent her a tip through Facebook, which she passed along to the police.But more than five months later, Veronica\u2019s death is a mystery. Was she killed because she was in a car with targeted gang members, the working theory of the Chicago Police Department? Was it because of her grand jury testimony, a rumor at school? Or could her death have had nothing to do with gangs \u2014 perhaps a road rage crime carried out by strangers?Her mother does not believe Veronica was the intended target, and she has little hope that the police will arrest someone.The Chicago police\u2019s clearance rate for murders committed this year is just 20 percent. In the 64 shootings over Memorial Day weekend, they have made two arrests.Ms. Mercado has at times appeared paralyzed by grief. \u201cMost of the time,\u201d she said, \u201cI go to sleep and hope I never wake up again.\u201d She thought about seeing a therapist, but even with insurance, the cost was too high. Amanda, one of Veronica\u2019s older siblings, said she felt she had lost not just her sister, but her mother as well.Since Memorial Day weekend, Ms. Mercado has found comfort sitting at Veronica\u2019s grave at Queen of Heaven Cemetery. It is adorned with pink flowers and balloons, a black-and-white portrait and a plastic stake with \u201cSister\u201d in cursive lettering.This is where Ms. Mercado spends her days off from the auto-parts store. In the quiet of the cemetery, she thinks about \u201cthe what ifs,\u201d as she calls them. What if Veronica had never met Mr. Alvarez? What if Veronica had moved to California to live with Ms. Mercado\u2019s brother?What if Veronica were still alive, and the two were preparing to move to Florida, finally escaping Chicago\u2019s violence?Ms. Mercado is free to leave Chicago behind. Her four other daughters are all grown. Miranda, the sister Veronica most admired, started classes this fall at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The others have jobs and children to keep them busy.But Ms. Mercado says she will stay. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going now,\u201d she said, stroking the grass that has sprung up over her daughter\u2019s grave. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving my baby.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Subdued Cuba Prepares Memorial for Castro", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byHAVANA \u2014 Cuba is preparing for Fidel Castro\u2019s final public appearance: a two-day memorial offering Cubans a chance to pay their respects.Statements and articles in government news outlets have also been lionizing Mr. Castro\u2019s life and achievements \u2014 \u201cAll of Cuba With Fidel,\u201d said one headline \u2014 while warning that liquor sales would be limited nationwide until next Sunday, when the mourning period is scheduled to end at noon.\u201cPublic activities and events will be suspended, and national flags will fly at half-staff in public buildings and military installations,\u201d Granma reported. \u201cRadio and television will continue with programming that is informative, patriotic and historical.\u201dA master of image and myth, Mr. Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people.All across Havana on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Cubans seemed quieter, more cautious, less certain of what the future might hold.Several nightclubs stayed closed on Saturday night. Traffic lessened, and the usual weekend music and revelry seemed dialed back. Many predicted that the somber mood \u2014 both sincere and enforced by the state \u2014 would hold until Mr. Castro\u2019s ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba next Sunday after a procession along the country\u2019s central highway.Elian Gonzalez, the center of an international custody battle waged by Fidel Castro nearly two decades ago, returned to the public eye on Sunday to praise the leader who fought to return him to Cuba.Echoing the round-the-clock adulation on state media, Mr. Gonzalez said on government-run television that the Cuban leader\u2019s legacy will long outlive him.It\u2019s \u201cnot right to talk about Fidel in the past tense ... but rather that Fidel will be,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cToday more than ever, make him omnipresent.\u201dWho will really call the shots in Cuba in the years to come? Here is a glance at some civilians and military figures who have Mr. Castro\u2019s ear.At one of Havana\u2019s most popular Wi-Fi hot spots \u2014 behind the imposing Capitolio building, which is being restored to hold the country\u2019s national legislature \u2014 the crowds were smaller than usual after dark on Saturday.Several young Cubans could be seen scrolling through Facebook and pointing out what relatives and friends around the world were sharing about Mr. Castro\u2019s death.Only a handful were talking to those relatives by video chat, which is usually the most popular activity in the hot spots spread across Havana.Tourists in the group said they were surprised but pleased to have been on the island during such a historic moment.\u201cI\u2019m definitely going tomorrow to see everyone saying goodbye to Fidel,\u201d said Miguel Castillo, 52, a visitor from Costa Rica. \u201cHe was a symbol of resistance. The people of Latin America had long been listening to his voice, to his call for autonomy.\u201dMarini Danilo, 30, a tourist from Italy, said he couldn\u2019t believe his vacation had turned into a chance \u201cto live in such a big story.\u201d\u201cFor me, he was just another dictator,\u201d Mr. Danilo said. \u201cHe was not my dictator, he was Cuba\u2019s, but it feels crazy to be here.\u201dAt least on Sunday, the scale of the goodbye for Mr. Castro was hard to gauge.Cubans have long known that when the world is watching, so are the state authorities: During international conferences, during President Obama\u2019s visit in March and, now, after Mr. Castro\u2019s death, the presence of state security becomes more intense, both in the streets and behind the scenes.Even without such clear warnings, Cubans \u2014 after decades of living under Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal \u2014 know that in such moments they are expected to behave and to say very little, especially to visiting reporters.So far, grief and memorialization have been dominated by the state. There have been only occasional public expressions or gatherings of any kind: a few students from a young Communist group getting together to grieve publicly on Saturday; a small group of Cubans waving flags on the Malec\u00f3n, the city\u2019s seaside boulevard.At the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n on Saturday night, the wide expanse of concrete was empty except for the police, some soldiers \u2014 and exactly four visitors snapping photos. But starting on Monday, Cubans expect to see thousands of others, for the final spectacle of the Fidel Castro era.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Expected to Seek Deep Cuts in Business Regulations", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThe unwinding of Dodd-Frank. The firing up of shuttered coal plants. The rollback of rules that increase overtime pay for low-wage workers.Hours after Donald J. Trump won the race for the White House, scores of regulations that have reshaped corporate America in the last eight years suddenly seemed vulnerable.While many questions remain about how Mr. Trump will govern, a consensus emerged Wednesday in many circles in Washington and on Wall Street about at least one aspect of his impending presidency: Mr. Trump is likely to seek vast cuts in regulations across the banking, health care and energy industries.\u201cThis is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan,\u201d Stephen Moore, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThere are just so many regulations that could be eased.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump is a maverick politician, his anti-regulation stance is that of an old-school Republican. It is driven by a belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from the long arm of the federal government.Or at least that is what some analysts and economists say they think is Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale. Even after a long campaign of endless rallies and debates, Mr. Trump and his closest advisers have disclosed relatively few specific economic policy proposals.And some of what he has proposed seems contradictory. For example, he has said he would roll back the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, while his party platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Trump will probably find common ground with many Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, on cutting regulation. They clashed during the campaign over Mr. Trump\u2019s past conduct toward women and inflammatory statements about ethnic groups, and many Republicans do not see eye to eye with Mr. Trump on immigration and trade.\u201cBut Ryan and Trump are like-minded on regulation in a way they are not on trade and immigration,\u201d said Ted Gayer, director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThat is red meat for both of them.\u201dHere is a rundown on how Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could gut regulations from Wall Street to Silicon Valley:A clean Republican sweep of the White House and Congress would normally be greeted by loud cheers across Wall Street.But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is not a clear boon for bankers and financiers in the way that past Republican wins have been.On paper, many of his campaign proposals appear to favor banks and investors, including a promise to undo Dodd-Frank, which was passed after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet repealing the law and its many rules seems unlikely to gain much traction in Congress. And even many banks admit they have spent so much time and money complying with the law, they would rather keep it.Several Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that they did not expect Congress to completely repeal Dodd-Frank. Instead of undertaking such a costly and controversial effort, one likely possibility is that the Trump administration and Congress would take aim at a handful of specific rules that most irritate the banks, including what is known as the Volcker Rule, a centerpiece of Dodd-Frank that prohibits banks from placing risky bets with their own money.Otherwise, many of the expected changes would benefit small and midsize banks rather than Wall Street banks. Regulators, for example, could raise the size at which a bank is subject to Dodd-Frank\u2019s enhanced oversight.Other pieces of Dodd-Frank could be picked off, like reining in the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a hallmark of the Obama administration.Mr. Trump could prune other low-hanging financial regulations, including a newly enacted Department of Labor rule that holds investment advisers liable for certain advice to their clients.He also promised on the campaign trail to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that increases the wealth of private equity executives.And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign took aim at the honey pot of global banking revenue: free trade. For decades, banks have benefited from facilitating deals and lending to companies worldwide.\u201cProbably more so than any president in modern history it will be difficult to predict what issues he latches onto,\u201d said Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official in the Obama administration, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.MICHAEL CORKERY, BEN PROTESS and LESLIE PICKERIn the energy industry, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first targets, according to Mr. Moore, an economic adviser, is President Obama\u2019s effort to limit carbon emissions at coal-fired utilities.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say the rule drove coal companies into bankruptcy, even though the industry says that its problems are mostly caused by waning demand.It is unclear whether the election of Mr. Trump can help struggling coal miners get back their jobs, but it will almost certainly upend the world\u2019s efforts to curb the impact of global warming.While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete dismemberment of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, a Trump administration could significantly weaken or slow them.Mr. Trump has said that he would do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. The rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and not arguing for the rules, Mr. Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.A Trump administration could weaken, or even repeal, the rules governing fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for new cars and trucks.Oil and natural gas executives are hopeful that Mr. Trump will deliver for them, too. They want a loosening of methane emission standards for existing oil wells and the opening of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a big difference,\u201d said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, an Oklahoma company.CORAL DAVENPORT, CLIFFORD KRAUSS and HIROKO TABUCHIAs income inequality and stagnant wages became a major preoccupation among voters, the Obama administration brought regulations and enforcement actions intended to increase the leverage of workers. Most of these efforts are now endangered by the prospect of a Republican president and Republican Congress.In theory, the regulation could be undone by the Trump administration through a rule-making process similar to the one that produced it. But this could take months, if not years. Instead, some lobbyists expect Congress to pass a legislative compromise that would rein in the overtime rule, by phasing it in over a number of years, and by limiting or undoing the automatic upward adjustment in the salary threshold every three years.Mr. Obama enacted a number of other policies through executive order rather than a more involved rule-making process, and these could be undone by a President Trump almost immediately, with the stroke of a pen. These include rules that increased the minimum wage and granted paid sick days to workers hired by federal contractors.Trump administration appointees could quickly reject such interpretations and enforce the law differently, said Marc Freedman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the N.L.R.B. could easily reverse such rulings.NOAM SCHEIBERThe idea of a Trump presidency triggered a sense of dread among many people in the liberal-leaning technology business.Mr. Trump is seen as less favorably disposed toward the concentration of power among the handful of large companies that dominate the internet, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate firm\u201cI think Donald Trump may be facile with Twitter but mostly feels hostility towards these companies and their size,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.During the campaign, Mr. Trump told an audience in May that \u201cwe\u2019re going get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.\u201dMany technology executives have called that idea far-fetched since most of Apple\u2019s supply chain, including many of its parts makers, are in Asia.Mr. Trump also blasted Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, saying that he was using the political influence of The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns, to discourage government action against Amazon on tax and antitrust issues.And Mr. Trump has called for the rejection of AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner.Still, analysts expect that he will appoint antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department who will largely follow traditional Republican approaches to the free market.Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment.Mr. Trump will be under pressure by major telecom and cable firms to roll back aspects of net neutrality. The rule inhibits how broadband providers manage traffic on their networks to ensure any website is equally accessible to consumers.Telecom and cable firms continue to challenge the rules in court and Mr. Trump, with the encouragement of Republicans in Congress, may seek to abandon the regulation.NICK WINGFIELD, VINDU GOEL and CECILIA KANG\u201cThe truth is, who knows?\u201d said Ron Cohen, chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics and the chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry trade group. \u201cWe still have to deal with the basic issues that are confronting us as an industry, and those have not changed just because of an election.\u201dOutrage over the rising cost of prescription drugs has spiked in recent years as Americans struggle to pay for their medicines. Egregious examples of price increases, like those on Mylan\u2019s EpiPen and older drugs sold by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, prompted congressional hearings and investigations.At the same time, the drug industry has gone to war with insurers and employers who pay for their workers\u2019 health coverage. Those dynamics, several people said, have not changed, and outrage over high drug prices is seen as a bipartisan issue.Nonetheless, Mr. Trump placed less emphasis on the issue than Mrs. Clinton did during the campaign.KATIE THOMASAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Incendiary Appeal of Demagoguery in Our Time", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBrexit, Erdogan, Putin and now Trump. Something is rotten in the state of democracy.The stink first became unmistakable in India in May 2014, when Narendra Modi, a member of an alt-right Hindu organization inspired by fascists and Nazis, was elected prime minister. Like Donald Trump, Mr. Modi rose to power demonizing ethnic-religious minorities, immigrants and the establishment media, and boasting about the size of a body part.To paraphrase Jean-Paul Sartre: If the truth remains cloaked in the motherland, in the colonies it stands naked. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s election in America exposed the failures of democracy, they had been revealed in Mr. Modi\u2019s India. Most disturbing, in both places, the alt-rightists were enabled by the conceits, follies and collusion of impeccably mainstream individuals and institutions.The fervent rhetoric about private wealth-creation and its trickle-down benefits openly mocked, and eventually stigmatized, India\u2019s founding ideals of egalitarian and collective welfare. It is this extraordinary historical reversal, and its slick agents, that must be investigated in order to understand the incendiary appeal of demagoguery in our time.Writing after its explosion in 20th-century Europe, Karl Polanyi described in his 1944 book \u201cThe Great Transformation\u201d how civil society and individual liberty are threatened as never before when a society has to reconfigure itself to serve the \u201cutopian experiment of a self-regulating market.\u201d Social and political life in India, America and Europe was drastically remade by neoliberal economism in recent decades, under, as the legal scholar David Kennedy has argued, the administration of a professional global class of hidden persuaders and status-seekers.The sheer potential of India\u2019s market \u2014 1.2 billion consumers, many of them young \u2014 bred intoxicating illusions among businesspeople, investment consultants and financial journalists. Never mind that it was the extraction of natural resources, cheap labor and foreign capital inflows, rather than high productivity or innovation, that was fueling India\u2019s economy. Or that economic growth, of the uneven and jobless kind, was creating what the economists Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen have called \u201cislands of California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa.\u201dIndifferent to poverty and inequality, and immune to evidence or irony, India\u2019s largely corporate-owned press and television reveled in the fame and wealth of corporate magnates and of cricket and Bollywood stars. All the while they stoked hatred against such enemies of rising India as Kashmiri separatists and their Pakistani supporters.But in 2010 corruption scandals began to expose India\u2019s government \u2014 headed then by technocrats trained at Oxford, Harvard Business School and the World Bank \u2014 as both venal and inept. Mr. Modi and his hawkish Twitter account emerged into national politics just as growth faltered and many frustrated aspirers and also-rans started to think of the promise of widespread enrichment as an elaborate hoax. He noticed that they were venting against flailing political representatives and their apparent cronies among newsgatherers. He accordingly packaged himself as an efficient executive, exploiting Indians\u2019 great esteem for technocratic managerialism. (\u201cMein Kampf\u201d is a perennial bestseller in India, Hitler being seen as an exemplary nationalist-cum-people-manager.)B.R. Ambedkar, the main framer of India\u2019s constitution, warned in the 1950s that democracy in India was \u201conly a top dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.\u201d Now the top dressing is being hosed away.Two years after he became India\u2019s most powerful leader, Mr. Modi appears to be an opportunistic manipulator of disaffection with little to offer apart from the pornography of power and a bogus fantasy of machismo. Mr. Trump looks set to follow his lead.Such firebrands emerged out of economic and political crises in almost every major European country in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, distracting angry citizens with the demonization of minorities, cosmopolitans and liberals. Drawing a cautionary tale from this blood-stained history, Polanyi assumed that the catastrophic triumph of economism over social and political necessities would be reversed. The three decades after World War II proved him right. Social-welfare policies underpinned national reconstruction in war-ravaged Europe, as well as in postcolonial Asia and Africa after decades of imperialism.In our own time, a global network of elites has tried to restart the discredited utopian experiment of a self-regulating market. The experiment failed, and again the rage of cheated masses has spawned demagogues who simultaneously promise to avenge the left-behinds and to rewire their alliances with the elites. Any attempt to rebuild democracy must reckon with the deeper reasons for its great and drastic transformation \u2014 above all in India, where Hindu supremacism, in its cruelty and callousness, anticipated the big, big American fan of Hindu.Pankaj Mishra\u2019s new book, \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present,\u201d will be published in January 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018They Will Have to Die Now\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "FeatureWith the Kurdish pesh merga on the road to Mosul.Supported byWith them was a column of vehicles new, old and very old: armored personnel carriers, mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAPs), Humvees, S.U.V.s, ambulances, Soviet tanks, backhoes, bulldozers, long-suffering sedans and a bestiary of retrofitted pickups and battlewagons, whose tenuous welding and argumentative suspensions told of the years Iraqi Kurds had spent fighting with hand-me-down and homemade hardware in one war or another.At 7 a.m., the idling engines came to life, and cries went up: \u201cLong live pesh merga!\u201d \u201cDeath to ISIS!\u201d The troops started down an unpaved track that led southwest through the Tigris River valley toward the city of Mosul. As the march went on, villages gave way to occasional abandoned farmhouses, crop fields to dunes, and the sun made itself felt. A long dust cloud rose in the wake of the column, whose eventual destination was Bashiqa, a small city on the mountain\u2019s edge that was claimed by the Islamic State.The operation to retake Mosul had finally begun one week earlier on Oct. 16. The pesh merga led the charge toward the city, Iraq\u2019s second-largest and ISIS\u2019 last citadel in the country. Mosul had become the focus of the world\u2019s attention, and the battle for it had been criticized even before it began. In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump complained that in revealing its designs on Mosul, the international anti-ISIS coalition was telegraphing its punches. This was inevitably true \u2014 not even ISIS had ever doubted that Mosul would be invaded \u2014 but it was also true that the first flurry of blows was too big to duck. Embedded in the column was a unit of American Special Forces, in a cluster of MRAPs. They were there, it was understood, to pick out targets for airstrikes. Rumbling in the distance, the bombs had deposited on the horizon a dome of inky vapor.While the pesh merga attacked ISIS from the north and the east, the Iraqi military was approaching from the south. The job of the battalion moving toward Bashiqa was to shore up the eastern front and extend a cordon around Mosul. The Iraqis\u2019 next moves would depend in part on the Kurds\u2019 success. For the moment, in other words, the progress of the central conflict in the Middle East had come down to this unlikely troop.The first ISIS mortar fire arrived in the midmorning with whizzes and thuds. It was off target, and the soldiers regarded the dirt plumes with indifference. The first incoming bullets soon followed and were cause for more alarm. They flew from a rambling, two-story cinder-block house on the crest of a slope.The gunfire split the column in two. The back portion halted behind a berm about 12 feet high and about 300 yards downslope from the house. A few soldiers climbed up the dirt and took aim. The rest got out of their vehicles and pulled out phones and cigarettes. Group photos and selfies were snapped.\u201cLet\u2019s use the cannon,\u201d a commander suggested. A pickup mounted with an anti-tank gun pulled in front of the berm. The first shot fell short; a second hit the house, leaving a disappointingly small hole in the facade.When there was a pause in the fighting, a group of trucks emerged from behind the berm, raced up the track and cut right onto a hillock that overlooked the house. Some pesh merga got out and gathered. They presented a clear target for snipers and artillery, but they didn\u2019t appear to mind. They chatted, laughed, smoked, checked their phones. More group photos, more selfies. Even after two mortar rounds landed in quick succession on either side of them \u2014 a sign that a spotter was nearby, bracketing their position \u2014 they remained unhurried. Eventually they got back into their vehicles and, under fire from the house, headed straight for it. The ISIS fighters had built their own berm beside the house\u2019s exterior wall. The Kurdish soldiers backed their trucks up to it, and one of them opened up on the house with a 50-caliber machine gun. Others peeked over the berm, taking the occasional potshot. One walked up to a gap in the dirt and, with neither cover nor helmet, a cigarette dangling from his lips, emptied a magazine.The 50-caliber jammed. The fighting subsided again. The soldiers reclined at the base of the berm. Out came the phones. More selfies. Texting. A man called his mother. Another watched a video of a firefight taking place on some other front around Mosul. None of them seemed eager to storm the house.\u201cI\u2019m deaf from that cannon!\u201d a soldier said.\u201cDid you take any photos of it being shot?\u201d another asked him.The gunner got into an argument with another soldier over whose responsibility it had been to make sure the 50-cal was working properly that morning. \u201cYou were supposed to fix it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my job!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as if you had to build an airplane. It\u2019s simple.\u201d\u201cYou came all the way to the front in a taxi, and now all you do is talk. You just talk.\u201dAnother burst of gunfire from the house, and a soldier climbed behind the anti-tank gun.\u201cCome help me,\u201d he instructed a colleague.\u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t get up here and help me, I\u2019m going to do everything that\u2019s bad to you.\u201dThe gun was loaded and fired. The backblast shattered a pickup\u2019s windshield.\u201cBazan, where are your cigarettes?\u201dBazan ran to a truck and returned with a pack of cigarettes.\u201cWho wants a cigarette?\u201dThe group lit up.\u201cEveryone here talks like a man,\u201d a soldier said, \u201cbut no one fights like one.\u201dThe pesh merga are commanded by Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government. When ISIS overran Mosul in June 2014, Barzani offered the help of his army to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who snubbed him. It was assumed Maliki worried that Barzani intended to annex whatever land his troops took. Maliki\u2019s successor, Haider al-Abadi, may have delayed the invasion of Mosul for the same reason. But earlier this year, Barzani, Abadi and the international coalition arrived at an agreement that called for the Kurdish forces to halt their advance at Bashiqa.About six miles from the eastern outskirts of Mosul, Bashiqa was inhabited largely by Christians, Kurds and members of the Yazidi minority, most of whom fled when ISIS arrived. The city presented an added political wrinkle in the war because it is in the \u201cdisputed territories,\u201d land claimed by both Iraq and the Kurdish regional government. Certain Kurds, mainly older ones, consider Mosul theirs, too. Partly for this reason \u2014 but more because they\u2019re accustomed to fighting against the Iraqi military, not alongside it \u2014 some pesh merga worried they would be attacked, or at least mistreated, by Iraqi soldiers when the two forces met on the front lines. Speculation about a sequel war between Kurdistan and Iraq was (and still is) commonplace. But so far relations were cordial, and the Iraqi military, knowing it would have its hands full with the close combat in Mosul\u2019s ancient streets, was content to leave the Bashiqa campaign to the Kurds.\u201cThis war is very different for us Kurds,\u201d Barzani\u2019s brother, Sihad Barzani, explained several days after the campaign began. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen airstrikes that we\u2019re not afraid of. This is the first time the Iraqi Army is not trying to kill us \u2014 and we\u2019re not trying to kill them. We hope it stays this way.\u201d He was in a large abandoned house that the pesh merga had commandeered and turned into a field headquarters on the periphery of Bashiqa. The march had brought them to the limits of the city. They had not yet entered, but they had it surrounded. \u201cISIS has no escape. They will have to die now.\u201dThe Barzanis are de facto royalty in Kurdistan. Massoud and Sihad\u2019s father, Mustafa, the patriarch of the incipient Iraqi Kurdish republic, led its revolution against Iraq until his death in 1979. It\u2019s common to meet pesh merga with tattoos of Mustafa\u2019s portrait. As Sihad stepped from the house, a young soldier lifted up his shirt to reveal the face of Mustafa, with his thick black mustache and checkered red head scarf, sprawled across his back. Sihad looked on approvingly. Asked how many of his own family members were fighting ISIS, he gestured at the soldiers gathered in the courtyard and said, \u201cThey\u2019re all my family.\u201dThe Tigris River valley is dotted with villages and olive groves. The ISIS fighters inhabiting it were experienced and disciplined. What they lacked in munitions they made up for in patience, as the pesh merga had learned. Some Kurds had developed a reluctant respect for their adversary. \u201cThey fight as if they want to die,\u201d it was often said.The night before, the jihadists had told the residents of Buharbuq, an ISIS-controlled village near Bashiqa, to be ready to leave at 6 a.m. for Mosul. The intent was obvious: They would be used as human shields. In the middle of the night, the village fled en masse.After leaving the headquarters, Barzani\u2019s convoy passed the refugee caravan, 80 or so cars and trucks stretched along a roadside. The residents of Buharbuq had taken everyone and everything they could: children, mattresses, blankets, grandmothers, pots, buckets, sheep, chickens. One truck contained a motorized wheelchair, another seven newborn lambs. The women were still dressed according to ISIS decree, fully covered in black hijabs and abayas.Officers with the Asayish, a Kurdish internal security agency, met the villagers on the road with a fleet of buses that would take them to a displaced-persons camp. A soldier pulled up with a freight truck full of crackers and water.\u201cAll of our life is wasted in this ISIS mess,\u201d a woman waiting in line said to her husband. \u201cI feel a hundred years old. I hope ISIS goes to hell, then rots in hell.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d her husband replied.There were heartsick roadside reunions. Two old classmates, one a pesh merga who had fled Buharbuq, the other a shop owner who had stayed, hugged for the first time in two years.\u201cLife was very bitter,\u201d the shop owner told his friend. He pulled from his pocket a 1,000-dinar note, less than a dollar. \u201cThis is all my money.\u201dA young man found his mother. She clung to his neck and wept and kissed his face again and again. \u201cThank God,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThank God.\u201dThe main camp was presided over by Barham Arif, one of the youngest and most respected generals in the pesh merga. Tall and taciturn, he led his men into battle in a jaunty black-and-brown-painted MRAP with a GoPro camera duct-taped to the hood.\u201cISIS is not smart and not brave, but they brainwash stupid people,\u201d Arif said. \u201cThey give drugs to their fighters. They fight for 20 minutes and then run away.\u201dFor months, Arif had lived with his men on the pesh merga\u2019s stalemated front line, on the ridge of Bashiqa Mountain, overlooking the valley. A modest cult of personality had formed around the general, and his camp was home to foreign volunteers and soldiers of fortune. There were American medics, a Brazilian and Czech videographer couple and, constantly at Arif\u2019s side, a chain-smoking Scottish self-styled sniper in spectacles. On Facebook, under employer, he listed \u201cpesh merga.\u201dGenerations of Kurds also converged in the camp. A few soldiers were in their 20s. Most were in their 30s, 40s and 50s. One soldier who had come down from the mountain with Arif was Kaefe Ahmed. Ahmed\u2019s father, also a pesh merga fighter, was killed by Iraqi soldiers when Ahmed was 4. Ten other family members had died in war. Ahmed refused to wear a camouflage uniform because, he said, \u201cfor decades the Iraqi Army destroyed our land with these uniforms.\u201d He had fought for more than 20 of his 37 years: in the Kurdish civil war, against Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces and now against ISIS.He and his cousin Robar Ali were in a unit with a tight-knit group of men, some of them related. When ISIS entered Mosul, they fought on its outskirts, before the pesh merga were ordered to withdraw. Had ISIS stopped there, Ahmed and Ali, like most Iraqi Kurds, wouldn\u2019t have worried much about the jihadists living nearby. This was a conflict among Arabs, they felt, and at first ISIS was better than Saddam\u2019s Baathists ever were. \u201cIn the beginning, the ISIS fighters were generally good with people,\u201d Ahmed said. But then ISIS pushed into Kurdistan. Ahmed and Ali fought them in Sinjar, and then in Bashiqa, before it was overrun. The fighting there was particularly bitter. \u201cThey\u2019re suicidal,\u201d he said.The oldest soldier in the camp, as far as anyone knew, was a man named Jamil Rashid. When asked about his age, he first said, \u201cA lot.\u201d Later offerings ranged from 61 to 78. Asked how many battles he\u2019d fought in over the years, he said, \u201cThat notebook does not have enough paper to write them all down.\u201d He ate what food local well-wishers brought to the camp and slept wrapped in a thin blanket in a ditch. Five of his sons were in the pesh merga. One had recently been killed by ISIS. He had more grandchildren than he cared to count.\u201cISIS is nothing \u2014 they\u2019ve been around for two years,\u201d said Rashid, who was fond of listing, in the profanest terms possible, the Iraqi premiers whose regimes he\u2019d fought against. \u201cAbd al-Karim Qasim\u201d \u2014 the Iraqi prime minister of the early 1960s. \u201cI screwed his mother. Then there was Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and then Saddam, and then Nuri al-Maliki. He was a bad guy. And now \u2014 what\u2019s his name again?\u201d\u201cAbadi,\u201d a young soldier said.\u201cRight, Abadi. I fought all of them on this holy ground \u2014 for this holy ground. Our mud is holy. Whoever doesn\u2019t fight for his land takes it in the [expletive]. This land is so precious.\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking about history, Jamil?\u201d another young soldier asked him. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be discussing now.\u201d\u201cSo what if I talk about history?\u201d Rashid said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same, history and now.\u201dThe armored personnel carriers and tanks and trucks filled up in moments. Far more soldiers wanted to take part in the assault than there was space in vehicles. Omar Qapchi, spreading about a mile down a slope that ended in an arterial road at the foot of Bashiqa Mountain, was made up of tightly packed one- and two-story homes. Near its western gate, the column split into three smaller convoys. Arif\u2019s convoy cut across a field toward the road. Though the ground was known to be full of I.E.D.s, some pesh merga cut one another off as they careered over suspicious patches of dirt and objects, racing to get into the action.When the convoy reached the road, muzzle flashes appeared in windows, and bullets whizzed by. The pesh merga strafed the buildings with machine-gun fire and grenades. At the eastern gate, the convoy hooked into the village. The streets were empty. From the residents who had phoned, it was known that about a dozen ISIS fighters were somewhere in the village.The convoy raced into the village center and suddenly found itself in a firefight with a contingent of ISIS gunmen, who, surrounded, had taken a stand at one end of a short, wide alley. The soldiers, on the other end, jumped from their vehicles, piled into the alley \u2014 directly in the line of fire \u2014 and began shooting back. There was little aiming but a lot of yelling. One man stepped into the alley with a grenade launcher. He pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He held the rocket inches from his nose and looked at it quizzically. As bullets hit the dirt near his feet, he slowly peeled off a piece of plastic wrapping, then lifted the launcher back onto his shoulder and tried again. This time it fired.The ISIS fighters took to their heels, and the soldiers, among them Ahmed, gave chase, eventually cornering several jihadists in a mosque. One detonated a suicide vest; another was sheared in half by a rocket. By the end of the day, eight of them had died, three had escaped and one was captured. Three pesh merga sustained minor wounds. Rather than going on foot from house to house to make sure the village was cleared, they gathered outside it and celebrated.\u201cI think I killed someone,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cIt would be a shame if I shot my rifle and didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201dTwo days later, the wind at their backs, Arif\u2019s men moved on Faziliya, a neighboring village. The road to the village was littered with I.E.D.s, which sent up showers of gravel and tarmac. On the wall of a kiosk at the entrance to the village was spray-painted: \u201cEvery ISIS man who dies goes to paradise.\u201d An ISIS flag fluttered on a fence post, but the roofs of the houses, which ranged steeply up the foot of the mountain, bore newly hung white flags: The town\u2019s residents were eagerly awaiting the pesh merga\u2019s arrival. Then gun and rocket fire erupted from a small, windowed spire on a building near the road. A tank reduced the building to smoking rubble.The people of Faziliya streamed from their homes and into the streets. They patted their heads \u2014 a Kurdish gesture of welcome \u2014 and kissed the soldiers. Children chanted: \u201cLong live pesh merga! Long live pesh merga!\u201d In the village square, a group of boys tore down an ISIS billboard. Soldiers shot off celebratory rounds.\u201cWho has cigarettes?\u201d a man asked the soldiers. \u201cWe want to smoke!\u201dA soldier found his wife and children \u2014 their first meeting in more than two years. His mother emerged. She took hold of her son. They sank to the ground in an embrace, their tears streaming together.An officer had already determined that one resident was allied with ISIS. The man was dragged from the group, his hands bound behind his back with a scarf. A green knit face mask was pulled down over his eyes, and he was forced to the ground. He pleaded his innocence.\u201cShut up, you imbecile!\u201d a soldier yelled at him.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious he\u2019s ISIS,\u201d another soldier said. \u201cJust look at his color. He\u2019s taken on the jihadists\u2019 color.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not with ISIS, I swear!\u201d the prisoner said. \u201cI\u2019m a Kurd!\u201d\u201cShut up or I\u2019ll stuff this down your throat!\u201d the first soldier said, jabbing his rifle\u2019s stock in the man\u2019s face.The officer was from Omar Qapchi and had fled the village as ISIS approached it in 2014. From his friends who had stayed, he had heard that the prisoner had driven an ambulance for the jihadists. His son, they said, was with ISIS, too.\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d the prisoner protested. \u201cI was just told to drive somewhere.\u201d\u201cHit him already,\u201d another soldier said.The prisoner\u2019s son, his hands also bound and face covered, was pushed down beside his father. \u201cMy son is a student in Bashiqa,\u201d the father said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything about him. Please don\u2019t put the gun to his head.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just following orders,\u201d the soldier said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said an Asayish commander who had arrived on the scene. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ISIS. We have to investigate.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve humiliated my son!\u201d\u201cSo are you saying your son is ISIS or not?\u201d the soldier asked.\u201cHe\u2019s a student! He\u2019s in ninth grade!\u201d They were bundled into the bed of a pickup and driven away.The Islamic State, the pesh merga knew, hadn\u2019t conquered such large swaths of the country with weapons alone. It had won sympathy among many Sunni Muslims who felt neglected by Iraq\u2019s Shia-dominated national government and abused by security forces. ISIS promised them protection and pride. Many of them saw ISIS as a way out of an already miserable existence.In a displaced-persons camp near Khazer, another front-line town, an elderly farmer who\u2019d fled the village of Topzawa, not far from Bashiqa, which the Iraqi military had taken a few days before, talked about the jihadists fondly. \u201cMost of the young men who joined ISIS were poor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed the money. They had no other options.\u201dThe body of an ISIS fighter who was killed when he went toward Iraqi soldiers in Intisar. The vehicle next to him was probably a car bomb. He had a suicide vest on, and there are two large unexploded bombs next to his body.He confessed that he had come to know some of the ISIS men in Topzawa well. They weren\u2019t foreigners, but Iraqis, ordinary ones. They were kind. They allowed him to travel wherever he wanted to sell his produce. He didn\u2019t mind that the women in his family had to put on more clothing, and he wore a beard anyway. They treated his wife and daughters with the respect that Islam required. \u201cAt the beginning of Islam, with Muhammad, there were good rules. But with democracy, there are no rules. I\u2019m a fair person. I believe in justice. But there are rules in Islam. No one can change them. Not you, not me, not anyone.\u201cISIS treated us as though we were free,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe felt secure under them. In the final battle, they conducted themselves honorably. They fought until they died.\u201d The Iraqi Army, by contrast, relied on foreign airstrikes. The bombs had killed 20 of his sheep, 10 of his chickens and 10 dogs, and when the soldiers finally arrived, they were \u201cvery, very bad.\u201d They forced him from his home and made him come to this camp, where he endured humiliations. His hands were bound. \u201cThey attacked my honor. They told me my wife and daughters had been raped by ISIS. I was disgraced. I wanted to kill myself.\u201dAt General Arif\u2019s camp, the berms had grown taller and the foxholes deeper. ISIS fighters had attacked by night, and by day they lobbed in mortar rounds and handcrafted missiles. Jamil Rashid spoke with a group of younger soldiers as gunfire rang out.\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s air. I like the sound of it.\u201dFinally, the order was given. The night before the assault, Arif\u2019s troops gathered on the mountain above Bashiqa, in their old position. Ahmed and his cousin Ali were part of group of about 30 men who would descend the slope and enter Bashiqa on foot. In the morning, an armored column collected on a road outside the city. Sihad Barzani arrived to wish them luck.\u201cWe must move, but slowly,\u201d he said.For six hours, the column crept toward the city, while airstrikes and artillery pummeled it. As they waited, soldiers checked for news of the American election, the next day, on their phones. Word came down that a sniper was holed up somewhere inside. He had already killed one soldier and wounded four.On the access road into the city\u2019s east end, which climbed up the mountainside, the column drove by a pesh merga bulldozer in flames, the driver incinerated in the cab. As in Omar Qapchi, the streets were quiet. But as the vehicles turned by a small park, a rocket-propelled grenade flew at it. Its orange fireball and white smoke trail, visible for less than a second, were terribly beautiful. The rocket exploded against the low concrete wall of the park. Another quickly followed behind it.The column made it to a central plaza. A handsome old church with a suspicious tower was peppered with machine-gun fire and artillery. Jamil Rashid hopped from the front seat of a truck and took up a position outside the church. Standing in the open, his rifle dangling by his leg, he looked around and breathed in the scent of gun smoke, beaming.The column turned back along the same road it had entered. But now there was an empty white sedan in the middle of an intersection. Was this a car bomb? A roadblock? Had some innocent tried to flee and suffered a breakdown? The driver of the lead tank stuck his head from the turret hatch. A shot cracked the air, its tone higher and sharper than that of a Kalashnikov. Blood sprayed from the driver\u2019s head. He slumped over the turret. His crew mates began screaming and crying. Panic passed down the line. \u201cSniper! Sniper!\u201d The column reversed course, honking and rear-ending, and labored back to the plaza. The tank sped from the city by a different route. At the staging point, the driver\u2019s body was lifted out and put in an ambulance. His friends bent over the tank\u2019s side skirt and knelt in the dirt, weeping.Before the driver was shot, Ahmed, Ali and their detachment had descended into the same side of the city on foot. They came under fire, retreated back uphill and took up a position. A high-pitched crack. Ali lurched forward, falling over Ahmed\u2019s leg. Ahmed thought his cousin had tripped. Then he saw the blood.After the service, long rugs were spread on the floor, and Ahmed and the men from his unit sat down to lunch. Their part in the fight against ISIS was over, for now. Bashiqa was liberated, and the Kurdish line stopped there. But the war against ISIS was not going well for the Iraqi Army, which was still stuck on Mosul\u2019s outskirts, taking a lot of casualties. \u201cIt will be a heavy fight,\u201d one man said.

In 2014, the club had come under scrutiny after the deaths of four others in the previous three years, which police had blamed on drug use.But in a hearing on Monday at Highbury magistrates court in North London, the Borough of Islington, home to the club, said it would allow Fabric to reopen after its owners had agreed to tough new antidrug measures, including preventing anyone under the age of 19 from entering, scanning identifications, and banning for life anyone caught dealing drugs or possessing them.Judy Griffith, promotions manager at Fabric, said by phone from Saint Philip, Barbados, that she was ecstatic about the news, which she said would give a big lift to London\u2019s night life and help secure an important sphere in British culture. \u201cI am over the moon, and very grateful for everyone that supported us.

{"Headline": "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byIt was a rough night for number crunchers. And for the faith that people in every field \u2014 business, politics, sports and academia \u2014 have increasingly placed in the power of data.Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory ran counter to almost every major forecast \u2014 undercutting the belief that analyzing reams of data can accurately predict events. Voters demonstrated how much predictive analytics, and election forecasting in particular, remains a young science: Some people may have been misled into thinking Hillary Clinton\u2019s win was assured because some of the forecasts lacked context explaining potentially wide margins of error.The election prediction business is one small aspect of a far-reaching change across industries that have increasingly become obsessed with data, the value of it and the potential to mine it for cost-saving and profit-making insights. It is a behind-the-scenes technology that quietly drives everything from the ads that people see online to billion-dollar acquisition deals.But data science is a technology advance with trade-offs. It can see things as never before, but also can be a blunt instrument, missing context and nuance. All kinds of companies and institutions use data quietly and behind the scenes to make predictions about human behavior. But only occasionally \u2014 as with Tuesday\u2019s election results \u2014 do consumers get a glimpse of how these formulas work and the extent to which they can go wrong.This year, Facebook\u2019s algorithm took down the image, posted by a Norwegian author, of a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs. The software code saw a violation of the social network\u2019s policy prohibiting child pornography, not an iconic photo of the Vietnam War and human suffering.This week\u2019s failed election predictions suggest that the rush to exploit data may have outstripped the ability to recognize its limits.\u201cState polls were off in a way that has not been seen in previous presidential election years,\u201d said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who is a co-founder of the Princeton Election Consortium. He speculated that polls may have failed to capture Republican loyalists who initially vowed not to vote for Mr. Trump, but changed their minds in the voting booth.Beyond election night, there are broader lessons that raise questions about the rush to embrace data-driven decision-making across the economy and society.The enthusiasm for big data has been fueled by the success stories of Silicon Valley giants born on the internet, like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The digital powerhouses harvest vast amounts of user data using clever software for search, social networks and online commerce. Data is the fuel, and algorithms borrowed from the tool kit of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, are the engine.The early commercial use for the technology has been to improve the odds of making a sale \u2014 through targeted ads, personalized marketing and product recommendations. But big-data decision-making is increasingly being embraced in every industry, and to make higher-stakes decisions that crucially affect people\u2019s lives \u2014 like helping to make medical diagnoses, hiring choices and loan approvals.The danger, data experts say, lies in trusting the data analysis too much without grasping its limitations and the potentially flawed assumptions of the people who build predictive models.Mr. Brynjolfsson said that people often do not understand that if the chance that something will happen is 70 percent, that means there is a 30 percent chance it will not occur. The election performance, he said, is \u201cnot really a shock to data science and statistics. It\u2019s how it works.\u201dSo, what happened with the election data and algorithms? The answer, it seems, is a combination of the shortcomings of polling, analysis and interpretation, perhaps both in how the numbers were presented and how they were understood by the public.Mr. Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, and Mr. Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium said state polling errors were largely to blame for the underestimates of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning.In addition to the polling errors, data scientists said the inherent weakness of election models might have caused some forecasting errors. Before an election, forecasters use a combination of historical polls and recent polling data to predict a candidate\u2019s chance of winning. Some may also factor in other variables, such as giving higher weight to a candidate who is an incumbent.But even with decades of polls to analyze, it is difficult for forecasters to predict accurately a candidate\u2019s chance of winning the presidency months or even weeks ahead of time. Dr. Mutalik of Yale compared election modeling to weather forecasting.\u201cEven with the best models, it is difficult to predict the weather more than 10 days out because there are so many small changes that can cause big changes,\u201d Dr. Mutalik said. \u201cIn mathematics, this is known as chaos.\u201dBut, unlike weather prediction, current election models tend to take into account only several decades\u2019 worth of data. And changing the parameters of that data set can also significantly affect calculations.Advertisement"}

The track is an unhurried disco seduction, sprawling to 10 minutes without overstaying its welcome. Robyn\u2019s vocals move gradually to the foreground from a distant place in the mix, and her lyrics feel almost free-associative: \u201cMmm, the pretty starlight/Yeah, here\u2019s what we like.\u201d The looseness is hypnotic, extending to an accumulation of stray sonic details, like the series of fills played by Per Lindvall, the Swedish session drummer. And the song\u2019s imploring message, as simple yet layered as its title, suits everyone involved. N.C.\u201cNightride,\u201d the album Tinashe suddenly released on Friday, is full of sparse, slow-motion tracks, another of this year\u2019s testimonials to the influence of FKA twigs and Janet Jackson before her. Tinashe sings about independence and connection amid gluey bass lines, echoey ambiences and twitchy synthetic percussion, asserting her free spirit with a blend of sensuality and sci-fi cool. To keep things even more enigmatic, the song \u201cNightride\u201d itself isn\u2019t on the album; it\u2019s just a video clip, although it\u2019s of a piece with Tinashe\u2019s other new songs. After some spoken affirmations, a loop of an Asian zither plinks amid hushed voices and elusive reversed sounds, while Tinashe sings a high, whispery promise like a spooky lullaby: \u201cI will comfort you.\u201d J.P.\u201cMy boyfriend saved me, my mother\u2019s homophobic/I\u2019m stuck in the closet, I\u2019m so claustrophobic.\u201d Kevin Abstract begins \u201cMiserable America,\u201d an arrestingly powerful single from his forthcoming album \u201cAmerican Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story,\u201d with these lines, delivered deadpan, rapped in a style that recalls the incantations of P.M.

J.C.\u201cRetribution\u201d is a dire, cathartic warning from Tanya Tagaq, the Canadian Inuit avant-gardist who won the Polaris Music Prize in 2014. She merges the ancient, the primal and the high-tech. The eight-minute \u201cRetribution\u201d starts with her calmly declaiming about materialism despoiling Mother Earth. \u201cWe squander her soil and suck out her sweet black blood to burn it,\u201d she recites, adding, \u201cThe retribution will be swift.\u201d From there, she grows wordless, guttural and shamanistic \u2014 grunting, hooting, chattering, wailing and screaming through a video that has her dancing in urban environs. An implacable drumbeat, a cutting fiddle line, a distorted guitar, a dissonant string ensemble and a thickening squall of electronics are among the sounds that well up behind her, creating a tsunami of a crescendo that\u2019s both ritualistic and rocking. J.P.The new single by Chemical Brothers should ring familiar to the electronic duo\u2019s fans: \u201cC-h-e-m-i-c-a-l\u201d has long been a fixture of its live show, a fact evoked by the sampled cheers at the top of the track. Expressly designed as a party-starter, it has klaxons, a techno throb, spelled-out brand reinforcement and an ageless tag: \u201cSo let your body rock.\u201d There\u2019s really no new information here, but in a way that\u2019s refreshingly honest: \u201cC-h-e-m-i-c-a-l\u201d isn\u2019t here to plug a forthcoming album, but rather to remind fans of the fact that the group\u2019s first seven albums will be reissued on vinyl next month, in time for the holidays. N.C.Yussef Dayes, a drummer, and Kamaal Williams, a keyboardist, make up the British duo Yussef Kamaal, which builds on the lineage of deep-groove instrumental music: CTI Records fusion from the \u201970s, broken beats and jungle from the early aughts, underground soul and acid house. The group\u2019s debut album, \u201cBlack Focus,\u201d pulls these and other influences into an elliptical orbit, with a chilled-out intensity. There\u2019s good reason to put this music on the same plane as new-breed fusion by, say, Flying Lotus and Makaya McCraven \u2014 but it has a sound and attitude distinctive to the London scene. The group was born out of freewheeling sessions at the Boiler Room, where Kamaal Williams also goes by Henry Wu, and even in its studio incarnation it conveys that creative spark, a sense that the simplest funk loop can lead someplace you weren\u2019t expecting to go.

But a move to challenge the vote tallies in three swing states \u2014 an extreme long shot to reverse his Electoral College majority \u2014 is advancing in the background, creating a noisy distraction on Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed and raising last-ditch hopes of some Hillary Clinton supporters.Neither Ms. Stein nor the Clinton campaign has found evidence of election tampering in any of the three states, where Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton by a combined margin of only about 100,000 votes. But once Ms. Stein seized on the issue last week, the Clinton campaign said it, too, would join in the efforts to seek recounts.The Clinton campaign will pay to have its own lawyers present at recount sites, but it is not contributing money to the effort, campaign officials have said.Ms. Stein said she had invited every candidate, including Mr. Trump, to join her calls for recounts, but she is not seeking money or legal input from the remnants of the Clinton campaign.\u201cWe would not want to be collaborating with the Clinton campaign on this,\u201d Ms. Stein said.Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman, Jason Miller, said in an email that the \u201cmere talk of a recount by someone who got less than 1%\u201d \u2014 Ms. Stein \u2014 \u201cis a joke.\u201dThe president-elect also returned to the issue of voter fraud over the weekend, advancing the baseless charge that \u201cmillions\u201d of people voted illegally.In a span of less than an hour on Monday night, Mr. Trump wrote five Twitter posts in which he asserted without providing evidence that there had been voter fraud, criticized journalists for not doing their jobs and said the fraud had benefited Mrs. Clinton.Ms. Stein asked that the recount of ballots be done entirely by hand, but the elections commission rejected that request. It instead allowed counties to determine whether the ballots should be counted manually or with tabulating equipment. Ms. Stein said on Monday that she would sue to demand the hand count.In all three states, the Stein campaign is seeking to answer the question of whether the vote was hacked by introducing malicious software into voting machines. The possibility was raised by J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan. Although no evidence of hacking exists, Ms. Stein wants to compare paper records of votes with electronic tallies of voting machines, and to subject touch-screen machines (which do not leave a paper trail) to forensic analysis.In Pennsylvania, the hurdles are higher in terms of the number of votes necessary to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, as well as the procedures for initiating a recount.The state, where Mr. Trump holds a lead of 70,638 votes, or 1.1 percent, allows any three voters to petition to recount their local precinct. But despite a call on Sunday from Ms. Stein on Facebook for thousands of Pennsylvanians to file the paperwork, in many cases the deadlines have come and gone, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State.There are more than 9,000 voting precincts in Pennsylvania. Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said she was aware of petitions in only a handful of the state\u2019s 67 counties.The Stein campaign said that as of Monday, voters had filed recount petitions in 120 precincts, including more than 70 in Philadelphia, where the county has not yet certified the vote and petitions can still be accepted, according to Ilann Maazel, a lawyer for the campaign.In Michigan, a candidate can request a recount by citing fraud or errors, said Fred Woodhams, a spokesman for the Michigan secretary of state. But other candidates, like Mr. Trump, could potentially object to such a request by appealing to the Board of State Canvassers.\u201cPeople will be working well after 5 p.m. and on the weekends,\u201d Mr. Woodhams said. \u201cIt will certainly be very challenging, and potentially it could be expensive.

Advertisers, including the Trump campaign, have used this targeting mechanism to encourage a subset of their supporters in swing states like North Carolina and Florida to request an absentee ballot.Many campaign sites include small pieces of software from Facebook or other networks that record who visited the site. This technique, called retargeting, is not unique to politics; you may have comparison-shopped for a computer or other big-ticket item and then discovered that ads for that exact item seemed to follow you around the web for weeks.And it can come across as a personal insult: Just as a devoted iPhone user does not want to be bombarded with Samsung ads, a Trump supporter might not want to be hounded by plugs for Mrs. Clinton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Helped Create Trump, and That\u2019s Bad for It", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the election of Donald J. Trump, technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency.Facebook and Google, for example, have both carried fake, frequently incendiary, articles that were highly shared by their users; Twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well, while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far-right hate groups organize and recruit, frequently targeting women and minorities on the site.The leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldn\u2019t try to police political debates. Facebook explains that it can\u2019t be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization.Nice try. These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels. They see America as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The American auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia. Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, said on Twitter that \u201cDetroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity. That is what is to be avoided.\u201dHere is the explanation from Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn\u2019s founder and a Clinton supporter, for Detroit\u2019s failures: \u201cThe overriding problem was this: The auto industry got too comfortable,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cThe Start-Up of You\u201d (the title alone speaks volumes). \u201cThe moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular.\u201d He also attacked any notion of continuity: \u201cInstead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst, they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism.\u201dMr. Hoffman goes further, arguing that it\u2019s not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world. People must harness them, as well.\u201cThe conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Information is limited. Resources are tight. Competition is fierce. The world is changing. And the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking. This means you need to be adapting all the time. And if you fail to adapt, no one \u2014 not your employer, not the government \u2014 is going to catch you when you fall.\u201dIt\u2019s an exhausting, Darwinian life he is describing \u2014 endlessly adapting to a changing, pitiless world. And it\u2019s precisely the opposite kind of life that Mr. Trump was espousing. His voters wish to return to the inefficient, enthusiastically nepotistic (you might call it family-based) factory life of the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 when America was great. Mr. Trump promised to bring his supporters\u2019 jobs back; the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy.It\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy. But at least he wasn\u2019t publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working Uber driver.There is one final irony. Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals. In the election, the biggest beneficiary of disruption was Mr. Trump, who defied all rules around decency, responsibility, truthfulness, consistency and even social custom, like releasing tax returns. And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied. Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalism also threatens the global consensus that is so important to the expansion of the tech giants. Yesterday, Russian authorities blocked LinkedIn over a data storage law.How do you like your disruption now?Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Race for a Zika Vaccine", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byMADISON, Wis. \u2014 The Zika virus thrives in tropical climates. But it is also growing in this cold-weather city \u2014 up a flight of stairs, past a flier for lunchtime yoga and behind a locked door. That is where scientists working in a lab for Takeda, the Japanese drug company, inspect and test vials of the virus.They are engaged in an all-out race to halt Zika, a disease that has set off worldwide alarm because of its links to severe birth defects. Day and night, these researchers are trying to crack the code to the virus.\u201cWe\u2019re slaves to the cells,\u201d Jeremy Fuchs, a senior researcher at the lab, said.And they are far from alone. Perhaps never before have so many companies and government organizations worked so quickly to develop a vaccine from scratch. Vaccines usually take a decade or more to develop. But researchers say a Zika vaccine could be available as early as 2018, in what would be a remarkable two-year turnaround.More than a dozen companies are on the hunt, in addition to government stalwarts like the National Institutes of Health. To get ahead, some teams are employing innovative technologies that rely on splicing DNA, a method that has the potential to revolutionize the development of vaccines but that has never before been approved for use in humans.The prestige of solving the puzzle and the chance to save lives are possible rewards. For the companies, another motive is the potential for significant profit. Unlike many recent viral outbreaks, which have been confined to poor areas, Zika has spread to countries like Brazil and the United States, with millions of wealthy people and governments that can afford public vaccination campaigns.\u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d said Dr. Thomas P. Monath, the chief scientific officer and chief operating officer of NewLink Genetics, one of the companies developing a vaccine. \u201cIt reflects the big opportunity and public health need, and also the fact that we have more, different technologies available today.\u201dBut meeting the ambitious timeline is far from guaranteed. To keep the fast pace, some clinical trial organizers are trying to start their tests in South America over the next few months, when Zika infection rates are expected to be at their height there.The timing is crucial. An outbreak of Zika provides an ideal testing ground for a vaccine, so the preventive medication can be evaluated in a population exposed to the virus. Researchers will know in short order whether the vaccines being tested are effective.If they miss the window, a vaccine could be delayed for a year or more \u2014 a result that could lead to millions more people becoming infected with the virus.\u201cIt\u2019s a race against nature,\u201d said Michel De Wilde, a vaccine research consultant and former executive at Sanofi, a French vaccine manufacturer.By September, after acrimonious debate and a long delay in Congress, President Obama approved a $1.1 billion spending package to fight the virus. About $400 million of the money will go toward developing a vaccine and diagnostic tests.The escalation of attention has been remarkable. Identified nearly seven decades ago, Zika was once considered mostly harmless, because about 80 percent of people who are infected show no symptoms.Dr. Barney S. Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the N.I.H, was at a meeting in July 2015 when he learned of the threat. A Brazilian doctor pulled him aside at the meeting in Bethesda, Md., which had been called to discuss chikungunya, another tropical disease.\u201cI know we\u2019re here about chikungunya,\u201d Dr. Graham said the doctor told him. \u201cBut I really want to tell you about Zika virus.\u201dSimilar meetings were occurring elsewhere in the vaccine world \u2014 at small companies like Inovio Pharmaceuticals and NewLink, in the offices of big manufacturers like GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, and at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is a few miles from the N.I.H. campus in Bethesda, where Dr. Fauci\u2019s team works.\u201cI said, all hands on deck,\u201d Dr. Fauci recalled. \u201cWe have a serious problem here. We\u2019ve got to really move.\u201dNo single person directs an operation as widespread as the race for the Zika vaccine. But Dr. Fauci certainly sits near the center of it and comes with a singular perspective.And to hear him tell it, the Zika virus does not stand much of a chance.\u201cWithout being presumptuous, most of us in the field feel that we will get a vaccine for Zika,\u201d Dr. Fauci said recently, his staccato Brooklyn accent underscoring his confidence. \u201cSo it\u2019s really a question of what\u2019s the best one, how quickly can you get it, is it safe, and is it scalable?\u201dBut he also knows the stakes.\u201cFor a pregnant woman,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely devastating in its potential impact.\u201dHis team, and the others chasing a Zika vaccine, started with a couple of big advantages. For one, the economic incentives are clear. The first company to develop an effective vaccine will win a toehold in a market that could ultimately reap billions in profit. And because governments are paying for some of the early development, the financial risk is limited.Also, the disease belongs to a family of viruses known as flaviviruses, which scientists have been battling for more than a century. Vaccines already exist for some of these viruses, such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and dengue.Another good sign: Adults infected with Zika seem to fight off the illness on their own, meaning the human body, if given the right tools, already has the resources to defeat it.The vaccine hunters had several options. The tried-and-true method is what is known as a killed vaccine, in which a dead virus is injected into the body. The body then builds its defense against the virus in a way that also protects against the live version. This is how many vaccines work, including those for polio and the flu.Several teams, including those at Takeda and one at Walter Reed, chose that path. Walter Reed\u2019s candidate entered early clinical trials in this month. Sanofi has signed on to bring that product to market.The advantage of the killed vaccines is that they are reliable. Several vaccine specialists said they were confident a Zika vaccine using this method would succeed. The downside is that developing one takes time, sometimes decades.Other teams, including Dr. Fauci\u2019s scientists at the N.I.H., decided on a newer approach. It involves manufacturing a harmless piece of the virus\u2019s DNA, the molecule that acts like an instruction manual for the body. Once injected, the DNA tells human cells to make Zika proteins. Those proteins then assemble themselves into harmless viruslike particles that trick the body into developing antibodies that can fight the disease if it arrives.It is a startlingly simple and fast approach. Dr. Fauci\u2019s team created a prototype that it could begin testing in mice within weeks.\u201cYou can jump in right away,\u201d he said.However, DNA vaccines are largely unproved in humans. While the technology has been approved for animals, none of the vaccines have been approved for humans. A vaccine developed by the N.I.H. to prevent West Nile, another virus related to Zika, succeeded in early trials but never completed trials and was not brought to market because researchers could not find a drug company that was interested.Part of the reason DNA vaccines are tricky, researchers say, is because the vaccine\u2019s DNA must reach the nucleus of a person\u2019s cells before it can begin instructing them to make Zika proteins. When the vaccine is injected into the body, not all of it reaches the nucleus, lowering its effectiveness.To solve this problem, some companies are trying a similar method that uses RNA, a molecule in the body that is more flexible than DNA. Among the things it can do is carry out, on its own, the instructions contained in DNA. The vaccine would not need to reach a cell\u2019s nucleus to trigger the immune response.GlaxoSmithKline and Moderna Therapeutics, using government grants, are working on RNA vaccines for Zika that are still in their early stages.If one or more Zika vaccines are successful, it is unclear who would ultimately get them. The medication could be used only during outbreaks, or it could become routine in some parts of the world.Early trials of the DNA-based vaccine developed by the N.I.H. are underway, and studies have begun in Puerto Rico of a similar vaccine being developed by Inovio.The next step will be to test the vaccines in a larger pool of people who live where Zika is present. That stage must be intricately set so that the trials occur at just the right moment, at the height of summer in Latin America, which starts in December.Not a day can be wasted. The N.I.H.\u2019s trial coordinators are setting up trial sites at more than 20 locations in Central and South America. Once the trials begin, the coordinators will monitor local Zika cases, moving resources to sites of outbreaks and away from places where the virus is quiet.Researchers say they are taking a lesson from the Ebola outbreak of 2014, which also spurred a race for a vaccine. In that case, the outbreak was brought under control before many of the trials could take place.\u201cAll of us felt like we kind of really missed the boat with Ebola,\u201d said Col. Nelson Michael, who is leading the Zika vaccine effort at Walter Reed. \u201cWe brought troops too slowly into the fight.\u201dIn a clinic at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore in September, several volunteers waited hours in a hallway to be among the first to receive the experimental DNA vaccine being developed by the N.I.H.Some read college textbooks, others browsed Facebook.Jen Wenzel, a volunteer and a postdoctoral fellow in neuroscience, said she signed up out of curiosity \u2014 and to make extra money. Volunteers are paid as much as $1,600 if they complete the study.When it was her turn, Ms. Wenzel winced and looked away from the needle about to deliver the vaccine. \u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d said a nurse, who then quickly jabbed the needle into Ms. Wenzel\u2019s arm, making her gasp in surprise.And with that, Ms. Wenzel became the 29th person at the University of Maryland, and one of only dozens worldwide, to have received a potential Zika vaccine. Over the next two years, she will return to the clinic for follow-up tests to see how well it works.Of course the researchers chasing a vaccine \u2014 and the many millions of people concerned about catching the virus \u2014 hope to have an answer long before then.Advertisement"}

I was always looking for ways to get a different perspective on the music and the moments offstage. My work gained deeper importance after Sharon\u2019s cancer diagnosis in 2013.  I did not see much of her while she went through her year of treatment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the filmmaker Barbara Kopple was with her, filming what would be the documentary \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Sharon Jones!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but I was there for Sharon\u2019s comeback performance at the Beacon Theater in 2014 after her treatment and recovery.I was still looking for the moments onstage that showed Sharon\u2019s power and joy as a performer, but I also saw the immense effort she made to get out there. Sharon went through a ritual before performing: some time for quiet reflection and a summoning of energy in the wings in the moments before taking the stage. She would get nervous, as if she wasn\u2019t sure she could pull it off despite having thousands of shows under her belt. She had to go deep inside in a very solitary way to find what she needed to connect with the energy of the music, the band and the audience.  As she confronted cancer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return, this cycle took on added intensity. When I photographed her on tour with Daryl Hall & John Oates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which turned out to be some of her final performances \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she was undergoing chemotherapy and managing a lot of pain. Her back was sore and stiff, her legs and feet were numb from neuropathy. She spent the day summoning every bit of strength so she could take the stage and give her best performance. It was her selfless commitment to the audience and to the band. But she needed the music for herself, too. When she was onstage, her face would light up and she seemed free from pain and illness. Body willing, her performances were more incandescent than ever.Even more heroically, she was not even the headliner, but an opening act in sweltering heat at nondescript outdoor amphitheaters in the Midwest. But I never saw her phone it in, or give less than everything. Abbey Simmons, the assistant tour manager and Sharon\u2019s closest nurturer and caretaker, told me, \u201cShe wants to die onstage.\u201d When shooting Sharon\u2019s performances, I tried to find the openings where I saw her connected to something deep: expressions of joy, God and love.Sharon was completely open. The only time she didn\u2019t want pictures was when she was trying to move into the right frame of mind to sing (or was just looking out for someone in the dressing room who didn\u2019t have their pants on yet). Once she was in her zone, I could be there with her. She wanted to be portrayed truthfully.The last one-on-one time I had with Sharon, we were in a crummy trailer in the back lot of an outdoor venue in Indiana. The room\u2019s furnishings consisted of a folding table and chair, a cheap mirror and a couch missing half of its pillows. She was doing her makeup before going out to perform in 95-degree heat. Without any prompting, she told me how much she wanted to keep going for the band, for the label, for her family and for all those who were a part of her world.  It hit me that she was aware of her limited time and how profoundly generous she was in giving herself to the music.We left the trailer and went to wait side-stage for the show to start. Brian Wolfe, the drummer on tour, told Sharon, \u201cYou look like an Egyptian queen.\u201d"}
{"Headline": "World (or at Least Brooklyn) Stops for Lost Dog", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byPet CityBailey, a 2\u00bd-year-old goldendoodle, lived a placid, largely uneventful life on a block of handsome brownstones in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, until 7:15 on the morning of Oct. 24.That was when her owner leashed her to a metal chair outside Henry\u2019s Local, a coffee shop on Henry Street, and went in for an iced latte.Another customer entered the cafe. Bailey, startled, jumped to the side. The chair crashed to the sidewalk. The noise spooked Bailey further.She bolted \u2014 down Henry Street, dragging the clattering chair behind her, with her owner, Orna Le Pape, in pursuit, yelling: \u201cBailey, stop! No! No!\u201dBailey ran diagonally through the intersection at Carroll Street. Then the chair snagged on something. Bailey broke free, leaving the chair and her leash and ID tags behind. She turned right at the When in Rome hair salon onto her block, President Street.She ran right past her house, and she kept going.Ms. Le Pape, 47 and fit but no match for a sprinting dog, lost sight of Bailey at the next corner, but passers-by yelled directions: \u201cShe went that way!\u201dBailey went left and left again, toward the waterfront. When Ms. Le Pape got to Columbia Street, on the far side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, no one was on the street. She screamed Bailey\u2019s name. She guessed at a direction to run. She passed people. No one had seen her.Gone.Every week, dozens of dogs and cats go missing in New York City. Their distraught owners put up signs. Some turn up alive. Some do not. Over the next few days, Bailey somehow became a phenomenon, a cause, and in her rarefied corner of Brooklyn and beyond, a social media star.Now it was around 7:30 on a Monday, a school and work day, though Ms. Le Pape, a psychotherapist, had no patients scheduled until evening.She ran home, got her car and began an aimless, frantic drive in search of the dog. She called home and told her 14-year-old son to find photos of Bailey (a dog with a shaggy tan-cream coat, a chestnut beard and enormously long eyelashes) and start printing out fliers. She drove home, picked them up, walked to a nearby copy shop to make more and started posting them, crying all the while.Ms. Le Pape canceled sessions with her evening patients, citing a family emergency. All day, she wandered the tidy precincts known collectively as Brownstone Brooklyn. Up Columbia to Atlantic Avenue, down Hicks Street by the expressway, west to the factories and warehouses of Red Hook, swinging by the dog run beneath by the highway overpass.Everywhere Ms. Le Pape went, people seemed compelled to help. They asked for an extra flier so they could post it on Facebook, or make copies and tape them up elsewhere. They offered suggestions \u2014 call vets, call shelters, call animal rescue places, go to the police.\u201cI went to the sanitation garage, down by the water, and the guy said, \u2018I\u2019m announcing this on roll call until they find her,\u2019\u201d Ms. Le Pape said. \u201cI ran into absolute strangers who said they were going to church to pray for my dog.\u201dShe printed over a thousand fliers. Omar at the copy shop would not take her money.In the evening, Ms. Le Pape became fixated on Brooklyn Bridge Park, a mile and a half north of her house \u2014 a quiet place to hide for a dog who hates loud noises. From 11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., Ms. Le Pape and her mother, who had come out from Manhattan to help, wandered the deserted park, calling the dog\u2019s name.Nothing.Tuesday: Day 2. Ms. Le Pape started getting calls from people who said they had seen Bailey the day before.She was able to reconstruct some of Bailey\u2019s route: 7:30 a.m. on Monday near the Brooklyn Bridge, a mile and a half north of her house. Then a mile and a half southeast of the bridge at Nevins and Degraw Streets. At 10:30 p.m. on Monday, Bailey had been spotted on Henry Street, five blocks from her house, but running the wrong way. That first day she covered at least 4 miles, probably considerably more.Ms. Le Pape went to the city pet shelters in East Harlem and East New York, Brooklyn. Nothing.More acts of kindness. Near the Fairway supermarket in Red Hook a man flagged her down. \u201cHe said, \u2018I see you\u2019re offering a reward on your sign. I have the winery that\u2019s down here \u2014 tell people the reward is they can come for a tasting and a tour.\u2019\u201dIt is not clear why the search for Bailey drew such an outpouring of support. Part of it may be that Carroll Gardens retains an intimate small-town feel.It certainly did not hurt that she was a particularly appealing dog.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the entire neighborhood would mobilize for an aggressive-looking dog,\u201d Ms. Le Pape said.A cynic might wonder if class had anything to do with it. A friend of Ms. Le Pape\u2019s had another theory. \u201cShe said, \u2018At a time like this, when there\u2019s so much turmoil going on around the election, here\u2019s this story that everyone can latch on to and be on the same side. Everyone wants a lost dog found.\u2019\u201dAt 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Ms. Le Pape was awakened by a dream: Bailey is downstairs, go downstairs.\u201cI didn\u2019t listen to the voice because it was crazy.\u201dOutside, she found dog poop on the sidewalk in front of the house. It appeared to be a few hours old. It looked like Bailey\u2019s.\u201cI thought, \u2018What if I pick it up and took it to the vet and had them analyze it?\u2019\u201d Ms. Le Pape recalled. \u201cI was reaching for anything.\u201dMs. Le Pape canceled her Wednesday appointments to continue the search. \u201cWe heard you have to do at least a three-mile radius,\u201d she said.In her part of Brooklyn, there are something like 1,500 blocks within a three-mile radius.At 10 p.m. on Wednesday evening, more than 60 hours after Bailey dashed off, Ms. Le Pape was riding a bike two neighborhoods from home, calling Bailey\u2019s name, and her phone rang.\u201cThis woman is panting and puffing,\u201d she recounted. \u201cShe says, \u2018I\u2019m following your dog, trying to stay with her.\u2019\u201d Bailey was on Sackett Street, just a few blocks from home. Ms. Le Pape flew down Columbia Street. She ran into the woman: \u201cShe said, \u2018I was trying to call you again \u2014 we lost her.\u2019\u201dThe phone rang again. Someone had just seen Bailey in Red Hook, on Van Brunt Street.And again: \u201cI see your dog,\u201d a man told her. Bailey was on Degraw Street, heading in the direction of home.Ms. Le Pape called her mother. \u201cI just sort of screamed something to the effect of, \u2018Everyone get downstairs!\u2019\u201dMs. Le Pape\u2019s older son opened the door. There was Bailey, at the top of the stoop.She was starving and dehydrated. She had lost eight pounds. Her paw was bleeding. But she was intact.Ms. Le Pape and her mother began to notify everyone who had been helping with the search, including Edie\u2019s grieving owner, Olly Smith. \u201cThis is the most wonderful news,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cWe\u2019re so, so happy for you all.\u201dBailey has resumed her old life, with one notable change: the coffee place.\u201cI still go there every day,\u201d Ms. Le Pape said. \u201cBut without her.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 16, 2016Akhil Reed AmarCharles FriedWe have a direct democracy: Senators, representatives and members of the Electoral College are all elected directly by the people. They do not, however, elect the president directly. This is a feature of the kind of government we have chosen from the beginning in which the states are important subsidiary (in some instances, primary) units of government. Even after a civil war and two world wars, the states control a large measure of the laws, administration and finance that have an impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. The states have  their own political cultures, personalities and traditions which persist in spite of our far more transient population, an interconnected national economy and national news media. In order to reflect this mode of governance, the interactions between the national government and the states in important matters often utilize the local units and personnel. The notion is that the states are not simply administrative units of the national government or its local offices. In that context it is quite appropriate that the head of state is elected state-by-state, albeit by popular vote in each state. That way at the most focused democratic moment, every four years the candidates and parties must take the states into account.  And sometimes it will happen that, as this year,  there will be a significant divergence -- millions of votes -- between who is chosen by the Electoral College and the winner of the overall popular vote.  Sometimes that disparity can act as a caution to the elected president, but where the House and Senate are in the hands of the elected president's party that caution is less likely to operate.\nI prefer direct national election of our president. I take states seriously and value federalism, but in a different way than do most defenders of the status quo.  Consider the fact that each state picks its own president-equivalent \u2014 its governor \u2014 quite directly:  one person, one vote.  All votes are counted equally and in close races recounted carefully.  America should copy this state-tested model when choosing the governor of us all: the president."}

{"Headline": "The Election Polls That Matter", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWith just days left in the 2016 presidential election, Americans are wondering if polling is accurate or if we\u2019ll see a Brexit-style shock.It\u2019s not just voters who ask these types of questions. On the eve of Election Day in 2012, as the campaign manager for President Obama\u2019s re-election, I was asked to meet him at a rally in Milwaukee.\u201cGallup has me down by three points, and other polls have me trailing, tied or with a slight lead,\u201d the president said. \u201cYour models have this race basically over. Why are we right and they are wrong?\u201dThe best campaigns don\u2019t bother with national polls \u2014 I\u2019ve come to hate public polling, period. In the 2012 race we focused on a \u201cgolden report,\u201d which included 62,000 simulations to determine Mr. Obama\u2019s chances of winning battleground states. It included state tracking polls and nightly calls from volunteers, but no national tracking polls.In Milwaukee, I assured the president that the golden report was predicting a victory, with 332 electoral votes. On Election Day, that was the exact number of electoral votes the president won.Today, campaigns can target voters so well that they can personalize conversations. That is the only way, when any candidate asks about the state of the race, to offer a true assessment.Hillary Clinton can do that. To my knowledge, Donald J. Trump, who has bragged that he doesn\u2019t care about data in campaigns, can\u2019t.When we started the president\u2019s re-election effort, we instilled a team culture in which our assumptions were tested and our work was constantly measured and refined. No detail went overlooked: We did a study of how far the reception desk should be from the front door of a local campaign office to make volunteers feel welcome.I could also point to hard numbers anytime President Obama wondered if yet another visit to Ohio was a good idea. (It always was!) The number-crunching that campaigns do ultimately leads to a rally in a high school gym in a state that is (or might become) important \u2014 something political junkies would do well to remember in the closing days of this election.For example, in recent days, Mr. Trump has campaigned in New Mexico, a state he has no chance of winning. Candidates can get more money and adjust their message, but the one thing they can\u2019t do is make more time; every wasted hour in a noncompetitive state is a grave error. Mrs. Clinton continues to go on the offensive in states like Arizona, where the race is close.\u201cBig data\u201d is a buzzword, but that concept is outdated. Campaigns have entered the era of \u201clittle data.\u201d Huge data sets are often less helpful in understanding an electorate than one or two key data points \u2014 for instance, what issue is most important to a particular undecided voter.With \u201clittle data,\u201d campaigns can have direct, highly personalized conversations with voters both on- and offline, like an ad on a voter\u2019s Facebook page addressing an issue the voter is passionate about. In 2016, we see that online political engagement rates (especially for young voters) are at a historic high.This is why campaigns no longer pay much attention to public polls, which often use conversations with just a few hundred people to make predictions about the entire electorate. Getting a truly representative sample has become ever more difficult because of the growing percentage of households with only cellphones, the number of voters who prefer to speak a language other than English, and the difficulty in contacting younger voters, who generally don\u2019t have landlines.Smart campaigns can use \u201clittle data\u201d to solve these problems. They look at public data sets that list each registered voter\u2019s name, address, party registration and election participation history. By analyzing these voter files, they develop an accurate idea of the makeup of the electorate. Rather than rely on voters\u2019 (frequently inaccurate) estimates of their own likelihood to vote, these campaigns look at their turnout record, thus getting a very precise idea of who \u201clikely voters\u201d really are. The media outlets that conduct national polls usually can\u2019t afford to do this.Even the best public polling can tell us only about broad categories of voters \u2014 not much help guiding a personalized conversation via text message, as is more common with voters in 2016 than it was even in 2012.When I work with campaigns, I prefer to focus on sophisticated modeling to make predictions about specific voter behavior. We can identify the key voters \u2014 not just big groups like \u201cindependent women\u201d \u2014 with whom we want to communicate at each stage of the election, and what we want to say to persuade them or remind them to vote. For instance, campaigns in Florida no longer look at the Cuban-American electorate as a monolith \u2014 we know that younger Cuban-American voters are very supportive of the Democratic Party.You see this clearly in the early-voting numbers. It\u2019s crucial for campaigns to \u201cbank\u201d their voters and make sure their key targets vote early. I suspect the early-voting numbers coming out of Nevada contributed to the Trump campaign\u2019s decision to spend less money on TV ads in the state.As we move into the final days of the 2016 election cycle, the smart money is on the campaigns \u2014 like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u2014 that are leveraging the power of data to find every last vote they can.Jim Messina, the chief executive of the Messina Group and a chairman of Priorities USA Action, was the campaign manager for President Obama in 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Reaches Tentative Deal With Union in Canada", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byAs with the Canadian branches of General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the union focused on preserving jobs as much as traditional contract issues like wages.Jerry Dias, the union\u2019s national president, said that the company would invest about 700 million Canadian dollars, or $522 million, to introduce a new engine at one of three engine factories Ford has in Windsor, Ontario. He said that the two older of those Windsor factories, which had been widely expected to close, would probably remain open.\u201cAre we better off today than we were yesterday in Windsor?\u201d Mr. Dias said. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201dHe added that with the new investment, the company\u2019s employment in the city would probably increase.The contract, which covers about 6,400 workers, otherwise generally mirrors agreements Unifor had made with the two other companies. Among other things, the contract will accelerate the rate at which new employees move to their new, higher wages. In turn, the union agreed that those workers would only have pension plans that paid out depending on performance, rather than the traditional plans, which have payments of a guaranteed size.As Monday\u2019s strike deadline neared, Unifor\u2019s leadership was torn between contradictory demands from Ford and a rift among its members who work at the company.According to the union, Ford\u2019s negotiators said that the company would match the agreements that Unifor had signed with General Motors of Canada and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Canada only if the union agreed to accept cost cuts.Under a system known as pattern bargaining, Unifor has always taken the position that it would not give any of the three Detroit-based automakers special concessions. Doing so, it has contended, would create an unfair advantage for one company.Ford declined to answer specific questions about the negotiations before the settlement was announced. After the talks ended, Mr. Dias said that the union did not make any cost concessions like allowing the use of temporary workers.In an unusual move, the president of the Unifor local that represents Ford\u2019s biggest plant in Canada, a sport utility vehicle assembly plant west of Toronto in Oakville, Ontario, said that his members opposed the agreement reached with G.M. and Fiat Chrysler.Mr. Thomas reiterated his position after Fiat Chrysler accepted the terms of the pattern contract.But the local chapter that represents workers at the three Ford engine factories in Windsor accused the Oakville local of jeopardizing the future of Ford in Canada.The Windsor local, using language normally reserved for denouncing employers\u2019 demands, reprimanded its Oakville counterpart.\u201cWe have never seen a bargaining committee that openly wants to gamble on the future of all Canadian operations and call a bluff,\u201d the bargaining committee wrote in the post. It said, \u201cIt\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair to all Unifor Ford members.\u201dEarly Tuesday, Mr. Dias said the union had successfully negotiated some gains with Ford beyond what was included in the pattern agreement. But he declined to describe them and noted that the contracts with all three companies included some unique terms.There are few concerns about Ford\u2019s Oakville plant, where 5,000 Unifor members produce the Ford Flex, the Ford Edge and two Lincoln models, the MKX and MKT. It has received substantial investment over the last decade. Mr. Dias said that the plant now had an additional mandate to make vehicles for sale outside North America.But two of the plants in Windsor are in adjacent factories that date from 1923. Their 600 employees make large, V-10 truck engines. Tighter fuel economy and emissions standards have darkened the outlook for such engines.Mr. Dias said that plant would continue to make V-10s for the foreseeable future, although he suggested that employment might fall there.The new engine will be made in a comparatively new factory elsewhere in the city that currently builds V-8s for the Ford Mustang and the F-150 pickup truck.An earlier version of this article, and an earlier correction, misstated the number of Ford Motor engine factories in Windsor, Ontario. There are three; a fourth factory, an assembly plant, is in Oakville.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Automated Pro-Trump Bots Overwhelmed Pro-Clinton Messages, Researchers Say", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 An automated army of pro-Donald J. Trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting Hillary Clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election, according to a report published Thursday by researchers at Oxford University.The chatbots \u2014 basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills \u2014 would send messages on Twitter based on a topic, usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol, like #Clinton.\u201cThey\u2019re yelling fools,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cAnd a lot of what they pass around is false news.\u201dIn some cases, the bots would post embarrassing photos, make references to the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server, or produce false statements, for instance, that Mrs. Clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail.Because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers, it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign, except for a handful of \u201cjoke\u201d bots created by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, they noted.However, there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort.\u201cThere does seem to be strategy behind the bots,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cBy the third debate, Trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing Clinton hashtags.\u201dA hashtag is used to indicate a Twitter post\u2019s topic. By adopting hashtags relating to Mrs. Clinton, the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among Clinton supporters.After the election, the bot traffic declined rapidly, with the exception of some pro-Trump programs that gloated, \u201cWe won and you lost,\u201d Dr. Howard said.Trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags.\u201cAnyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the U.S. election had an effect on voters\u2019 opinions or influenced the national Twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how Twitter works,\u201d said Nick Pacilio, a Twitter spokesman.The researchers based their study on a collection of about 19.4 million Twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of November. They selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least 50 times a day.\u201cFor example, the top 20 accounts, which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts, averaged over 1,300 tweets a day and they generated more than 234,000 tweets,\u201d the researchers noted. \u201cThe top 100 accounts, which still used high levels of automation, generated around 450,000 tweets at an average rate of 500 tweets per day.\u201dThe Oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote.The researchers have coined the term \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.The bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well. During the British campaign, they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around Israeli-Palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro-Brexit. After the vote, the bots returned to their original issue.In the case of the American election, the researchers noted that \u201chighly automated accounts \u2014 the accounts that tweeted 450 or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period \u2014 generated close to 18 percent of all Twitter traffic about the presidential election.\u201dThey also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports.One of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call \u201cselective affinity.\u201d\u201cClinton supporters will cut the Trump supporters out of their network, and Trump supporters will do the same,\u201d Dr. Howard said. \u201cThe polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self-groom our news networks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungry Venezuelans Flee in Boats to Escape Economic Collapse", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byWILLEMSTAD, Cura\u00e7ao \u2014 The dark outlines of land had just come into view when the smuggler forced everyone into the sea.Afraid of the authorities, the smuggler refused to land. Ms. Bello said he gruffly ordered her and the others into the water, pointing toward the distant shore. In the panic, she was tossed overboard, tumbling into the predawn blackness.But Ms. Bello could not swim.\u201cIt was worth the risk,\u201d said Ms. Bello, 30, adding that Venezuelans like her \u201care going after one thing: food.\u201dVenezuela was once one of Latin America\u2019s richest countries, flush with oil wealth that attracted immigrants from places as varied as Europe and the Middle East.But after President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez vowed to break the country\u2019s economic elite and redistribute wealth to the poor, the rich and middle class fled to more welcoming countries in droves, creating what demographers describe as Venezuela\u2019s first diaspora.Now a second diaspora is underway \u2014 much less wealthy and not nearly as welcome.Well over 150,000 Venezuelans have fled the country in the last year alone, the highest in more than a decade, according to scholars studying the exodus.\u201cParents will say, \u2018I would rather say goodbye to my son in the airport than in the cemetery,\u2019 \u201d he said.Desperate Venezuelans are streaming across the Amazon Basin by the tens of thousands to reach Brazil. They are concocting elaborate scams to sneak through airports in Caribbean nations that once accepted them freely. When Venezuela opened its border with Colombia for just two days in July, 120,000 people poured across, simply to buy food, officials said. An untold number stayed.\u201cIt has all totally changed,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n de la Vega, a sociologist at Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University in Caracas. About 60 percent more Venezuelans fled the country this year than during the year before, he added.\u201cThe earnings of these people are low,\u201d Mr. de la Vega said of the recent migrants. \u201cThe only option left to them is the nearby countries, ones they can get to on foot, or by rafts, or go on boats with tiny motors.\u201d\u201cVenezuelans like myself are coming to Brazil for a simple reason: It\u2019s easier to survive here,\u201d said Reinier Salazar, 30, an industrial engineer who moved to Brazil last year. Now he cooks at a fast-food restaurant for about $400 a month \u2014 much more than he made back home in Venezuela, he said.The exodus is unfolding so quickly that since 2015 about 30,000 Venezuelans have moved to the border region that includes the Brazilian state of Roraima, officials say. Now the Brazilian Army is bolstering patrols along highways and rivers, bracing for even more arrivals.\u201cWe\u2019re at the start of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in this part of the Amazon,\u201d said Col. Edvaldo Amaral, the state\u2019s civil defense chief. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing Venezuelan lawyers working as supermarket cashiers, Venezuelan women resorting to prostitution, indigenous Venezuelans begging at traffic intersections.\u201dSome are paying smugglers more than $1,000 a person to reach cities like Manaus and S\u00e3o Paulo, officials say, while others just manage to cross the border into Brazil. In Pacaraima, a small Brazilian border town, hundreds of Venezuelan children are now enrolled in local schools and entire families are sleeping on the streets of town.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a solution to this problem because hunger is involved,\u201d said the mayor, Altemir Campos. \u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t have enough food for its people, so some are coming here.\u201dThe small Caribbean islands neighboring Venezuela are far less hospitable, saying they simply cannot absorb the onslaught. The closest to Venezuela\u2019s coast, Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, have effectively sealed their borders to poor Venezuelans since last year by making them show $1,000 in cash before entering \u2014 the equivalent of more than five years of earnings in a minimum-wage job.Both countries have increased patrols and deportations, and Aruba has even set aside a stadium to hold as many as 500 Venezuelan migrants after they are caught, according to the authorities.It\u2019s a dramatic reversal of fortune for Venezuelans, who once went to Cura\u00e7ao to spend money as tourists, not to plead for work.\u201cThey all say, \u2018You are from Venezuela. You are from a rich country that has everything,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Bello said of her encounters on the island. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018No longer.\u2019 \u201dEmpty homes now dot the streets of the fishing town of La Vela, Ms. Bello\u2019s hometown in Venezuela, their owners having set off by sea.They have mortgaged property, sold kitchen appliances and even borrowed money from the same smuggling rings that pack them on the floorboards alongside drugs and other contraband.The journey to Cura\u00e7ao takes them on a 60-mile crossing filled with backbreaking swells, gangs of armed boatmen and coast guard vessels looking to capture migrants and send them home.Then, after being tossed overboard and left to swim ashore, they hide in the bush to meet contacts who spirit them anew into the tourist economy of this Caribbean island. They clean the floors of restaurants, sell trinkets on the street, or even solicit Dutch tourists for sex, forced by the smugglers to pay for their passage by working in a brothel, the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao say.Countless families in Venezuela are like the Bellos now. Unable to scrounge together more than a meal a day, they are scattered across seas and borders.Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Rolando works construction in Cura\u00e7ao and his wife recently joined him, leaving their 7-year-old daughter with relatives back home. An uncle of Ms. Bello\u2019s was not so lucky: He sits in a Cura\u00e7ao prison, accused of smuggling migrants like his relatives.Then there is Wilfredo Hidalgo, Ms. Bello\u2019s 27-year-old cousin, who studied business administration in Venezuela but never found a job. Two years ago, he was deported from Cura\u00e7ao after coming by plane. Now he is trying to return by boat, having saved half of the $350 he needs to pay the smugglers.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he said.There is also Ms. Bello\u2019s brother Roger, whose 19-year-old girlfriend, Yaisbel, is six months pregnant. He, too, said he would go to Cura\u00e7ao to support his child. Yaisbel said she would stay behind but take a loan from smugglers to pay for her boyfriend\u2019s journey, using her mother\u2019s house as collateral. Hopefully, she said, her mother would never find out.\u201cI am just watching her stomach,\u201d Roger Bello said. \u201cBefore the child is here, I will be in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201dAnd finally there is Ms. Bello\u2019s mother, Maria Pi\u00f1ero, who gave her a life vest just before she left, knowing that she could not swim. But the smuggler ripped it off Ms. Bello just before she was thrown into the sea, saying that the swells were so high she was better off swimming under the waves.Now, despite Ms. Bello\u2019s ordeal, her mother vowed to make the journey by boat, too.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m leaving with nothing. But I have to do this. Otherwise, we will just die here hungry.\u201dOne evening at the end of September, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, 47, climbed aboard a boat in a small town on the country\u2019s northern coast. She dropped to her knees, praying to God that she would survive the journey and find a better life in Cura\u00e7ao.The other passengers, tears in their eyes, began to pray too, some joining hands in a circle on the beach. They muttered hopes that the coast guard would not catch them, that they were good people, that they were mothers and fathers.They waded chest-deep into the water, hoisting their few possessions overhead, and climbed into the boat. Its motor started and it steered toward the horizon.Even the smuggler seemed distraught at the misfortune bringing him profits.\u201cI would prefer that the crisis ended and my business was over,\u201d the smuggler said after they had left. \u201cI would prefer a thousand times that there was no crisis and we could live in the Venezuela from yesterday.\u201dJes\u00fas Ramos knew he would have to swim ashore from the smuggler\u2019s boat. So he spent his last weeks in Venezuela doing laps in the sea in front of his home in La Vela, his mother recalls.His friend William Cordero, 29, went too. He spent that month applying for a business license for the salon he planned to open with all the money he expected to make in Cura\u00e7ao. He had already bought a sign.\u201cMy Faith In God Barbershop\u201d it said.But the boat carrying the men never made it.The two friends, along with three other migrants and a captain, vanished somewhere off the coast of Venezuela last year. No wreckage was found. The only evidence that their journey even occurred is a few selfies sent from their smartphones just before they departed. The men posed on the side of the skiff with big smiles.\u201cI try not to cry; I tell myself, \u2018He\u2019s well, that\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201d said Florangel Amaya de Ramos, Mr. Ramos\u2019s mother.The plan had been a simple one: A seven-hour journey in a speedboat. If they were stopped by Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s coast guard, they would pose as tourists. And with their documents in plastic bags, they were ready to swim ashore, knowing that the smuggler wanted to make a quick getaway. Then they could find their contacts using cellphones tucked in empty rice porridge jars.Mr. Cordero already had a Cura\u00e7ao mobile-phone chip. Two years before, he had boarded a plane to Cura\u00e7ao and worked illegally as a barber there, earning several thousand dollars that he sent to his wife and two children in La Vela. But in 2015, Mr. Cordero was deported.He returned to a new, grimmer Venezuela. Long lines for food were becoming startlingly common in La Vela and inflation hit triple digits.Even in big cities like Caracas and Maracaibo, staples like corn flour, the cornerstone of the Venezuelan diet, have become increasingly hard to find, while a growing black market for other goods has driven prices beyond the reach of many. In rural towns like La Vela, residents are even more squeezed, with fewer goods than large cities and a poorer population with less money to pay for them.Mr. Cordero tried to make the best of things by opening a barbershop on his sister\u2019s patio, wearing a white uniform like the one he wore in Cura\u00e7ao. But he earned only about 40 cents per haircut, compared with $35 or more per day in Cura\u00e7ao.The lure of the island grew more intense than ever. But the country had put the new visa restrictions on Venezuelans, and the door was shut behind him. The only way back was with a smuggler by boat.Mr. Ramos, Mr. Cordero\u2019s friend, knew a man who was collecting 200,000 bolivars each, or about $200 at the time, to run a smuggling boat. Mr. Ramos, a lanky 20-year-old, had also been deported recently after working as a gardener in Cura\u00e7ao, but had not managed to find work back in Venezuela. Once the money ran out from his first trip, his wife and three children were spending many days hungry.The smuggler found two other men from the area, and a fifth migrant named Jessica M\u00e1rquez who had come from M\u00e9rida, a city nearly 400 miles away.The five waited anxiously in La Vela for several days as the smuggler got reports from other fishermen in Cura\u00e7ao about coast guard patrols, trying to decide which night would be safest to leave.Mr. Cordero\u2019s sister, Saribeth Cordero, recalled the group sitting in her brother\u2019s barber shop on her porch one afternoon as a movie played on the television about a shipwreck.\u201cWhat if there are sharks?\u201d asked Ms. M\u00e1rquez, Ms. Cordero recalled.\u201cYou can\u2019t be negative like that,\u201d Mr. Cordero said, his sister recalled. But she said her brother was scared too. \u201cHe was nervous about the ocean,\u201d Ms. Cordero said.The group finally headed off in good spirits. Mr. Ramos had sold his motorcycle to pay the smuggler, telling his mother he would not need it anymore. She packed him a waterproof bag with some meager belongings: soap, toothpaste, antibiotics and a few clothes. A van arrived and they left.That afternoon, they arrived at the rendezvous point with the smuggler, a town called Tucacas. They stayed the night in a hostel there. The motor of one of the boats had failed recently, something that worried Mr. Ramos when he wrote to a friend who had agreed to meet him in the jungle once he landed in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. man\u2026 just relax, you\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d the friend wrote in Facebook message that Mr. Cordero forwarded to his mother.\u201cYes bro, tomorrow, God willing,\u201d Mr. Ramos wrote back.Mr. Cordero climbed aboard the boat and sent a selfie to his sister. He wore yellow board shorts and no shirt, making a peace sign with his hands.It was the last anyone heard from anyone in the group.The first to know something had gone wrong was Ms. Ramos. The friend in Cura\u00e7ao wrote over Facebook that he had waited all night but her son never arrived.\u201cI cried all night,\u201d she said.Questions haunt the families of the lost migrants each time they look out toward the sea. Could the men still be alive somehow? Will Venezuela ever return to the country that it was, one where it was not necessary to swim to the shore in Cura\u00e7ao after being tossed from a fishing boat?Ms. Ramos is still waiting for her son and speaks of him in the present tense. Each Sunday, she goes to Mass to pray for his return.\u201cI always speak to God,\u201d said Ms. Ramos. \u201cI am always looking up at that picture of the Virgin. I am scared one day she will yell back at me, \u2018Enough, already. That\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201dRolando Bello sat on a pier in Cura\u00e7ao, worrying about his mother. It was September, a week before she stepped aboard a boat to join him in Cura\u00e7ao. He knew the dangers well, having made the journey twice himself.Last year, he says, Mr. Cordero and Mr. Ramos had approached him to join their doomed trip before they set off.\u201cI was this close to going,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see what would have happened to me.\u201dNow his family was being subjected to the dangerous whims of the passage once more.His mother\u2019s boat was getting ready to set off. His sister, who had been dragged ashore by her hair, had been caught by the Cura\u00e7ao authorities and deported back to Venezuela over the summer. Desperate to work, she had sneaked into Aruba instead, taking a loan from a smuggling ring to get there.But at least his wife was with him. She came to Cura\u00e7ao that month under a new scheme. Because she did not have the $1,000 needed to pose as a Venezuelan tourist at customs, smugglers rented her the money to satisfy the new cash requirement, which is imposed only on Venezuelans. The smuggler\u2019s agents in Cura\u00e7ao then quickly approached her at the airport to take back the money \u2014 and to collect the $100 rental fee.Mr. Bello\u2019s wife, Lennymar Ch\u00e1vez, sat next to her husband and the two ate a large lunch. A boat sailed past a row of colonial facades, and Venezuela felt a world away.\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten an arepa for three months,\u201d she said, referring to the Venezuelan staple of corn flour, which has become increasingly hard to find at home. \u201cI ate one here in Cura\u00e7ao for the first time.\u201dThey had left their 7-year-old daughter in La Vela with relatives. Mr. Bello had trained to be an engineer in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. Now he was a construction day laborer, happily earning about $65 a day. Ms. Ch\u00e1vez trained to be a nurse, but held few hopes of working in her profession in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201cI don\u2019t mind cleaning now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe important thing is that I\u2019m working here.\u201dBut the authorities in Cura\u00e7ao, like many tiny islands, fear the immigrants will undercut the local labor force or bring violent crime.\u201cMy preoccupation is what kind of people are entering Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d said Nelson Navarro, the island\u2019s justice minister who argued that the increase in Venezuelans coincided with a 15 percent rise in crime, particularly armed robberies. \u201cIn Venezuela, they don\u2019t hesitate to shoot a police officer, but here, this is news.\u201dAlex Rosaria, a legislator on the island, worries that the migrants will further strain Cura\u00e7ao, where unemployment is at 11 percent.\u201cWe have only a limited capacity to deal with refugees,\u201d Mr. Rosaria said.For now, the task has been left to the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. Rob Jurriansen, a Dutch naval officer who heads operations in Cura\u00e7ao, says his small fleet intercepted only a tiny fraction of the migrants, perhaps just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants arriving in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao, the islands the fleet patrols.Now, he says, officials in the Netherlands, the former colonial power that is still formally tied to Cura\u00e7ao within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, fear they will also get stuck with the bill of caring for a migrant tide.\u201cThey want to prevent a situation like Libya,\u201d he said, referring to the much larger flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe.His station is close to Caracas Bay, now the landing point of many who flee Venezuela. Dense, thorny brush covers the island for miles in each direction, forming a maze through which the migrants wander as they enter Cura\u00e7ao.Far across the passage, the seas had calmed and Mr. Bello\u2019s mother was preparing for her second attempt. After nearly reaching the island in September, her boat turned back, fearing it was being pursued by the Coast Guard.It set out again on a clear October night at 9 p.m. Mr. Bello\u2019s mother, Ms. Pi\u00f1ero, sent a message to relatives just before taking off. It had been a choppy ride on the first voyage, but this time the 13 passengers glided smoothly over the waves.But the flat ocean also meant they were visible when they arrived early the next morning, before dawn. Somewhere on shore, Coast Guard officials say they saw what they called a \u201cstrange blip\u201d on the water.Ms. Bello was the first in the family to learn what happened next, when a friend called at 6 a.m.\u201cGirl, they got your mother,\u201d the friend said. \u201cThey caught the boat with drugs.\u201dMs. Bello didn\u2019t want to believe the news, but opened her computer to see what she could find online. Already, images were circulating of the passengers being apprehended by the authorities. Ms. Bello recognized her mother.\u201cYes, it was her with the red hair, the one covering her face so she could not be seen,\u201d she said of her mother.Ms. Bello\u2019s mother landed with a dozen other passengers in detention, she said in a brief telephone interview, watched over by guards. She sounded desperate and tired, her voice cracking.\u201cI thought that trying would be worth it, but in the end it wasn\u2019t, because I\u2019m headed back,\u201d she said, before the line clicked and she was gone.Her son Rolando Bello remains in Cura\u00e7ao with his wife, but his mother\u2019s capture casts a heavy shadow in the small home they share with another Venezuelan migrant family. The couple was trying to gather the money for Ms. Pi\u00f1ero\u2019s plane ticket back to Venezuela, which deportees are required to pay. They would send it through a third party to avoid being discovered themselves.One evening last month, Mr. Bello was alone, wondering if the promise of Cura\u00e7ao had been worth the damage to his family.\u201cOnly God knows the sacrifice one makes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut fine. This is life.\u201dHer daughter, Ms. Bello, was angry.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad because we hope we will arrive in one piece,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then suddenly, after a journey so long, they catch you. And just send you back to Venezuela.\u201d\u201cJust imagine the despair my mother is in,\u201d she added. \u201cShe has no money. Now she may have to sell her house. What a crazy thing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Roger Bello and Yaisbel, the woman who is pregnant with his child. Mr. Bello is her boyfriend, not her husband.An article on Nov. 26 about a diaspora of poorer Venezuelans fleeing poverty and hunger omitted the names of two of the three Caribbean islands that a fleet of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard patrols for refugees. Besides Cura\u00e7ao, the fleet also patrols Aruba and Bonaire. In addition, the article paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Rob Jurriansen, a coast guard officer who heads the fleet. Mr. Jurriansen said his fleet had intercepted just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants \u2014 not boats \u2014 coming to those three islands from all countries, not only Venezuela.Ana Vanessa Herrero and Meridith Kohut contributed reporting from Willemstad and La Vela, Venezuela, and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Reportage Turns to Cynicism", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byFixesThe election of Donald J. Trump has led to considerable soul searching in the news business, as journalists confront the role we played in his triumph. Much has been written about the billions of dollars of free media coverage Trump received, journalists\u2019 lapses in challenging his outrageous falsehoods, and our clumsy grappling with how to treat his unconventional candidacy.But the news coverage that helped Trump the most wasn\u2019t about the campaign. It began long before it \u2014 decades before his candidacy, in fact. Trump was the beneficiary of a belief \u2014 near universal in American journalism \u2014 that \u201cserious news\u201d can essentially be defined as \u201cwhat\u2019s going wrong.\u201dTo make his case, Trump recounted a near-daily vision of a government hopelessly broken and corrupt, cities that had become \u201chellholes,\u201d military leaders who resembled the Keystone Kops, immigrants flooding into the country stealing jobs \u2014 when they\u2019re not raping and killing. In America\u2019s inner cities, he said, you saw: \u201cPoverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing, no homes, no ownership. Crime at levels that nobody has seen.\u201dThe erosion of belief has been gradual. It didn\u2019t begin with the internet or cable TV, and it is not entirely because of the new enthusiasm for getting news from social media or late-night comedians. It can, ironically, be traced instead to the years of the Vietnam War, Watergate, C.I.A. surveillance of Americans and other profoundly disillusioning experiences in the 1960s and 1970s, when reporters were doing what the originators of the First Amendment had in mind \u2014 checking the power of public officials by holding them accountable.That was a public service, and it ended a more permissive era when a more timid brand of journalism glorified leaders, knowingly looking away from their personal and professional lapses. Unfortunately, the pendulum swing led to a new problem: hypercynicism, with virtually everything about America\u2019s leaders, power brokers and civic actors, including their private lives, fair game for scrutiny. Speaking truth to power now meant taking down all icons, exposing all pretension and looking for self-interest and \u201cspin\u201d everywhere.Disillusionment and cynicism have become natural byproducts of everyday journalism. We\u2019re not talking about politically tainted news, or the \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads\u201d reflexes of local TV coverage, which provide nightly reinforcement of the threat of violence from strangers \u2014 even as that threat is negligible for the vast majority of people.We\u2019re talking about a problem at the very core of journalism: the unstated theory of change that might be summed up as: \u201cSociety will get better when we show where it is going wrong.\u201d We are presenting what\u2019s wrong with the world as if that\u2019s all there is.As a result, what audiences see beyond their direct experience is a world of unchecked pathology, and it makes it all too easy to fear and demonize others. It shapes people\u2019s behaviors and choice of leaders. During the election, citizens had considerable information about the candidates, and they knew about their own lives and problems. But they were easily bamboozled about the extent and nature of problems in the country and the world.What happens when the story is not about carnage but about courage? When Ebola was rampant, headlines promising global catastrophe dominated the news. The thousands of deaths in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone incited global fear. But Mali contained Ebola with only eight cases. Nigeria contained it with 19 cases. Senegal stopped the virus after a single case. Did journalists deliver resounding headlines about how these countries achieved these successes? Did they follow up with stories of government competence after harping on government incompetence? Of course not. There is now an Ebola vaccine, which was developed with remarkable speed \u2014 in time, in fact, to end the epidemic. How many journalists focused on that? Billions of people were terrified by Ebola. Do even a few thousand know about the vaccine?Every major problem presents opportunities for reporters to show how people are responding. Whether an effort fails, is marginally successful or works well, it provides information crucial to democracy. It shows that people care. It helps new ideas circulate. It shows that incremental system change is possible. It shows that beyond your direct experience, there are other communities where people who look different from you are also trying to build a better society. This nurtures the respect that makes society work.Journalism has a language with which to describe threats and failures, but it is tongue tied when it comes to letting society know when there\u2019s a win. Part of this is simple sensationalism. But perhaps more important is that journalists have become afraid to cover remedies, lest we seem gullible (which, for a journalist, is the greatest sin). We are comfortable, however, covering failure, and adding to the narrative of decline.This distortion of reality takes a toll. We know from psychological research that a steady diet of news about violence, corruption and incompetence leads to increased fear, learned helplessness, hopelessness, cynicism, depression, isolation, hostility, contempt and anxiety. The journalist Walter Lippmann wrote: \u201cThe way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do.\u201dIn the wake of Trump\u2019s election, we need to ask if today\u2019s approach to news is tenable for a democracy whose survival depends on the belief and agency of its citizens.And how can it be tenable for the news business to ask people to pay for a product that is painful to consume? Audiences tune out. But we know they tune back in when they can learn that something can be done. That feels empowering. (Showing that success is possible is also crucial for holding power accountable; it takes away the excuses of those who are venal or incompetent.) In a BBC World Service survey, two-thirds of its under-35 audience said they wanted news not just to tell them about problems, but to help them understand what could be done. Gradually, news organizations in Europe and the United States are beginning to listen and explore remedies.These kinds of stories are abundant and real; they are the hidden history of our time. The best defense against the fear-mongering of the demagogue is to reveal the decency, competence and courage of people determined to fix their society. We don\u2019t have to make these stories up. We just have to report on them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Social Media\u2019s Globe-Shaking Power", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtYet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news. In fact, the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the world: With billions of people glued to Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, Twitter, Weibo and other popular services, social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political force, to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events.The election of Donald J. Trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the planet, social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society. They have subsumed and gutted mainstream media. They have undone traditional political advantages like fund-raising and access to advertising. And they are destabilizing and replacing old-line institutions and established ways of doing things, including political parties, transnational organizations and longstanding, unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia.Most important, because these services allow people to communicate with one another more freely, they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among once-marginalized groups. These ad hoc social movements range widely in form, from \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacists in the United States to Brexiters in Britain to ISIS in the Middle East to the hacker collectives of Eastern Europe and Russia. But each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable power, resulting in unpredictable, sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms.\u201cYou now have billions of people on the internet, and most of them are not that happy with the status quo,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a research firm that forecasts global risks. \u201cThey think their local government is authoritarian. They think they\u2019re on the wrong side of the establishment. They\u2019re aggrieved by identity politics and a hollowed-out middle class.\u201dMany factors accounted for Mr. Trump\u2019s win: middle-class economic anxiety in the industrial Midwest; an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national direction; and some mix of latent racism, xenophobia and sexism across the electorate. But as even Mr. Trump acknowledged in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired Sunday, social media played a determining role in the race.\u201cThrough this new technology, people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their grievances,\u201d Mr. Bremmer said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for social media, I don\u2019t see Trump winning.\u201dFor people who like an orderly, predictable world, this is the scariest thing about Facebook; not that it may be full of lies (a problem that could potentially be fixed), but that its scope gives it real power to change history in bold, unpredictable ways.But that\u2019s where we are. It\u2019s time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the world-shattering forces that their boosters long promised they would be \u2014 and to be unnerved, rather than exhilarated, by the huge social changes they could uncork.This should come as no surprise. In a way, we are now living through a kind of bizarro version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media.Over much of the last decade, we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world. There was the Green Revolution in Iran and the Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa. In the United States, we saw the Occupy Wall Street movement and the #BlackLivesMatter protests.Social networks also played a role in electoral politics \u2014 first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of Howard Dean in 2003, and then in the election of the first African-American president in 2008.The Islamic State has used social networks to recruit jihadists from around the world to fight in Iraq and Syria, as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas.And in the United States, both Bernie Sanders, a socialist who ran for president as a Democrat, and Mr. Trump, who was once reviled by most members of the party he now leads, relied on online movements to shatter the political status quo.Why is this all happening now? Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University who has studied the effects of social networks, suggested a few reasons.\u201cWhen the technology gets boring, that\u2019s when the crazy social effects get interesting,\u201d Mr. Shirky said.\u201cWhite ethnonationalism was kept at bay because of pluralistic ignorance,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cEvery person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the TV about immigrants or was willing to say white Christians were more American than other kinds of Americans \u2014 they didn\u2019t know how many others shared their views.\u201dThanks to the internet, now each person with once-maligned views can see that he\u2019s not alone. And when these people find one another, they can do things \u2014 create memes, publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview, and then break into the mainstream. The groups also become ready targets for political figures like Mr. Trump, who recognize their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for real-world victories.Mr. Shirky notes that the Overton Window isn\u2019t just shifting on the right. We see it happening on the left, too. Mr. Sanders campaigned on an anti-Wall Street platform that would have been unthinkable for a Democrat just a decade ago.Now, after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, the way forward for Democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on Facebook as by elites in Washington \u2014 and, as a result, we\u2019re likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past.The upshot is further unforeseen events. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely going to get more of these insurgent candidates, and more crazy social effects,\u201d Mr. Shirky said.Mr. Trump is just the tip of the iceberg. Prepare for interesting times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Fake News Goes Viral: A Case Study", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byEric Tucker, a 35-year-old co-founder of a marketing company in Austin, Tex., had just about 40 Twitter followers. But his recent tweet about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations against President-elect Donald J. Trump fueled a nationwide conspiracy theory \u2014 one that Mr. Trump joined in promoting.\u00a0Mr. Tucker's post was shared at least 16,000 times on Twitter and more than 350,000 times on Facebook. The problem is that Mr. Tucker got it wrong. There were no such buses packed with paid protesters.But that didn't matter.Here, The New York Times deconstructs how Mr. Tucker\u2019s now-deleted declaration on Twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon. It is an example of how, in an ever-connected world where speed often takes precedence over truth, an observation by a private citizen can quickly become a talking point, even as it is being proved false.Mr. Tucker, who had taken photos of a large group of buses he saw near downtown Austin earlier in the day because he thought it was unusual, saw reports of protests against Mr. Trump in the city and decided the two were connected. He posted three of the images with the declaration: \u201cAnti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin\u201d Mr. Tucker said he had performed a Google search to see if any conferences were being held in the area but did not find anything. (The buses were, in fact, hired by a company called Tableau Software, which was holding a conference that drew more than 13,000 people.) \u201cI did think in the back of my mind there could be other explanations, but it just didn\u2019t seem plausible,\u201d he said in an interview, noting that he had posted as a \u201cprivate citizen who had a tiny Twitter following.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m also a very busy businessman and I don\u2019t have time to fact-check everything that I put out there, especially when I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going out there for wide consumption.\u201d Sean Hughes, the director of corporate affairs for the bus company Coach USA North America, said he learned about the rumor involving its vehicles after receiving a couple of curious emails and hearing from a friend in New Jersey who had seen the claim on Facebook and wanted to know if it was true.\u201cThat reporter said, \u2018You\u2019re probably going to get a lot more phone calls because it\u2019s all over the place,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hughes said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cYou\u2019re the second journalist to actually call me to see what was going on, no bloggers or anything, and we\u2019re easily accessible on our website,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.He added, \u201cI just kind of wish people looked into facts before they go ahead and do something like that, because it could be easily debunked based on a quick phone call or two, or a couple emails.\u201d Mr. Tucker considered deleting his tweet about the buses, but Mr. Trump\u2019s message emboldened him. \u201cI figured if he were to say something like that, I might be barking up the same tree,\u201d Mr. Tucker said. When asked if Mr. Trump might have been relying, at least tangentially, on the erroneous message he had sent about the buses, Mr. Tucker said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say why Trump tweeted when he tweeted. I just don\u2019t know and I truthfully don\u2019t think any of us will ever know.\u201dDoreen Jarman, a spokeswoman for Tableau, said the company issued a statement to the local television station KVUE and The Austin American-Statesman on Nov. 11, saying that the buses were connected to the company\u2019s conference. After midnight, Mr. Tucker deleted his original tweet, then posted an image of it stamped with the word \u201cfalse\u201d for posterity. It did not receive much attention. After a week, that message had 29 retweets and 27 likes. The Snopes article has been shared about 5,800 times according to its website, a fraction of the number for the fake version of the news. Faced with the impact of his initial tweet, Mr. Tucker, who now has about 960 Twitter followers, allowed himself a moment of reflection. \u201cAnytime you see me in the future going out there where I think there\u2019s going to be a big audience, I can assure you I\u2019m going to try my best to be balanced with the facts and be very clear about what is opinion and what is not,\u201d Mr. Tucker said. If he could go back, he said, \u201cI might have still tweeted it but very differently. I think it goes without saying I would have tried to make a more objective statement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many would rather not ponder critical decisions about feeding tubes, funeral homes and other end-of-life issues until the need is thrust upon them.But as our population ages and the industry gets more attention, new firms \u2014 many of them technology companies \u2014 are setting out to compete on price and convenience.A new crop of tech start-ups is hoping to capture a slice of that sector. Many are founded by millennials, who have grown up online and expect to shop for \u2014 and curate \u2014 everything there.As baby boomers become more comfortable shopping online, these start-ups are finding a highly engaged audience. And those in their 20s and 30s, hitting major life events like marriage, the birth of a child or the loss of a parent, also require planning services.The typical customer would be someone like Michelle LaBerge, a resident of Oshkosh, Wis., who recently turned 50 and helped her parents move into an assisted living community. Those events reminded her that she needed to get her own affairs in order.For $30, Ms. LaBerge created a will customized to suit her particular circumstances. \u201cIt was very easy,\u201d she said. \u201cI compared it to my parents\u2019 will, done by an attorney, and it looked the same.\u201dThe founders of Willing, Eliam Medina and Rob Dyson, wanted to create a platform that allowed users to complete their own estate planning documents like a will, power of attorney and health care directive.\u201cIf you look at what TurboTax has done for tax planning, we wanted to do the same thing for estate planning,\u201d said Mr. Medina, the company\u2019s chief executive.An early version of the platform was introduced in Florida in January 2015. Consumers were invited to try the service free and about 500 wills were created, Mr. Medina said. That summer, Willing, based in Miami, went through the start-up incubator Y Combinator, where it expanded to all 50 states. The company has raised $7 million. Mr. Medina says 25,000 wills a month are created on the platform.A team of people posing as shoppers seeks out pricing and services information from funeral homes that are unaware the information is for the site. An increasing number of funeral directors, however, are voluntarily working with Parting to put their information in the database, which now has more than 15,000 funeral homes.It is backed by an angel investor and is increasing about 27 percent a month in searches and visitors, said Tyler Yamasaki, a founder.Still, it has been an uphill battle getting these traditionally small, mom-and-pop companies to promote themselves, Mr. Yamasaki said.\u201cIt\u2019s a big, slow industry and a lot of these funeral homes aren\u2019t open to start-ups,\u201d he said. Funeral homes can get a free basic listing on Parting or pay for a premium listing, which increases their visibility. If a home gets a customer through the listing, Parting collects 12 to 15 percent of the funeral bill as its fee.\u201cLike what are the 60 things I need to do in the next three months? At Grace we say, \u2018Here are the 17 things you need to do this week\u2019 and you can check them off as you do them. Here\u2019s what you do the week before someone dies, when they die and then two weeks later.\u201dToday, most of Grace\u2019s customers call in and are helped by staff members who are also licensed funeral directors \u2014 including Mr. Kruger and his co-founders. \u201cIn some ways death is still handled by talking to other people,\u201d he said.Grace connects families with vetted providers, including estate lawyers, financial planners, funeral homes and caterers. Customers receive a list of tasks to complete before and after a death, including the necessary paperwork, but the staff can also help with funeral planning, filling out forms and other tasks.Mr. Kruger said Grace has had some unusual requests, like shipping a body to Romania and closing a deceased individual\u2019s Tinder account.The company, founded in June, has raised under $2 million in seed funding and transactions are growing about 20 percent a month. Grace\u2019s services are offered only in Southern California, but Mr. Kruger said they would be in Northern California by the end of the year and in additional states next year.Possibly the most difficult situation consumers face is to decide how to be cared for at the end of their lives, and communicating that to family members.The start-up has been self-financed until now but is now closing a seed round, said Suelin Chen, a founder and chief executive.The platform asks users a series of questions to help them determine their preferences. Their answers are used to populate their Cake profile, to which they can add notes and instructions to family members or friends.\u201cPeople get very inspired by what other people do. It\u2019s a part of living,\u201d Ms. Chen said. And now it\u2019s part of dying, too.Advertisement"}

It suggested that she had died, at age 45, leaving us without \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite news reporter.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a news story written by a Times reporter. And it isn\u2019t true: Kelly is alive and prosperous, exceptionally so. But it has appeared, with some regularity, on the Times website, as an advertisement pretending to be a news story.In other words, it\u2019s fake news, or at least a version of it.Harvey, a Times reader from Reno, Nev., has been noticing the ad awhile now, and wrote me this week to complain. \u201cThis ad, or \u2018clickbait,\u2019 keeps popping up on various New York Times pages online,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is unacceptable. Please stop these ads, which frankly make me feel like the NY Times is no better an outlet than the horrifying Facebook feeds with all of their fake news clickbait items.\u201dHow could such fraudulent content wind up on the Times website? Through something called programmatic advertising, which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people. It\u2019s machine to machine, like a stock market matching buyers with sellers.Both The Times\u2019s newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid false, misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site. But it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads automatically, without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits.Sebastian Tomich, a senior vice president in advertising, says The Times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false Megyn Kelly claim. But the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact \u2014 once the ad has already appeared.Thus, the Kelly ad has now been reported and taken down. Tomich says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently.Tomich says The Times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business. I agree. Relative to the size of the site and the volume of advertising, The Times doesn\u2019t have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about weight-loss remedies.As measured by sheer impact, there is no comparison between a handful of fake-news ads on the Times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on Facebook. One is a brook, the other is an ocean.But there are similarities too. Both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys readers, and that can diminish a brand.Fake-news ads like the Megyn Kelly one may not be rampant at The Times, but it\u2019s still worth taking a good look at whether The Times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them. That\u2019s particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash point, and when The Times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems.Advertisement"}

Trump said Thursday that he had reached out to the Carrier air conditioner company in Indiana to ask it not to move more than 2,000 factory jobs from Indiana to Mexico.In a post on Twitter Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said: \u201cI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\u201dI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!During both the primary and general election campaigns, Mr. Trump frequently cited the February decision by Carrier and its corporate parent, United Technologies, to close two Indiana factories and move production to Mexico as an example of how Nafta and other free-trade agreements had failed American workers.The two plants \u2014 a Carrier factory employing more than 1,400 workers in Indianapolis and a United Technologies plant with 700 employees in Huntington \u2014 are profitable, but pay workers $15 to $26 an hour \u2014 about what the company\u2019s workers in Monterrey, Mexico, earn in a day.In a time of slow economic growth and intense pressure from Wall Street to improve profits, moving production south of the border seemed like too good of an opportunity for United Technologies\u2019 executives to pass up.In a tweet Thursday after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, Carrier confirmed that the president-elect had reached out, but refused to say what steps, if any, management was now considering.\u201cCarrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together,\u201d the company said. \u201cNothing to announce at this time.\u201dFor workers in Indianapolis, the Twitter exchange provided a ray of hope on an otherwise anxious Thanksgiving holiday.\u201cEveryone is posting about it on Facebook and there\u2019s a lot of excitement,\u201d said Paul Roell, who has worked at Carrier for 17 years and was an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Trump in the election.\u201cI\u2019m a little more optimistic now,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers are saying, let\u2019s see if he\u2019s really going to do this.\u201d\u201cI was very surprised to see it on Thanksgiving today,\u201d Mr. Roell added. \u201cI figured he\u2019d be like everyone else today, with his family, not thinking of Carrier.\u201dEarlier in the week, Indiana state officials had come to the factory to describe what benefits workers could expect as layoffs approach, Mr. Roell said.

{"Headline": "Facebook Shouldn\u2019t Fact-Check", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBut as a journalist who has been covering the inner workings of the technology industry for more than a decade, I find the calls for Facebook to accept broad responsibility for fact-checking the news, including by hiring editors and reporters, deeply unsettling.What those demanding that Facebook accept \u201cresponsibility\u201d for becoming the dominant news aggregator of our time seem to be overlooking is that there\u2019s a big difference between the editorial power that individual news organizations wield and that which Facebook could. Such editorial power in Facebook\u2019s hands would be unprecedented and dangerous.We can all agree that Facebook should do much more to make sure that blatantly fabricated claims that Donald J. Trump won the popular vote or received the pope\u2019s endorsement don\u2019t spread and are, at a minimum, labeled fakes.Facebook admits, and my sources confirm, that it can do a better job of this by helping users flag dubious articles and predicting fakes based on data it has for search. This doesn\u2019t have to involve humans: Facebook could decide to label content as suspected as fake if it was flagged a certain number of times and if it displayed other questionable attributes. Such a move would not mean Facebook\u2019s taking broad responsibility for what\u2019s true.But hiring editors to enforce accuracy \u2014 or even promising to enforce accuracy by partnering with third parties \u2014 would create the perception that Facebook is policing the \u201ctruth,\u201d and that is worrisome. The first reason has to do with the nature of Facebook\u2019s business. The second has to do with the news business.One thing is clear to anyone who has worked in a newsroom: Not all fact-checking decisions are black and white.Did the pope endorse Mr. Trump? He did not.News organizations like my own publication make these judgments a million times a day. And we sometimes get them wrong. But we are checked by the power of our competitors and, for news organizations with a subscription business, by readers who stop paying us if we fail them.To be sure, this business model is under great stress as people lose trust in news organizations. But I don\u2019t believe the solution is to give up on it, particularly if the alternative is to cede the power of authentication to companies like Facebook.No matter how many editors Facebook hired, it would be unable to monitor the volume of information that flows through its site, and it would be similarly impossible for readers to verify what was checked. The minute Facebook accepts responsibility for ferreting out misinformation, users will start believing that it is fact-checking everything on the site.And what about more private content in groups or messages? For that to be fact-checked, Facebook users would have to trade their privacy (as an analogy, imagine AT&T fact-checking phone calls). That isn\u2019t a position I think Facebook would ever want to be in.The second reason I am fearful of Facebook as fact checker is what it will do to journalism.If you don\u2019t believe that Facebook\u2019s policies could sway the news industry, you haven\u2019t been paying attention over the past five years. Publications have been suckered into tweaking their content and their business models to try to live off the traffic Facebook sends them. They\u2019ve favored Facebook clicks over their core readers, and are no closer to addressing plummeting print revenues. What would happen if the distribution of their articles on Facebook was tied to submitting data about their sources or conforming to some site-endorsed standards about what constitutes a trustworthy news source?My fellow reporters and editors will argue that I am letting Facebook off too easy. While my husband did work there for a brief period, my position isn\u2019t a defense of the company, which I have covered critically for years. I simply don\u2019t trust Facebook, or any one company, with the responsibility for determining what is true.Jessica Lessin is the founder and chief executive of The Information.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The End of the Postracial Myth", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Of course, that post-racial dream did not last long, and nothing epitomizes the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that belief more than the election last week of Donald J. Trump. As I watched my home state of Iowa join the red flood that overtook the electoral map last Tuesday, I asked myself the same questions that so many others did: What happened? Why had states that reliably backed Obama \u2014 states like Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 flipped Republican?I was struck by how quickly white pundits sought to tamp down assertions that race had anything to do with it. It was, it seemed to me, almost a relief to many white Americans that Trump\u2019s victory encompassed so many of the heavily white places that voted for a black man just years before. It was an absolution that let them reassure themselves that Donald Trump\u2019s raucous campaign hadn\u2019t revealed an ugly racist rift after all, that in the end, the discontent that propelled the reality-TV star into the White House was one of class and economic anxiety, not racism.But this analysis reveals less about the electorate than it does about the consistent inability of many white Americans to think about and understand the complex and often contradictory workings of race in this country, and to discuss and elucidate race in a sophisticated, nuanced way.While we tend to talk about racism in absolute terms \u2014 you\u2019re either racist or you\u2019re not \u2014 racism and racial anxiety have always existed on a spectrum. For historians who have studied race in the United States, the change from blue to red in heavily white areas is not surprising. In fact, it was entirely predictable. \u201cThere are times when working-class whites, whether rural or urban, will join an interracial alliance to get the short-term gains they want,\u201d Robin Kelley, a history professor at U.C.L.A., told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t ever do it without kicking and screaming.\u201dThe Rev. Jesse Jackson, the first black man to run for president (and second black American, behind Shirley Chisholm), made similar inroads with rural white farmers during his 1984 and 1988 campaigns. This was simply because he reached out to them promising to push policies that would specifically help them, like ending foreclosures on family farms and forgiving their debt. He did not get a majority of this vote, but he got a surprisingly significant portion.Decades later, large numbers of rural and suburban white voters were willing to cast their lot with Obama and his multiracial coalition \u2014 not necessarily out of some sense of racial enlightenment or egalitarianism but because at the time, they saw it as being in their own best interest. Class and economic anxieties did not erase racial ones; they just in that moment transcended them.Even as the recession caused Iowa to shed hundreds of state jobs, Douglas managed to hold onto hers. But in 2012, for the first time in her life, she registered as a Republican, and last week she voted for Trump. Douglas told me she had switched parties because she felt Obama had been irresponsible with spending, causing the national debt to soar. She said Democrats were spending too much on social programs for people who did not need them.\u201cI don\u2019t want to throw Granny out in the snow, and I think the least of our brothers should be taken care of,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think that those who can work should.\u201d Douglas said there was a time in her life where she was struggling, and so she applied for welfare for herself and her young children but was denied. She didn\u2019t think that was fair, but she worked hard and turned her life around. But these days, she said, \u201cI kind of think for some social programs there is no stigma.\u201dDouglas never mentioned race, but polls including a recent one of Trump supporters have shown that white Americans\u2019 support for entitlement programs declines if they think black people are benefiting. And the longer Douglas talked, the more she revealed other reasons she had voted for Trump.When Obama was elected, she hoped he would \u201cbridge race relations, to help people in the middle of Iowa\u201d see that black people \u201care decent hardworking people who want the same things that we want.\u201d She said people in rural Iowa often don\u2019t know many black people and unfairly stereotype them. But Obama really turned her off when after a vigilante killed a black teenager named Trayvon Martin, he said the boy could have been his son. She felt as if Obama was choosing a side in the racial divide, stirring up tensions. And then came the death of Michael Brown, shot by a policeman in Ferguson, Mo.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that the struggles of black Americans aren\u2019t real,\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cbut I feel like the Michael Brown incident was violence against the police officer.\u201dThe Black Lives Matter movement bothered her. Even as an Ivy League-educated, glamorous black couple lived in the White House, masses of black people were blocking highways and staging die-ins in malls, claiming that black people had it so hard. When she voiced her discomfort with that movement, she said, or pointed out that she disagreed with Obama\u2019s policies, some of her more liberal friends on Facebook would call her racist. So, she shut her mouth \u2014 and simmered.\u201cTrump was crass, and he was abrupt,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cBut I felt like he was going to take care of the things that mattered for me, and honestly I was very worried about our country.\u201dThere has never been a moment in America in which black people\u2019s gains have not been perceived by some white Americans as their loss. And history is littered with examples of how economic and racial anxieties can create a wedge with which to destroy interracial political and economic alliances. White supremacists overthrew the biracial fusion party in North Carolina in the late 1800s and, with the support of the white population in the state that had once supported the sharing of power, worked to disenfranchise black North Carolinians and usher in seven decades of Jim Crow. In more modern times, George Wallace was roundly trounced when he ran for governor of Alabama against a racist opponent. Wallace, who had promised \u201cto treat a man fair, regardless of his color,\u201d vowed to never be \u201cout-niggered\u201d again. The next election he rode a segregationist platform right into the governor\u2019s mansion. Similarly, Richard Nixon ran for president the first time as a moderate and lost, but he later found his opening courting white opposition to civil rights with his Southern strategy. It is not incidental that John McCain and Mitt Romney mostly declined to stir up racial tensions in their campaigns against Obama and lost.When Trump inveighed against Mexican rapists and talked of barring Muslims from the country, the baldness of his rhetoric spoke to something deeply seated in the Iowans I talked to. Erin Wright, who worked for the state before quitting to finish a nursing degree, voted for Obama in 2008, and doesn\u2019t remember if she voted at all in 2012; she cast her ballot for Trump last week. Like Douglas, she wasn\u2019t struggling financially but was attracted to Trump\u2019s promise to seal our southern borders and to bar Muslims from entering the country.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of illegal people here, who do take work,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they want to become a citizen, that is super, they should become a citizen. But all the influx of people who come in, they get benefits, they get jobs, and they take them from people who can\u2019t find anything else who have lived here their whole lives.\u201dWhat\u2019s missing from the American conversation on race is the fact that people don\u2019t have to hate black people or Muslims or Latinos to be uncomfortable with them, to be suspicious of them, to fear their ascension as an upheaval of the natural order of things. A smart demagogue plays to those fears under the guise of economic anxieties. Things not as good as you hoped? These folks are the reason. Kelley, the historian, said white Americans have ignored race when it serves them and defaulted to it when it suits them. \u201cWe think of interest as an objective thing that floats above, but it is subjective,\u201d he said. \u201cRace always plays a role. It never disappears.\u201dThe miracle Obama worked in 2008 and 2012 was to stitch together, at least in part, the racial lines that have always fractured this country. What we saw last week was those lines being torn apart again.Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.

European officials have said the two companies\u2019 practices not only stopped rivals from competing directly, but also limited consumer choice and, in the case of Google, hindered innovation in the fast-expanding mobile world.The cases against Google and Microsoft, however, are not identical.The claims came on the heels of a separate antitrust investigation into whether Microsoft broke European competition rules by unfairly promoting its Windows Media Player over alternatives offered by rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.That included automatically including Internet Explorer with every version of Windows, which was then used on about 90 percent of all computers worldwide. Internet Explorer held more than a 50 percent share of Europe\u2019s browser market when the charges were filed.Google says that people can easily download rival services and that it does not restrict them from using competitors\u2019 applications. The company says its relationships with cellphone manufacturers are voluntary and it does not receive direct payments for these companies\u2019 use of its Android software.If it is found to have broken European rules, the company could face financial penalties, calls to alter its mobile operating system or both.Advertisement"}

Ms. Butler, a chef who is organizing the event in her spare time, said the march had no official means of funding yet.There are women on the page who have said that the march is not inclusive enough, and that they don\u2019t want an event organized by white women. Ms. Butler acknowledged the criticism but stressed that the women who are organizing are from different racial and religious backgrounds.Ms. Butler, 27, said the greater concern would be helping local groups raise money to help women who can\u2019t afford to travel to Washington.\u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s incredibly expensive to fly to D.C. on inauguration weekend,\u201d Ms. Butler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want only an upper-middle class of people at this march because no one else can afford to go.\u201dTabitha St. Bernard-Jacobs, 34, who plans to help sign up attendees by visiting churches, synagogues and community centers in New York City, said she had been working to include all types of people \u2014 including those who have not been on Facebook lately.\u201cI am a woman of color and I am an immigrant,\u201d said Ms. St. Bernard-Jacobs, who lives in Brooklyn.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 28, 2016Emerson CsorbaNoa Gafni SlaneyAs social creatures, we seek out opportunities to connect with others. The internet is particularly effective in helping us do that.  As a child growing up in the United States with foreign parents, every summer we would visit my mother's family in Israel. There I would  marvel at the artists on MTV Europe. And every four years, my Chilean father would hole up in our New Jersey basement to watch the Mundial on Univision \u2014 a cultural phenomena in other parts of the world, but unknown to our American neighbors. But the internet, like all platforms, can be used for positive and negative interactions. We cringe with horror at hateful speech and people who leverage 140 character sound bites to further their anti-openness agenda. In the wake of the U.S. presidential election, many observers claim that social media has created \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d that reinforce our views as opposed to opening us up to new ones.As our world becomes more closely intertwined, we want to hold on to the elements of our identity that define where we come from. It can be sharing our home or showing pride in our local government. That is what makes today\u2019s globalized success stories so wonderful \u2014 they are undeniably influenced by their local context.\nAbout a year ago, I attended a meeting in Geneva focused on gathering 450 \"changemakers\" to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges. I thought the participants would emerge with new relationships and perspectives on complex issues such as poverty and climate change. But very little meaningful conversation took place. Instead, participants spent the summit glued to their phones, taking selfies and sharing on Facebook \u2014 their posts usually accompanied by inspirational quotes and messages on how grateful they were to be included in this group of leaders.In our digital world, it comes as no surprise that these posts play such a central role in our lives, and that carefully curated social media images and comments gain such traction. But I cannot help but wonder what it is that we lose in the process of sharing so much of ourselves publicly. Social media \"likes\" and new followers provide us with public approval, but this need for constant sharing of ourselves \u2014 and the immediate gratification that comes with it  \u2014 diminishes the meaning and significance in the things we share. When it is possible to share widely, the approval we gain from followers leads us to forget that something even could be private, and moreover, that some parts of our lives are worth keeping private. Indeed, our digital connections might increase the ease in sharing certain parts of ourselves, but we must ask whether these are things better worth protecting. \n\u201cClicktivism\u201d and \u201cslacktivism\u201d are derogatory terms for online activism. It suggests that digital campaigns do nothing more than generate likes on Instagram. Many argue that these campaigns do more harm than good by providing participants with a sense of satisfaction that they\u2019ve taken an action without actually contributing to the cause through tangible, \u201creal-world\u201d means. Nothing could be further from the truth.The United Nations Foundation is leveraging online interest to create a continued focus on the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to creating compelling messages that are easy to share on social media, the foundation uses its +SocialGood community, a platform for changemakers to share resources around global issues, to spread the word and make the goals locally relevant. Our online interactions influence our offline behavior. The myth of clicktivism dismisses the powerful movements that are taking place \u2014 on and offline.\nThe relationships we form are superficial at best, and the social comparison that these connections fosters can be psychologically damaging.Over the past three years, I have conducted hundreds of one-on-one interviews with early and mid-career professionals on how they see their lives and careers developing in an uncertain world. Through these discussions, a theme of \"ruthless comparison\" emerges, where we become acutely aware of how our friends and colleagues portray themselves online. Noa highlights campaigns such as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and Lean In, where the collective action of celebrities and average citizens creates a social pressure for others to engage in a particular socially conscious activity. While useful in generating real-life action, this pressure to engage is in large part based on social comparison: a need to portray oneself in a particular light to appear to be a person committed to doing good. These online actions are increasingly required to \"keep up with the Joneses\" in a connected world.Although many interviewees were aware that these self-representations are illusory, they nevertheless felt pressured to engage in this competition, sharing their achievements and experiences over social media to show others how they are keeping up. This fuels a perpetual competition, focused on the sharing of successes and other updates, regardless of how accurately these portrayals represent real life \u2014 and they rarely do.This vicious cycle is difficult to escape; it requires a significant amount of confidence in oneself to both remain connected and see past the charade we collectively engage in. For every +SocialGood campaign that legitimately builds in-person dialogue, there are countless online campaigns fuelled by individual or corporate need to \"curate\" images that compare favorably with those of society's influencers. Based on my interviews with early and mid-career professionals, many individuals are at a crossroads in how to act in their online worlds. Skeptical of the authenticity of online activity, they nevertheless feel trapped in a society where sharing is celebrated. Indeed, we must be weary of the comparisons that our connectedness encourages, knowing that these comparisons are often psychologically exhausting and, in some cases, harmful. \nWhen I first began to research social media in 2004, the reigning narrative was that people who chose to interact online were \"socially awkward\" and looking for opportunities to connect in the digital realm because real-world opportunities were closed off to them. When I studied teenagers who used chat rooms, I saw that a generation of digital natives were as socially adjusted as their peers and looked to connect online in addition to real life. In writing about online connections, Noa highlights its \"key difference\" as being the ability to \"tap into a global community, not just a local one.\" Critically, this global community allows participants to share their opinions, and in some cases, develop relationships that would not otherwise exist. Personally, I have benefited from this interactivity; several of my closest friendships, as well as professional opportunities, began with communication over online tools such as skype \u2014 with in-person meetings not taking place until sometimes more than one year into our conversations. These experiences are compelling, as are the examples that Noa shares of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and others helping change the world. But as Phillips writes, a belief in potential to create change can bring disappointment and frustration, as we realize that the stories of social change we consume in our connected worlds are not always as readily achievable as we have been led to believe. People of all ages are spending more and more time online. Does this digital trend improve lives or hurt them?  \n"}

He was then held in secret by the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group.Mr. Kerry also thanked the government of Oman for its assistance and said, \u201cWe also recognize this positive gesture by the Houthis.\u201dA senior American official said the Houthis had cleared Mr. Luqman of wrongdoing in August before finally acknowledging that they were holding him, a key step in getting him home.

{"Headline": "Can the Media Recover From This Election?", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byThis has not been your typical presidential election \u2014 not for the voters, the candidates or the news media. James Poniewozik, chief television critic for The New York Times, and Jim Rutenberg, media columnist for The Times, discuss how the election season went, good and bad, for members of the press.So will the media be better in 2020? Worse? Yes. And yes. And there will be more of it.I\u2019ll start with one topic you raised: reporters\u2019 willingness to truth-squad. I hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s asymmetric, weirdly brazen dishonesty has broken reporters of the bad habits of false equivalency, euphemism and forced balance. The job of journalism, always, is to describe reality as we honestly find it, regardless of appearances. I hope that\u2019s a permanent change. I fear that the profession will decide Mr. Trump was a one-off, an asteroid, a special circumstance requiring Special Trump Rules.It\u2019s not as simple as, \u201cthe press went easy on him.\u201d In some ways this made for devastating or dismissive coverage. But only one candidate was treated like she might be elected, set policy and make appointments.And this will be key in the days, months and years ahead. The press needs to explore the frustration of those many Americans who think free trade\u2019s gone too far; that immigration threatens the national fabric; and that insiders from Washington, Wall Street and the media have rigged the system against them.Either way, this will be a real wasted opportunity if there isn\u2019t a lot of probing, fearless reporting about how much racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism exist in the culture. It has surfaced. Let\u2019s not let the rug roll back over it all when this is done.That brings me to this question: When this thing wraps, do you think the mainstream media will revert to where it was before this campaign started, treat this as one nightmare it would just as soon forget? Or does it emerge forever changed?Because whatever you say about this year\u2019s election coverage, it killed at the box office.I take these morning-after regrets the same way I do a political party\u2019s postelection autopsy. Wake me up if they ever implement it.Another looming question about the postelection media is if Mr. Trump will be a player in it. Especially if he loses, I\u2019m dubious of Trump TV as a full-fledged cable channel. That\u2019s expensive \u2014 an online subscription service might be an easier way to cash in. That, and that brand depends on his image as a winner. In defeat, even claiming a rigged election, he may be a tougher sell.But who says Trump TV would only be a thing if Mr. Trump loses? A President Trump would make aggressive use of the media. Why not his own de facto state TV? What would stop him: his deep respect for the norms of political propriety?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Item on the College Admission Checklist: LinkedIn Profile", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byTechnophoriaApplying for admission to many American colleges already has high school students jumping through hoops.School transcript? Check. Recommendations? Check. Personal statement? Standardized test scores? List of accomplishments? Check. Check. Check.Now some social media experts are advising high school seniors to go even further. They are coaching students to take control of their online personas \u2014 by creating elaborate profiles on LinkedIn, the professional network, and bringing them to the attention of college admissions officers.Last year, for instance, Mr. Katzman\u2019s company advised a high school senior in the Washington area to create a detailed LinkedIn profile and include a link on his application to Harvard. (His mother asked that the student\u2019s name be withheld for privacy reasons.) Soon after, LinkedIn notified the student that someone from Harvard had checked out his profile.The student is now in his first year at Harvard. Whether the LinkedIn profile had any bearing on his admission is unknown. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment. But Mr. Katzman says that high school students who use social media to showcase themselves may gain an edge with colleges.\u201cNo one has quantified the power of this,\u201d Mr. Katzman told me recently. \u201cBut I maintain that it is very powerful.\u201dPublic schools from San Francisco to New York City are teaching online conduct skills as part of a nationwide digital citizenship push to prepare students for colleges and careers. Teenagers who set up LinkedIn profiles in the hope of enhancing their college prospects represent the vanguard of this trend.But the phenomenon of ambitious high school students on LinkedIn also demonstrates how social networks are playing a role in the escalation of the college admissions arms race. For students in high-pressure schools who already start packaging themselves for college in ninth grade, LinkedIn could add yet another burden to what might be called the careerization of childhood.Professionalized teenage r\u00e9sum\u00e9s could also further intensify disparities in college applications.\u201cKids from privileged families tend to do more of those things both offline and online \u2014 joining school clubs, writing for their school newspaper, getting tutoring so their grades go up, doing SAT preparation,\u201d says Vicky Rideout, a researcher who studies how teenagers use technology. Using LinkedIn on college applications, she says, \u201cis yet another way for there to be a disparity between the haves and the have-nots.\u201dOfficials at Vassar College and other institutions that deliberately do not search out applicants\u2019 social media profiles suggested that colleges disclose their admissions practices.\u201cWe prefer to evaluate a candidate based on the items that candidate has prepared and submitted to us,\u201d said Art D. Rodriguez, Vassar\u2019s dean of admission and financial aid. He added, \u201cWhile we understand that some colleges and universities do look into candidates\u2019 online profiles, we believe those schools should be transparent about the procedure and alert applicants to it.\u201dSome high school students are establishing LinkedIn profiles to give the colleges that do look something they would like them to find. Students who naturally tailor posts for their peers on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook told me they used the professional network as a separate space to market their accomplishments to adults.\u201cI did not make a LinkedIn profile for my friends,\u201d says Matthew Martratt, a 17-year-old high school senior in Marietta, Ga., who is an Eagle Scout and a member of his school\u2019s marching band and organizes community service projects. \u201cI made it to show people who don\u2019t know who I am what I am about.\u201dMr. Martratt, who took a LinkedIn course from Social Assurity, said he followed colleges to which he intended to apply on LinkedIn and Twitter and posted about them.\u201cIt\u2019s like sending them an invitation to look at my profile,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I get likes or notifications back, it shows that they are looking.\u201d\u201cLinkedIn makes sense from a professional standpoint of showcasing their expertise and their skills,\u201d said Vita Vaccaro, the school\u2019s marketing and virtual enterprise coordinator.In a culture where digital citizenship is often taught as a series of prohibitions \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t post anything you wouldn\u2019t want your grandmother to see!\u201d \u2014 coaching students to build online r\u00e9sum\u00e9s may increase their sense of agency.The push for digital citizenship education also raises the question of whether some schools are so fixated on teaching social media skills that they are steering students to the most popular commercial sites \u2014 rather than helping them develop a more expansive worldview, both online and off.With widening students\u2019 horizons in mind, Noble Impact offers courses at eStem High, a charter school in Little Rock, Ark., where students not only use LinkedIn but also separately create their own online portfolios and learn real-world entrepreneurship skills.Nate Reeves, a senior at eStem High in the Noble Impact program, for instance, has a LinkedIn profile. But when he wanted an internship at Little Rock Technology Park, he did not rely on it. He called the co-working space directly and landed an in-person interview. He is now an intern there. And Mr. Reeves is trying to cultivate an online presence that is unique to him and not limited to LinkedIn.\u201cOn LinkedIn, they see what you are good at,\u201d said Mr. Reeves, 17, who has studied computer programming and is building a personal website to display a fuller picture of his experiences and interests. \u201cBut they don\u2019t really get to know you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as the start-up world continues to move away from easily definable consumer or corporate products and services, investors have had to take less-charted paths.And so Spark, which formally announced on Monday its two latest investment funds, with a combined $1 billion in capital, has backed Cruise as well as some other eclectic companies: an upstart stock exchange called IEX, and Mark43, whose software helps police departments organize their records. Those investments sit alongside bets on more recognizable companies like Slack, the popular messaging software, and Wayfair, the online home furnishings retailer, which is now publicly traded.\u201cNo one knows what the next big platform is,\u201d Nabeel Hyatt, a Spark partner, said. \u201cNow is a new market time.\u201dThe firm, which has expanded to San Francisco and New York from its home base in Boston, has had some big wins.

And Oculus, the maker of virtual reality headsets, sold itself to Facebook for $2 billion.Not all of Spark\u2019s bets have paid off. The firm was an early backer of Foursquare, a location-based start-up that has lost much of its popularity and whose valuation was cut in half by January.Many of the best-known venture capital firms live on the fabled Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., but Spark was born in Boston in 2005. Two veteran venture capitalists, Santo Politi and Todd Dagres, said they believed that as the dot-com bust receded from memory, the time had come to make bets on consumer internet companies once more. And they persuaded Bijan Sabet, a longtime acquaintance and entrepreneur, to come on board.Relatively few firms, such as Union Square Ventures in New York, were ready to jump back into the consumer internet field, even as Facebook and Myspace were on the ascent.\u201cI think the lesson drawn from 2005 was, \u2018That\u2019s crazy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Politi said.In founding Spark, Mr. Politi and Mr. Sabet said, the idea was to create a firm that was different from many traditional venture capital shops, where partners specialized in, say, enterprise software or clean energy investments. Instead, each partner can bring any idea to the table, and after debate, the partners decide whether to pursue the opportunity.\u201cMost firms are market-first; they\u2019re in a market or not,\u201d Mr. Hyatt, a serial entrepreneur who joined Spark in 2012, said of other firms\u2019 focuses.Investing decisions are often made by reaching consensus, without strict voting. (The partners briefly tried formal voting on investment decisions \u2014 via Slack \u2014 but quickly scrapped the idea.)\u201cWhen entrepreneurs get married to us, you get married to the whole family,\u201d Mr. Sabet said.The firm\u2019s earliest and best-known bets were grounded in what Mr. Politi and Mr. Sabet called an appreciation for good product design. That has remained a constant, the two said, whether applied to a computer security start-up or the automated investments firm Wealthfront.\u201cIn my view, they\u2019re very smart and helpful investors, and really thoughtful about products and technology,\u201d John Lilly, a partner at Greylock Partners who worked with Mr. Sabet as a fellow investor in Tumblr, said in an email.All told, Spark oversees $3 billion in investment funds and has expanded the number of partners. One, Kevin Thau, is a former senior executive at Twitter, while another, Megan Quinn, came over from Kleiner Perkins.Like other venture firms, Spark broadened its focus and added a growth fund aimed at older companies in need of bigger sums of money. To lead the effort, Spark hired Jeremy G. Philips, a serial entrepreneur who got his start at McKinsey, to work out of its New York office, and later Ms. Quinn, to be based in San Francisco and offer her insight as a former product designer for Google and the payments company Square.The firm will now have more money to invest. Its fifth venture fund, announced Monday, will have $400 million under management, and its second growth fund will have $600 million.Spark\u2019s partners insist that the firm is unafraid of pushing into new industries, without slavish regard for whether there is an existing, easily defined market for a start-up\u2019s products. The Twitter investment, Mr. Hyatt argued, would not have been made if the firm had been focused that way.He also said that Spark tried to avoid investment fads.\u201cWe\u2019re not ambulance chasers,\u201d Mr. Hyatt said, though he added that the firm has invested in what became hot deals.On the flip side, some of its picks have been more esoteric. In June 2013, Spark invested in the first major round of Oculus, then just a promising virtual-reality start-up that subsequently became a sensation on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. Other venture firms joined in, and Oculus surprised many by selling itself to Facebook a year later.Spark was also one of the first venture firms to pour money into IEX, which was explicitly designed as the opposite of modern-day high-speed trading and gained fame as the subject of Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys.\u201d Alex Finkelstein, the Spark partner who led the investment and who learned about IEX from Mr. Lewis\u2019s book, praised the start-up\u2019s ambitions to shake up the world of stock market trading and the quality of its founders.And then there is the start-up Cruise. Kyle Vogt, one of its founders, recalled meeting several times with Mr. Hyatt and forming a personal connection. Several days after their third or fourth meeting, Mr. Vogt recalled, Mr. Hyatt came back with a \u201cridiculously complex\u201d financial model and analysis that proved to be accurate.\u201cThey \u2018got\u2019 the business, and they took the time to go deep,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.An article on Tuesday about the venture capital firm Spark gave an outdated name for the firm of John Lilly, who commented on Spark\u2019s track record. It is Greylock Partners, no longer Greylock Ventures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Lone EpiPen Competitor Hasn\u2019t Taken Off", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Adrenaclick, a cheaper alternative, has benefited from furor over EpiPen pricing. But its maker is struggling to meet demand, and a generic EpiPen is near.Supported byFew people, though, have turned to the one true alternative \u2014 known by the brand name Adrenaclick.The story of Adrenaclick is paved with blunders and missed chances, leaving it a largely unknown bit player with a single-digit share of the market. Six companies in succession have owned Adrenaclick since an earlier version became available 13 years ago, but few invested significant money in marketing. It has been sold under multiple names, and at one point it was taken off the market for more than a year. Recently, its owner, Impax Laboratories, has struggled to keep up with scant demand, resulting in sporadic shortages.\u201cEpiPen is like Kleenex \u2014 it\u2019s ubiquitous,\u201d said Brian Chapman, a consultant for ZS Associates, a pharmaceutical marketing firm. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done with that brand has been amazing.\u201dImpax has been moving to make Adrenaclick a competitive alternative. The company is striving to expand access to Adrenaclick by upgrading the outdated production line, improving the distribution system and lobbying states to make it easier for patients to get the product from pharmacists.\u201cWhy use the drug? Why make the switch?\u201d said Ronny Gal, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. \u201cWhy do I need to go with the Adrenaclick, when a year from now I will have a generic EpiPen?\u201dDoctors who are aware of and prescribe the Adrenaclick say patients are often pleasantly surprised to learn that there is an alternative to the EpiPen.Doctors say they have struggled to keep track of the product, and its availability, over the years. The product now called Adrenaclick got its start in 2003 as the Twinject, an EpiPen alternative that was designed to deliver two doses of epinephrine in the event that users needed a second one. But the Twinject was confusing and difficult to use, and after a series of design changes, it evolved into the Adrenaclick. The Food and Drug Administration approved those changes in 2009.By then, however, Mylan had begun its push to expand sales of the EpiPen. Executives there saw untapped potential in the product soon after taking ownership of it in 2007.As the EpiPen became a blockbuster product, the Adrenaclick struggled to keep up, capturing only about 1 or 2 percent of the market.In 2013, after a period when the Adrenaclick was off the market, its owner at the time, Amedra Pharmaceuticals, made the tactical decision to stop competing directly with the EpiPen and instead created an identical, but generic, version of the Adrenaclick.That move allowed insurance companies to begin covering the Adrenaclick as a generic product, lowering the out-of-pocket costs to most patients to $10 to $20. The list price for a pair of generic Adrenaclick pens, which uninsured customers may have to pay, is about $400, compared with more than $600 for a pair of EpiPens. Coupons for both products can lower the price further.Impax inherited the Adrenaclick, along with its generic version, in 2015 as part of a larger acquisition. Rather than investing in a costly marketing campaign, the company has opted to lobby states to make the generic Adrenaclick more widely available.The company also said it was spending tens of millions of dollars to upgrade its assembly line to meet heightened demand for the product after the EpiPen price increases. It now holds about 7 percent of the market, Mr. Boothe said.\u201cCertainly the news has been a great form of awareness,\u201d he said. However, he added, \u201cwe\u2019ve been very prudent with how we\u2019ve distributed the product.\u201dMr. Boothe rejected arguments that the Adrenaclick\u2019s chances for success were limited. \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan for Impax,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a sustainable opportunity for us, and we\u2019re making investments accordingly.\u201dStill, the Adrenaclick has such a low profile that even people who consider themselves knowledgeable consumers said they were surprised to learn recently of its existence.Barbara Hollinger, a 57-year-old retiree and quilter in Northern Virginia, carried an EpiPen for 20 years because she is allergic to yellow jacket stings. But she said she became irate about the cost of EpiPens, which her insurance was forcing her to pay for out of pocket. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a better way,\u201d she remembered thinking. \u201cSo when I asked my doctor if there was a generic, she said, \u2018Yeah, but nobody ever prescribes it.\u2019\u201dAfter a few false starts at her local CVS, her quest was a success, and with her insurance, the product cost her $5. CVS now says the product is available in all of its pharmacies nationwide.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where the U.S. Is a Rival, Trump Election Is Greeted With a Smile", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byKOTOR, Montenegro \u2014 Just over an hour after Donald J. Trump secured his stunning triumph, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia congratulated the victor and looked forward to \u201cconstructive dialogue.\u201d China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, waited a little longer, sending Mr. Trump a similarly measured message of hope and appealing for \u201ccooperation for mutual gain.\u201dBut perhaps even more revealing was Momcilo Krivokapic, a bearded Orthodox priest who was ecstatic over the upset result.Seated in the dark at Saint Nikola Church because of a power failure, the 71-year-old priest gloated at \u201cthe defeat of satanic forces\u201d in the West bent on strengthening NATO, expanding gay rights and championing Western notions of tolerance.\u201cGod has reached out his hand and touched the United States to help us all,\u201d said Father Krivokapic, a bitter foe of the American-led military alliance and of the values that American power has brought to the far corners of the world, even to Kotor, an ancient fortified town on the Adriatic coast of Montenegro.The election of Mr. Trump on Tuesday has presented an unexpected gift to leaders \u2014 political, spiritual and ideological \u2014 who resent the encroachment of the West and now rejoice at a result that in their eyes shows how liberal democracy produces nothing but an angry populace and wild unpredictability.Mr. Trump has openly questioned some of the basic tenets of America\u2019s role in the world. Now his election has stirred confidence in America\u2019s biggest rivals, Russia and China, that they will have more room to assert their own strategic interests, whether in Ukraine, the Baltics or the South China Sea.\u201cA weakened and disorganized West like this will surely bring many more additional strategic opportunities for China,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. Mr. Xi, who has been the strongest foreign policy president for China, will be further emboldened, Mr. Shi said, and will be \u201ceven less prudent\u201d in his foreign policy.But beyond that, the election is being viewed as a comeuppance for a country that lectures others about the superiority of American values.Mr. Trump\u2019s election is a \u201cvictory for Putin by which he gains a very strong case to be made about the crisis of traditional Western democracy and its institutions,\u201d wrote Tatyana Stanovaya, an analyst for the Center for Political Technologies, a Russian research group.While Mr. Putin and his Kremlin aides were restrained in their initial public response to the result, \u201cundoubtedly, they are drinking Champagne,\u201d said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political consultant who once worked for the Kremlin.This, Mr. Pavlovsky said, is \u201cfor two reasons: one political, the other psychological.\u201dFor Russia, the triumph of Mr. Trump, just five months after Britain\u2019s shock vote to leave the European Union, accelerates an unraveling of the Western order, a trend that the Kremlin has worked tirelessly to promote through disinformation and the funding of anti-establishment parties like the National Front in France.China, far more dependent on economic ties to the West than Russia is, has avoided trying to stoke turbulent populist sentiments in Western countries but, with a shared hostility toward liberal democracy, has moved increasingly close to Russia to form a united authoritarian front.Russian politicians and analysts cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as an opportunity for Russia to extend its global influence and, possibly, shed economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Crimea and Ukraine.Mr. Putin, speaking to ambassadors presenting their credentials in the Kremlin, sought to play down any expectations in Russia of a sudden warming of now ice-cold relations with Washington. \u201cWe understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path, in view of the degradation that U.S.-Russian relations have unfortunately suffered,\u201d Mr. Putin said.But more important for Russia than any quick gains was a feeling that after years of enduring criticism from Washington over its steady retreat from Western-style democracy, Russia can now point a finger at the United States.Even before Election Day, Russian state-owned news media hammered the same simple message, said Maria Lipman, editor of Counterpoint, a journal published by the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies, George Washington University: \u201c\u2018Our democracy might not be perfect, but look at theirs. It stinks.\u2019\u201dThe result \u2014 the victory of a businessman who delighted in shredding the conventions of political decorum and of an America-led Western order in place since the end of World War II, has \u201cproved Russia right,\u201d Ms. Lipman added, and shown that the United States is \u201cno shining city on a hill.\u201dRussia, meanwhile, has been busy building its own alternative city, a beacon for all those who long for a more secure, illiberal world rooted in faith and traditional values. At the center of this effort has been Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a close ally of Mr. Putin.On Wednesday, the patriarch said he was praying for divine assistance for Mr. Trump, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s now hope for good changes both domestically and internationally.\u201dLike Russia, China has long bridled at American complaints about its illiberal ways, rejecting the idea that human rights and free speech are universal values and insisting that China has found its own political model rooted in uniquely Chinese values that put stability above all else.In the days before the election, the Chinese government, eager to point out to its citizens the advantages of one-party rule by the Communist Party, used the nastiness of the Trump vs. Clinton contest to warn about the evils of American democracy.\u201cAmerica is terribly ill,\u201d wrote Yuan Peng, the vice president of a state-run research center, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. His article in The People\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party, said the election would be remembered as a \u201cpage of \u2018dirty, chaotic and poor performance.\u2019\u201dPresident Xi, the head of the Communist Party, avoided mockery in his congratulatory message to Mr. Trump and emphasized that \u201cI place great importance on the China-U.S. relationship,\u201d while quietly advising him in coded language to stay out of China\u2019s way. Mr. Xi, Chinese state television reported, said he had told the president-elect that he hoped \u201cto strive with you to uphold the principles of not engaging in conflict or confrontation, and of cooperation for mutual gain.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions remained unclear, the very uncertainties of his victory have given the Chinese leader an opportunity to pursue a number of strategic advantages across Asia, analysts said.\u201cThe general line from China will be: \u2018The United States is unreliable. You have to accommodate us,\u2019\u201d said Peter Jennings, the director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra.If Mr. Trump delivers on his promise to downgrade America\u2019s traditional alliances in Asia, China will almost certainly capitalize on an American retreat by trying to push the United States aside in a region Beijing considers its natural sphere of influence. At the same time, China is hoping that he reneges on his pledges to take on China over trade and slap hefty tariffs on its exports to the United States.With his growing Navy, Mr. Xi may now feel emboldened to pursue more control of the South China Sea, the major waterway that carries trillions of dollars of the world\u2019s trade, and that he insists belongs to China. He will almost certainly use increasingly big financial inducements to pick off smaller countries like the Philippines and Malaysia that were already moving closer to Beijing, and midsize American allies like Australia that are moving closer to China\u2019s economic order.The outcome of the American election, however, may not be all positive for China. Feeling abandoned by the United States, and vulnerable to an emboldened and increasingly assertive China, Japan and South Korea could both decide to develop their own nuclear arsenals.In South Korea, where there is a powerful lobby for the country to become a nuclear power, there is about a 50 percent chance of going nuclear, said Andray Abrahamian, associate research director of Choson Exchange.The Japanese government called an emergency meeting Wednesday night, to consider its options. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faced questions about the future shape of the military alliance, but also recognized that the Obama administration\u2019s trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was dead. Mr. Abe had taken big political risks at home to win concessions for the trade deal, which Mr. Trump has vilified.The Trump triumph could also hold peril for Russia, where state media has for weeks presented the billionaire as a much-needed break from the supposedly Russophobic attitudes of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. In a Facebook post, Andrey Loshak, a Russian journalist, predicted that Mr. Trump\u2019s entry to the White House would deprive the Kremlin of what has become one of its most potent political tools: blaming the Obama administration for all of Russia\u2019s troubles.\u201cThe worldview planted into Russians\u2019 minds that America is to blame for all and every ill, including urine-stained porches and alcoholic neighbors, crumbles. Who is to be hated now?\u201d Mr. Loshak wrote. \u201cYou can\u2019t do without a specter of a good, high-quality enemy these days.\u201dAndrew Higgins reported from Kotor, Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow, and Jane Perlez from Yangon, Myanmar.

{"Headline": "Morocco Says Crushing of Vendor in Garbage Truck Was Homicide", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byThe vendor, Mouhcine Fikri, 31, was killed on Friday after he jumped into the compactor at the back of the truck to recover his swordfish, which the police had confiscated because the fish is a protected species. Cities in Morocco have since been consumed by protests, by some estimates the largest in years.The statement offered the following account of his death.Mr. Fikri had bought 500 kilograms, or 1,100 pounds, of swordfish from fishermen at Al Hoceima. The species is protected, and may not be fished between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30.Mr. Fikri asked someone to drive the fish from the port. The vehicle was not examined when it left the port, but security officers subsequently stopped and inspected it.A representative from the country\u2019s Agriculture and Fishing Ministry arrived and cited the driver for violations. The police informed the prosecutor\u2019s office, which ordered the fish confiscated and the driver detained.A veterinarian found that the fish were unsuitable for consumption because their origin could not be documented. The fish were ordered destroyed, and officials summoned the garbage truck to carry out the task.The operator of the truck requested a formal order before destroying the fish. The officials delivered such an order to the head of the company, but that document turned out to be a forgery, investigators found.As the truck was loaded, Mr. Fikri and several friends climbed into the back to save their merchandise.\u201cAt that moment, the compactor began running, following the activation of machinery on the rear right side of the truck, which caused the death of the deceased, Mouhcine Fikri,\u201d the statement said.It was not clear how the compactor was activated. The prosecutor\u2019s office concluded that the death was an \u201cinvoluntary homicide.\u201dInvestigators interviewed 20 people over three days, and referred 11 of them to the courts; eight people were detained.The government\u2019s account of the death could not be independently verified.Since Sunday, thousands have taken part in protests, demanding that those responsible be held accountable for Mr. Fikri\u2019s death. The city hall of Al Hoceima has been the site of raucous protests.Facebook Live videos showed hundreds of people in the city\u2019s main square, shouting, \u201cDown with the Makhzen,\u201d a word that refers to the political system in Morocco, which is a constitutional monarchy.In 2011, as uprisings swept the Arab world, Moroccans agitated for democracy and social justice, though almost none for an overthrow of the monarchy. King Mohammed VI introduced constitutional changes in response to the protests, but some critics have called them inadequate.\u201cSince 2011, people are no longer afraid,\u201d said Abdelhak El Amrani, 26, who attended a protest in Marrakesh on Sunday. \u201cMoroccans today are alert to what hurts their dignity. The serenity of the social climate will never be guaranteed without the rule of law. No justice has been rendered. Today, deep wounds have opened.\u201dHannah Olivennes contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Election, Some Women Assert Themselves With Small Gestures", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byThis year, Svea Vikander has decided that she and Evla, her 3-year-old daughter, will be the focal point of her family\u2019s holiday card. She decided to relegate her husband and son to a smaller picture below.The card comes with a message that she said sums up the year: \u201c2016 \u2026 is never going to happen again.\u201dMs. Vikander said the card, illustrating her hope for the future, was one small thing she could do to reaffirm her place in the world, on behalf of herself and her daughter.Some women view all of this as more than a partisan political setback, and they say they are taking small steps in their everyday lives to fight back. On Facebook and Twitter this week, I asked women to tell me if they\u2019ve noticed any changes within their own lives, and a mix of strangers and acquaintances responded.One woman said she\u2019ll try something small: She will return mail that is addressed to her husband but doesn\u2019t mention her, too.Another woman broke things off with her boyfriend after he said he wouldn\u2019t be able to support her efforts to be a better advocate for minorities \u2014 she is one herself.And multiple women said they are applying a greater sense of urgency in teaching their children the importance of consent in sexual matters after absorbing from news reports that many of their fellow citizens seem to have a cavalier attitude toward misogny and sexual harassment.Several women shared stories of the small ways they\u2019re navigating the workplace after the election, from refusing to skirt around men clustered in hallways at a work conference to speaking up more often in meetings.\u201cI am more vocal and less apologetic,\u201d Tara D\u2019Haenens, who works at a medical center in South Bend, Ind., said in a Facebook message. \u201cI no longer think of being nice as quite the compliment that I used to believe it was.\u201dIn Ms. Vikander\u2019s case, putting herself and her daughter front and center seemed like a small way to make her stance known. It sounds subtle until you consider the reach of a holiday card: Close friends, extended family and work colleagues will be on the mailing list. Her husband supports the message.\u201cI feel like wielding it to reaffirm the importance of women is an act of some kind,\u201d Ms. Vikander, 32, said of the card. \u201cI wanted to emphasize that women are disproportionately affected by the changes the Republican Party espouses, especially with regard to reproductive rights and safety.\u201dI heard from others sending gentle reminders to loved ones: One woman, a wife and mother of two sons, told me that she has reminded the men in her life that she was not a personal maid service.Other women who were interviewed said they too are working to address issues of cultural inclusion and consent with their children, and are showing them how to speak up for themselves and others.Rachel Lee, a professor of gender studies and the director of the Center for the Study of Women at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that as a mother of three, she has told her daughters, who are half Asian-American and half white, to search for \u201cpotential allies\u201d in overturning America\u2019s status quo, which she believes centers on the dominance of white males.Ms. Lee, 50, also said she reminds her daughters that they are not powerless.\u201cThey should support those who are feeling very much under attack: undocumented \u2018Dreamers\u2019 and those girls at their schools wearing the hijab,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are concrete actions that can change gender dynamics and that are bottom-up.\u201dAnother prevalent theme for women, particularly among minorities who overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton, is re-examining how they engage on social media, a place where feelings of angst and anger have clashed in the days following the election.Monifa Porter, 43, a product manager who lives in Oakland, Calif., said she is taking a second look at how she discusses issues on social media after ending a friendship with a former college roommate over words they exchanged after the election.\u201cHis reaction was effectively: \u2018I\u2019m a good white person, I work very hard, my professional life is about protecting minorities,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Porter, who is black, said of her friend. \u201cAcademically and out of anger, I responded that this is about all white people, and whiteness is a category that must be interrogated.\u201dThe solution, Ms. Porter said, might be found in logging off of the web. She said she is examining how she can leverage her network of friends and professional contacts to make small, in-person changes in her community. She hopes white men and women who are motivated for change will do the same thing \u2014 and will address the racial dynamics of the election, while they\u2019re at it.Still, those who are bothered by it \u2014 65 percent of people who voted for Mrs. Clinton say they were \u2014 want to approach their relationships with deeper awareness after the election.Stefanie Taylor, a midlevel executive who works for a retail company and lives in Elgin, Ill., said in an interview that the election made her realize how few women were present in her meetings. That she is often the only woman in the room has become harder for her to overlook.\u201cI was thinking that, statistically, these were the men that voted to take away funding from Planned Parenthood,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cThe organization that allowed me to get cervical screenings and breast exams and allowed me to get an education and take care of my health care. Those were the things that were creeping up into my head over the next 48 hours.\u201dMs. Taylor, 33, noticed another change in her dealings with colleagues: \u201cMy patience is thinner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Solo Dream of Sailing Leads to a Dual Adventure", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byVows11 PhotosTo fall in love with a sailor is to court a broken heart. But in 2009, when Lauren Sloss spied Alex Kleeman in a Bay Area bar, she never guessed he harbored a dream to sail the world.Outwardly, there was nothing salty about Mr. Kleeman, a tall, skinny mathematician who worked for a climate forecasting start-up and spent workdays knee-deep in algorithms. In fact, Mr. Kleeman, an affable Midwesterner from suburban Chicago, was known to his many friends as a man who never swore.Like many millennial San Franciscans, Ms. Sloss, now 29, was also working at a start-up, in advertising. That night, she stared at Mr. Kleeman, a handsome guy in a Black Keys T-shirt, trying to work up the courage to tell him that the Black Keys were her favorite band.But when urged to make a move, she balked. Her friend Irene Yuan made it for her.\u201cMy friend Lauren is your soul mate,\u201d Ms. Yuan said. \u201cCan she have your card?\u201d Mr. Kleeman, slightly flummoxed, obliged.The normally bold Ms. Sloss left the bar in a burst of shyness. Later that night, she sent Mr. Kleeman a witty email. In response, he sleuthed her online.Her Facebook photo showed three women, all beautiful, but which was she? Flattered by Ms. Sloss\u2019s attention, he agreed to meet \u2014 even though he was avoiding relationships.Mr. Kleeman, now 33, had graduated from Stanford University with a master\u2019s in computational and mathematical engineering after attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as an undergraduate. A difficult long-distance relationship was behind him, and he was focused on his large circle of friends, who liked his laid-back manner and adventurous spirit.He was known for gathering friends for unusual events: a backpacking trip where dinner was an elaborate paella cooked on an open fire, a \u201ctourist\u201d pub crawl that required participants to wear cargo shorts and not enough layers for the Bay Area\u2019s chilly weather shifts, an \u201cawkward\u201d party where food was served without utensils.Ms. Sloss wasn\u2019t seeking to settle down, either. A native of San Mateo, Calif., she had graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a dual degree in English and history. She, too, had a voracious social life centered around a dozen best friends with whom she was in constant contact.She had mixed feelings about relationships. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be tied down,\u201d she said. Fiercely independent, she feared a serious beau might dampen her dreams, including her hope of moving to New York City to be a writer. She dated lightly, yet sometimes yearned for a big love.At their first date, the two found common passions: music, food, friends and travel. Ms. Sloss was charmed by Mr. Kleeman\u2019s ever-ready, body-shaking laugh. Mr. Kleeman delighted in Ms. Sloss\u2019 smiling eyes and confident style (she is known to wear the same chunky motorcycle boots for all occasions). A second date ignited chemistry, but upon parting, Mr. Kleeman offered a peck on the cheek.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Ms. Sloss said she wondered.\u201cI was being cautious,\u201d said Mr. Kleeman as a way of explanation.Still they continued to hang out frequently and became part of each other\u2019s circle of friends. Mr. Kleeman abandoned some of his caution.\u201cI was falling in love, but resisting,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was different than anything I\u2019d known. Lauren is totally open about everything.\u201dThat spring, Ms. Sloss announced her acceptance to a master\u2019s program in magazine writing at N.Y.U. Undaunted by the distance that would be between them, she persuaded Mr. Kleeman to stay together.But he had an announcement, too. At long last, his dream of sailing the world with his younger brother, Nick, now 31, was going to come true. Soon. Or soonish.This was news to Ms. Sloss, who had no idea of Mr. Kleeman\u2019s oceangoing plans. Taking a deep breath, she suggested they take things step by step. \u201cI mean, there wasn\u2019t even a boat yet,\u201d she said.The year apart was challenging. Mr. Kleeman, who stayed true to a flip phone well into the smartphone era, hated digital communication. Still, scraps of conversation carried their love, and multiple coast-to-coast visits renewed their commitment.She returned to San Francisco for her summer break, moving in with Mr. Kleeman and beginning her career as a freelance journalist focusing on food and lifestyle. She regularly writes for Lucky Peach, Vice and Punch.His departure was imminent. The brothers had bought Saltbreaker, a 32-foot sailboat, and were prepping and provisioning her for a September 2011 trip. The destination and duration of their voyage: unknown.Now Mr. Kleeman was convinced they should breakup. He knew how difficult communication would be at sea. \u201cI thought the chance of us being together after the trip would be better if we had no expectations,\u201d he recalled telling her.\u201cLauren has always been determined, and some might say stubborn,\u201d said Brittany Cowing, a close friend since elementary school. \u201cIn second grade she announced she would be a writer. Nothing stops her when she puts her mind to it.\u201dAlthough Ms. Sloss feared Mr. Kleeman might find someone else, or permanently settle on a deserted island \u2014 or just simply not miss her \u2014 she argued her case for them to remain a couple, with a few tears.\u201cAlex is the kindest man I know and the furthest from being a player,\u201d said Omar Elafifi, a close friend of Mr. Kleeman. \u201cHe thought it was unfair to Lauren to leave everything open-ended.\u201dBut as departure day approached, Mr. Kleeman\u2019s resolve lessened. \u201cWe were good, so why end it?\u201d he said. \u201cIt was more likely Lauren would meet someone here or get bored waiting for me.\u201dAfter a gala send-off, the brothers sailed for Central America. Ms. Sloss finished her degree months later and joined them for several weeks of not-so-smooth sailing. Fierce winds off the coast of Nicaragua tossed Saltbreaker like a top, and the slam of waves was incessant. Despite the conditions, including not a shred of privacy, Ms. Sloss embraced life on board, earning both her sea legs and Mr. Kleeman\u2019s admiration.After another emotional parting, Saltbreaker set out across the Pacific. \u201cI knew Alex well but not well enough to know if taking off for the tropics would mean he might never come back,\u201d she said. \u201cI now could see how sailing does crazy things to people.\u201dAs Saltbreaker snaked through the Pacific, the brothers were often joined for morning swims by pods of dolphins. They became excellent spear fishermen, and ended their days watching jaw-dropping sunsets.They found community with other sailors; nights moored in pristine bays were accompanied by the strum of ukuleles and passed bottles of Jack Daniels.But there was also stress. Their engine broke down more than once, winds shifted and died and supplies were difficult to source. \u201cLiving on a boat is constant work,\u201d Mr. Kleeman said. Despite their best efforts, communication, often via ham radio, was sporadic and unreliable.\u201cIf I missed a call from Alex, I\u2019d cry for two days,\u201d Ms. Sloss said.As 2013 rolled over, Ms. Sloss joined the brothers, now flat broke, in New Zealand. With Mr. Kleeman restocking the coffers by working remotely for his previous employers, when ashore, he considered his options.If he sailed again, he thought Ms. Sloss may leave him. So while Saltbreaker went to Bali with only his brother at the helm, Mr. Kleeman took a break from his adventure to return stateside to enjoy a soft bed, cold beer and the companionship of his patient girlfriend.But he was not quite ready to give up sailing. By 2015 he had persuaded her to sail, just the two of them, around the Indonesian archipelago. \u201cWe had gotten to the point where Lauren subtly reinforced my good ideas, and dissuaded me from those that were actually bad,\u201d Mr. Kleeman said. \u201cThis was a good one.\u201dThey reunited with Saltbreaker in Bali, and set off again heading north. During the trip, they fell into a lovely rhythm: reading, singing, fishing, swimming and waking up the next day to do it all again.But the sea had its rough days. One afternoon, the bolt on the tiller sheared and they lost steering under full sail and with the engine running full speed. As they sped toward a reef, grabbing at sails, an uncharacteristically rattled Mr. Kleeman even spat expletives. The anchor finally grabbed hold, saving them from crashing into a wall of coral just yards away.Afterward, Mr. Kleeman\u2019s hands shook. \u201cBut Lauren kept her head,\u201d he said, final proof this was the woman he wanted to marry.One night while she slept, he made an engagement ring from anchor wire. A few days later he suggested a bonfire at night on a deserted island.On that uninhabited island, with the fire crackling and the tide inching up, Mr. Kleeman produced his homemade ring. His intentions were clear, \u201cbut I can get another ring,\u201d he told her.\u201cNo, this is what I want,\u201d an ecstatic and truly surprised Ms. Sloss recalled saying, especially because \u201cit\u2019s hard to have a secret on a tiny boat.\u201dAfter cocktails and briny oysters, the wedding party picked up tambourines and raucously paraded to a nearby gallery for dinner. The groom, wearing flip-flops, and the bride, now in her beloved motorcycle boots, led the procession into a downpour that drenched everyone but left spirits undampened.\u201cOur lives will always be full of adventure,\u201d the bride said. \u201cWhy would a little rain stop us?\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\u2019d see the same reporters in each city, and about this cohort he says: \u201cWe\u2019d become a morbid fraternal order.\u201dMr. Lowery is young (he was born in 1990) and talented (he was a member of the team awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his newspaper\u2019s coverage of police shootings) and black. His book is electric, because it is so well reported, so plainly told and so evidently the work of a man who has not grown a callus on his heart.He had a moment of unwanted fame in August 2014 when he was in Ferguson, Mo., to cover the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white policeman named Darren Wilson. He was eating and doing work in a McDonald\u2019s \u2014 a journalist\u2019s go-to spot because of the free wifi, electrical outlets and bathrooms \u2014 when police ordered the restaurant cleared out.Mr. Lowery has a lot to say about social media and the way it has been put to use by the activists in the movement that\u2019s come to be loosely known as Black Lives Matter. Sites like Facebook and Twitter, he writes, together function as \u201ca hybrid newsfeed, broadcasting platform and ongoing group therapy space.\u201d The movement\u2019s opponents, he finds, use it in much the same way.The author described himself as a social media guinea pig. He doesn\u2019t just file stories for the Post. He tweets, shares video on the live streaming app Periscope and tinkers with Snapchat. To work as a daily print journalist now is to be multiplatform and, like some automated teller machines, open 24/7.Mr. Lowery\u2019s book is valuable for many reasons. He circles slowly and warily around the question of why, during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, so little has seemed to improve on the racial front.\u201cThe headlines of the Obama years often seemed a yearbook of black death,\u201d he writes, \u201craising a morbid and depressing quandary for black men and women: Why had the promise and potential of such a transformative presidency not yet reached down to the lives of those who elected him? Even the historic Obama presidency could not suspend the injunction that playing by the rules wasn\u2019t enough to keep you safe. What protection was offered by a black presidency when, as James Baldwin once wrote, the world is white, and we are black?\u201dMr. Lowery collected hundreds of interviews for this book, and he recounts his visits to many cities to cover shootings. But his book never reads like a data dump. It has a warm, human tone.In part this is because he is open about his reporting process; we get to see how the sausage is made. He tells us about his mistakes, and he issues mea culpas. After one such error, when he used overheated language in a tweet, one of his editors delivers a dictum he takes to heart: \u201cThe more emotional the story, the less emotional the reporter.\u201dHe and his fellow Post reporters were astonished to find how difficult it was to gather figures about police shootings. They began to keep track themselves. \u201cThe picture we painted would reveal how common it had become for unarmed black men to be killed by police officers \u2014 one unarmed black person shot and killed by police every 10 days.\u201d He is eloquent about how these shootings stir centuries of banked anger from African-Americans at the way they have been treated by police.The killing of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of police is not new, of course. Officers are rarely indicted for doing so, and less often convicted. \u201cBefore Ferguson, this story line was as common as it was hidden,\u201d Mr. Lowery writes.Follow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @DwightGarner.They Can\u2019t Kill Us AllFerguson, Baltimore, and a New Era in America\u2019s Racial Justice MovementBy Wesley Lowery248 pages.

He asked the bikers if he could hang out and take some shots. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you police?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled.That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Since that day a year and a half ago, Mr. Giannopoulos has been photographing British Bikelife, as it is known. He has captured bikers at rest and at play, in standoffs with the police, but more than anything doing the thing they love above all else. And he accompanies those photographs with a passionate defense of the people in them.First, though, he had to win their trust, because the bikers are widely reviled in England. Their garb and street names play no small part, as well as their often-confrontational attitude. But while some bikers do behave badly, Mr. Giannopoulos said, in large part the bad-guy stuff is posturing. And for the photographer, the public condemnation and the police crackdown are part of an older story.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be from the working class in the U.K. is to be maligned consistently by the media and the middle and upper classes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Giannopoulos  said.Among the bikers, he found a tremendous sense of community and loyalty. They often took their families, including young children, to the gatherings, and some of the photos suggest that another generation of Bikelife is in the making.But it is not a particularly genteel existence. When they are not racing around, riders may gather to do burnouts, revving their motors in place to produce clouds of smoke and an ocean of noise. And then there are the twelves. Think of a wheelie. Now take it a little higher. And just a little more. There. If it looks as if the clock is striking midnight \u2026 well, you get the idea.And it is also not a particularly safe life. Injuries are common, especially as many riders don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to wear protective gear.Mr. Giannopoulos has a soft spot for the underdog. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether I agree with their activities or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always had a certain amount of admiration for people or groups that are defiant of authority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He is even thinking about taking up biking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 motor biking, that is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 himself.And who knows \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe he will be allowed to do so this time.

But in a series of text messages with The New York Times early Sunday, he confirmed that the meeting with Mr. Trump and members of his family had taken place, and that an article written about it in the Indian newspaper, which reported that one of his partners said they had discussed the desire to expand the deals with the Trump family, was accurate.Washington ethics lawyers said that a meeting with Indian real estate partners, regardless of what was discussed, raised conflict of interest questions for Mr. Trump, who could be perceived as using the presidency to advance his business interests.\u201cThere may be people for whom this looks O.K.,\u201d said Robert L. Walker, the former chief counsel of the Senate Ethics Committee, who advises corporations and members of Congress on government ethics issues. \u201cBut for a large part of the American public, it is not going to be O.K. His role as president-elect should dictate that someone else handles business matters.\u201dThe Economic Times reported that the meeting occurred on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization would not confirm the day of the meeting.Internationally, many properties that bear Mr. Trump\u2019s name are the result of marketing deals \u2014 like the one in India \u2014 in which he is paid by someone for the use of his name but does not actually own the underlying property. He has such marketing agreements in South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, the Philippines and Turkey, according to a list published by his company.Atul Chordia and Sagar Chordia are well-known figures in real estate in Pune, a city of about three million people in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Their father, Ishwardas Chordia, was born into a family of sugar traders, but as a young man forged a close friendship with Sharad Pawar, who became an important politician in Maharashtra and now sits in the upper house of India\u2019s Parliament.Beginning in the 1990s, Chordia businesses built luxury hotels, corporate parks and residential projects in upscale neighborhoods in Pune.Dave Besseling, a former deputy editor at GQ India, hosted an event at Sagar Chordia\u2019s hotel during the 2016 presidential campaign and said Mr. Chordia expressed \u201celation\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and the opportunities it would bring.Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a liberal government watchdog group in Washington, said the meeting at Trump Tower was inappropriate even if there had not been conversation about business. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s children and son-in-law have been deeply involved in the transition and selecting who will be part of his administration,\u201d Mr. Bookbinder said. \u201cAt the same time they are deeply involved in the business.

{"Headline": "New Research Center to Explore Ethics of Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byCarnegie Mellon University plans to announce on Wednesday that it will create a research center that focuses on the ethics of artificial intelligence.The ethics center, called the K&L Gates Endowment for Ethics and Computational Technologies, is being established at a time of growing international concern about the impact of A.I. technologies. That has already led to an array of academic, governmental and private efforts to explore a technology that until recently was largely the stuff of science fiction.In the last decade, faster computer chips, cheap sensors and large collections of data have helped researchers improve on computerized tasks like machine vision and speech recognition, as well as robotics.\u201cWe are at a unique point in time where the technology is far ahead of society\u2019s ability to restrain it,\u201d Mr. Suresh noted.But at the same time, he said some people are a bit too optimistic about their claims of A.I. advances, particularly when it comes to autonomous vehicles.Mr. Suresh said he personally did not think self-driving cars would be in widespread use in the next three years.The Uber laboratory has been a sensitive spot for Carnegie Mellon. The field of artificial intelligence emerged in part at Carnegie Mellon in the 1950s in the work of faculty who developed software that showed how computer algorithms could intelligently solve problems.University officials said the departing faculty have been replaced and 13 additional professors have been hired since the defections. They also said that between 2011 and 2015, Carnegie Mellon faculty and staff created 164 start-up companies.University officials pointed to a partnership the school entered into last year with Boeing to use machine-learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data generated by modern aircraft such as the Boeing Dreamliner.The new center is being created with a $10 million gift from K&L Gates, an international law firm headquartered in Pittsburgh. It will draw from several academic disciplines and will initially add two faculty and three positions for graduate students. It will also establish a biennial conference on ethical issues facing the field.K&L Gates is one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates\u2019s father, William H. Gates Sr., was involved in the firm until his retirement in 1998. Peter J. Kalis, chairman of the law firm, said the potential impact of A.I. technology on the economy and culture made it essential that as a society we make thoughtful, ethical choices about how the software and machines are used.\u201cCarnegie Mellon resides at the intersection of many disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a synthesis of the best thinking of all of these disciplines for society to define the ethical constraints on the emerging A.I. technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Killing of Saudi Student Shakes Wisconsin College Town", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byFor nearly a week, the police in Menomonie, Wis., have been at a loss to identify a suspect or a motive in the fatal beating of a Saudi Arabian college student outside a pizza restaurant. Now, the city is trying to change that by raising money for a reward. The tally so far? $20,000.He was taken to the hospital in Eau Claire, where he died on Monday, the police said.After his death, the Police Department said it did not believe there was an \u201congoing threat\u201d to the community, though it said it had no information about a possible motive. By Thursday, that apparently had not changed.However, a department commander, Todd W. Swartz, said in an email that witnesses had described a possible suspect: a six-foot-tall white man.In the absence of information about whether there had been a racial motive, the death of Mr. Alnahdi has shaken the small city in the western part of the state and has shocked the university campus, where the 9,600 students include a tight-knit group of 142 from Saudi Arabia.\u201cThere is more fear, especially because we don\u2019t know who the assailant is,\u201d Michael Lee, an international student adviser, said in a telephone interview on Thursday from the campus. \u201cIt was an extremely rare, almost-unheard-of event.\u201dMr. Lee said that the number of Saudi students had grown in the past four years, attracted to the university\u2019s engineering and business curriculum. The Saudi kingdom sponsors about 80,000 to 100,000 students in the United States as a way to diversify its economy and future work force, he said.\u201cMany people are looking for ways to help the police find the assailant, and we hope this fund will generate the information needed to lead to an arrest and conviction,\u201d Mr. Meyer said.The Council of American-Islamic Relations, a national civil rights organization, said it would add $5,000 to the fund, and sent its Minnesota chapter executive director, Jaylani Hussein, to meet with students and staff members at the university on Wednesday.\u201cThey are all afraid,\u201d Mr. Alkohmos said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cA lot of international students are asking for more police officers to be more in downtown every weekend, and just to increase security for a while for us to feel safe.\u201d\u201cThis is NOT who we are!\u201d another note read.And a third from his teachers: \u201cRest in peace.

A memorial service for Mr. Alnahdi was planned for late Thursday afternoon.\u201cIt is a normal reaction in a time like this to look for reasons for this tragedy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI certainly have many questions and concerns that I wish we had answers to about what led to Hussain\u2019s assault.

{"Headline": "Inside a Fake News Sausage Factory: \u2018This Is All About Income\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byTBILISI, Georgia \u2014 Jobless and with graduation looming, a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia decided early this year that money could be made from America\u2019s voracious appetite for passionately partisan political news. He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it did not work,\u201d said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real \u2014 and completely fake \u2014 news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.\u201cIt\u2019s all Trump,\u201d Mr. Egan said by telephone. \u201cPeople go nuts for it.\u201dWith Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?Some analysts worry that foreign intelligence agencies are meddling in American politics and using fake news to influence elections. But one window into how the meat in fake sausages gets ground can be found in the buccaneering internet economy, where satire produced in Canada can be taken by a recent college graduate in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and presented as real news to attract clicks from credulous readers in the United States. Mr. Latsabidze said his only incentive was to make money from Google ads by luring people off Facebook pages and onto his websites.To gin up material, Mr. Latsabidze often simply cut and pasted, sometimes massaging headlines but mostly just copying material from elsewhere, including Mr. Egan\u2019s prank story on Mr. Obama. Mr. Egan was not amused to see his satirical work on Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s website and filed a copyright infringement notice to defend his intellectual property.Yet Mr. Egan conceded a certain professional glee that Mr. Trump is here to stay. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got him for four years,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dIn Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America\u2019s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)\u201cMy audience likes Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.\u201dSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that \u201cthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.\u201d Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: \u201cStop it Liberals\u2026Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here\u2019s Why.\u201d That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people\u2019s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)Then the notice arrived from Mr. Egan in Canada, which prompted the company that hosts Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites, including departed.co, to shut them down for two days until he removed the offending story.\u201cIt was really bad for me,\u201d Mr. Latsabidze recalled. \u201cTraffic dropped and I had to start everything all over again.\u201dMr. Egan, for his part, said he did not like others making money unfairly off his labor. And he estimated that \u201cprobably half\u201d the readers of his stories believe they are true because of the widespread theft by other websites.\u201cA lot of that was conservative readers who see it picked up on other sites and believe it,\u201d Mr. Egan said. \u201cIn many cases, they haven\u2019t actually read it, they\u2019re just reacting to a headline.\u201dMr. Latsabidze said he was amazed that anyone could mistake many of the articles he posts for real news, insisting they are simply a form of infotainment that should not be taken too seriously.\u201cI don\u2019t call it fake news; I call it satire,\u201d he said. He avoids sex and violence because they violate Facebook rules, he said, but he sees nothing wrong otherwise with providing readers with what they want.\u201cNobody really believes that Mexico is going to close its border,\u201d he said, sipping coffee this week in a McDonald\u2019s in downtown Tbilisi. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201dAll the same, the Mexico-closing-its-border story proved so popular after it appeared on his site that he hunted around on the web for other articles on the same theme. He found a tall tale about Mexico planning to call back its citizens from the United States if Mr. Trump won. This, too, generated huge traffic, though not quite as much as the first one, which Mr. Latsabidze described as \u201ca really great story.\u201dHe insisted he has nothing against Mexicans or Muslims, whose exclusion from the United States is requested by an online petition that often appears on his websites and who are invariably presented in a negative light in the stories he posts.\u201cI am not against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw that there was interest. They are in the news.\u201d Nor, he added, is he particularly against Mrs. Clinton, though he personally prefers Mr. Trump.If his pro-Clinton site had taken off, he said, he would have pressed on with that, but \u201cpeople did not engage,\u201d so he focused on serving pro-Trump supporters instead. They, he quickly realized, were a far more receptive audience \u201cbecause they are angry\u201d and eager to read outrageous tales.\u201cFor me, this is all about income, nothing more,\u201d he added.The income comes mostly from Google, which pays a few cents each time a reader sees or clicks on advertisements embedded in one of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s websites. His best month, which coincided with the hit bogus story about Mexico closing the border, brought in around $6,000, though monthly revenue is usually much lower.While Facebook does not directly provide Mr. Latsabidze any revenue, it plays a central role in driving traffic to his websites. He initially established several fake Facebook pages intended to steer traffic to his websites, including one supposedly set up by a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka. This woman, he acknowledged, does not really exist. \u201cShe is me,\u201d he said.He discovered, however, that such pages were ineffective compared with legitimate Facebook pages from real people, particularly Trump supporters, because they have so much energy and love promoting stories they like.Departed.co \u2014 named after Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s favorite movie, \u201cThe Departed,\u201d and recently redirected to usatodaycom.com \u2014 published dozens of stories daily, many of them similar to one posted on Nov. 17 with the headline, \u201cThis Is Huuge! International Arrest Warrant Issued By Putin For George Soros!\u201d The story was not true and had already been published on scores of other fake news sites around the web.In the prelude to the election, bogus reports about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health and highly favorable ones about Mr. Trump were promoted with gusto by Russian state-controlled news media outlets and legions of pro-Russian internet agitators. This has stirred suspicions that the Kremlin has had a hand in the fake news industry, prompting American researchers to assert in recent studies that the online blurring of the boundary between truth and falsehood is in part the result of Russian manipulation.But Mr. Latsabidze and others here say they serve only their bank balances, not Russia or anything else.He insisted that his team operated entirely on its own and that it did not want or need outside help. He said that it took him just two hours to set up a basic website and that anyone with a modicum of computer savvy could quickly start hawking news \u2014 real or fake \u2014 online.\u201cI did not invent anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has all been done before.\u201dMr. Latsabidze, who apparently has broken no laws, said that any crackdown on fake news might work in the short term but that \u201csomething else will come along to replace it.\u201d\u201cIf they want to, they can control everything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this will stop freedom of speech.\u201dFor now, the postelection period has been bad for business, with a sharp fall in the appetite for incendiary political news favoring Mr. Trump. Traffic to departed.co and affiliated websites has plunged in recent weeks by at least 50 percent, Mr. Latsabidze said.\u201cIf Hillary had won, it would be better for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI could write about the bad things she was going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not write to make Trump win. I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.\u201dIn the months since he got into the fake news business, Mr. Latsabidze has landed a day job as a programmer with a software company, which he sees as a better future. \u201cThis is more stable work,\u201d he said.But he seemed reluctant to quit altogether.\u201cAre there any elections coming up in the U.K.?\u201d Mr. Latsabidze asked.He was disappointed to hear that none were scheduled soon. But, advised that France will hold a hotly contested presidential election next April featuring a Trump-like candidate in the form of Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist, he perked up.\u201cMaybe I should learn some French,\u201d he said.Andrew Higgins reported from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Mike McIntire and Gabriel J.X.

{"Headline": "CNN Brings In the Social App Beme to Cultivate a Millennial Audience", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byWith millions of people regularly tuning in to his YouTube video blogs every morning, Casey Neistat has a millennial fan base coveted by both marketers and media companies. Now, one of those big media outlets is bringing Mr. Neistat \u2014 and, it hopes, his youthful audience \u2014 in-house.Beme was intended to be a social sharing application that Mr. Neistat described as \u201cmore authentic,\u201d a way of putting four-second bursts of video out into the social sphere without giving users the ability to edit or tweak the content. Taking video was as simple as holding a smartphone\u2019s front-facing sensor to one\u2019s body, as if the camera were an extension of one\u2019s chest.Mr. Neistat hopes to bring that idea of authenticity to a news and media environment to draw in a younger audience largely untapped by the cable news network. CNN will shut down the Beme app, which had 1.2 million downloads before losing steam.\u201cA huge part of my particular audience sees news and media as largely broken,\u201d Mr. Neistat said in an interview. \u201cMy dad sees it as the word of God, but I think the young people definitely do not.\u201dBeme saw early traction, especially among Mr. Neistat\u2019s avid personal following, but failed to capture a large part of the social sharing market amid competitors like Instagram, Facebook and others. Snapchat, the disappearing video and photo sharing app, seemed to tap into much of the raw types of content and feelings Mr. Neistat said he and his team were trying to capture.Many of the ideas that came out of Beme will be applied to a new, separate start-up company that will exist as an extension of CNN. Mr. Neistat and his team will be given full creative control to come up with a new project.Beme\u2019s audience is something that CNN, a 36-year-old cable news destination, is striving to attract. Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide, has frequently stated the network\u2019s ambition to become a \u201cdigital company,\u201d far from its roots as a 24-hour news channel.\u201cCasey has tapped into nearly six million really powerful viewers, most of which do not tune in to CNN,\u201d Andrew Morse, global head of CNN Digital, said in an interview. \u201cTo build this audience authentically, we believe we need to build something new.\u201dIt is unclear what shape the Beme project will take, but the plan is for Mr. Neistat to present some of its early ideas in the first half of 2017.One thing is for sure: Mr. Neistat, fluent in broadcasting himself in the digital age, is far from beholden to traditional cable news conventions. Instead, he is being asked to find the next medium and mode of delivering news to an audience more skeptical than ever before.\u201cWhat we did on Beme was connect with people and strike that chord of honesty,\u201d said Jeremy Liew, a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners and lead investor in Beme. \u201cThat, combined with the size of Casey\u2019s following on YouTube, validated exactly the kind of understanding that traditional media companies are looking for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fake News Onslaught Targets Pizzeria as Nest of Child-Trafficking", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWithin hours, menacing messages like \u201cwe\u2019re on to you\u201d began appearing in his Instagram feed. In the ensuing days, hundreds of death threats \u2014 one read \u201cI will kill you personally\u201d \u2014 started arriving via texts, Facebook and Twitter. All of them alleged something that made Mr. Alefantis\u2019s jaw drop: that Comet Ping Pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John D. Podesta.When Mr. Alefantis discovered that his employees were getting similar abusive messages, he looked online to unravel the accusations. He found dozens of made-up articles about Mrs. Clinton kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant\u2019s back rooms. The articles appeared on Facebook and on websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen, with one headline blaring: \u201cPizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington\u2019s Occult Elite.\u201d\u201cFrom this insane, fabricated conspiracy theory, we\u2019ve come under constant assault,\u201d said Mr. Alefantis, 42, who was once in a relationship with David Brock, a provocative former right-wing journalist who became an outspoken advocate for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Alefantis suspects those relationships may have helped to make him a target. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing for days but try to clean this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized,\u201d he said.But Mr. Alefantis\u2019s experience shows it is not just politicians and internet companies that are grappling with the fake news fallout. He, his staff and friends have become a new kind of private citizen bull\u2019s-eye for the purveyors of false articles and their believers.For more than two weeks, they have struggled to deal with the abusive social media comments and to protect photos of their own children, which were used in the false articles as evidence that the pizza restaurant was running a pedophilia ring. One person even visited Comet Ping Pong to investigate the allegations for himself.To combat the fake news tide, Mr. Alefantis has contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local police, and he has asked Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit to remove the articles. Yet the misinformation has continued to spread, growing into a theory known as #pizzagate that has traveled to Ireland. At one point, Comet\u2019s staff counted five #pizzagate Twitter posts a minute. As recently as Sunday night, the Twitter message \u201cDon\u2019t let up. #PizzaGate EVERYWHERE\u201d was reposted and liked hundreds of times.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to shoot a swarm of bees with one gun,\u201d said Bryce Reh, Comet\u2019s general manager, whose wife asked him to leave his job because of the threats and vulgar messages they both have received on their social media accounts.Mr. Alefantis, an artist born and raised in Washington, co-founded Comet Ping Pong 10 years ago as a casual spot for clay oven pizza. The restaurant has kid-friendly features like Ping-Pong tables and a craft room. Famous natives like members of the band Fugazi have held small shows there. The eatery, which seats 120, is a mash-up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of Mr. Alefantis.The 4Chan users immediately speculated about the links between Comet Ping Pong and the Democratic Party. Some posited the restaurant was part of a larger Democratic child trafficking ring, which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs. That idea jumped to other social media services such as Twitter and Reddit, where it gained momentum on the page \u201cThe_Donald.\u201d A new Reddit discussion thread called \u201cPizzagate\u201d quickly attracted 20,000 subscribers.Glen Caplin, a former campaign official for Mrs. Clinton, did not comment directly about Comet Ping Pong but said, \u201cWikiLeaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked.\u201d Mr. Podesta did not respond to requests for comment.Last week, one supporter of the Pizzagate theory shot a live video from within the restaurant during a busy dinner shift. Local police, who had parked across the street after Mr. Alefantis filed a report about the fake news stories and threats, told the man to leave.In a statement, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department said it was monitoring the situation and is \u201caware of general threats being made against this establishment.\u201d The F.B.I. said it \u201cdoes not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.\u201dMost troubling for Mr. Alefantis and staff has been the use of children\u2019s images, pilfered from the restaurant\u2019s social media pages and the personal accounts of friends who had \u201cliked\u201d Comet Ping Pong online. Those photos have been used across dozens of websites. Parents, who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution, have hired lawyers to get the photos removed.Musicians who have performed at Comet Ping Pong have been pulled in, too. Amanda Kleinman, whose band, Heavy Breathing, has performed there several times, deleted her Twitter account after the abusive comments became overwhelming. Similar comments have flooded her YouTube music clips.\u201cWe are at a dangerous place in American culture where a good percentage of people aren\u2019t distinguishing what is a real news source based on real reporting and fact-checking and only reinforcing pre-existing ideas they have,\u201d Ms. Kleinman said.The frustration has been compounded by the lack of recourse for Mr. Alefantis, his friends and employees. Yelp blocked the comments sections of Comet Ping Pong\u2019s review page after reports of abusive comments and fake news in reviews. YouTube said it prohibits threats, harassment and hate speech and has tools for flagging violations and filing complaints for the site to take further action, but has largely not blocked comments on these videos. Twitter declined to comment, and Facebook did not have any further comment.After employees and Mr. Alefantis complained to Reddit about how Comet Ping Pong was being targeted on the site, the #pizzagate discussion thread posted a warning that revealing personal information about individuals was prohibited.\u201cWe know that we have more work to do and we take our responsibility to address online abuse seriously,\u201d Reddit said in a statement.Little relief appears in sight. Over the weekend, Comet Ping Pong received dozens of calls from people screaming obscenities and threats. Mr. Alefantis got 50 nasty Instagram direct messages, including one that warned, \u201cThis place should be burned to the ground!\u201dOn Monday morning, when Mr. Alefantis picked up his phone, he saw a text from a staff member warning that an individual might protest in front of the restaurant.\u201cIt\u2019s endless,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}

She is described by friends as \u201calways happy,\u201d \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201ca bright spirit.\u201d Her own Facebook posts give a sense of a more particular Nohemi: \u201cLearning a 3D modeling computer program in a language I don\u2019t know is up there in the top three hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do.\u201d (The reader can\u2019t help but wonder what the other two hard things were.)In interviews soon after the attack, Nohemi\u2019s mother sometimes used the present tense to describe her daughter: \u201cShe loves school,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cNohemi wanted a different life from most of our people who just go to work and come home. She wanted a career.\u201dReading about Nohemi\u2019s short life reminded me of many of my students at Johnson State College in Vermont, where I recently retired as president. Vermont is as different from California in its demographic makeup, size and economy as two states can be, and yet her story could have been theirs. Some of my students had never held a passport or even left our state; like Nohemi, they took their first plane rides while in college, exiting wide-eyed onto foreign lands.\u201cI can go anywhere now,\u201d one student told me after returning from Greece, as stunned as she was newly confident. Finding your way home on the metro in another country is one thing; doing so on your first metro ride ever is a triumph.Like Johnson State, Cal State Long Beach is one of 400 regional colleges and universities educating 40 percent of the nation\u2019s undergraduates. These \u201cmiddle children\u201d of public higher education \u2014 not a community college, not a state flagship \u2014 are oft-forgotten (and seldom celebrated) microcosms of their states. Nohemi might have thrived anywhere, but Cal State Long Beach, whose enrollment is 95 percent Californian and more than one-third Hispanic, seems to have fostered a keen awareness and responsibility of place (her place) and given her not only a context in which to flourish, but also the confidence to venture beyond its borders.Nohemi had only begun her journey, but her sense of adventure might serve as a beacon for young people with limited family resources as they set out to discover worlds apart from their own.In other ways she was atypical: Nearly 75 percent of Americans who study overseas are non-Hispanic white, and disproportionately from private schools. Despite the opening up of federal financial aid to support study abroad, international study is still more available to students with greater family resources.Nohemi would have beaten many odds, and we root for people who defy statistics and set new paths. Will Cal State students follow hers? I asked Dean Jeet Joshee, who oversees international study at the university, if he was seeing any drop in interest in study abroad since her death. He said that students tell him they will not be deterred from their plans.Of course, study abroad is not without its risks. Foreign students in Rome are frequent targets of robberies, including one last summer that ended in the death of an American student in an exchange program at John Cabot University. But such highly publicized deaths may skew our perceptions.The president of the Institute for International Education, Allan E. Goodman, has often said that getting to the airport in the United States may be the most dangerous part of studying abroad. Paradoxically, he says, he is asked by parents from other countries if they should keep their children from coming here to avoid the risks inherent in a country in which guns are rampant.As unlikely as Nohemi\u2019s death was, it was not random. Her assassins did not set out to kill a Mexican-American design student in particular, but they did set out to murder what she represents: the freedom of pleasure, choice and agency.Colleges are brave institutions. They must be part of the forces that shape the lives of young adults during their most alert and seeking years. As parents and educators, it\u2019s our job to ensure that we protect these freedoms for our young people \u2014 here, at home \u2014 and instill in them the values and responsibilities that such liberties require. Then we can set them free, and hope it\u2019s enough.Most students who return from a semester or more of international study report greater maturity and a clearer understanding of their own values.Living and learning in another culture is more important than ever \u2014 for the individual students, of course, but also because the empathy such experiences foster is crucial in maintaining a safer, more loving world. No other single experience comes as close to building a new perspective on citizenship and place as study in another country. Nothing.Nohemi\u2019s brief immersion in that experience made her life, I am convinced, a larger one. This was a woman who refused to be constrained by tradition or circumstance. She chose knowledge instead of ignorance. She chose to imagine a future for herself.That she did not get to inhabit that future breaks our hearts but not our resolve to leave our homes and expand our notion of citizenship and belonging.Barbara E. Murphy is a former president of Johnson State College and of the Community College of Vermont and is the author of the poetry collection \u201cAlmost Too Much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

New York, where I have lived for half my life? Or Topeka, where I grew up?The first person who said that to me during my recent reporting trips to Topeka, Kan., was Helen Crow. I think of her as Topeka\u2019s Real Estate Queen. Helen and I grew up in the same Topeka neighborhood: Potwin, a historic district of quaint red brick streets and Victorian houses.She\u2019s a broker. One of my childhood best friends, Sheree Smith, is now her indispensable assistant. As a broker, Helen has a strong sense of what home means, and knows how to make people feel it. She quickly went to work on me, trying to overcome my resistance to the idea that Topeka was still my home.I kept thinking of my childhood friend and high school classmate Sheree. She never went to college. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t have the money to send any of their five children to college, so they never mentioned it to us, even though they both went,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t know what I would want to do.\u201dAfter graduating from Topeka High, she spooned canned fruit into dessert cups at a nursing home, learned how to perform EEG\u2019s, and worked 10 years at the Frito Lay factory, where she got a hernia from lifting a heavy bag of corn meal. The job she has now, in real estate, was previously held by a college student, Sheree tells me with her usual gallows humor. A few years ago, when we were having dinner, I tried to talk her into taking some courses at Washburn University, a public university in Topeka. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust \u2014 to learn,\u201d I said. She did not see the need for it. But now she is proud that her younger son, Derrick, is earning his master\u2019s on the G.I. bill.\u201cI know you didn\u2019t approve of many, many things Rhonda and I did, and you weren\u2019t wrong,\u201d Sheree told me when I asked if I could write about her. (Rhonda was the other member of our gang of three.) She was not talking only about college, but she judges herself too harshly. The view from Kansas, I knew, could be very different than the views from the East and West Coasts.When The Times sent me to Topeka in August, it was just the third time I had been back since my family moved away in 1980. The landscape has changed dramatically. As in small towns all over America, shopping and much of the middle class have moved out of the city center.So I was relieved to find Topeka High School, the big central high school and my alma mater, virtually unchanged \u2014 renovated, even.It must be true of every hometown that, as Elena Ferrante says in her popular Neapolitan novels, there are those who stay and those who go. I was one of those who wanted to go.Yet it could easily have been the other way around, and you can never completely leave the past behind. When a colleague, who knew that I had grown up in Topeka, once referred to me as a New Yorker, I snapped, \u201cI am not a New Yorker.\u201dBeing back was healing. It is a journalist\u2019s trick to look for familiar figures, as a shortcut to understanding them. I was especially drawn to three seniors in my reporting.Nathan Triggs, torn between the city and the farm, reminded me of a high school friend who lived on a farm and married his high school sweetheart while they were still teenagers (a Kansas Romeo and Juliet). Zachary Shaner, a smart and talented musician who worries about affording college, reminded me of my high school friend Jeanne, who was a smart and talented debater but lived in a neighborhood so poor it has been razed for urban renewal. And TaTy\u2019Terria Gary, who wants to see what life is like outside Topeka, reminded me of myself.I was incensed. \u201cI\u2019m going to respond,\u201d I told the two boys.\u201cDon\u2019t be negative,\u201d Nate said.I\u2019ll be continuing to follow Nate, Zac and TaTy as they apply to college. Ultimately I will write about where they get in and where they decide to go. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to find out,\u201d I told Nate the other day. \u201cMe too,\u201d he replied.As I get to know these kids, Topeka has started to feel familiar again. I feel grounded by the downtown streets named after presidents. I am surprised and pleased that Einstein\u2019s Army surplus store, where Sheree, Rhonda and I used to get our hippie clothes, is still in business. I am disoriented by the appearance of the state capitol building, whose refurbished copper dome is now brown instead of green. I peek at the Gage Park pool and remember us all sunbathing there in our bikinis. I have new appreciation for how the mist rises off the brick streets on a fall morning in Potwin as if you\u2019re in Paris. I feel the call of unknown places when the train whistles blow at night.So when the principal of Topeka High, Rebecca Morrisey, said to me after my last visit, \u201cI think you\u2019ve come home quite well,\u201d I did not flinch. I agreed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Did College-Educated White Women Vote for Trump?", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "On Election Day, Lauren changed her profile picture on Facebook to a shot of her in the campaign\u2019s trademark Make America Great Again hat, squinting through the sights of a rifle at a paper target. It was pinned to a tree on the far side of the family\u2019s emerald green lawn in Moscow, a small borough in Lackawanna County, Pa. The town of 2,000, which is almost entirely white, is the starting point for a picturesque train ride into the Pocono Mountains. It has five churches and a median household income of about $77,000.Hillary Clinton\u2019s father grew up about a dozen miles from here, in the county seat of Scranton. As she mentioned many times on the campaign trail, he owned a drape store. Frable\u2019s father was a butcher in a grocery opened by her grandfather, an immigrant from Italy. Her father served as a medic in World War II, and then worked for the Amalgamated Meat Cutters union. He and Frable\u2019s mother, a registered nurse, voted for Democrats for president, until they supported Ronald Reagan in 1980 and never looked back.If Frable\u2019s parents were lost to Hillary Clinton\u2019s party decades ago, she and her daughters represent a different kind of Hillary heartbreak. Frable has voted for several Democratic candidates for governor and other offices over the years, and this is the eastern edge of a region, stretching to Wisconsin, that seemed like fertile Clinton territory. She actually beat Trump in Lackawanna County but just barely, with under 50 percent of the vote, compared with Barack Obama\u2019s 63 percent. Clinton also lost white women by three crucial points in Pennsylvania. The Frables help explain why. The three women are college-educated or college-bound, and they voted for Trump not because they feel left behind but to improve economic opportunity, as they see it.For this cohort, the concern isn\u2019t necessarily their own finances. \u201cMy life wouldn\u2019t change either way,\u201d Frable said about the material difference between a Clinton and Trump presidency. \u201cI don\u2019t think my taxes will be better or worse with one or the other.\u201d But she felt confident that her children will find better jobs after college with Trump in office, and she talked with longing about his promise to restore jobs, like one she remembers a friend of her father\u2019s had, working in an auto factory in Detroit. \u201cIf we could have export agreements with, say, France or Germany, or let\u2019s face it, Russia, they would take our quality goods and we could be great again,\u201d Frable said.All of this \u2014 along with other items on the Trump \u201cwish list,\u201d as Frable put it, like defeating ISIS and cracking down on border security \u2014 matters far more to her than anything Trump said about women or was accused of doing to them. Anyway, given Bill Clinton\u2019s history, how can Hillary complain? \u201cI have disrespect for Hillary for not doing more for herself, not standing up for herself with him,\u201d Frable said. \u201cThat\u2019s more damaging than goofball words Trump came up with.\u201dFrable, who is self-employed as a marketing consultant, has a degree in the equivalent of graphic design from the Art Institute of Philadelphia and another in small-business administration. Her husband of 31 years works in H.V.A.C. engineering. Lauren is studying sonography at a community college and planning to transfer to Misericordia University near Scranton. Abigail, a senior in high school, plans to get a degree in hotel management.Trump\u2019s business record \u2014 the fact that he bounced back despite the ups and the downs \u2014 initially attracted Frable and her daughters. Frable also admires Ivanka Trump and felt she was one of the campaign\u2019s \u201ctop three assets.\u201d She sees Ivanka as a role model for Abigail in her own entrepreneurial interests. It\u2019s not Hillary\u2019s \u201cGloria Steinem feminism,\u201d as Frable put it, that she values. It\u2019s Ivanka\u2019s sleek version of female success, which commentators have labeled \u201ccommodity feminism\u201d \u2014 branding to sell products. \u201cI\u2019ve been paid the same as men, I\u2019ve managed men,\u201d Frable said. \u201cI\u2019ve not had any trouble working with men.\u201d For Trump supporters that I talked to, college education didn\u2019t seem to lead to support for the liberal women\u2019s movement. Frable and her daughters oppose abortion as Christians. Other women called themselves pro-choice but backed Trump because they didn\u2019t think he really opposed abortion or thought the law in states like theirs wouldn\u2019t change even if he chose future Supreme Court justices with an eye to overturning Roe v. Wade.Frable has close friends and clients who are ardent Hillary supporters, but she discounts the despairing social-media posts she has seen about women who didn\u2019t support Clinton\u2019s historic candidacy. She thinks the election wasn\u2019t about gender or race. It was a victory of \u201cMiddle America.\u201d Clinton, she said, \u201cis more the white elitist than Trump. She\u2019s the one who had elitist celebrities stumping for her.\u201dFrable and her husband own a second home near Fort Myers, Fla., and she\u2019s impressed by the work ethic of the Mexican immigrants she knows there. Trump won\u2019t really build a wall or deport people en masse, she said. He got where he is by making compromises. He\u2019ll do the same as president; she is sure of that. Frable and her daughters are confident in their judgment and confident in themselves. \u201cDid you hit the target?\u201d a friend asked Lauren on Facebook about her Election Day profile picture. \u201cOf course I did!\u201d Lauren wrote back.Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School.\u201cFlint, where I\u2019ve been photographing for the past year, is a city in real struggle. In parts of the city, one in five houses is empty. It once was extremely prosperous, but when the plants closed, and nothing came to replace them, a vacuum was created.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cThis young man was being fitted for his tuxedo at Dante Zeller Tuxedo & Menswear on Staten Island. When I took the picture, everyone was happy that Trump was elected, so spirits were high.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cThis man\u2019s name is Terrell Finger. I met him in Ferguson. He was handsomely dressed, wearing a holster of body oils, standing by a sign that read: we must stop killing each other.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cThis picture was taken before the annual Veterans Day parade in Waco. I expected to find politics in evidence, given the recent election. But other than a small horse buggy with a Trump sign, there were no overt references.\u201d Nov. 11, 2016\u201cI was walking around the streets of Cincinnati with a local childhood friend. I found it poignant to see our nation\u2019s first president looking out onto the city\u2019s streets that day. My friend reminded me that George Washington was a member of \u2018The Society of the Cincinnati,\u2019 after which the city was named.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cHer name is Afiwa. She came here 19 years ago from Togo. She\u2019s a citizen now, and she\u2019s proud of that. Here, she\u2019s kneeling by a large tree and praying for her family and herself. She\u2019s been through difficult times in her life, and she was saying that she was thankful to have made it this far. She said she voted for Clinton. She was openhearted, inviting and unguarded. She was a comfort to me, because I wasn\u2019t really seeing a lot of optimism the day after the election. The mood was predominantly dark, sad and angry that day, but I wasn\u2019t getting any of that from her.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cThis midconstruction castle-esque home struck me as a conjuring of storybook fantasy into reality, a representation of architecture as fortification and perhaps a precursor to the coming years.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cMaddie, the woman pictured in this image, is my wife\u2019s best friend from high school. She and her husband, Dan, are Latter-day Saints. Maddie didn\u2019t vote for Trump; she said she couldn\u2019t do it in good conscience. As I took the picture, I sensed her anxiety about raising children in this environment.\u201d Nov. 10, 2016\u201cI live in Minnesota, and most of my photographs depict the big middle of America. The New York Times magazine asked me to go to Wisconsin on Thursday to take a picture. I drove a couple of hours to Barron, Wisconsin. Barron has a population of 3,300 and voted two to one for Trump. The man I photographed was named Lance. He was a Trump supporter. \u2018I could see this country go back to its grass roots, even if it went all the way to revolution,\u2019 he told me, \u2018I\u2019d be standing on that front line.\u2019\u201d Nov. 10, 2016Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Notes on the U.S. Election: A Measure of America\u2019s Fever", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byAbroad in AmericaWhen democracy is at its best, elections are the civilized version of warfare: clashes of wit, personality and ideas that seek to resolve a nation\u2019s biggest arguments. But sometimes an election is just a dirty fight.When Donald J. Trump arrived in Albuquerque last week, stepping from his gold-plated jet into an aircraft hangar that was thronged with baying supporters, he held his arms aloft like a champion boxer.His speech opened with dutiful attacks on Obamacare, the Iran nuclear deal and immigration. But it was when he uttered a single word \u2014 \u201cHillary\u201d \u2014 that the crowd truly erupted.\u201cLock her up!\u201d The roar filled the hangar. Mr. Trump paused his speech, then smiled.Two days later and 1,500 miles away, Hillary Clinton punched back. Slamming her rival\u2019s \u201cdark and divisive vision,\u201d she alternated between mocking Mr. Trump and painting him as a threat to America and global stability.Would America\u2019s nuclear codes be safe in his hands? she asked the crowd at her own rally in Orlando, Fla. What about black people? Latinos?A harsh, saw-toothed quality crept into her voice. This was the biggest election of their lives, she told supporters. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cgo and vote.\u201dAs Nov. 8 approached, I wanted to see the candidates up close. I went to 10 rallies in six states, traveling more than 6,000 miles (that\u2019s nine flights in four days). After all that, I didn\u2019t get closer than 30 yards from either candidate. The view was often better on television.Rallies felt like injections to the vein, jolts of political energy driven by voters who stood for long hours in crowded halls, cheering leaders they could barely see for promises that may never be fulfilled. But venom, not hope, was a driving force.Fear and loathing course through both campaigns, driven on one side by Mr. Trump\u2019s chest-thumping populism and on the other by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s apocalyptic warnings of the consequences if he wins.Lurid personal attacks, insinuations of vote-rigging, rampant conspiracy theories \u2014 I might have been in Pakistan, where I lived for nine years, or at my current base in Egypt. In this election, America\u2019s shining city on the hill, it seems, has more in common with those countries where the electricity blinks on and off.Below, some snapshots and notes from my time on the trail, first with Mr. Trump, then with Mrs. Clinton.He channels the energy of the crowd, listening as he speaks. When he hears the right note of approval, Mr. Trump amplifies his message and bounces it back, usually with one of his trademark three-word catchphrases.\u201cDrain the swamp!\u201d the crowd yells on cue \u2014 a reference to the swamp upon which Washington, D.C., was built. Then: \u201cBuild the wall\u201d on the Mexican border.And: \u201cLock her up!\u201dThen we are herded into a giant service elevator that deposits us in the bowels of the casino where, among the concrete pillars, a convoy of gleaming black vehicles and burly Secret Service agents is waiting. Mr. Trump follows within minutes.I press up against the window of the press bus. The candidate walks briskly, but his shoulders are drooped, as if deflated by the effort of the speech. He steps into a four-wheel drive, and the convoy sets off for the airport. This, it turns out, is the closest I will get to him.But you don\u2019t get to see the star. In a break with campaign tradition, Mr. Trump has declined to share a plane with the traveling press. He flies in his private Boeing 757 \u2014 fancifully nicknamed Trump Force One \u2014 with its 24-karat gold taps and retinue of advisers.Yet individually, many Trump supporters are a far cry from the snarling caricatures. At the University of Northern Colorado, they are cheery and polite, an odd mix of the prim and the profane: schoolteachers and churchgoers in sensible shoes, paunchy middle-aged men in tattoos and biker leathers. They seem to exult in the solidarity of the crowd, defiant in their identity as \u201cdeplorables.\u201dTo them, Mr. Trump can do no wrong; the problem is politics. Les Potts, a retired preacher, tells me that he worries about the progressives\u2019 gaining control of the Supreme Court and the spread of communism. Is America not the global center of capitalism? No, he insists.\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Washington, we need some big changes. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have that without a revolution.\u201dMs. Sanger, who is 33 and works at a furniture factory, explains: Mrs. Clinton is a corrupt criminal, \u201cbought and paid for by special interests \u2014 she deserves jail.\u201dMs. Sanger\u2019s placard is sponsored by infowars.com, a conspiracy website that, thanks to Mr. Trump, has leapt to prominence.It\u2019s also a sign of the times: Thanks to Mr. Trump, fringe ideas are now aired in the mainstream, prejudice masquerading as fact. Danny Popma, a local factory owner, tells me that the Muslim community in Detroit \u2014 the largest in America \u2014 was implicated in 9/11.At Macomb Community College, north of Detroit, he paints a dismal picture of American foreign policy, laying the chaos of the Middle East \u2014 Libya, Syria, Egypt and Iraq, and the death of four Americans in Benghazi in 2012 \u2014 at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s doorstep.To him, the entire world is a stage of American humiliation, with a declining military and abandoned veterans. It resonates with people in the crowd. To them, Mr. Trump offers to salve fallen pride, flex American muscle and renew bruised notions of American exceptionalism.Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk-show king, is on the radio, pouring cold water on suggestions that Mr. Trump is losing and basking in the email scandal that has exploded over the Clinton campaign \u2014 again.Nobody knows what was in these latest emails, not even the F.B.I. director, who revealed their existence. But that\u2019s not the point. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails have acquired a talismanic power in this election, a digital dung heap that embodies the negatives she has struggled to shake off: defensiveness, reflexive secrecy, the whiff of shortcuts and sharp practice.The candidates are neck and neck here in Florida, bombarding each other with negative ads. It\u2019s hard to avoid them on TV: images of a vampirelike Mrs. Clinton, or Mr. Trump slinging insults at women. \u201cI can\u2019t wait till this is all over,\u201d my Uber driver says.Before the candidate arrives, a few of her supporters wilt under the scorching sun and are carried out for first aid. What strikes me among the older supporters is the intensity of their animus toward Mr. Trump. He is, one man tells me, \u201cpure evil.\u201d Nancy Perkins, 64, a retired nurse, says she has unfriended every Trump supporter on Facebook: \u201cI don\u2019t need people like that in my life.\u201dThe warm-up act is Alicia Machado, the onetime Miss Universe who became an election argument when it emerged that Mr. Trump had once called her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping.\u201d Now the Clinton campaign has deployed her. Her voice quivers as she recounts how he called her ugly.\u201cHe\u2019s the ugly one!\u201d yells a man in a wheelchair at the back of the crowd. \u201cMonster!\u201dMuch has changed since Timothy Crouse wrote \u201cThe Boys on the Bus,\u201d his gritty account of covering the 1972 presidential campaign, and it\u2019s not just Twitter\u2019s replacing typewriters. Today, most of the full-time Clinton correspondents are women, so testosterone levels have fallen, too.Unlike Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton travels on the same plane as the press. But it\u2019s a distinction without a difference: She is ensconced behind a curtain near the nose.That\u2019s new; only a few weeks ago, when the polls showed her with a comfortable lead, Mrs. Clinton sometimes strolled back to field questions. But then the F.B.I. email scandal hit. Polls tightened. Mrs. Clinton dispatched her aides to press the press.Here, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s focus is Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude toward immigration. She talks about what his \u201cdark and divisive vision\u201d would mean for blacks, Mexicans and Muslims. \u201cImagine what it would be like to have him in the most powerful office in the world on Jan. 20,\u201d she says.Mrs. Clinton, who was born in the suburbs of Chicago, is watching on an iPad and cheering for the Cubs, who haven\u2019t won the championship in 108 years. On the press bus, the Twitter messages and filing of stories have halted; reporters crowd over the dim glow of a laptop where someone has managed to stream a live feed.The bus erupts in cheers when the Cubs clinch the title with a final out. Mrs. Clinton allows herself to celebrate, holding aloft the Cubs\u2019 W flag \u2014 for \u201c win\u201d \u2014 as she is no doubt hoping to do for herself in a few days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Puts Slack in Cross Hairs With New Office Chat App", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byREDMOND, Wash. \u2014 In the last couple of years at Microsoft, some old habits have been tossed away, like obsessively placing Windows software at the center of all the company\u2019s big bets. But the company would still dig trenches to protect Office, its $23-billion-a-year software franchise.Microsoft on Wednesday took the wraps off Microsoft Teams, an addition to the Office package that will allow professionals to huddle virtually with colleagues in private chat rooms to talk about anything from work projects to where to get lunch.If you think Microsoft Teams sounds a little like Slack, the relatively new chat service that has pulses pounding among Silicon Valley investors and customers, you would be correct.In fact, if this were 1997, a more bellicose time at Microsoft, people inside the company would be whispering that the new application was a Slack killer. But the tone is different these days, even if the intent is essentially the same.\u201cLook, my job No. 1 is to make sure that the 85 million users I have on Office 365, we go meet their needs and keep growing that base,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference room last week on the Microsoft campus. \u201cThis is not to take away any success anyone else has. We\u2019ve always had lots of tools out here that have competed and also coexisted.\u201dMicrosoft Teams is the most significant new addition in years to Office 365, the current name of the Microsoft software suite, which has over the years migrated from the PC to become a product delivered over the internet that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other applications. Bill Gates, a Microsoft co-founder and now technology adviser, even had a hand in its creation.The reception to Microsoft Teams will help determine whether Mr. Nadella, who became chief executive of the company in early 2014, can extend his recent run of success.Microsoft plans to use distribution, an old standby, to get people using Microsoft Teams, bundling it with the business version of Office 365 at no additional cost.\u201cWe are orders of magnitude bigger in terms of the users we serve,\u201d said Rajesh Jha, executive vice president of Office Engineering at Microsoft.Customers generally pay $5 to $20 a month to subscribe to Office 365. Mr. Nadella\u2019s 85 million figure is the number of active monthly business users of the software.\u201cThat\u2019s where Microsoft has an inherent advantage around security,\u201d Mr. Diwan said.\u201cThe moral of the story is if you\u2019re a large incumbent with many lines of business, it is incredibly difficult to take on a smaller, focused start-up that has traction in the market,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive of Slack, which took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on Wednesday welcoming Microsoft to the market.What\u2019s more, most people are using Slack because they want to, not because it is being shoved down their throats by a corporate I.T. department. Slack has been embraced by many as a more efficient way for teams to communicate than email, which is not designed for real-time conversations.Messages in Slack are archived and searchable, and people can use it on mobile devices and PCs. Mr. Butterfield said Slack had particularly helped create more transparency across boundaries inside companies, allowing, for example, marketing teams to see what sales staff are talking about and engineers to eavesdrop on product designers.In a demonstration last week at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters, executives showed how Microsoft Teams both resembles Slack and adds to its innovations. Like Slack, the software lets people pepper their messages with GIFs and emojis. There are also ways of connecting Microsoft Teams with other applications and services like Twitter and GitHub.The most noticeable difference is that Microsoft Teams organizes conversations into threads, grouping messages on the same topic to make conversations easier to follow than they are in Slack\u2019s unthreaded message streams. It has customizable tabs for making it simpler to get to commonly used services and files, like budget spreadsheets.Mira Lane, principal architect of Microsoft Teams, demonstrated how people could spontaneously start videoconferences inside the software if they would rather hash things out face to face. \u201cIt\u2019s a really low-friction way of having an ad hoc meeting,\u201d Ms. Lane said.Mr. Butterfield of Slack said the service had plans to support both threaded conversations and videoconferencing in the future.Microsoft began working on Microsoft Teams about 18 months ago, after Mr. Gates encouraged Brian MacDonald, a respected Microsoft engineer credited with creating Outlook, the company\u2019s flagship email application, to come up with a new take on productivity applications.\u201cWe\u2019d have pretty frequent conversations, sometimes group reviews, sometimes one-on-ones,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said. \u201cHe\u2019d send me big, long memos to consume. I\u2019d send him a few ideas back. It was great.\u201dMicrosoft does not always build a new product when it wants to expand the range of Office. About four years ago, it paid $1.2 billion to acquire Yammer, a social networking app that had found a following in the tech industry. So did Microsoft consider buying Slack?\u201cIt\u2019s not something that I looked at,\u201d Mr. Nadella said, adding that he did not know if others who work for him seriously considered it.Mr. Butterfield declined to say whether he was approached by anyone from Microsoft about a deal, but it would not have mattered if someone had. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been pretty clear publicly, and in private conversations with everyone else in the industry, that we have no interest in being acquired,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Rajesh Jha. He is executive vice president of Office Engineering, not corporate vice president. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a picture caption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters Take Anti-Trump Message to His Doorstep, and Plan Next Steps", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byThousands of demonstrators filled public squares, parks and streets in the country\u2019s three largest cities on Saturday to protest President-elect Donald J. Trump, part of a wave of dissent that has swelled since the presidential contest last week.They were transgender people, the children of immigrants, and parents toting infants on their back. They were families, students, and men and women of all ages and races. Many carried cardboard signs \u2014 \u201cShow the world what the popular vote looks like,\u201d read one, \u201cPutin Won,\u201d said another. As throngs marched through city streets, the participants joined in a cry of \u201cNot my president!\u201dIn one of the largest anti-Trump demonstrations since his election on Tuesday, a mass of people marched from Union Square in Manhattan to Trump Tower, the headquarters and home of Mr. Trump. Protesters marched around one of Mr. Trump\u2019s buildings in Chicago. In Los Angeles, thousands of people marched up Wilshire Boulevard, forming a crowd that stretched for nearly a dozen blocks.\u201cI\u2019m just doing my part in democracy,\u201d said Alfred Diaz, 25, who joined the protest in Los Angeles. \u201cI feel that this is a way for me to voice my opinion.\u201d\u201cI disagree with a lot of Trump\u2019s stances, so I\u2019m just out here practicing my rights,\u201d said Mr. Diaz, who was born in Los Angeles but whose family is from Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m unsure and I\u2019m unsatisfied.\u201dThe demonstrations followed a week of protests, as thousands of people have taken to the streets. Demonstrations have taken place in Oakland, Calif.; Baltimore; Kansas City, Mo.; Milwaukee; Miami; and Portland, Ore.Students have walked out of classes, protesters have blocked highways and demonstrators have clashed with the police. Speakers and protesters have talked about their fears of deportation, reduced access to to birth control, a rollback of same-sex marriage and the potential for racially motivated violence.\u201cWe need to protest what we believe to be a disturbing turn in politics this week,\u201d said Kimie Liu, 40, as she stood near Trump Tower in New York with her 14-month-old son, Kellan, strapped to her back. \u201cMy son is here because this is the future. Trump stands for so many things I find abhorrent, and we won\u2019t sit down when hate wins. We stand for what we believe in.\u201dThe demonstrations have mostly been organized on the fly by local activist groups, although national organizations like Showing Up for Racial Justice and the National Action Network have supported the protest efforts. The calls to participate have come largely through Facebook and other social media.In New York on Saturday, protesters were quick to describe their motivations for marching.Shak\u00e9 Topalian, 71, a child of Armenian immigrants, said she was fearful of a genocide like the one her parents had survived. \u201cI want to make sure that this does not happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cI refuse to be a bystander.\u201dThousands have turned out to protest in at least 52 cities across the United States in the days since the vote.Fin Justin Ross, 20, a transgender man from New Jersey, said he had woken up around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday to pick up friends for the rally. \u201cWhen Trump won, my first thought was I needed to go back into the closet,\u201d he said.Virginia Jimenez, 45, a Mexican-American from Long Island said she came to the protest to show that \u201cnot all Mexicans are bad people,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI raised three sons without asking for any handouts.\u201dLisa Harris, also of Long Island, spoke about her father, a Holocaust survivor. \u201cI know hate,\u201d she said.Many protest leaders had supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary race and either did not vote or chose a third-party candidate in the general election, said Ben Becker, an organizer with the Answer Coalition, an antiwar and antiracism activist group based in New York. Their anger, he said, had been exacerbated by the conciliatory tone shown to Mr. Trump by President Obama and Hillary Clinton after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat.More protests are planned for the coming days, and preparations already are underway for a large demonstration at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.It is uncharted territory for a modern American presidency. One would have to go back to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860 to see these types of widespread demonstrations in response to the election of a president, said Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian who teaches at Rice University in Houston.President Lincoln won only about 40 percent of the popular vote and was not even on the ballot in some Southern states. Spontaneous protests broke out across the country after the Lincoln victory, Professor Brinkley said.For many of the people who have turned out for the current protests, it has been a kind of group therapy, and already seem to be cementing new, cross-sectional liberal coalitions. People with \u201cNasty Women\u201d T-shirts have stood with signs that read \u201cClimate change is real.\u201d Black Lives Matter protesters have marched alongside those proclaiming themselves \u201cUndocumented and Unafraid.\u201dBut beyond the commotion in the streets, activists are pursuing strategies for what they think will be tumultuous times during a Trump administration.In Wisconsin, the Latino rights group Voces de la Frontera has scheduled forums to provide emotional support to Latinos and other minorities, and to brainstorm ways to help immigrants fight policies that might hurt them.Cat Brooks, a co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project in Oakland, said her group and other leaders in the city were planning to raise money to provide direct services for social programs they feel certain will be cut under a Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress. They were making plans, for example, to find ways to offer diabetes testing and counseling if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.Ron Gochez, an organizer with Uni\u00f3n del Barrio, an immigrants rights group in Los Angeles, said that it will gather community organizations to discuss what to do if mass deportations occur. It will also train undocumented immigrants to use their cellphone cameras if immigration enforcement agents show up at their door, and help people set up emergency phone lists so they can call neighbors if they are picked up for deportation proceedings.\u201cIt\u2019s not just saying that we\u2019re against Trump, we have to defend ourselves against the policies he\u2019s promising to create,\u201d he said.Leaders from several black civil rights groups like the National Action Network and the N.A.A.C.P. have been holding conference calls to form a legislative strategy, the Rev. Al Sharpton said.They plan to lobby Congress on criminal justice reform and expanding voting rights, highlighting what they believe are the negative effects of voter identification laws and reductions in early voting periods, Mr. Sharpton said. They hope to use the stories of millions of newly insured Americans to highlight the devastating consequences of repealing the Affordable Care Act. They will fight any new stop-and-frisk policies in court, Mr. Sharpton said, and bring witnesses to congressional hearings to challenge cabinet appointments they see as questionable.Their efforts will kick off with a rally and a march in Washington for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday, just days before Mr. Trump is inaugurated, Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go away and say, because we lost an election, that we, therefore, lost our right to stand up for civil rights and civil liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, in many ways, we feel is bigger than one election.\u201dAs the protest began to wane in Los Angeles, Jay Brown Jr., 42, surveyed the large group around him.\u201cIf you look around, there are a lot of families out here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should say something to you. People are trying to teach their kids what\u2019s acceptable.\u201dEli Rosenberg reported from New York; Jennifer Medina from Oakland, Calif.; and John Eligon from Kansas City, Mo.

{"Headline": "Just Dandy", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWordplayWEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 I do love a riddle, and Andrew Kingsley provides us with a classic one today, one purported to have no answer but with an interesting literary history.In addition, Mr. Kinsgley supplies us with one of the many answers that people have come up with over the years. When you consider that the riddle posed by the Mad Hatter in Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d was written in 1865, it comes as no surprise that readers have had a lot of time to write punch lines.The Mad Hatter admits that he has no answer to his own question, whereupon Alice rolls her preteen eyes and thanks him for totally wasting her time.And that is a fairly thin answer to the Hatter\u2019s riddle. Others came up with better and more succinct punch lines, like the one in today\u2019s puzzle.This is what we call a quip theme, where a quotation or in this case, a riddle, is written into the grid based on the clues, which tell the solver where to start and end. We don\u2019t see a lot of them in The New York Times Crossword, because the standards for cleverness are fairly high and the quips must also be able to be broken up into lines that scan well. Unfortunately, most people who utter quips never take into consideration the poor puzzle constructor, so these themes are rare.Today, the riddle question is broken into two parts:18A: WHY IS A RAVEN LIKE23A: A WRITING DESKAnd the answer offered by a solver who is now lost to history is:45A: BECAUSE POE WROTE50A: ON BOTH OF THEM\u25a0 12A: Pro tip: If you see a clue that says you should be thinking about a word that is \u201clike\u201d something and you\u2019ve never heard of that thing, odds are good that the answer will be RARE.\u25a0 44A: Thankfully no longer being clued as a woman\u2019s leg, a GAM is the word for a group of whales.\u25a0 49A: I had to think about this one, but think of it like a foreign language clue: if the clue indicates that the answer belongs to a certain period of time (how far back do transistor radios go?), the answer should probably be from that period of time. I wasn\u2019t familiar with the term TEENER, but it\u2019s apparently bygone slang for \u201cteenager.\u201d\u25a0 6D: LANA Del Rey released the album \u201cUltraviolence\u201d in 2014.Sometime in the days of yoreWhen themeless puzzles had become quite a boreI groped for a theme which would prove not a snore;Yet nothing came rapping at my vacant mind\u2019s door.Tired of waiting for a fancy to spore,I selected a tome from some worn-out bookstore.Full of whimsy and wit and nonsense galoreIt quickly became a story adored.Now Charles Lutwidge Dodgson \u2014 Lewis Carroll to youWas a tinkerer with words and puzzling guru.Yet there was one puzzle he Mad-Hatterly posedWhose solution no one has yet to suppose.So I leave it to you, my frabjous scores,To decipher the cipher Mad Carroll once sworeTo leave rejoindered by readersNevermore.Alrighty then.

The next president made his name in real estate in Manhattan.The next president began his campaign at his New York City skyscraper, cast his vote at a nearby public school and celebrated his victory at a Midtown hotel.And the next president lost at the polls in all those places on Tuesday. New Yorkers overwhelmingly voted against Donald J. Trump, one of their own, went home and woke up with him as the winner.Feelings of hometown pride in the Republican nominee\u2019s victory were generally absent on Wednesday, the city\u2019s mood framed by a shawl of gray clouds.\u201cI don\u2019t think any New Yorkers slept,\u201d said Maye Le\u00f3n, 39, a hair stylist in East Harlem.The feeling of loss was magnified by the shock of it, not just for New Yorkers but for all those who voted for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and believed her victory was a sure bet, even as the sun set and polls closed on Tuesday. That her victory proved to be an illusion, so much smoke, left many \u2014 mainly in New York, along the East Coast and on the West Coast \u2014 wondering how they could have gotten it so wrong. Were they that locked in an echo chamber of the like-minded?\u201cI never even considered the possibility that Hillary would lose,\u201d said Shirley Wu, 26, a student at New York University. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know a single person voting against her.\u201dAs a construction worker, Eve Galarza, 39, put it: \u201cThey elected him. It says a whole lot about America.\u201d As if that were some strange land.Michael Moran, 65, an artist who used to live near the former home of Mr. Trump\u2019s family in Jamaica Estates, Queens, said the surprise of the result depressed him. \u201cI feel funny about the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel out of touch.\u201dThe last New Yorker to be elected president rode \u201ca political cataclysm, unprecedented in the nation\u2019s history,\u201d according to The New York Times the next day. That was in 1932, and his name was Franklin Delano Roosevelt.On Wednesday in New York, the new political cataclysm felt to many not homegrown but like something that started someplace else and washed up here.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the country as well as I thought I did,\u201d said Tristan Chirico, 32, a student in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. \u201cI feel gaslit, like I\u2019m going crazy. I can\u2019t fathom how this is possible.\u201dAnother Crown Heights resident, Alison Benko, 23, said, \u201cI felt like I woke up and my country was stolen.\u201d And yet, it was not. For all the talk of a \u201crigged election,\u201d there has not been a hint of impropriety regarding the actual voting. What was actually stolen, perhaps, was a portrait of the country that many people carried.\u201cNew York City is liberal, and I think people weren\u2019t seeing beyond that,\u201d said Rosalie Kaufman, 71, at a museum in Mr. Roosevelt\u2019s former home on East 65th Street in Manhattan. \u201cThey saw what they wanted to see.\u201dShe added: \u201cI love New York. I will always live here, but it doesn\u2019t represent the United States.\u201dA student at Hunter College, Hector Lorenzo, 34, of Washington Heights, leaned on a wrought-iron fence outside the 32nd president\u2019s former home and considered the election of the 45th.\u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d he said of the results. \u201cI guess you figure there will be some division in the country. But this is more widespread, and scarier, than I thought it was.\u201dLike many, Holly Rilinger, 42, a fitness trainer in Manhattan, posted about the election on Facebook: \u201cI woke up more upset with how blind-sided I feel,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHow insulated I have allowed myself to become. How in the world have I become so completely disconnected from the rest of the country? I have mid-western roots.\u201dKristina Blaine, 36, from Rego Park, Queens, saw both sides of the election within her own family, spread around New York, Ohio and Florida. She visited Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday holding a sign that read: \u201cSome of my family voted for Trump. I am sorry America.\u201d She regretted not trying to change minds: \u201cInstead of rocking the boat with my family, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI could have done more.\u201dEarly in the presidential campaign, Ted Cruz\u2019s derogatory accusation that Mr. Trump was a symbol of \u201cNew York values\u201d was roundly mocked in the city itself. Now, with his victory, Mr. Trump, for better or worse, really is the face of New York in the White House, a born-and-raised son of the city representing the nation to the rest of the planet.New Yorkers reflected on his New York values, some with praise. \u201cIn this city, you have to be respectful of everyone,\u201d said Luis Estrella, 63, from Elmhurst, Queens. \u201cHe\u2019s from New York, so I think he\u2019s going to be tolerant of everyone, even though he has said the opposite. That\u2019s just noise.\u201dRafael Gonzales, 66, of Washington Heights, said he had jumped up and hugged his television when the election swung Mr. Trump\u2019s way and shouted, \u201cS\u00ed, muchacho!\u201d\u201cHe was born here and who are you if you don\u2019t do something for your people?\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do well because New Yorkers get along with everybody.\u201dOthers suggested the new New Yorker in Washington would not be representative of his roots, but more of a city caricature.\u201cHe\u2019s always so negative, always criticizing everything,\u201d said Margie Rivera, 61, who lives in East Harlem. \u201cThat\u2019s not New York.\u201dEnissia Rivera, 23, speaking near Trump Tower, twisted it the other way. \u201cHe\u2019s not a New Yorker,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes morals, and he doesn\u2019t have any.\u201dMarcin Perkowski, a foreman at a hotel construction site in Manhattan \u2014 a job seemingly near and dear to the president-elect \u2014 suggested it was too soon to pass judgment.\u201cI think we will see after four years,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now it\u2019s been less than 24 hours and nothing has changed.\u201dAnd yet, for many, everything had.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a foreman at a hotel construction site in Manhattan.

So, what are the Trump voters in Florida thinking, and where does this movement \u2014 or whatever we should call it \u2014 go after Tuesday?As at any Trump rally, the merchandising opportunities outside the Sarasota event were plentiful. A man wearing a Trump flag as a cape walked down the line of attendees, towing a wagon filled with water bottles. \u201cIce cold Trump water here! Tastes like freedom!\u201d he said. Another man selling foam fingers called out, \u201cGive Hillary the finger \u2014 vote Trump!\u201d A supporter constructed a life-size \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d made out of interwoven cardboard boxes. A woman stood inside the basket and posed for a photo, giving an enthusiastic thumbs-up.Outside the arena, Cathy Borden, a retired Navy recruiter, said everyone she talks to is voting for Mr. Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t go by those polls.\u201dDave Kraft, in line with his wife, Ruth, wrestled with this dissonance. \u201cHow could he lose, if you look at Facebook?\u201dNo matter what happens on Election Day, the Republican Party will be stuck in a bind of its own making. The Trump contingency is powerful enough to control the party, but not powerful enough to put a Republican in the White House on its own. The more the party caters to its base, the deeper the G.O.P.\u2019s 2013 autopsy report gets buried under a pile of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d signs.Janice Gaddy was standing in front of the Krafts in line with her two granddaughters. She said she\u2019s not just disgusted by Mrs. Clinton (\u201cI hate that woman. She is evil\u201d), but extremely disappointed by the Republican leadership. Ms. Gaddy was exasperated by everyone from Senator Ted Cruz, whom she supported in this year\u2019s Republican primary, to Mitt Romney (\u201cIf I could take my vote back, I would\u201d) and Megyn Kelly (\u201cShe should just go away\u201d) for not supporting the Republican nominee wholeheartedly.She also expressed frustration at Republicans in Congress for not going far enough to block President Obama\u2019s agenda.\u201cWhat have they done?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe gave them a Republican Senate and we gave them a Republican Congress, and they have let Obama do everything that he wanted.\u201dMs. Kraft called Paul Ryan a \u201ctraitor,\u201d and said she might leave the Republican Party after this election. Her husband said Mr. Romney didn\u2019t support Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid because he was \u201cjealous\u201d of his success.\u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican, you\u2019re part of a team,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta support everybody.\u201dWhile the race in Florida remains tight, some Trump supporters could be in for a rude awakening on Tuesday night. More than 6.4 million Floridians have already cast their votes. And, going by the data, Hispanic voters are poised to make up a powerful share of the electorate in ways they didn\u2019t in 2012. More Hispanic voters have already cast their ballots in the early voting period than in the entire 2012 election.\u201cSomething has aroused Hispanics to register and vote in 2016, and it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to know what that is,\u201d he told me.But not all Hispanic-Americans, of course, will vote against Mr. Trump and for a Democrat this year, especially among Florida\u2019s Cuban-American population. In 1961, Cristina Dawson and her family fled Cuba to the United States as political refugees. She was at the Trump rally on Monday with her cousin, who had come to the United States on the same plane from Cuba.Ms. Dawson said she felt \u201capprehensive\u201d about the election\u2019s results. \u201cThere\u2019s so much voter fraud,\u201d she said, shaking her head.Maria Chambers, Ms. Dawson\u2019s cousin, said the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency reminds her of the dictatorship of Fidel Castro.\u201cWe already lost a country, and we\u2019re on the verge of losing another,\u201d she said.In the middle of his rally in Sarasota on Monday, Mr. Trump spotted his own face in the crowd: a Donald Trump mask. An audience member passed the mask up to the podium, and he held it up beside his own, slightly less cartoonish visage. \u201cIs there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?\u201d he asked, and the crowd roared its approval. He grinned widely. Mr. Trump, and the people who have grown to love him over the past year and a half \u2014 who have stood steadfastly by him as he\u2019s weathered attack after attack, and emerged victorious every time \u2014 were having the time of their lives.But unfortunately for Mr. Trump and his supporters, all good fun must come to an end. Their hero ends his speech, waves goodbye, and after one final thumbs-up, disappears behind a velvet curtain flanked by Secret Service officers. The crowd files out of the gymnasium to the strains of the Rolling Stones. Leftover signs and empty popcorn tubs litter the floor. The reporters roll on to the next campaign stop, the merchandise tents get packed up and one by one, the cars pull out of the parking lot until it is empty. Up in the sky, Mr. Trump is already flying toward his next adoring crowd.Advertisement"}

He is also considering Harold Ford Jr., an African-American former Democratic representative from Tennessee, for transportation secretary or another post, though that process has not yet become serious, a Trump official said.Interviewed on Tuesday on the Fox News program \u201cYour World With Neil Cavuto,\u201d Mr. Carson said the president-elect had offered him multiple positions in his cabinet. Asked specifically about the housing job, he replied, \u201cI would say that it was one of the offers on the table.\u201dMr. Carson\u2019s job prospects had gotten somewhat lost in the recent flurry of speculation about key national security positions, as well as his own misgivings about his qualifications. But on Tuesday, Mr. Carson thrust himself back into the spotlight, with an assist from Mr. Trump.In recent days, Mr. Trump has broadened the list of people he is consulting to include Michelle Rhee, a former District of Columbia schools chancellor; Representative Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii Democrat who is the first Hindu member of Congress; and Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, an Indian-American. Mr. Ford, with whom he has not yet met, is a regular commentator on the MSNBC show \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d whose host, Joe Scarborough, Mr. Trump regularly calls for advice.So far, however, his picks have consisted of five white men: Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist in the White House, Reince Priebus as chief of staff, Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser, and Representative Mike Pompeo as director of the C.I.A. Mr. Trump is also rumored to be close to naming Gen. James N. Mattis as secretary of defense.While not as vocal as other supporters like Rudolph W. Giuliani or Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Mr. Carson has been a steadfast backer of Mr. Trump. He went on television to defend him after the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which Mr. Trump spoke about groping women.But his last job was as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University, and he has little background in housing. In the Fox interview, Mr. Carson cited his childhood in Detroit and his experience treating inner-city patients as qualifications for the job.A single day at Trump Tower in Manhattan provides a view of potential cabinet members and staff in the next administration.\u201cI grew up in the inner city,\u201d he said, \u201cand have spent a lot of time there and have dealt with a lot of patients from that area and recognize that we cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities, and we have to get beyond the promises and start really doing something.\u201d\u201cYou know, our inner cities are in terrible shape, and they definitely need some real attention,\u201d Mr. Carson continued. \u201cYou know, there have been so many promises made over the last several decades, and nothing has been done, so it certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine, and I\u2019ll be thinking and praying about it seriously over the holiday.\u201dMr. Carson\u2019s remarks were a striking reversal from last week, when a friend of his said he had turned down an offer from Mr. Trump to be secretary of health and human services, citing his lack of experience in running a vast federal bureaucracy.The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, had 8,416 employees and an annual budget of $32.6 billion as of 2014.On his own Facebook page, Mr. Carson has said he would prefer to remain an outside adviser to Mr. Trump.\u201cMy decision not to seek a cabinet position in the Trump administration has nothing to do with the complexity of the job, as is being reported by some news outlets,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cI believe it is vitally important for the Trump administration to have many outspoken friends and advisers who are outside of the Washington bubble.\u201dThe relationship between Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump has had its ups and downs. Before the primaries, when Mr. Carson was riding high in the polls, Mr. Trump accused his rival of having a \u201cpathological temper.\u201d He based his accusation on a passage in \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d Mr. Carson\u2019s autobiography, in which he described having a strong temper and said that when he became angry, \u201cI grabbed the nearest brick, rock or stick to bash someone.\u201dDuring the debates, however, Mr. Trump generally spared Mr. Carson the cutting remarks he aimed at Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Later, when Mr. Carson endorsed Mr. Trump, he conceded that it was difficult to reconcile the bombastic figure on the trail with what he described as a more thoughtful person behind closed doors.\u201cThere\u2019s the one you see on the stage,\u201d Mr. Carson said, \u201cand there\u2019s the one who\u2019s very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

He declined to specify what those provisions were but said that they had been conveyed to the organization.Dr. Naik has also refused to renounce Osama bin Laden as a terrorist.Dr. Naik is often evasive when questioned over his more inflammatory statements, including one that supported suicide attacks. In a news conference in Mumbai in July, in which he appeared by videoconference from Saudi Arabia, he said that suicide attacks in which innocent people were killed were un-Islamic, but that the use of the tactic was justified in war.Peace TV has been banned in Bangladesh, and Indian satellite channels have refused to carry it, but Dr. Naik\u2019s sermons still have a large audience in India and abroad.At the July news conference in Mumbai, he denied supporting terrorist activities and said that he did not encourage the Dhaka attacks.In past years, the Indian police have registered cases against Dr. Naik over objectionable speeches he has made, the local news media reported.At the conference in July, however, Dr. Naik said, \u201cNever ever in my full life have I been called for investigation.\u201dDr. Naik said that one of his videotaped speeches that was used as the basis for one of the cases filed in India was \u201cdoctored,\u201d and \u201cbecause of the clip, many of the Hindus were hurt and I said that I apologize for hurting their feelings.\u201dThe Islamic Research Foundation was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Detains Leaders of Kurdish Opposition Party", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 The Turkish police detained the two co-leaders of Turkey\u2019s main Kurdish opposition party and several of its lawmakers on Friday during early-morning raids as part of a counterterrorism investigation, the state news media reported.The leaders, Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, were detained after police officers in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir and the capital, Ankara, raided their homes, according to officials from the party, known as the H.D.P.Simultaneous raids were carried out at the party\u2019s headquarters in Ankara, where at least nine of its members of Parliament were detained.The detentions on Friday appeared to be part of a wider crackdown on the party, Turkey\u2019s fourth-largest. The Turkish government has accused it of being the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a Kurdish militant group that renewed a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state last year after the breakdown of a two-year cease-fire.The H.D.P., which became Turkey\u2019s first pro-Kurdish party to enter Parliament last year when it won 59 out of 550 seats, denies links to Kurdish militants. It says that it seeks to promote a peaceful solution to the Kurdish conflict while defending the rights of Kurds.\u201cThe H.D.P. calls on the international community to react against Erdogan Regime\u2019s coup,\u201d the party said in a message posted on Twitter after the detentions of its members, referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Dozens of elected mayors have been detained or arrested on terrorism charges in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern region, more than 20 Kurdish news outlets have been shut down, and tens of thousands of Kurdish teachers have been dismissed from schools.As the raids continued on Friday, social media disruptions were reported across Turkey, with monitoring groups reporting difficulties reaching Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and WhatsApp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google and Facebook Take Aim at Fake News Sites", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOver the last week, two of the world\u2019s biggest internet companies have faced mounting criticism over how fake news on their sites may have influenced the presidential election\u2019s outcome.On Monday, those companies responded by making it clear that they would not tolerate such misinformation by taking pointed aim at fake news sites\u2019 revenue sources.Google kicked off the action on Monday afternoon when the Silicon Valley search giant said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service. Hours later, Facebook, the social network, updated the language in its Facebook Audience Network policy, which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites.\u201cWe have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \u201cOur team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\u201dBy Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to No. 2 in a search for those terms. Google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories.\u201cThe goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\u201d Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, we clearly didn\u2019t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\u201dFacebook\u2019s decision to clarify its ad policy language is notable because Mark Zuckerberg, the social network\u2019s chief executive, has repeatedly fobbed off criticism that the company had an effect on how people voted. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 percent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount is fake news and hoaxes.\u201cOver all, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.Facebook\u2019s ad policy update will not stem the flow of fake news stories that spread through the news feeds that people see when they visit the social network.Facebook has long spoken of how it helped influence and stoke democratic movements in places like the Middle East, and it tells its advertisers that it can help sway its users with ads. Facebook reaches 1.8 billion people around the globe, and the company is one of the largest distributors of news online. A Pew Research Center study said that nearly half of American adults rely on Facebook as a news source.Google\u2019s decision on Monday relates to the Google AdSense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers. More than two million publishers use Google\u2019s advertising network.\u201cMoving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher\u2019s content or the primary purpose of the web property,\u201d Ms. Faville said.Ms. Faville said that the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election.It remains to be seen how effective Google\u2019s new policy on fake news will be in practice. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake. Although satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is not clear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humorous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google\u2019s change.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a typical holiday toy ad except for one fact: Lili has Down syndrome.Millennials \u201cexpect to see a broad cross-section of families, couples and individuals, including people who are developmentally disabled as a matter of truthfulness,\u201d said Bob Witeck, a former executive with the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton and a communications strategist in Washington, D.C., who tracks ad spending.Teresa Gonzalez Ruiz, the vice president for brand marketing at Fisher-Price, said that the company began using child models with Down syndrome last year in response to the increasing diversity of its global customer base.\u201cThe consumer mind-set has really changed,\u201d she said. \u201cMillennials are so in tune with causes. The biggest shift I\u2019ve seen as a marketer is that in the past three to five years of talking to moms, they care about the product but they also really want to know where the company stands.\u201dDown syndrome, a chromosomal condition, carries physical traits including flat facial features, a small nose and an upward slant to the eyes. Parents of children with Down syndrome say it\u2019s about time advertisers noticed the distinctive beauty of people with the condition.\u201cMy goal is simply to raise awareness that these kids can be models, too, and then the world sees them,\u201d said Meagan Nash of Buford, Ga., whose 15-month-old son, Asher, has Down syndrome and will soon be modeling for the OshKosh children\u2019s clothing line.But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for a child or an adult with Down syndrome to land a modeling job. Ms. Nash waged a social media campaign over the summer to have Asher considered to model for OshKosh. She said she submitted his pictures for a casting call but was told they weren\u2019t included in the final round because the retailer hadn\u2019t specifically asked for child models with special needs.After she posted a picture of her son and told the story on Facebook, her story went viral. Photos of Asher hamming it up on a couch during a private photo shoot have appeared in social media feeds as far away as Spain. The story made its way back to OshKosh, which said in a statement that it wasn\u2019t the company that turned Asher down but rather the talent agency. OshKosh invited Asher to a photo shoot for the company\u2019s holiday ad campaign.Ms. Nash said the fact that Asher has Down syndrome is not going to be the first thing people notice when they see the ad.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to say, \u2018Oh, that boy has Down syndrome.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to say, \u2018Look at that jacket the boy is wearing in the ad.\u2019\u201dPeople with Down syndrome have been featured in acting roles, albeit in small numbers, on popular television shows. Many say it began with Corky, the character played by Chris Burke on \u201cLife Goes On,\u201d the first television series to regularly feature someone with Down syndrome. The show, which premiered in 1989, was seen as groundbreaking.But from there, advocates say it\u2019s been a long, slow road toward the Fisher-Price ad, fashion runways and other milestones.\u201cWe focus on what a smart business decision it is to include people with disabilities in advertisements,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cYou are essentially leaving a lot of money on the table, otherwise.\u201dIzzy Bradley, a 4-year-old from Stillwater, Minn., who has Down syndrome, has appeared in three Target ads in the last three years, and has another in the works. Her mother, Heather Bradley, said the ads simply feature her child playing with toys and don\u2019t \u201cdraw attention to the fact that she has Down syndrome.\u201dA spokeswoman for Target, Jenna Reck, said the use of children with Down syndrome in its advertising is part of a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d on the part of the chain\u2019s creative team to reach out to various communities within its customer base.\u201cIt does not happen on a whim,\u201d Ms. Reck said. \u201cTarget always wants to reflect its customers. As society changes and people\u2019s views change, Target reflects that in its advertising, including using models with disabilities and Down syndrome.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more than a clothes model,\u201d Karrie told her mother. \u201cI\u2019m a role model!\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled one of the surnames of the vice president for brand marketing at Fisher-Price.

{"Headline": "Deprivation: A Childhood in 1960s Hungary", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byFictionBy the time Szilard Borbely\u2019s parents were robbed, his mother beaten to death on Christmas Eve, in 2000 (his father, also beaten, was to survive for six more years), he had written a variety of books \u2014 poems, essays, studies, operas \u2014 but he was chiefly known as a poet with a good many prizes and awards behind him. The last book of poems he finished before that time, \u201cBerlin-Hamlet,\u201d had to wait three years for publication. The prose work \u201cThe Dispossessed\u201d \u2014 it is self-defined as a novel, but one can hardly call it fiction or precisely a memoir \u2014 appeared in 2013 and took the country by storm, topping practically every list for Book of the Year. The only book after that was the 2014 edition of another volume of poems, \u201cHalotti Pompa\u201d (\u201cThe Splendor of Death,\u201d first published in 2004), which he had written partly as a response to his mother\u2019s death. But he himself was dead by then, having taken his own life in February.No point in leaping to conclusions. We have long learned to draw a line between lives and works, and the treacherousness of the literary first-person singular has been exposed time and again. Quite right too, we might say, nor is the identification of the two in Borbely\u2019s work to be taken for granted \u2014 yet they both cannot help informing each other in a peculiarly intense way.Even so, there would be little of necessarily literary value in accounts of and reflections on a personal tragedy, unless the work amounted to something more. Borbely\u2019s work is far more. The personal tragedy does not remain personal: It is, in his case, a crystallization of the human condition under stress, a process that had begun in Borbely\u2019s work before the murders, and one that was immediately linked in his mind with Christianity, Judaism, the struggle with historical poverty, and an understanding of human helplessness and violence.The theme of deprivation forms the bedrock of \u201cThe Dispossessed,\u201d and to the general reader its conditions will seem shockingly primitive, though as Borbely himself said in a late interview, his deprivation was nothing compared with those of the Roma in his small village. We are not in \u201cAngela\u2019s Ashes\u201d territory, still less in the land of misery memoir. We are in a remote corner of Hungary not far from Romania in the 1960s. World War II has come and gone, and its survivors, both Jews and soldiers of the fascist regime, have returned to vastly changed lives. These are post-Stalinist, post-1956 uprising times, but the Stalinist party is still the dominant power in the village, and both the death of Stalin and the failure of the revolution have passed the village by. This is where the young narrator lives with his mother, father and big sister. The father is brutal, helpless and increasingly defeated; the mother is brutal, helpless and contemptuous of those she regards as peasants; the children are often unruly and often beaten. Nevertheless, they are united with the mother by love.The richness, inventiveness, the sheer graphic quality of the language, beautifully rendered by the translator Ottilie Mulzet, takes the fierce and often obscene terms of the village and offers them to us as a form of luminosity. It\u2019s not a trick. It\u2019s not fake religiosity. It is, and we accept it as, life. We could perhaps describe it as dirty realism were it not for the variety of voices within it, in longer passages where individuals speak of some mysterious historical semi-magical event, or in those where the attention is on the sheer fascination of natural detail. The book is not a single text: It is a compound.Nor is there clear narrative progression. The book is composed of short passages that move to and fro in time, in which the developing theme of belonging and outsiderness takes on different facets. Key among these facets is the question of the father, who is regarded by the rest of the village as suspiciously Jewish. Only one real Jew remains in the place, a Holocaust survivor, who has been reduced to a despised odd-job-man status. Anti-Semitism runs through the village like foul water, unthinking, freely articulated, always available. The narrator is bullied as a Jew because of his father. The Jew is \u201cthe yellow egg on the underside of the potato leaf. .\u2008.\u2008. People crush them between their nails, like lice.\u201d The phrase \u201cto pay the Jew\u201d means to defecate.But this is not a book about being Jewish. It is, rather, an account of presences, of the family circle at the core of it, the extended family making frequent visits and the rest of the village spreading like an ancient sore that is unlikely ever to be cured. Loss and lack of love lie at the heart of it.As does God, whose name is seldom invoked without obscenity. But it is not God who is being cursed: God is invited to do the cursing. Small creatures perish and endure lives of filth and cruelty in this corner of God\u2019s earth. People may curse in God\u2019s name, but he is everywhere, casting a divine glow over the place. He, a suffering crucified God, is in the language without ever announcing himself. \u201cIt was during this time that the angel might have arrived, when the flesh of the downy plum grows firm under its blue skin. Drops of dew ran down it in the early autumn morning. Whoever touches this pale transparent layer leaves a trace with his fingers upon it.\u201d All is marked and traced. The events in the book happen a long time before the murder of Borbely\u2019s parents, but murder is latent throughout.\u201cBerlin-Hamlet,\u201d the book of poems, is a different matter. It consists of a sequence of letters, fragments, allegories and locations and is part memory, part desire to meet someone. The whole is a closely packed series of dreamlike meditations. There is an implied dramatic context and a narrator, speaking in the first person, who longs and reflects and relates himself to a notional \u201cyou,\u201d with whom an intense but fleeting connection had once been established. The narrator is isolated, living under the skin of a perceived state of affairs that he sees, as through a mirror, with painful clarity.That shade hovers in a space that we, in retrospect, may read as antechamber to \u201cThe Dispossessed.\u201d \u201cThe Dispossessed\u201d is the soil of the past, \u201cBerlin-Hamlet\u201d the urban space of the present, where consciousness of the soil has to make some kind of temporary dwelling. It is a beautiful, authoritative book, again translated by Mulzet.After Borbely\u2019s death, Laszlo Krasznahorkai, whose work has a certain affinity with Borbely\u2019s in prose, wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cDear Szilard, I did not understand you. I loved you.\u201d If there is a line of literary succession, it might, in Borbely\u2019s case, include Zola\u2019s \u201cGerminal,\u201d Kosinski\u2019s \u201cThe Painted Bird,\u201d Andrei Platonov\u2019s \u201cSoul\u201d and Krasznahorkai\u2019s own \u201cSatantango.\u201d It might seek visual parallels in Bosch and Brouwer. But these are various independent works, and they don\u2019t constitute a tradition as such. What is clear is \u201cThe Dispossessed\u201d is a great sui generis book that, for all its cultural differences, touches us deeply. We recognize it as tragic, truthful and visionary wherever we are.George Szirtes is a poet and translator. His most recent book is \u201cMapping the Delta.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Trolled Us All. We Should Learn From It.", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFor more than a year, Americans were glued to their smartphones as Donald J. Trump tweeted and retweeted misogynistic, racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic speech. It was not a strategy that any digital campaign expert would ever advise. Often, it felt more like a reality-show stunt than a real campaign.But it worked. And the result is very real. Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox social media campaign helped him beat more than a dozen other candidates, enjoy free media coverage that would have cost billions, become a major-party nominee and win the presidency.While we Democrats reject his message, we must learn from his tactics if our party is to evolve and protect our priorities from a Trump presidency and Republican Congress. Democratic campaigns must stop looking at social media as a one-way communication device for amplifying overproduced campaign messages. The true power of social media for politicians is unleashed only if they use it to make emotional connections.No amount of digital savvy will take you across the finish line if you don\u2019t have a message that resonates. This year, many voters were angry and felt left behind by a political system and an economy that favor the wealthy and well connected. Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign my company worked on, heard this anger, and offered a message of political revolution to overhaul a rigged system that found wide online support. Unfortunately, in the end, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign message didn\u2019t offer these voters what they were looking for.Mr. Trump did hear them, though \u2014 giving them something dark and divisive in response. Mr. Trump\u2019s unlikely rise to the top of the Republican ticket was fueled by voters who felt they weren\u2019t being heard by party elites. As I watched the Republican primary unfold, I saw a party that had created an opening by failing to listen and engage with its base. Mr. Trump filled that space.For those who struggle to find their authentic voice online, newer technology has made it easier than ever to get real. Imagine if Mrs. Clinton had ditched the script, the teleprompter and the overproduced videos and posted a cellphone video telling America that she was fired up on an issue. That she was mad and going to stand and fight. And that this fight was personal. If you use it right, social media can give people insight into not only how you think, but how you feel.Instead, the Clinton campaign too often chose gimmicks over real heartfelt messages. Contests to have dinner with celebrities, talking to us in emoji, and hashtag campaigns like #ImWithHer may have spoken to some of her supporters. But these campaigns failed to address the real pain and suffering in places like the industrial Midwest. These voters are on social media, too.There is no downtime for public figures on social media. Our president-elect is continuing to tweet and so should Democrats. Twitter keeps voters involved in the conversation, so politicians need to continue the conversation with them even when it\u2019s not election season. Don\u2019t build up a social media presence to tell voters your innermost thoughts and then stop talking to them the day after the election is over. That\u2019s a bad breakup.But engagement alone is not enough. Democrats need to use social media to disrupt the news cycle as well. Mr. Trump showed us that tweeting at 3 a.m. can change what everyone is talking about during the morning commute, for good or for bad.In future campaigns, Democrats will need to devote even more resources to social networks than they did in 2016. Misinformation spreads quickly on social media, and it\u2019s only going to get worse. More and more Americans are watching events unfold in their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat feeds rather than turning to news sites and candidate websites. Campaigns must correct the record with their own social media posts as well as have promoted posts and internet ads ready to go or suffer the tangled mess of thousands of falsehoods retweeted as uncontested facts.This is not the first election where we have seen hate speech emerge online. In 2007, I was the Obama campaign\u2019s external online director. I monitored more than a dozen social networks, setting rules for what was, or wasn\u2019t, appropriate for posts and comments. We were not going to allow anonymous internet bullies to dominate the conversation or spread lies about any of the candidates, even our opponents, on our social platforms. Our mission was to run these social networks like a modern version of the way a congressman\u2019s office communicates with constituents, using them to provide factual answers to every possible question about the campaign. The goal was to show voters we could have a conversation about the campaign without sexism, racism or other forms of bigotry.As the minority party in Congress and with a President Trump in the White House, Democrats will need to bring people together around issues with new ferocity. We need to make our case better, faster and more authentically than ever before. As evidenced by his loss in the popular vote, many Americans have had enough of Mr. Trump\u2019s antics. Our base is active and engaged, turning Mr. Trump\u2019s words against him with empowering hashtag campaigns, from #MuslimsReportStuff and #BadHombre to #NastyWoman.It\u2019s the job of Democratic leaders to now keep these voters engaged. Democrats can\u2019t wait until next election season to really talk to their constituents online. Do not cede ground to those who would build a campaign based on hate or entertainment value. So, Democrats, let\u2019s mourn our losses for another minute, then get online and tweet our hearts out, propose solutions and listen to what voters say.Advertisement"}

The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful.Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston; Chicago; Portland, Ore.; Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.A pro-Trump supporter, right, clashed with an anti-Trump protester at Lee Circle in New Orleans on Wednesday after the man on the left grabbed a Trump flag from a truck.In New York, crowds converged at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where the president-elect lives.They chanted \u201cNot our president\u201d and \u201cNew York hates Trump\u201d and carried signs that said, among other things, \u201cDump Trump.\u201d Restaurant workers in their uniforms briefly left their posts to cheer on the demonstrators.The demonstrations forced streets to be closed, snarled traffic and drew a large police presence. They started in separate waves from Union Square and Columbus Circle and snaked their way through Midtown.Loaded dump trucks lined Fifth Avenue for two blocks outside Trump Tower as a form of protection.Emanuel Perez, 25, of the Bronx, who works at a restaurant in Manhattan and grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, was among the many Latinos in the crowd.\u201cI came here because people came out to protest the racism that he\u2019s promoting,\u201d he said in Spanish, referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not scared for myself personally. What I\u2019m worried about is how many children are going to be separated from their families. It will not be just one. It will be thousands of families.\u201dProtesters with umbrellas beat a pi\u00f1ata of Mr. Trump, which quickly lost a leg, outside the building.The Police Department said on Wednesday night that 15 protesters had been arrested.Bianca Rivera, 25, of East Harlem, described Mr. Trump\u2019s election as something that was \u201cnot supposed to happen.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re living in a country that\u2019s supposed to be united, a melting pot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s exposing all these underground racists and sexists.\u201dElsewhere in the country, college students gathered in spontaneous marches and asked university leaders to schedule meetings to reflect on the results.There were similar protests at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles; University of California campuses in Berkeley, San Diego and Santa Barbara; Temple University, in Philadelphia; and the University of Massachusetts.High school students also walked out of classes in protest in several cities.As U.C.L.A. students made their way to classes on Wednesday, they talked about how to make sense of an outcome that had seemed impossible a day earlier.\u201cI\u2019m more than a little nervous about the future,\u201d said Blanca Torres, a sophomore anthropology major. \u201cWe all want to have conversations with each other, to figure out how to move forward. There\u2019s a whole new reality out there for us now.\u201dChuy Fernandez, a fifth-year economics student, said he was eager to air his unease with his peers.\u201cI\u2019m feeling sad with this huge sense of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said. The son of a Mexican immigrant, he said it was difficult not to take the outcome personally.\u201cWe\u2019re all just kind of waiting for a ticking time bomb, like looking around and thinking who will be deported,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the exact opposite of what most of us thought would happen.\u201d\u201cWe refuse to recognize Donald Trump as the president of the United States, and refuse to take orders from a government that puts bigots into power,\u201d the organizers wrote.\u201cWe have to make it clear to the public that we did not choose this man for office and that we won\u2019t stand for his ideologies.\u201dJennifer Medina and Stephanie Saul contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Officials Defend Integrity of Vote, Despite Hacking Fears", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byThe statement came as liberal opponents of Donald J. Trump, some citing fears of vote hacking, are seeking recounts in three states \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 where his margin of victory was extremely thin.A drive by Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, for recounts in those states had brought in more than $5 million by midday on Friday, her campaign said, and had increased its goal to $7 million. She filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday, about an hour before the deadline.In its statement, the administration said, \u201cThe Kremlin probably expected that publicity surrounding the disclosures that followed the Russian government-directed compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations, would raise questions about the integrity of the election process that could have undermined the legitimacy of the president-elect.\u201dThat was a reference to the breach of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system, and the leak of emails from figures like John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.\u201cNevertheless, we stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people,\u201d it added.In Michigan, Ms. Stein must wait for a Monday meeting of the state\u2019s Board of Canvassers to certify the results of the Nov. 8 balloting before filing for a recount. In Pennsylvania, where paper ballots are used only in some areas, election officials said that the deadline to petition for a recount had passed, but that a candidate could challenge the result in court before a Monday deadline.The recount efforts have generated pushback by experts who said it would be enormously difficult to hack voting machines on a large scale. The administration, in its statement, confirmed reports from the Department of Homeland Security and intelligence officials that they did not see \u201cany increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day.\u201dThe administration said it remained \u201cconfident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out.\u201d It added: \u201cAs a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.\u201dHowever, intelligence officials are still investigating the impact of a broader Russian \u201cinformation warfare\u201d campaign, in which fake news about Mrs. Clinton, and about United States-Russia relations, appeared intended to influence voters. Many of those false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik, two state-funded Russian sites.Those fake-news reports were widely circulated on social media, independent studies, including one set for release soon, have shown, sometimes in an organized fashion by groups that appear to have had common ownership. Individuals, conservative talk-show hosts and activists recirculated them, often not knowing, or apparently not caring, about the accuracy of the reports.But the misinformation effort is far from black-and-white. Many people who spread false news have no connections to any foreign power, including a man in Austin, Tex., who posted a Twitter message saying that paid protesters were being bused to an anti-Trump demonstration there. Though the report quickly went viral, the buses, it turned out, were there for a corporate conference.That single reference was enough to create a fake story suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was being treated for Parkinson\u2019s.The allegation was quickly shot down by several news organizations. It made little difference: Propaganda or Not, made up of former national security, intelligence and other professionals, and some workers at Google and other technology firms, concluded that it was reproduced tens of thousands of times, sometimes by botnets, and viewed millions of times.But it is not known whether that news was circulated under Russian government direction, or simply by Russian sympathizers, or Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents.The barrage of online efforts to influence the election this year has prompted broader concerns that similar attempts, directed by the Kremlin or its surrogates, could now be focused on elections next year in Germany and France. The goal, intelligence officials and outside experts fear, is to undermine the cohesiveness of the Western alliance, particularly NATO members, by calling into question the validity of democratic elections.\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what the effects of the \u2018fake news\u2019 and other disinformation was,\u201d said Jason Healey, an expert on cyberconflict at Columbia University. \u201cIf they were able to influence in favor of Trump by one or two percentage points in some places, they will be encouraged to try again for the French and the Germans.\u201dThe efforts have also prompted debate inside Facebook and other social media firms about their responsibility to filter out false news. But doing so is a complex task, akin to editing a news operation, and it comes with complex political calculations: Once social media firms begin editing here to American standards, they will be under pressure from authoritarian regimes to do the same to their standards.In its statement, the administration focused chiefly on the threat of Russian manipulation of the vote on Election Day, not on the proliferation of propaganda and fake news.Ms. Stein, of the Green Party, acknowledged on Thursday in an interview with the PBS \u201cNewsHour\u201d that it was unlikely that recounts could change the results. Still, she said that \u201cthis was an election in which we saw hacking all over the place,\u201d and that \u201cat the same time, we have a voting system which has been proven to basically be wide open to hackers.\u201dTrip Gabriel contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Wish We All Could Be Californian", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Francisco \u2014 THIS is going to sound very California, but here goes: I drowned my election sorrows by surfing. It didn\u2019t help, but I was struck by something afterward. All my life, I\u2019ve seen strangers on California beaches \u2014 bearded bodysurfers drinking local Bourbon, Republican volleyball players eating vegan energy bars \u2014 trade warm glances that say, \u201cI salute your lifestyle choices and respect your privacy.\u201d After the election, those furtive nods implied nausea, terror and a compassion born of confidence that others felt much the same. Within that compassion, I sensed the emergence of something new in California public life: an awareness that we Californians are bound together as one people by the shared values of our increasingly tolerant and pluralistic society.Everybody knows by now that California tacked left on Election Day: 61.5 percent of our voters choose Hillary Clinton for president; we made Kamala Harris the first Indian-American (and second African-American woman) to be elected a United States senator; we reaffirmed overwhelming Democratic majorities in state politics; and we voted to legalize marijuana, ease parole for nonviolent criminals, raise taxes on cigarettes, extend income-tax increases on the wealthiest few, boost school spending, restore bilingual education, encourage the reversal of the Supreme Court\u2019s noxious Citizens United ruling and ban single-use plastic bags.The national outcome made our progressivism feel so threatened and precious that a pre-election video of Gov. Jerry Brown saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to build a wall around California to defend ourselves from the rest of this country\u201d went viral. He was joking, but the mental image helped us all see in physical terms \u2014 Pacific on one side, Sierra Nevada on the other \u2014 what has become obvious in cultural terms. Namely, that California is now both a place and a body politic apart.Secession goes by different names \u2014 Calexit, Califrexit \u2014 and there is a group called Yes California that aims to put an exit referendum on the 2019 ballot for all the obvious reasons. California, for example, pays many billions of dollars more in taxes annually than it gets back in federal spending and has every year since 1987, despite our own crumbling infrastructure and underfunded public schools. Then there\u2019s our relative impotence in shaping the federal government, given an Electoral College that makes one vote for president in Wyoming worth more than three in California, and the fact that Wyoming gets one United States senator for every 291,000 people, roughly speaking, while California gets one for every 19.2 million. Each of California\u2019s 53 congressmen have to represent over a hundred thousand people more than Cynthia Lummis, a Republican who is Wyoming\u2019s lone representative.On Election Day, Shervin Pishevar, the multimillionaire Uber investor and Hyperloop One co-founder, promised to bankroll a campaign \u201cfor California to become its own nation\u201d if Mr. Trump won. He moderated that position a week later with a tweet that advocated \u201ca new Federalism where state and local governments are empowered to determine their destinies while bonded together in a United States of America.\u201d Still, nearly everyone I know would vote yes tomorrow if we could secede peacefully and get security guarantees while we annex Oregon and Washington, join the Canadian health care system and claim Brooklyn in the same way that West Germany once claimed West Berlin.Then there is the joint statement released on Nov. 9 by the State Senate leader, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, and Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon: \u201cToday, we woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land, because yesterday Americans expressed their views on a pluralistic and democratic society that are clearly inconsistent with the values of the people of California. We have never been more proud to be Californians. By a margin in the millions, Californians overwhelmingly rejected politics fueled by resentment, bigotry and misogyny.\u201d They went on to call California a refuge of justice and opportunity \u201cfor people of all walks, talks, ages and aspirations \u2014 regardless of how you look, where you live, what language you speak, or who you love,\u201d and promised that, as they put it, \u201cWe will not be dragged back into the past.\u201dThis last bit matters because California\u2019s past is not pretty. The genocide of indigenous Californians was remarkable among North American Indian wars for its sheer scale and evil. California resentment of Chinese laborers in the Gold Rush mines and on the railroads helped produce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first federal law to restrict immigration by people of a specific ethnicity. During World War II, Californians incarcerated thousands of law-abiding American citizens of Japanese descent while leaving those of German and Italian descent unmolested.After that war ended, African-American migrants to California were surprised to find racist real-estate redlining and a virulent West Coast version of Jim Crow. Tim Watkins, president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Los Angeles, told me that his father was sent out here alone from Mississippi at age 13 because a lynch mob was after him. \u201cWhen my father got off a train in L.A., the first thing he saw was a \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign on a restaurant,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. \u201cWhen he married my mother, a white woman, he could not marry her here, so their marriage certificate is in espa\u00f1ol because they went down to old Mexico.\u201dThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped, but not enough to stop the violent Watts uprising of 1965 or the Rodney King riots of 1992, both of which expressed collective fury over systemic racism. As recently as 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, revived a flagging re-election bid by backing Proposition 187, which barred the state from providing public services to undocumented immigrants. Proposition 187 passed, but was never really implemented. According to Senator de Le\u00f3n, Wilson\u2019s re-election did for California what Mr. Trump\u2019s election and promised deportations might yet do for America: It woke up the Latino vote and ushered in the deep-blue politics that have since helped to legalize same-sex marriage, make Obamacare work, turn virtually the entire state into one big sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants and enact far-reaching climate-change regulations.Anyone who doubts that progressivism is good business has to reckon with the fact that California is now the sixth largest economy in the world, ahead of France, Russia and India, with $2.46 trillion in gross domestic product.It\u2019s not all sunshine, of course. California\u2019s $54 billion agriculture industry thrives on the exploitation of migrant workers, and our poverty rates and income inequality are among the nation\u2019s worst, thanks partly to a technology economy that makes millionaires in coastal cities but does little for the hinterlands except raise the cost of living. That helps explain why 3.7 million Californians \u2014 33 percent of the vote \u2014 chose Donald Trump and why California\u2019s electoral map resembles the national one, with red counties in the rural white interior and blue mostly on the coast.Many Californians are also casting a gimlet eye at the two big industries whose leaders talk a liberal game but sell products that arguably undermine civil society: entertainment and technology. In Los Angeles, that conversation includes movies and TV shows that, in the words of the actor and author Robinne Lee, \u201coften extend the perception that it\u2019s a white man\u2019s world and everyone else is just a guest star.\u201d In Silicon Valley the obvious culprits are Twitter, which has become a hate-speech superhighway, and Facebook and Google, both of which capture eyeballs by tailoring news feeds and search results to make us feel good. In so doing, and especially by supporting the mass dissemination of fake news and outright lies, they radically reinforce the biases that drive Americans into dangerously oppositional camps of red and blue.But the overwhelming \u2014 and novel \u2014 sentiment coming out of Nov. 8 remains one of common identity, which is remarkable in a place that is 38.8 percent Hispanic, 38 percent non-Hispanic white, 14.7 percent Asian and 6.5 percent African-American, and where just about everybody knows both steady churchgoers and at least one loving and stable family with two moms or two dads. Paola Martinez-Montes, director of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment in San Diego, says that California\u2019s African-American and Latino communities no longer see themselves as oppositional and that she has also been in touch with the A.C.L.U. and Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to understand that we are going to walk in this together, and that\u2019s really positive,\u201d she told me.Senator de Le\u00f3n, by the time I caught up with him, was on an airplane bound for a climate-change conference in Morocco.\u201cI\u2019m going to be mobbed \u2014 everybody is going to be asking me what the hell happened,\u201d he said by telephone, just before the plane took off. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t want to go our direction, we\u2019re going it alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Talks Beauty, Femininity and Feminism", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byHow have your feelings on makeup evolved?In general, the cultures that I know \u2014 Nigeria, the U.S., the U.K, Western Europe \u2014 all largely judge women quite harshly for appearances. But in Nigeria, there\u2019s a slight difference. There isn\u2019t much of a judgment if you\u2019re an accomplished woman and seem to care about your appearance.But I do remember that when I moved to the U.S. \u2014 and I think maybe there are different standards for people who are supposed to be particularly intellectual or particularly creative \u2014 I very quickly realized that if you want to seem as a serious writer, you can\u2019t possibly look like a person who looks in the mirror.Why do you think things that are associated with femininity, like fashion and beauty, are not taken seriously?It\u2019s about a culture that diminishes women. The things we traditionally think of as masculine are not things our culture dismisses as frivolous. Sports, for example, we think of as masculine. It\u2019s something that our culture takes quite seriously.I think it\u2019s part of a larger picture of a world that simply doesn\u2019t give women the same status that it gives men. There are many examples, and some have more serious consequences. All over the world, there is violence against women, and many cultures have ways of justifying it or minimizing it. But I think you can actually draw a line from that to other feminine pursuits that culture diminishes.Why did you finally decide to wear makeup, no matter what people thought?It\u2019s getting older. You realize there\u2019s very little time for rubbish. You realize life is short, and it\u2019s so much better to be who you are. When I was younger, I didn\u2019t have the sense of self to do that.But it\u2019s interesting because even when I didn\u2019t wear makeup in the U.S., I wore makeup in Nigeria because I wanted to look my age and not too young. In Nigeria, in particular, it was easy for men to dismiss what I said because they thought I looked like a small girl. I remember seeing a man at the airport after my first novel was published, and he looked at me, quite quizzical, and said, \u201cYou look like the writer.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m kind of her.\u201d His face fell. And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think the writer would be such a small girl.\u201d There was such disappointment on his face.At some point, I wanted to be who I am. And who I am is a person who enjoys, from time to time, putting a bright color on my lips.Women have choices to make. When you\u2019re not feeling good, you don\u2019t have the energy to do your face the way you usually do. I really respect Alicia Keys\u2019s choice not to wear makeup because she felt it was a mask. And she feels now that she\u2019s more truly herself. I think, \u201cAmen to that.\u201d If makeup feels that way for you, then don\u2019t do it. We have to allow women a multiplicity.Why do you think we don\u2019t?I think people will judge appearance. Humans are visual beings. We notice because we have eyes. What I would love to see changed is the baggage we bring to those judgments. When we see a man who\u2019s well dressed, we don\u2019t assume that he must be shallow or he must not be a serious person.Talking about men is helpful because we can then say, \u201cIf this woman who we are judging were male, and everything else stayed the same, would we judge her the same way?\u201d I think that would be a fair way to think of it.A lot of this is especially important to teenagers and women in their 20s. If you were speaking to this group directly, what would you say?There\u2019s no such thing as perfection. Originality is a beautiful thing. I think it\u2019s much harder now than when I was younger because we didn\u2019t really have the internet. I would say don\u2019t watch too many of those beauty YouTube or makeup videos. They use way too much product. There\u2019s a lot the industry can do. It\u2019s important to have a much wider range of what\u2019s considered beautiful.Why did you decide to attend the Dior show at Paris Fashion Week this fall?As a writer, I sort of think of myself as anthropologist. I thought I might be able to collect material. No, but I really went because I really admire the new Dior creative director. She\u2019s such an intelligent, thoughtful, interesting, honest woman. She\u2019s really just my kind of woman. It seemed strange to me that this great, storied fashion house caters to women, and a woman hadn\u2019t been a creative director before.Will you continue to be a presence in the fashion world?If you were raised by Grace Adichie, my mother, you had better be interested in fashion. From the time I was a little girl, my mother would dress me up. She would put some of her jewelry on me. I\u2019m a bit of a shoe fiend. I make no apologies for it. The first makeup I used was my mother\u2019s lip gloss. I remember putting on a lot of it, so it was quite shiny. She didn\u2019t mind at all. She said, \u201cYou look like you ate hot jollof rice and didn\u2019t wipe it off.\u201dThere\u2019s a part of me that likes shoes, and likes dresses, and likes makeup, and likes books, and likes to write. I think that\u2019s the case for many women. But our culture makes us think we have to choose slices of ourselves that we\u2019re comfortable showing the world.Do you consider fashion and makeup entry points to a wider audiences?I decided to do this No7 thing because I thought it might be fun, and then they will give me free makeup. And I\u2019m always up for free things. It wasn\u2019t a carefully calculated thing. It was actually just my being blinded by the selfish overwhelming love of makeup. But I have to be honest, there were times when I thought, \u201cWell, what have I done?\u201d I wasn\u2019t quite aware of how many pictures of me would be out there. It makes me feel a little vulnerable. I told my friends to stop sending me pictures of when they see me at the bus stop in London or something. It\u2019d be very dishonest to say it\u2019s all wonderful. It\u2019s not so much a question of regret. But it does come with feelings of vulnerability that can be uncomfortable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the 21st-Century Craze for Redesigning Everything", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "1. The ProblemIn theory, the redesign begins with a problem. The problem might be specific or systemic or subjective. A logo makes a company\u2019s image feel out of date. A familiar household object has been overtaken by new technology. A service has become too confusing for new users. And so on. The world is, after all, full of problems.The human desire to solve problems fuels brand-new inventions too: The wheel, for example, eased conveyance significantly. But the redesign tends to address problems with, or caused by, dimensions of the human-designed world, and identifying such problems may be the designer\u2019s most crucial skill. Redesigns fail when they address the wrong problem \u2014 or something that really wasn\u2019t a problem in the first place. While progress may entail change, change does not necessarily guarantee progress. But a clever redesign, one that addresses the right problem in an intelligent fashion, improves the world, if just by a bit.Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Simons was so impressed that she signed two students, Amy Wu and Luke Stern, to a three-month contract that summer. The two of them soon zeroed in on a particularly thorny design problem: the big, instructional decal on Citi Bike\u2019s kiosks. Annual members used a key fob and had no reason to interact with the decal, but it was the gateway for casual users. Consisting mostly of text, the decals were dense and off-putting, especially to tourists uncomfortable with English. Some failed to understand that they were supposed to type in a code from a printed receipt to unlock a bike; instead, they tried to figure out how to insert the receipt itself into a slot on the docking station.There was another, more prosaic reason that Stern and Wu focused on the decal: It was something they could actually change. Citi Bike is operated by a private firm, but New York\u2019s Transportation Department oversees it, too, and the technology involves an external vendor. The decal, however, was produced in-house. So Stern and Wu proposed refashioning it, using a set of instructional pictograms loosely inspired by Ikea booklets. They tested several prototypes and endured baffled responses from Citi Bike users until eventually landing on a gridlike arrangement of visuals that people found intuitive. Simons and the Transportation Department signed off on a final version, and it was installed on the city\u2019s 300-plus Citi Bike stations. Wu checked the service\u2019s publicly available user data a month later and discovered that casual ridership had increased about 14 percent. \u201cIt was a little bit surreal,\u201d Stern recalls. \u201cWe can actually make a difference.\u201dIndeed, this is the platonic ideal of the redesign: A designer sees a problem, proposes a solution, makes a difference. Such tidy narratives fuel a reigning ideology in which every object, symbol or pool of information is just another design problem awaiting some solution. The thermostat, the fire extinguisher, the toothbrush, the car dashboard \u2014 all have been redesigned, whether anybody was clamoring for their alteration or not.This hunger for change has been a boon for firms like IDEO. Tim Brown, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, has overseen IDEO\u2019s steady expansion from product design to interactive and service design for businesses like Bank of America and Microsoft, and in more recent years even for municipalities and governments. He has been a vocal proponent of the idea that \u201cdesign thinking\u201d can be applied to just about any problem. \u201cThere are two takes on the redesign,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThe glass-half-empty take on redesign is, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re unnecessarily redesigning a chair,\u2019 or a lamp, or whatever.\u201dProblem: not enough casual users. Solution: reworking the instructions for newcomers from a text-heavy approach to something more pictorial, reminiscent of Ikea instructions.The glass-half-full take requires a broader perspective: \u201cThe need to redesign is really dependent on how fit for purpose the thing in question is,\u201d Brown says. In his thinking, much of our world is built around systems designed to respond to the social structures and technologies of the industrial age. Everything from systems of education and health care to the design of cities and modes of transportation, he says, all trace their roots to a drastically different era and ought to be fundamentally rethought for the one we live in now. \u201cI think we\u2019ve potentially never been in a period of history where there are so many things that are no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore the idea of redesign is entirely appropriate, I think \u2014 even though it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d2. What to ChangeYou don\u2019t have to listen to Karim Rashid for very long to get a sense that he thinks pretty much every single manifestation of the built environment needs to be redesigned. Known for his colorful personal and professional style, he has had a long run as one of the most famous industrial designers in America. He believes design is a fundamentally social act that makes the world a better place. But it is also, he points out, a business. So in practice, most redesigns begin with a client; without one, not much happens. He has worked with many of them \u2014 on furniture, packaging, gadgets, housewares, luxury goods, even condos and hotels. But he has learned that even having a client does not guarantee that any given redesign will ever make it out of renderings and prototypes and into the real world. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m prolific,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine if all the other stuff got to go to market?\u201dAs Rashid sees it, so many of the things that surround us bear cumbersome vestiges of the past. \u201cThe world is full of this kind of kitsch history \u2014 history that has nothing to do with the world we live in now,\u201d he says. He points to a redesign project of his that fizzled, a complete rethinking of the business-class tableware for Delta Air Lines. His proposal was bold: His bowls had sharp angles that echoed Delta\u2019s triangular logo, his trays had subtle recesses that anchored dishes in place and his wineglasses skipped the stem in favor of a tapered shape with a wide base.\u201cThe stem on a wineglass is meaningless,\u201d Rashid says. He dismisses the conventional argument that it prevents the drinker\u2019s hand from interfering with wine\u2019s ideal temperature; to have the slightest such effect, he claims, you\u2019d have to wrap your palm around the bowl for 20 straight minutes. The stem is actually a leftover artifact, he says, from centuries ago, when goblets made of metal had high stems to signal status and wealth. This design quirk remained after we switched to glass, Rashid says. Making wineglasses look a certain way because that\u2019s how they have always looked is a classic example of privileging form over function. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in first class or business class on an airplane with turbulence,\u201d Rashid says, \u201cwith a wineglass with a stem on it \u2014 do you understand? It\u2019s so stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHis proposed redesigns were striking, but they had to pass muster with the service-item maker, the flight attendants\u2019 union and Delta itself \u2014 which ultimately declined to move forward with the concepts Rashid proposed. \u201cIt was all rejected,\u201d he tells me, with a sigh. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t look like domestic tableware.\u201dRashid loves to \u201cbreak archetypes,\u201d in effect redesigning a whole object category. But the hurdles to doing so involve practicality as well as taste. More recently, he designed the Solarin mobile phone for Sirin Labs. It is equipped with extreme encryption capabilities and made with wealthy, privacy-obsessed customers in mind. It costs an eye-popping $12,000 and up. The client had a sky\u2019s-the-limit attitude about imbuing the phone with a truly distinct form.The payment giant\u2019s top priority in revisiting its logo for the first time in decades: Don\u2019t mess it up. The result, released earlier this year, is a version of the familiar interlocked-circles symbol streamlined for the digital era.3. What to KeepSituations like this can unnerve clients, and this knowledge was certainly relevant to Mastercard when it decided this year to update its logo for the first time in more than 20 years. Raja Rajamannar, the global chief marketing and communications officer, says that the first parameter he gave his designer, Michael Bierut at Pentagram, \u201cwas not to mess things up.\u201d The online crowd can get \u201cpretty nasty,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get mired in unnecessary controversy and negativity.\u201dThis conservatism among clients can frustrate designers. \u201cI was kind of brought up in this tradition that, you know, there\u2019s nothing more inspiring than the blank slate, the open brief,\u201d Bierut says. But over the years he has come to appreciate the challenge of \u201cstarting with a given,\u201d particularly now.\u201cThe last big period of redesign was the postwar era,\u201d Bierut says. \u201cThere was this mania to make older companies look new and modern.\u201d As a more corporate world emerged, the visual vernacular of mom-and-pop businesses looked quaint, and so design shifted from an emphasis on manufacturing things to selling more abstract forms of value. A railroad doesn\u2019t run trains, the thinking went; it provides transportation \u2014 so instead of a representation of a locomotive, its more modern logo might rely on arrows and italic typography. More broadly, idiosyncratic or hand-drawn lettering gave way to stylized and minimal iconography and type treatments that projected far-flung and trustworthy power. \u201cCorporate design was done as a command-and-control exercise,\u201d he says, resulting in a master solution laid out in \u201ca thick binder\u201d prescribing how every branding element would appear.By the \u201980s and \u201990s, that approach started to feel dated, suspicious and at odds with a vogue for more agile management theories. So in the last two decades, there has been a fresh wave of redesigns as companies have repositioned themselves in a more globalized, technologized marketplace. Mastercard is one of many examples of a company looking to update visual strategies designed with billboards and brick-and-mortar stores in mind for the age of social media and a transnational customer base.Nevertheless, the specific dimensions of Mastercard\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t mess it up\u201d parameter included keeping the interlocking circles \u2014 one red, one yellow \u2014 that the brand has used for more than half a century. Bierut believes that this was wise: Unlike a book cover or a poster, a brand mark is \u201cmore like a building,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t unveil it thinking it\u2019s going to work once and then be on its way. It\u2019s supposed to accrue value the longer it\u2019s invested in.\u201d The raw familiarity that builds up over years, which marketers refer to as \u201cequity,\u201d probably plays a bigger factor in our assessment of a supposedly great logo design than we realize. Bierut is tickled, for instance, by how many people seem to admire Target\u2019s logo. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine if you went to your client whose name was Target and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea,\u2019 then you went away for a few weeks and came back with a circle with a dot in the middle, and an invoice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe client would be skeptical \u2014 and the world at large would destroy you.\u201dFor Mastercard, Pentagram got as creative as the brief allowed, offering dozens of yellow-and-red-circle variations \u2014 adding additional colors to suggest inclusivity, or a superminimal take presenting only the outlines of the interlocked rings. Rajamannar (and others at Mastercard, crosschecked by multiple rounds of market research) passed on those, opting for a treatment that amounted to a kind of reiteration of the existing mark. The colors became a little brighter, a set of stripes in their overlap was eliminated in favor of a single orange-y color and the name moved below the circles. Ultimately, in fact, the new symbol is designed to be able to stand alone, with no name at all; Rajamannar says testing conducted across 11 countries found 81 percent of respondents recognized the wordless version of the logo as Mastercard\u2019s.In short, the not-messing-it-up mission was deemed a success \u2014 and there was no notable backlash. \u201cThis kind of brand mark has become more ubiquitous than the designers of the \u201960s and \u201970s ever would have dreamed,\u201d Bierut says, and that may explain a public interest in design that would have been a shock in that era. It should not be so surprising today; the design profession has been on a decades-long mission to have its work taken seriously across the culture. But now, having achieved what they wanted, many designers seem to wish the public would be more deferential \u2014 something Bierut finds amusing. \u201cIf designers claim to want people to be interested and invested in and care about design,\u201d he says, \u201cthey sort of have to accept that interest on the terms of, you know, the audience.\u201d4. Where to CompromiseIn 2011, Jamie Siminoff had just sold a start-up and was spending most of his days in his garage in Pacific Palisades, Calif., determined to come up with a new business concept. Tinkering with ideas including a gardening business and new conference-call technology, he soon became annoyed, because he could never hear his doorbell, and he kept missing visitors. So he \u201chacked together\u201d a system that linked the bell to his phone. His wife told him that it was far more useful than the notions he was chasing in the garage. The idea evolved to include a camera and a motion detector \u2014 and thus the ability to monitor your front door from anywhere, with a smartphone, making the object as much about security as convenience.The product he ended up with, Ring, is a good example of a broader phenomenon in the world of industrial design. The technology shifts that Brown and Rashid cite have quickened the pace of redesigns in more mundane, less grandiose ways. Thanks to the proliferation of cheap sensors, circuit boards, cameras and other components, practically every consumer good now seems susceptible to reinvention as a \u201csmart object.\u201d Even the path Siminoff traveled from concept to design was made easier by technology and start-up mania, first with the aid of a crowdfunding campaign, then with an unsuccessful but profile-raising appearance on \u201cShark Tank.\u201dSometimes such a path results in a version of what the tech critic Evgeny Morozov calls \u201csolutionism\u201d \u2014 starting with a supposed breakthrough and then seeking out a supposed problem that it can hypothetically solve. And at times the presumed innovations in these tech-centric redesigns seem to run well ahead of their potential privacy and security pitfalls. (\u201cYes,\u201d the tech site Motherboard reported last year, \u201cyour smart dildo can be hacked.\u201d) But sometimes it results in a hit, like the widely celebrated update of the thermostat in internet-connected, app-controlled form created by the start-up Nest, which was ultimately bought by Google for $3.2 billion.By his own account, Siminoff\u2019s first stab at the product was a bit off. He called it Doorbot, and its look matched the geeky name: a vaguely sci-fi, curved object with a camera concealed by a spooky, bulbous protrusion. \u201cThat was the pride of the design,\u201d Siminoff says now, laughing. He prototyped it in his garage with a couple of recent college graduates; none of them had a design background. The marketplace set him straight, he says: \u201cNo one wanted this big HAL 9000 thing on the front door.\u201d He still believed in the object\u2019s utility, but he realized he would need to redesign his redesign.Siminoff found his way to Chris Loew, an industrial designer in Silicon Valley, with a long record in technology hardware; he worked on early versions of tablet products and spent 16 years at IDEO helping clients including Samsung and Oral-B. In more recent years he has been hired by a number of start-ups. Impressed by Siminoff, Loew also recognized the issues with Doorbot. \u201cIt was very gadgety,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if you were being shot with radiation or \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not offensive, but you didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d In short, it didn\u2019t look like a doorbell, and even the most impressive technical capabilities have to be presented in a form that makes sense to the consumer.The original version of this reimagined doorbell (equipped with a camera and intercom) had such a sci-fi look that visitors often didn\u2019t know what it was. A redesign of that redesign has placed it in the realm of functional home d\u00e9cor \u2014 and it has been installed in hundreds of thousands of homes.In this case, that meant a design that resonated with basic home architecture. There were already serious technologized constraints: It had to accommodate a fairly large battery, a camera, a circuit board and a motion detector that required an opening of a specific size. And from a purely aesthetic perspective, the architectural setting imposed limits that might not apply to a free-standing product: Nobody really wants to tack a wild experiment in product design to a front door. Loew settled on a rectangular shape that would visually echo molding. \u201cEverybody\u2019s house is really just extruded shapes and planar shapes,\u201d says Loew, who is now Ring\u2019s lead product designer. The product comes in various finishes informed by classic door hardware, and is meant to be notable but not flashy.The company has grown to 500 employees, with hundreds of thousands of installations already done. The only holdover from Doorbot is a circle around the button that glows blue when pressed.5. When to Start OverSmiedt paused on one image of a carry-on bag with a side pocket containing a flask-shaped plastic bottle outfitted with a strong microfilter. This accessory popped up during the luggage-design process as a useful alternative to buying bottled water after every airport security check. \u201cSo no matter what country,\u201d Rashid explained, \u201cI go across and to the bathroom and fill it up with clean water. Because it\u2019s absurd, this idea of drinking bottled water \u2014 the landfill is enormous, 18 million bottles are thrown away a day in America.\u201d Both men immediately saw its appeal. Smiedt promptly \u201cdisappeared,\u201d Rashid continued, \u201cand six months later came back and said: \u2018You know, forget the luggage. We\u2019re doing the water bottle.\u2019\u2009\u201dOn its own, the flasklike form seemed off, so Smiedt pushed for alternatives, something more like what was on Rashid\u2019s product shelf \u2014 but not exactly. An hourglass-like, squeezable shape that Rashid eventually dreamed up was perfect. But it required making a lengthy search to find a capable manufacturer \u2014 \u201cNobody had made a blow-molded bottle that was thinner in the middle,\u201d Smiedt said \u2014 and committing to a huge production order for the product, which they called Bobble.\u201cCompanies are often risk-averse,\u201d Smiedt continued, \u201cand don\u2019t get design\u2019s possibilities. But designers do what they want to design, and it often doesn\u2019t connect with the consumer,\u201d at least not the mass scale he had in mind. \u201cFor me,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe key to design is that it can\u2019t polarize.\u201d Many designers would recoil from that assertion, but as a mass-market-oriented entrepreneur, Smiedt\u2019s goals are different. He thinks a lot about who is not going to like a new take on a useful object, as a way to \u201cget to something that\u2019s really understood.\u201dThis new take on the reusable water bottle started out as an accessory to a luggage redesign. The luggage was scuttled \u2014 but Bobble, with a distinct shape and a strong microfilter, has sold millions.The Bobble bottle sold 15 million units in its first three years on the market. Smiedt sold Bobble to Seventh Generation and has gone back into business with Rashid, this time in a partnership. They want to redesign more travel-related accessories, so they started by dumping their luggage onto a table and talking about what they carried, and what they needed. Their first idea involved finding a way to keep smeary touch-controlled gadgets clean. Rashid designed a travel-size spray bottle, arriving at an elliptical form, more like a worry stone than a bottle. They both loved the object\u2019s shape and feel but wondered about the breadth of its appeal. Ultimately, they shelved it, though not entirely.They went back to the results of the bag-dump experiment and zeroed in on the most bothersome objects: the dull-colored, blocky, careless-looking power adapters and portable chargers and their various entangled wires. What if you combined a wall charger and mobile battery in a single object? What if it had a more appealing aesthetic? Smiedt sourced the technology, and Rashid designed around it to create an object they called Bump. Sifting through a box of prototypes, Smiedt pointed out that this completely different product has almost the same elliptical shape as the discarded cleaner idea. This \u201cfun\u201d form (it comes in magenta, red, black and blue) will carry through the entire product line, he explained. Rashid also devised a matching cable, and a clever silicone sleeve that is used both to store the cable and to protect Bump when it\u2019s tossed into a bag.Of course, there was a hitch. Market testing found that consumers were often happy to use Bump with the (less attractive) power cable they already owned, and didn\u2019t bother with the sleeve. So as Bump goes on sale online and rolls out across big retailers, starting with the Container Store in late October, the cord is now sold separately. And that clever silicone sleeve may also be sold separately \u2014 or it may be on its way to a prototype box somewhere.6. The SolutionAll redesigns have something in common: They end. This does not happen at the moment the redesigned symbol, object or interface is implemented. It happens when that redesign is replaced. Maybe that\u2019s the lofty logic of progress, or just the workaday logic of capitalism. But it\u2019s certainly the logic of the redesign, and perhaps design in general, in the early 21st century. When IDEO\u2019s Tim Brown talks about updating all that is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d today, he\u2019s talking about entire systems, not just their individual and tangible components and manifestations.IDEO started out as an industrial-design firm working on consumer products; it expanded further into interaction design as the digital world took hold, and then it went into services. Now its projects include \u201credesigning\u201d such abstractions as the school lunch (for the city of San Francisco) or the vote (for Los Angeles County), experimenting with how to lace in 21st-century technology elements and shed out-of-date practices. These are incremental efforts that play out over years. There is no momentous before-and-after unveiling, just a continuous process of researching, trying and replacing ideas. This, after all, is how designers work: in an ongoing system of study, hunches, prototypes, tests and do-overs.The inevitability of re-redesign is something that Amy Wu (now part of a Microsoft design team in San Francisco) and Luke Stern (now a designer for Intersection, a firm focused on civic spaces) encountered in their work for Citi Bike. A few months after the triumphant installation of their redesigned kiosk decals, the company that operated Citi Bike was bought by another bike-share operator, Motivate, which runs similar programs for several other cities. They got an email from Citi Bike saying they might be needed again, but then never heard back.The new owner promptly set about a broader upgrade of Citi Bike\u2019s system involving new software and changes to the hardware in those kiosks. This meant that the decals needed to be redesigned yet again. The new ones incorporated some of Wu and Stern\u2019s thinking, but in a new look that, among other things, visually announced to the world that Citi Bike had been updated.Stern and Wu are philosophical about this turn. \u201cThe logistics had changed,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThey had to update the system. Our design wasn\u2019t actually relevant any more. That\u2019s reality, right?\u201d Right. And it was certainly a useful final lesson for an effort that started out as a student project: All redesigns end, but the redesign never does. \u2666Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grandmother\u2019s Killing Lays Bare a Dilemma in Child Welfare Work", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Murder in the 4-0Carmen Irizarry, 60, was killed by her drug-addicted partner in the Bronx, but her 9-year-old granddaughter, Heaven, escaped, avoiding the grim tally of children killed by the people closest to them.Supported byThe girl named Heaven lay curled up asleep next to her grandmother on the mattress they shared on the living room floor. The woman, Carmen Irizarry, had been the 9-year-old\u2019s legal guardian for years, a stand-in for the girl\u2019s troubled mother. Now, Heaven\u2019s protector was sick, breathing from an oxygen tank after a long hospital stay for acute lung disease. It was early in the morning of May 11, quiet in the half-light in the eighth-floor apartment in the South Bronx.Just before 5 a.m., Henry Maldonado, Ms. Irizarry\u2019s companion of 30 years, entered the room clutching a chef\u2019s knife, the police said. In a fury, he thrust the knife at Heaven, then at Ms. Irizarry, back and forth, the blade cutting five times into Heaven\u2019s torso and left leg. Her grandmother tried to block the blows.\u201cHeaven,\u201d she said, \u201cgo!\u201dIn the most notorious of those cases, caseworkers missed persistent signs of physical abuse and children later died, inciting outrage and prompting reforms. The signs in Heaven Irizarry\u2019s case were subtler in that her home was typical of many troubled households that child welfare workers encounter. She was loved, and had a solid guardian, but she was also surrounded by people addicted to drugs and entangled in the criminal justice system. Determining whether she was in danger was not a simple task.Two days after Heaven was born, her mother, Brenda Irizarry, handed the newborn over to her own mother. She had little choice: She was bound for prison on a parole violation, and child welfare officials were inquiring about the baby. That day in August 2006 was the first of three encounters New York City\u2019s child welfare agency would have with the family. Each time, caseworkers either missed or discounted Mr. Maldonado\u2019s history of domestic violence and drug abuse.Had she not escaped, Heaven might well have been the victim of the eighth murder recorded this year in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times is reporting on every killing logged in 2016. Instead, it was her 60-year-old grandmother whose name was recorded that morning. Since then, the precinct has endured several more homicides, and it now has 14 for the year, more than all but one other precinct in the city.As her grandmother crumbled under the knife strikes, Heaven ran barefoot out the door, blood soaking her pink nightie.Up two flights of steps, she went to an apartment directly above her grandmother\u2019s at 700 East 156th Street in the St. Mary\u2019s Park Houses. Loretta Fleming opened the door and Heaven stumbled in, hysterical. \u201cMy grandfather went crazy,\u201d the girl said.Ms. Fleming, who often babysat for Heaven, called 911. Below, she could hear Mr. Maldonado knocking things over, breaking glass. \u201cYou are going to die,\u201d she heard him scream. Then she smelled smoke.Mr. Maldonado, 55, was putting a lighter to papers and clothes, the police said. He had plunged the eight-inch knife into Ms. Irizarry more than two dozen times, breaking off the haft. Then he stabbed himself twice in the chest with a steak knife.Firefighters broke down the door and doused the flames. Officers used a stun gun to subdue Mr. Maldonado.When Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, interviewed Mr. Maldonado eight days later in the burn unit at Jacobi Medical Center, he said all that he could remember was that he had tried to kill himself. Told that Ms. Irizarry had been hurt, Mr. Maldonado said he wanted a lawyer. Then he asked if Heaven was all right.\u201cI said, \u2018She\u2019s fine, but you stabbed her five times,\u2019\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled. \u201cSo he goes, \u2018What about my wife?\u2019 I just shook my head. He goes, \u2018What does that mean?\u2019 I said, \u2018She died and you killed her.\u2019\u201dIn hindsight, there were clues that despite Ms. Irizarry\u2019s evident devotion to Heaven, the girl lived amid perilous instability, exposed to her mother\u2019s drug-fueled lifestyle and Mr. Maldonado\u2019s violent mood swings.\u201cThis defendant has a history of violence against the deceased,\u201d a Bronx assistant district attorney, Felicity Lung, said at a court hearing in June after Mr. Maldonado was charged with murder in Ms. Irizarry\u2019s death.A year before Heaven was born, Mr. Maldonado attacked Ms. Irizarry on two consecutive days, once with his fists and once with a machete. He barred the door and cut the phone line during the second rampage, according to court records and interviews with witnesses. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault.Two years later, in October 2007, child welfare workers determined that Ms. Irizarry\u2019s home was safe for her granddaughter when they conducted a court-ordered home study, after Ms. Irizarry had filed a petition for custody of Heaven. At the time, the agency could not readily examine criminal records.The court, relying on the caseworker\u2019s report, appointed Ms. Irizarry the child\u2019s legal guardian. Heaven\u2019s father, who could not be located for comment, has not played a role in her life and never sought custody, several relatives said.Eight years later, the agency again investigated the family after Brenda Irizarry, Heaven\u2019s mother, who lived in the apartment for long periods, assaulted a woman with a baseball bat as Heaven looked on. Ms. Irizarry pleaded guilty in September 2015 to second-degree attempted assault, but was not sentenced to serve any time.Again, caseworkers determined that Carmen Irizarry was a competent guardian, even though she sometimes left the child with her daughter, two people familiar with the case said.That time, the caseworkers raised questions with teachers at Public School 157. Why had Heaven missed more than 10 days of school in the second grade? Her attendance worsened the next year, when she missed 26 as her grandmother\u2019s health failed; yet her teachers had never alerted child welfare officials, the people familiar with the case said.The city\u2019s Education Department, citing privacy laws, declined to comment on why Heaven\u2019s absences had not prompted a call to the authorities.Friends said Susie Irizarry \u2014 as the grandmother was known to them \u2014 was a vigilant guardian who doted on Heaven, and city officials confirm that there was never a complaint that Heaven was physically abused.In practice, Ms. Irizarry was not the only one watching Heaven. She worked long hours as a counselor for disabled adults and came home late most nights, neighbors and relatives said. It was Mr. Maldonado, or Heaven\u2019s mother, who often cared for the girl after school. And a couple of afternoons a week, Heaven would stay with Ms. Fleming, the neighbor to whom she would flee the night her grandmother was killed.Brenda Irizarry, 44, has been arrested nine times since 2013, on charges including prostitution, petty larceny and drug possession. Henry Maldonado has at least 15 arrests dating back to 1984, on assorted charges, including carrying a knife, drug possession and armed robbery. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to selling pills he had obtained with Medicaid benefits to a black market drug dealer.In addition, a man who lived with Ms. Fleming, and who occasionally accompanied Heaven and Brenda Irizarry on outings to the park or the beach, was a sex offender who had served 21 years in connection with the rape and robbery of a 12-year-old girl, law enforcement officials said. A year ago, the man, Morgan Shuler, 53, whose nickname was Moet, was arrested again, on charges that he had raped a woman in Heaven\u2019s building. He pleaded not guilty. \u201cMoet loved Heaven,\u201d Ms. Fleming said.Since the murder, Heaven has been placed in the temporary custody of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s estranged son, Henry Jr., who is seeking permanent custody, relatives said. The girl\u2019s physical wounds have healed, and she is thriving in a new home and school in the North Bronx, law enforcement officials said. She attended a dance and gymnastics camp over the summer. The family took her white-water rafting in Pennsylvania and on a Florida vacation. For the first time in her life, Heaven has her own bed.Henry Maldonado pleaded not guilty at his court arraignment in June. His lawyer, Martin Goldberg, has not yet indicated whether he intends to offer a psychiatric defense.Gladys Carri\u00f3n, the commissioner of the city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services, said state law precluded her from saying whether caseworkers had been aware of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s previous attack on Ms. Irizarry or knew of the criminal backgrounds of other people in Heaven\u2019s orbit.The agency does not ask the courts to put children in foster care solely because there are drug addicts or people with criminal records in a home, Ms. Carri\u00f3n said. Indeed, many families the agency monitors in the South Bronx struggle with a combination of those problems.\u201cWe\u2019d be removing many, many more children,\u201d she said.Ms. Carri\u00f3n said it was difficult for caseworkers to know about every person caring for a child. Investigations focus on the primary caregiver, in this case Carmen Irizarry, she said. The agency turns to foster care only as a last resort, usually in cases of physical abuse, molestation or extreme neglect, the commissioner said.\u201cOur work is not an exact science,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way to be able to predict 100 percent of the time what could happen, and when something could happen, and when is the right time to intervene.\u201dIt is impossible to separate Mr. Maldonado from his daily landscape of methadone clinics, pill mills, street-corner drug purchases and furtive highs in parks, alleys and stairwells. He was well known on the commercial strip of 149th Street near Third Avenue, with his long, graying hair pulled back in a ponytail, his \u201cDeath Before Dishonor\u201d patch, the heavy rings on every finger, a cane in one hand, a knife in his pocket. \u201cOutlaw forever, forever outlaw\u201d was how he described himself on Facebook.Heroin and opioid abuse have swept into suburban and rural areas of the country, but the scourge has long devastated the South Bronx, where Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Irizarry lived. More people die of heroin and opioid overdoses in the Bronx than anywhere else in the city; the rate exceeds 22 per 100,000 residents. Few areas have as many methadone clinics as the Mott Haven and Melrose neighborhoods in the 40th Precinct.Mr. Maldonado had been an addict for decades, and he went daily to a methadone clinic on East 138th Street. Methadone treatment is intended to curb the craving for heroin, but the clinics also tend to be gathering spots for less resolute addicts who often lead one another to backslide, addiction experts said. After taking his dose, Mr. Maldonado would typically spend days stalking his next high: pills, PCP, cocaine and, once in a while, heroin, relatives and fellow addicts said.\u201cHe had a very bad drug problem,\u201d his daughter, Evita Maldonado, said. \u201cHe would take whatever he can get his hands on.\u201dHis heavy drug use had started in the early 1980s, around the time he met Ms. Irizarry in a salsa club near Bristow and Jennings Streets. Her name in those days was Carmen Rodriguez. She had been briefly married in the 1970s to Brenda\u2019s father, Harry Irizarry, and kept his surname.Ms. Irizarry loved to dance, many of her friends recalled. Mr. Maldonado, who then went by the nickname Dee Jay, ran with young men who called themselves the Cool Brothers and provided security for clubs.Their relationship was tempestuous and revolved around drinking, drugs and nightclubs, friends said. \u201cHenry was kind of a wild man,\u201d said Jimmy Soriano, a friend from those days. \u201cThey used to get high like there was a shortage of drugs or something.\u201dMr. Maldonado had a melodramatic streak and was quick to take offense, friends said. During one argument with Ms. Irizarry, while he was high on PCP, he lay in the street and asked someone to drive a car over him.Ms. Irizarry, too, fought addictions, to alcohol and crack cocaine. While she eventually won the struggle in the early 1990s, after the birth of her two younger daughters, Mr. Maldonado fell back into drug use again and again, storming out of support-group meetings. \u201cHe was like a stick of dynamite,\u201d said Claude Hernandez, one of his counselors.In the early 1990s, Mr. Maldonado tried to jump off a roof and was hospitalized at Harlem Hospital, his lawyer, Mr. Goldberg, said. Another time, he tried to hang himself at St. Barnabas Hospital while undergoing detoxification.He never found the strength to quit, fellow addicts say. And when he was high, neighbors said, he often fought with Ms. Irizarry. \u201cThey were always arguing,\u201d said Joy T. Madison, who lived below the couple for 15 years. \u201cHe was always drinking and drugging. Then he\u2019d come home and pick a fight with her.\u201dThe criminal justice system did little to help. Most of his offenses were reduced to misdemeanors, and Mr. Maldonado spent no time in state prison and only a few days in jail. Judges sometimes sentenced him to anger counseling or community service, but he was never compelled to enter drug treatment as part of a plea deal, court records show.In addition to using illegal drugs, he spent many days visiting doctors at three clinics. A psychiatrist at one prescribed him mood-stabilizers and tranquilizers for bipolar disorder, said Mr. Goldberg, his lawyer. He was also seeing an anesthesiologist for back and knee pain. The treatment for those, Mr. Goldberg said, was more drugs: opioid pills and injections.Still, several of Mr. Maldonado\u2019s friends said they could never have predicted that he would attack Ms. Irizarry and Heaven. He was often seen hugging and kissing Ms. Irizarry. He also seemed to revel in his role as grandfather, doting on Heaven and walking her to school.\u201cTo do what he did, he must have been in another world,\u201d a close friend and fellow addict, Carlos Nu\u00f1ez, said. \u201cI still, to this day, cannot see it happening.\u201dYet several friends said there were clear signs that Mr. Maldonado was falling apart in April, amid Ms. Irizarry\u2019s illness. After a lifetime of smoking, she collapsed last November with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Five months later, she stopped breathing for a time and spent weeks at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center.While she lay in intensive care, Mr. Maldonado stepped up his use of illicit drugs and stopped taking anti-anxiety medication, friends and relatives said. He was smoking PCP and spoke of suicide. \u201cHe was bugging out,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1ez recalled.His grief proved violent. A neighbor who tried to visit Heaven\u2019s mother, Brenda, in April said Mr. Maldonado punched him and chased him away with a sword. The same month, Mr. Maldonado attacked his daughter Evita with a cane after she confronted him about his drug use, she said in an interview.He also complained bitterly about Brenda\u2019s presence in the apartment, blaming her for Ms. Irizarry\u2019s condition and threatening to kill her, friends said.In late April Ms. Irizarry left the hospital, weak and unable to work. She asked Brenda to move out.\u201cShe said that things were going to change,\u201d one of her closest friends, Nilsa Rivera, said. \u201cShe was not going to deal with anyone\u2019s negativity or addictions.\u201dMr. Maldonado, who did odd jobs for cash and recently started receiving disability benefits, had to divert more of his income toward their bills. Heaven, in a hospital-bed conversation with Detective Javier Cordero, said Mr. Maldonado screamed, \u201cNo more bills,\u201d as he attacked her and her grandmother.The night before that attack, a neighbor said, he was agitated and glassy-eyed in the hall outside Ms. Irizarry\u2019s apartment.\u201cYou could see the stress on his face,\u201d the neighbor, Steven Ocasio, said. \u201cHe said, \u2018My demons is out tonight.\u2019\u201dMr. Goldberg, the defense lawyer, said Mr. Maldonado denied that he smoked PCP that evening. But he said that in the early-morning hours, Mr. Maldonado had taken prescription drugs, among them Seroquel, Xanax, Ambien and OxyContin.\u201cThis was a suicide attempt,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said.In the end, however, it was not Mr. Maldonado who died, but Ms. Irizarry. In a sense, she was a victim of her faith in him, the couple\u2019s youngest daughter, Angelica Rosado, said. \u201cShe never gave up on him.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting, and Susan C. Beachy and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reddit and the God Emperor of the Internet", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionWithin minutes, the post had accrued more than 2,000 comments. Within days, they numbered more than 12,000. Reddit, a hodgepodge of message boards about everything, from kiteboarding to financial advice to Photoshopping human arms onto images of birds, is the eighth-most popular online destination in the United States. The_Donald, devoted, of course, to Donald J. Trump, has become one of the most influential communities within one of the most significant websites on the internet. Yet that post by OhSnapYouGotServed is probably largely incomprehensible to most people.The_Donald has around 300,000 members. Some are conservative stalwarts, others are meme-making teenagers; all are anonymous, hidden behind user names, making their origins and motivations difficult to pinpoint. But it\u2019s fair to say that many saw themselves as political outsiders who reveled in rallying for the underdog.The community is home to copious Islamophobia, trolling of liberals and near constant bashing of Hillary Clinton. It has evolved a dialect decipherable only to insiders, which includes acronyms like \u201cMAGA\u201d (Make America Great Again); epithets like \u201cGod Emperor\u201d (for Mr. Trump); insults like \u201ccuck\u201d (short for cuckold and often deployed against feminists); memes featuring a cartoon frog associated with racism; and nicknames like \u2019Pedes. (Centipedes, a term for Trump supporters adopted from a YouTube mash-up of the song \u201cCentipede\u201d by the band Knife Party and clips of Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches. It might also be a penis joke. Seriously.)This, according to its moderators, was \u201cthe largest, best and closest thing to an official campaign subreddit for Donald Trump 2016.\u201d If Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 online presidential campaign was a well-oiled machine that made effective use of supporter data, analytics and social-media tools, Mr. Trump owes some degree of his success to an online mob of rabid, self-organized supporters.Politics has always been a popular topic on Reddit. The site came of age during the administration of George W. Bush \u2014 and Reddit, in general, despised Mr. Bush. It has leaned liberal-to-libertarian ever since, the most popular candidates being Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul. Until The_Donald.When created by a couple of volunteer moderators in 2015, the community was just one of many straightforward political-support pages (r/SandersForPresident and r/HillaryClinton were already going strong) that sprang up to aggregate news articles from sources such as CNN and The Hill.Today The_Donald is something different. Its memes and slang serve as the passwords to an internet speakeasy, a secret club whose rules one moderator justified as existing to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for Trump supporters. \u201cEveryone wants to have a sense of belonging,\u201d Reddit\u2019s chief executive, Steve Huffman, told me last week. \u201cAt some point, it becomes almost cultlike.\u201dThe_Donald\u2019s policy states \u201cno racism/anti-Semitism,\u201d but it also warns \u201cNo dissenters or S.J.W.s,\u201d as in social-justice warriors. \u201cConcern trolling,\u201d or questioning views expressed on the subreddit, is also banned.The community is notoriously difficult to manage. Its top moderator team has turned over at least four times, according to Mr. Huffman. (This usually happened because the community revolted, as in one instance in which a lead moderator wrote that he believed he could get away with raping undocumented immigrants.) Moderators also suspend and bar members more frequently than do moderators of any other section of the site.Still, by early 2016, its content so regularly took over Reddit\u2019s most popular lists that the company decided to change its algorithm to make it harder for posts from groups like The_Donald to reach prominence, according to employees. When he announced the change, Mr. Huffman said it had been in the works for a while, but also that Reddit was being undermined by The_Donald\u2019s attempts \u201cto dominate the conversation.\u201dThe community\u2019s power soon reached beyond Reddit. Mr. Trump tweeted out memes and videos that originated on The_Donald and in July he participated in a popular Reddit \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d discussion, after his team communicated with the moderators.This would make little sense if The_Donald were all memes and derision. But according to Reddit, The_Donald\u2019s moderators \u2014 nearly 50 far-flung volunteers \u2014 deftly managed to channel action out of the chaos. They hosted an extensive and at times informative Wiki about Mr. Trump\u2019s policy proposals and instructed supporters how to help with the campaign. Members often suggested strategies for arguing persuasively against opponents.Perhaps most important, members organized an effort to comb through the Democratic National Committee emails released by WikiLeaks over the summer. In order to interpret and disseminate these documents, The_Donald relied on a network of subscribers it (adoringly?) named \u201cweaponized autists.\u201d Of particular fixation were emails from the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a debate in October, Mr. Trump said to Mrs. Clinton, \u201cJohn Podesta said some horrible things about you.\u201dThere is no way to know how much all this online activism made a difference on Election Day. But there were many discussions of how The_Donald\u2019s hundreds of thousands of members could persuade their friends on Facebook and elsewhere to get out to vote. And, after all, they spent months discussing Nov. 8 on Reddit; it\u2019s hard to imagine they didn\u2019t spend a few minutes in a voting booth.But now that Mr. Trump is the president-elect, what will happen to The_Donald? What will the centipedes do when the Trump administration becomes the establishment, engaging with lobbyists and compromising on ideals, and all of the typically \u201cWashington\u201d behaviors they despise?The_Donald is still very active, and is gaining subscribers. OhSnapYouGotServed wrote: \u201cWhere do we go from here? We stay the course. This is our home and we are on the winning team. They cannot silence this movement. Trump has much work to do to drain the swamp of corruption in all corners of the country. We have an opportunity to dismantle the establishment. We can still use our platform to aid in these endeavors.\u201dRecent posts on The_Donald have promoted a letter-writing campaign for Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. There\u2019s support for protesters countering the anti-Trump legions in Midtown Manhattan. There\u2019s a proposed boycott of Harry Potter books and movies, with a reminder that J. K. Rowling tweeted that Voldemort was \u201cnowhere near as bad\u201d as Mr. Trump, and a proposal to defund NPR.There was also, for a moment this fall, a movement to set up a political action committee, something to be expected of a candidate\u2019s fan base after the campaign wraps up. The proposal was met with bile, and rejected as a money grab. Moderators issued an apology and a retraction of the idea. Organizing the \u201cweaponized autists\u201d worked. Asking for letters to support Mr. Assange is working. Asking for money did not.Whatever The_Donald\u2019s moderators say, the community\u2019s future is uncertain without a controversial, underdog candidate to rally behind. It\u2019s hard to imagine that the allure of insider-only memes and perverse laughs will be enough to sustain it over the next four years.\u201cThere are no brakes on this train,\u201d wrote OhSnapYouGotServed. No brakes, perhaps, but it will almost certainly run out of steam.Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, a senior writer for Inc., is the author of the forthcoming \u201cWe Are the Nerds,\u201d about Reddit.Advertisement"}

Children die of diarrhea.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe considered how he might make a difference in the face of such a daunting problem. How could he tackle something so large and universal, in particular in an industry climate in which traditional funding models have changed radically in the new millennium?A student of chess, he imagined the problem as a multifaceted, long-term endeavor and thought several moves ahead. He researched and strategized for a year, focusing on potential financing options and partner organizations. He decided to work around the world examining water issues until 2025, so he knew he needed a plan.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe institutions that have typically supported photographic work have largely been handicapped by the advent of this new explosion of information and connectivity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Abdulaziz, 30, said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the revenue streams to support long-term work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you look at the budgets of some of these companies that donate money to lower their tax bracket, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

{"Headline": "Snap Moving to I.P.O. Faster Than Its Peers", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSnap wants to be sure youth is not wasted on the young. The company, which offers an app with disappearing messages and pictures, is preparing an initial public offering at the tender age of five years. That is earlier than most of its technologically minded peers, which tend to mature a little more before going public. Snap\u2019s value, however, may yet have some growing to do.The start-up, formerly known as Snapchat, is based in Los Angeles and led by the 26-year-old Evan Spiegel. It submitted confidential I.P.O. paperwork this month under a law intended for smaller firms. A market debut early next year could get Snap trading ahead of highly anticipated stock sales by older ventures including Airbnb, Palantir, Pinterest and Uber.Figures discussed only privately so far are impressive. Snap has approximately 150 million daily active users, should generate over $350 million in revenue this year and hit $1 billion in 2017. If that is accurate, it would mean growth of nearly 200 percent. The mooted top-end valuation of $25 billion would then peg it at an eye-popping 25 times the expected top line.Both Twitter and Facebook were expanding at about the same rate when they were the same age. Twitter would have had only about 50 million comparable users, an estimate calculated by using the proportion of monthly-to-daily users it reported at the time of its I.P.O. two years later. And yet it garnered a valuation, privately, of 25 times revenue. Growing pains have cut the microblogging site to less than five times next year\u2019s revenue.Facebook\u2019s backers in 2009 were valuing the social network and its 185 million daily users at 13 times forward revenue. With some $37 billion in sales expected next year, the social networking titan still trades at around nine times, a heady multiple considering growth may be slowing to around 30 percent.Snap should have ample room to expand, despite challenges ahead, like building its advertising model, an effort just underway. It is strong in video, where the action is, and teenagers stick around for long stretches. Facebook\u2019s 430 million daily active users in the United States, Canada and Europe also suggest more growth opportunities for Snap in areas where ads are most lucrative. Twitter\u2019s fate is a cautionary tale and financial details remain to be seen, but Snap\u2019s I.P.O. is developing into an investor photo op.Advertisement"}

The men, of course, do not notice the flier. Nor do they notice me, sitting a few seats away.It may seem shocking that students at one of America\u2019s most elite universities, in one of its most progressive states, would behave so crudely. But in fact those publicly shared scouting reports show Harvard students engaging in an activity at which we excel: rating and categorizing one another.Like most adolescents, we\u2019re eager to define our identities, and determine our place on campus and in the world. In high school, many of us were known as \u201cthe kid who got into Harvard.\u201d Here, we can all claim that title, so we sort ourselves into groups even more exclusive than the roughly 5 percent of applicants our school admits.By the time my family dropped me off in Harvard Square, I had already submitted applications for limited-enrollment freshman seminars and pre-orientation programs for students interested in the arts and social justice. At convocation, as Harvard\u2019s president delivered a speech about the importance of forming a community, I worried that everyone had already found their friends for the next four years.I soon found that the students who competed for academic honors and leadership positions during the day staged different contests at night. On Friday and Saturday evenings, young women dressed in bandage skirts and heels line up outside the clubhouses on Mt. Auburn Street. Shivering in the cold, they wait for the nod of a bouncer. On Sunday mornings, young men brag about their conquests.Sometimes, the line between academic and sexual competition blurs. Many campus extracurricular organizations choose members through a process called \u201cthe comp,\u201d which may include cocktail parties as well as work requirements. During my freshman year, I attended the introductory meeting for a campus literary magazine. Members, dressed in black, stood behind a big wooden table and smoked cigarettes. Empty wine bottles served as candlesticks. The magazine\u2019s editors promised that applicants would be judged only on the basis of their literary merits, but I still felt pressure to dress carefully for every meeting. Was I cool enough to join? Witty enough? Pretty enough?Now, as a senior, I stand behind the tables. While my friends and I don\u2019t evaluate the appearance of female \u201ccompers\u201d or candidates for leadership positions, we toss out superficial judgments about our fellow students all too easily:\u201cHe really dropped the ball on that project.\u201d\u201cShe never smiles.\u201d\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t seem committed.\u201dWe gossip under the guise of meritocracy.Harvard\u2019s competitiveness does not cause men to degrade women. Men \u2014 even, apparently, presidents \u2014 need no excuse to do that. Yet when we regularly evaluate one another\u2019s fitness to join our organizations, attend our parties and become our friends, we give misogyny a vocabulary. We give it a place on our campus, and in our culture.It\u2019s not just Harvard, either. We are the generation of the Buzzfeed listicle, the Yelp rating, the Tinder swipe and the Facebook like. Surely, the Paleolithic man ranked women on the walls of his cave, but the 21st-century man makes his lists for all the world to see.Each entry in the soccer team\u2019s 2012 scouting report included, in addition to a nickname and a numerical value, a paragraphs-long assessment and a photograph culled from social media. The cross-country team designed spreadsheets, some of which allowed individual men to add comments about the women\u2019s physical appearance. This \u201clocker room talk\u201d was not idle chatter, but a project that required time, effort and a certain kind of skill.We\u2019ve honed that skill for years.Maia Silber is a senior at Harvard University.Advertisement"}

The tax code didn\u2019t start out complex. The complexity was created by cheats.We all want the same thing, which is to keep America moving forward. I personally believe, though, that four more years of an establishment president will do nothing for this nation.Hillary is corrupt. I\u2019m sorry to say it, but she terrifies me. I could stomach some \u201cmistakes\u201d because no one is perfect, but she is ... extreme. The emails, Benghazi cover-up, D.N.C. primary rigging, silencing Bill\u2019s accusers, these are not \u201cmistakes.\u201d This is corruption.I\u2019d rather have a presidency where the direction is kind of a question mark over a presidency that will keep America chugging in the same (wrong) direction.It was cathartic, as though all the tension and anxiety that have built up in this grimy election year shifted for a few hours to the honored national game. Close-up shots of the fans showed people with tightly folded arms, nail-biting, praying, clutching rosary beads, compressing lips, grinding teeth, clenching jaws \u2014 and bursts of hope that could not be held in any longer.It was a brilliantly played game between two strong teams telling us decency and fair play still exist in this country.My dad was a lifelong Cubs fan born in 1909, the year after the Cubs last won the World Series.

We have to be conscious of this phenomenon and help women have true power over their bodies.This comment received more than 560 reader recommendations.Little is more traumatizing than losing one\u2019s breasts, forcing a decision so intimate, so personal: whether or not to reconstruct and how.Yes, it is odd that these are not the breasts I grew in adolescence. But I could not have predicted how grateful I am to have them. And that\u2019s the sorrow: that in the throes of diagnosis and surgery it is nigh on to impossible to know how we will feel being reconstructed or breastless in a year or three.This comment received more than 230 reader recommendations.I had never been there before and I was really tight on money, and told the cashier where I wanted him to stop ringing stuff up.To my amazement, he rang up most of my groceries at 10 cents apiece. I couldn\u2019t express enough how grateful I was, and he just shrugged it off with a smile. I\u2019ll never forget that as long as I live.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Russia and Putin, a Surprise Gift From America", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The victory of Donald J. Trump declared early on Wednesday was an unexpected bonus for the Kremlin, which had used the long, tortured United States election campaign to prove the global reach of its disruptive disinformation operations and to cast doubt on the entire Western democratic process.Speaking at a Kremlin ceremony to welcome new ambassadors to Moscow, the Russian president said that the Kremlin had heard Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogans about resuming and restoring ties with Russia and was ready to cooperate, even if it involved a \u201cdifficult path.\u201dMr. Putin repeated his mantra from the superpower past that the two nations had a special responsibility to \u201csustain global stability and security.\u201dProminent analysts gloated about the opportunity this presented for Russia to extend its global influence and, possibly, shed economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Crimea and Ukraine.\u201cUndoubtedly, they are drinking champagne, and for two reasons: one is political, the other psychological,\u201d said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political consultant who once worked for the Kremlin.The political reason is that Russia benefits from disarray in the global order, he said, and psychologically the Kremlin feels more in tune with the anti-establishment view of Trump. Overall, he and others said, there is joy that the liberal establishment in the West has suffered another defeat.The mood extended beyond the Kremlin. The state-controlled news media has given constant attention to the campaign, particularly to the fact that Mr. Trump, far from demonizing Mr. Putin, as most Western politicians do, praised him as a strong leader.\u201cTrump said he respects the president,\u201d said Maria V. Katasonova, 21, the organizer of a Trump support party at the Union Jack pub in Moscow that went on all night. \u201cHe said he will talk to Russia. It is a positive moment that will turn down the temperature of international relations.\u201dThere was little love for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Putin has always accused her of supporting the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in 2012, and senior officials repeatedly derided her as one of the key architects of regime change that, in the officials\u2019 view, brought war and chaos to Libya, Syria and Ukraine.\u201cA lot of Russians like Trump,\u201d said Ms. Katasonova, who was wearing a blue Trump-Pence T-shirt. \u201c One phrase explains it: \u2018war and peace.\u2019 Hillary is war, Trump is peace.\u201dBy dawn, the crowd of supporters had dwindled to about a dozen from 100 the previous night. Still drinking whiskey and beer, they cheered every announcement of a Trump win on CNN.The wall of the bar was decorated with dewy portraits of Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump and Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front in France. Russia has given financial backing to Ms. Le Pen, a major critic of the European Union and Europe\u2019s welcome mat for immigrants, and other organizations on the far right and far left in Europe.News outlets like the RT satellite television network and Sputnik show Western Europe as awash in demonstrations. They also supported the vote in Britain to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.If Europe was important, however, finding the means to sow doubt and insecurity about the political system in the United States, the last remaining superpower, was the big prize.Television has been relentless in trying to paint the American system as flawed, suggesting that the process was not better than that in Russia. One prominent Russian politician even joked about it before the votes came in.Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the longstanding leader of the Communist Party, said that Mrs. Clinton was smart but not good for Russia. \u201cIf Americans will vote honestly, I think Trump will make it, but if they will vote like here, then Hillary will win,\u201d he said.If the Cold War was rooted in ideological differences, the new Russian goal is to show that all political systems are equally bad. Also by interfering in conflicts like those in Ukraine and Syria, Mr. Putin has sought to reassert Russia\u2019s role as a global power to be reckoned with.Dmitry Kiselyev, the most prominent anchor on state television, called the United States election campaign the dirtiest in that country\u2019s history, saying it provoked \u201cdisgust\u201d toward what is somehow still called democracy. He also said that whoever was elected would not be legitimate and would face constant legal challenges.As voting started, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the English-language RT satellite television network and a former high school exchange student in New Hampshire, posted on Twitter, \u201cDemocracy. R.I.P.\u201dMore directly, senior security officials in Washington linked Russia to hacking attacks at the Democratic Party headquarters that led to leaked emails in October that proved embarrassing to the Clinton campaign.Mr. Trump encouraged Russia to disclose more of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, leading her to accuse him of being a \u201cRussian puppet.\u201d Mr. Trump, in the last debate, shot back, \u201cNot a puppet, not a puppet.\u201dMr. Putin denied any direct state role in the leaks, saying that the American news media should pay attention to the content, not the source. Still, he gloated that Russia was front and center in the campaign, no longer ignored.\u201cToday, the No. 1 problem in the entire election campaign is Russia. It is the main talking point,\u201d Mr. Putin told a group of mostly foreign Russia experts in October.\u201cThat is very welcome, of course, but only partially,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhy partially? Because all participants in this process are abusing anti-Russian rhetoric and spoiling our interstate relations. And this is bad both for our countries and for the entire international community.\u201dAs the results began to hint at a Trump victory, his Russian supporters could not quite believe it. \u201cOperation Unthinkable. World history has changed its course,\u201d Egor Kholmogorov, an outspoken nationalist, wrote on his Facebook page.Of course, various more sober policy analysts were sanguine about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s positive statements about Russia would result in improved ties and perhaps easing some economic sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of Ukraine.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should exaggerate the importance of the kind words that Trump has said about the Russian leadership,\u201d Aleksei Arabatov, an international relations expert, said in an interview on Echo of Moscow radio station. \u201cHe said good things at the beginning, he said bad things, and now he said that he doesn\u2019t know. This is a man who adjusts himself to the circumstances and to the public he speaks in front of.\u201dAndrew Kramer and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Kory, offered more detail about his client\u2019s death.\u201cLeonard Cohen died during his sleep following a fall in the middle of the night on Nov. 7,\u201d Mr. Kory said in a statement. \u201cThe death was sudden, unexpected and peaceful.\u201dIn the months before his death, Mr. Cohen was busy. Even as his body was growing frail and he was experiencing pains in his back, he was working diligently to bring several projects to completion, according to friends and colleagues. In addition to finishing his last album, \u201cYou Want It Darker,\u201d which was released in October, he was working on two other musical projects and a book of poetry.\u201cHe felt the window getting narrower,\u201d said Patrick Leonard, a producer and songwriter who had worked closely with Mr. Cohen on his last three albums. \u201cHe wanted to use the time as productively as he could to finish the work that he was so good at and so devoted to.\u201dMr. Cohen, whose working pace was slow \u2014 he took five years to write his most famous song, \u201cHallelujah\u201d \u2014 had been extremely productive in recent years, touring steadily between 2008 and 2013 and releasing three studio albums since 2012. Some of that work, his collaborators say, was a matter of polishing material he had been working on for many years.Mr. Leonard said that when Mr. Cohen died, they were at work on an album of string arrangements of his songs and another of songs that he said were inspired by old rhythm-and-blues grooves.Describing their working method, Mr. Leonard, who has collaborated with Madonna, Pink Floyd and many other artists, said that he would sometimes get emails through the night in which Mr. Cohen tweaked lyrics. Then Mr. Cohen joked about it in further emails the next day.\u201cI feel really grateful that I have been able to have my email ding,\u201d Mr. Leonard said, \u201cand there\u2019s a new Leonard Cohen lyric.\u201dAt times this year, people who wrote to Mr. Cohen \u2014 usually a dependable correspondent on email \u2014 got an automatic response. Chris Douridas, a host on the California public radio station KCRW, got a terse \u201cUnable to read/reply,\u201d and got a worried feeling.\u201cIt told me that he was unplugging from the digital world,\u201d Mr. Douridas said.But that message was also Mr. Cohen\u2019s way of keeping distractions at bay while he worked. In the weeks and months before his death, he appears to have engaged in as much creative activity as he could handle. Mr. Leonard said that he emailed Mr. Cohen a set of new R&B tracks the morning he died. Other friends spoke of dining with him just days before.\u201cI\u2019ve often said that if I knew where the good songs came from I\u2019d go there more often,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, in his dry, deep baritone, when asked about his songwriting method.Mr. Douridas said that after the event, he asked Adam Cohen whether fans could expect another album. \u201cHe genuinely seemed to not know the answer to that question,\u201d Mr. Douridas said.Even near death, Mr. Cohen\u2019s debonair charm was intact. Sharon Robinson, a singer and songwriter who has been a longtime collaborator of his, said she was sitting in the front row at the Canadian consulate event, and she gave Mr. Cohen a hug as he stepped down from his seat. \u201cHe said into my ear, \u2018You look beautiful, darling,\u2019\u201d Ms. Robinson recalled.She had last seen Mr. Cohen in August, just before she left for a concert tour. He invited her to his house, and after first offering her \u201cchocolate, ice cream and sandwiches,\u201d played her the new album on a boombox.As the songs played, he closed his eyes and recited the words quietly to himself, she said, a ritual she had witnessed many times before. But this time he was working against the clock.\u201cHe was dealing with the ultimate challenge, I suppose,\u201d Ms. Robinson said, \u201cand wanted to make sure that he got everything out that he wanted to say.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wanted: Leaders to Turn Interfaith Conflict Into Trust", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byFixesThe election of Donald J. Trump has highlighted religious tensions in America, particularly with Trump\u2019s proposals to bar Muslims from entering the country and to create a registry of Muslims living in the United States. But these tensions did not begin with Trump. In America, virtually every form of faith or belief has at some point suffered unfavorable reception by others; the victims include Roman Catholics, Mormons, evangelical Christians, Jews and atheists, alongside Muslims.Democracy is not just a place where you elect representatives; it\u2019s a society where you can make personal convictions public. And diversity isn\u2019t just the things we like. It isn\u2019t just samosas and egg rolls. Diversity is also the things you don\u2019t like. We have to recognize that expressions of some identities will injure others.The typical metaphor for this is bridges. But bridges don\u2019t fall from the sky or rise from the ground. The ability to disagree with people on some fundamental things and work with them on others isn\u2019t natural for the human psyche or civil society. Leaders have to create that, and we have to be strategic about creating those leaders.In my book, I tell a story about Ruth Messinger, who ran the American Jewish World Service and was Manhattan borough president. In the 1960s, Ruth was assigned to build a foster care network in western Oklahoma. While taking her baby for walks she saw signs on houses saying \u2018Church of Jesus Christ.\u2019 So she knocked on the doors, introducing herself, and got invited to attend evangelical church services.Some of the things said during the services were insulting to her. Sometimes a sermon mentioned Jews as Christ killers. Many of the people didn\u2019t think women should be working outside the home, and they were pro the Vietnam War, which Ruth strongly opposed. But Ruth talked about the kids who needed help and, afterward, when the pastor stood up and asked: \u2018Who will partner with Ruth Messinger to help these kids in need?\u2019 half the church would stand up and sign their names. And Ruth said that if she had let what they said about feminism and the Vietnam War prevent her from forming that partnership, hundreds of kids in western Oklahoma would not have had caring foster homes.That\u2019s an example of somebody who had the ability to disagree on some ultimate concerns and work on others. Because of the relationships and trust she built she was later able to have civil conversations about other disagreements, including their views of Jews.When groups have deep differences \u2014 say, Reform Jews and evangelical Christians on the question of abortion \u2014 people say if you don\u2019t address the conflict you are ignoring the elephant in the room. My response is: If all you do is pay attention to the elephant in the room, you miss the other animals in the zoo. There are other things that Reform Jews and evangelicals can engage on together that are fundamental and inspiring; working against sexual trafficking is an excellent example.An interfaith leader brackets disagreements temporarily. By \u2018bracket\u2019 I don\u2019t mean you never return to disagreements, I just mean don\u2019t get hung up on them. Don\u2019t let them prevent you from doing other fundamental things.For me, if you support a Muslim registry because your knowledge of Muslims comes from the first minute of the evening news and your Facebook news feed, and there is a significant possibility that different conversations and information about Muslims would shift that idea, I would absolutely engage constructively with you. And I think this describes many Americans.What I\u2019m very wary of is what I would call an educated bigotry that seeks to manipulate.In 1959 and 1960, vast swaths of America feared that the election of J.F.K. would mean that the flag of the Vatican would fly in Washington, D.C., and the Pope would descend on the White House. Arthur Schlesinger, the historian, famously said that the deepest bias in the American people is anti-Catholicism.Last year, I was one of thousands of people holding a Vatican Flag on the south lawn of the White House as Pope Francis appeared with President Obama. It\u2019s a stunning shift in history. And people have almost no memory of the anti-Catholic bigotry from two generations ago. A lot of Catholics don\u2019t even remember it.Why? As the social science tells us, when people of different identities mix positively with one another, they come to like each other, and that is the great genius of American civil society. Interfaith leaders pay attention to the prejudices that have disappeared in the past and recognize that those same dynamics can be put into place again.Or identify unlikely and powerful partnerships in history. A classic civil rights example would be Abraham Joshua Heschel and Martin Luther King Jr. It seems straightforward now, but 50 years ago it was uncommon for an Orthodox Jew to march alongside a black Baptist.Another one: Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Gandhi in the Hind Swaraj (Indian Home Rule) movement. At a time of great Muslim-Hindu tension in India, this Muslim from Afghanistan marched and worked with Gandhi for the freedom of the subcontinent.By the way, that\u2019s everything that was said about Catholics.My wife and I are adamant that we are not going to blame all Trump supporters for what some extremists are doing. Our kids met some neighbors, other 9-year-olds, who casually said they\u2019re Trump supporters. We told our kids: You\u2019re still going to be friends with them. We didn\u2019t support Trump for president, but it\u2019s good that you know people who did. And you should still play football and baseball with them \u2014 the 9-year-old version of fundamental concerns.We talk a lot about being proud of being Muslim and being Indian and of the contributions of our communities to America. It was a Muslim from Bengal, Fazlur Rahman Khan, who created the architectural form of skyscrapers.We buy Muhammad Ali books. We talk about Mahatma Gandhi as the chief inspiration for Martin Luther King Jr. We are building pride in their identities, and they are generally surrounded by people who are affirming of that.I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d feel if I lived 90 minutes outside Chicago. Where we live in the city, the Trump world is a minority. But the last thing I want to do is retreat more deeply into my urban liberal bubble.What are ways in which I can understand who my fellow citizens who voted differently are? What qualities do they possess that I would admire? And what are fundamental things that we can work on together?That\u2019s work on me to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Muhammad Dahlan\u2019s Ascent, a Proxy Battle for Legitimacy", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byWith each passing day, the Israeli-occupied West Bank feels increasingly at war with itself as Mr. Abbas, 81, with heart trouble and no designated successor, lashes out at anyone perceived to support Mr. Dahlan. Arrests, purges, protests and even gunfire mark a proxy battle pitting an old guard struggling for legitimacy against a new generation of leadership with its own checkered history.\u201cI know that Abu Mazen is scared, and others are scared, that Dahlan comes back,\u201d Mr. Dahlan said, using Mr. Abbas\u2019s nickname and referring to himself in the third person. \u201cWhy scared? Because he knows himself what he has done the last 10 years. And because he knows that I know.\u201dWith dark hair, an easy smile and the trim physique of a man who exercises 90 minutes a day, Mr. Dahlan exuded vigor and charm in a recent interview here. He dismissed his reputation as a ruthless former security chief \u2014 \u201cDo I look dangerous?\u201d \u2014 but was ruthless in condemning his rival.Unemployment is rampant, Mr. Dahlan said. Schools and hospitals are in desperate shape. Corruption flourishes. Mr. Abbas has failed to end Israel\u2019s occupation, he said, and increasingly runs \u201ca dictatorship\u201d squelching dissent.\u201cQuote me: I don\u2019t want to run in the presidential election,\u201d Mr. Dahlan said, puffing on a small pipe and toggling between English and Arabic during a two-hour conversation. \u201cIs it clear?\u201dBut, he added: \u201cI\u2019m ready to be part of any team. I\u2019m ready to be a soldier. I\u2019m ready to be anything. But with vision and plans and real leadership.\u201dStill, that does not mean Mr. Kidwa or a similar figure would accept such a deal. In a separate interview, Mr. Kidwa, who has served in a variety of diplomatic positions, including foreign minister, dismissed Mr. Dahlan. \u201cI think the possibility of him returning is not that high, at least in the current stage,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen bridges are burned, it\u2019s probably hard to be rebuilt.\u201d\u201cAbbas has such an iron grip that none of his rivals really stands a chance against him right now,\u201d said Grant Rumley, a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, based in Washington, and co-author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Abbas. \u201cHere he is in the twilight years of his reign, and he is easily one of the most cunning politicians in the region in terms of cutting the knees out from his opponents.\u201dMr. Abbas has in recent weeks expelled rivals from his Fatah party and arrested others. On Tuesday, he announced a party conference later this month in a move interpreted as an effort to push out Dahlan allies.The tension has turned violent at times. Last month, unknown gunmen shot up the family house of Fadi Elsalameen, a critic, with 60 bullets. Mr. Elsalameen, who maintains a Facebook page highly critical of Mr. Abbas, said he worked with Mr. Dahlan on an international initiative but did not belong to his coterie. \u201cI\u2019m not part of Dahlan\u2019s work in Palestine at all,\u201d he said. But Mr. Abbas \u201cis calling all opposition \u2018Dahlan.\u2019 \u201dThat does not mean Mr. Dahlan can rally Palestinians. Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, said Mr. Dahlan had little street credibility. \u201cThis guy is a shady character who foreign governments have looked to to do dirty work quietly, and he has often been willing,\u201d he said.Mr. Dahlan was born in a Gaza refugee camp and joined the violent fight against Israel as a teenager. Arrested 11 times, he learned Hebrew during five years in Israeli prison and later became Palestinian security chief in Gaza.But Martin S. Indyk, the vice president of the Brookings Institution and a diplomat who worked for Mr. Clinton, said Mr. Dahlan played the Americans off Mr. Abbas to marginalize him. \u201cHe\u2019s charismatic, smart, manipulative and a clear threat to the old Fatah guard in Ramallah,\u201d he said.Israeli officials refuse to discuss Mr. Dahlan, knowing any positive comments would discredit him among Palestinians. But Amos Yadlin, the director of the Institute for National Security Studies and a former Israeli military intelligence chief, said the government was watching Mr. Dahlan\u2019s maneuvering.\u201cAs we look into the time after Abu Mazen, he seems like an interesting option,\u201d Mr. Yadlin said, \u201cnot so much because of himself but because of the very good connections he has in the Arab world.\u201dMr. Dahlan said he had never even met Mr. Lieberman and rejected accusations of corruption, though he did not deny using brutal tactics in Gaza.\u201cI wasn\u2019t head of the Red Cross,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one was killed, no one lost his life. But of course there were mistakes.\u201dHe also admitted to making money. \u201cTwo things that I\u2019m not denying,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I\u2019m rich, I will not deny it. Ever. And that I\u2019m strong, I will not deny.\u201d He added, \u201cBut I work hard to increase my level of life.\u201dHe has used some of his money, and funds from his Arab patrons, to finance charitable activities in Gaza and the West Bank. Some Gazans have used the hashtag #Dahlan in Twitter messages seeking help for sick relatives.Married and a father of four, Mr. Dahlan describes himself as a workaholic who never vacations; he showed me the backyard garden, where he says he never spends time except to show it off to guests.\u201cI love achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my addiction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Election Highlighted a Growing Rural-Urban Split", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byThe Great DivideDonald J. Trump fared very poorly in American cities in Tuesday\u2019s election. Hillary Clinton did just as badly among rural voters. The political divide between the two groups has been growing more stark in America for years, and 2016 showed an even sharper split than 2012.Mr. Trump\u2019s own Manhattan gave him just 10 percent, a new nadir for a G.O.P. presidential candidate in the borough. His soon-to-be home, Washington, gave him just 4 percent.Most of the change, though, occurred not around the big cities \u2014 where Democratic candidates have only so many votes left to pick up \u2014 but far outside them. Just 15 counties tilted by more than five percentage points in favor of Mrs. Clinton relative to how they voted in 2012. By contrast, 1,826 moved by at least that much away from the Democratic candidate.The counties that swung the most drastically toward Mr. Trump, by 15 points or more, were nearly all in the Midwest. That abrupt shift was probably driven by numerous factors that are hard to untangle: weak economic prospects; Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lack of attention to those places on the campaign trail; Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobic message to voters anxious about change.But the widening political divergence between cities and small-town America also reflects a growing alienation between the two groups, and a sense \u2014 perhaps accurate \u2014 that their fates are not connected.\u201cIn a sense, the high-end economy in these urban areas is disconnected from the success from the rest of the country,\u201d Mr. Renn said. And the very things that drive success in Silicon Valley\u2019s tech industry, or New York City\u2019s financial sector, are what worries rural America: globalization, foreign trade, immigration. \u201cGoldman Sachs and Google do not really need America to be a broad-based middle-class success in order for them to be personally successful.\u201dThose economic forces will probably grow only stronger, even as the effects of an election that pushed urban and rural America further apart recede.Advertisement"}

No one is blowing up churches,\u201d said Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that there\u2019s been an increase.\u201dWhile all sides of the political spectrum have reported problems, Andrew Anglin, a vocal Trump supporter and a leader of the alt-right movement, called explicitly for intimidation of \u201cbrown people\u201d on his neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer.\u201cI am of course against any violence against these people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, I do think you should yell at them. We want them to feel that everything around them is against them. And we want them to be afraid.\u201dMany online attacks have stemmed from a small number of accounts, but have been shared widely, amplifying their effects, according to groups that monitor hate speech.\u201cThe challenge is that these kinds of tweets generate millions and billions of media impressions,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said. \u201cIt allows these people to spread their venom with a velocity and a volume that was never before possible.\u201dIn addition to fear, celebration is among the most common causes of hateful outbursts, according to Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\u201cWhen we have a catalytic event that is highly emotionally charged, we see an increase in hate crimes,\u201d Mr. Levin said.Analyzing hate crime data to identify trends can take months, Mr. Levin said. In the meantime, he said, it will be important to monitor nonviolent activity like vandalism, verbal altercations and conflict on social media, which can escalate to violence.While many of the widely shared complaints of harassment do not constitute criminal activity, they are stirring fear among marginalized groups.Feeling helpless, Iman Zawahry, who is Muslim, turned to Facebook to share with friends what her 12-year-old son had experienced in school in Gainesville, Fla.

The more and more I push him for information, the more he gets upset. I\u2019m in a complete panic.\u201dIf Mr. Trump were to publicly condemn acts of prejudice, experts say, it could have a neutralizing effect because those who express hatred tend to respond to cues from role models. Mr. Trump signaled, in his victory speech on Wednesday morning, that his language may move in that direction, saying, \u201cTo all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201dMr. Levin, at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said, \u201cThe more conciliatory he is, I think the better it will be because people look toward the media and role models as to how to frame their viewpoints.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Cohen at the Southern Poverty Law Center and his colleagues noted that no matter how Mr. Trump proceeds as president, the extremist groups that supported him, whose enthusiasm has been stoked by the election, are likely to react. And because of that, those seeking to tamp down hate fueled by race, religion or sexual orientation are \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place.\u201d\u201cThe rock is that these ideas will play a role in his administration,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThe hard place is that when they don\u2019t, there will be a furious backlash because of the raised expectations.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misattributed a quotation. It was Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 not Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism \u2014 who said that people are \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place\u201d in seeking to tamp down hate fueled by race, religion or sexual orientation, and that the \u201crock is that these ideas will play a role in his administration.

{"Headline": "Gunman Who Killed Police Sergeant Had History of Desperation and Defiance", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byThe red Jeep wedged between a parked truck and a patrol car, the bloodied body hanging out the window and the evidence markers scattered across the sidewalk \u2014 they all told of a fleeing ex-convict trapped on a dead-end street, and a heavy firefight that followed, leaving a New York City police sergeant and his assailant, Manuel Rosales, dead.But Mr. Rosales\u2019s violent last minutes on Friday were hardly the panicked coda to a home invasion gone wrong, as they first seemed from the 911 call that had come in that afternoon.Mr. Rosales had more on his mind than simply avoiding arrest, his father and friends said. On Thursday, the day before the shootout, he had written on Facebook, \u201cThis nightmare is coming to an end \u2026 goodbye.\u201d Years earlier, he had told a suicide hotline operator that he wanted to commit \u201csuicide by cop\u201d by firing at a Long Island station house and dying in a hail of police shots.His desperation and defiance had swelled over two decades. Much of it he rarely spoke of: his diagnosis of bipolar disorder around 15, and years of petty lawbreaking, gang membership, abuse and living out of his car.He wore a final perceived indignity on his sleeve, though, a court order obtained by his estranged wife that he told people was keeping him from the one he cared for most: his blond, round-faced son, Antonio Miguel, who was in the Bronx apartment he stormed on Friday.Mr. Rosales had not entered that apartment looking for money. He had come to negotiate for time with his 3-year-old son.School and law enforcement officials in Suffolk County had seen his deterioration at every stage, said his father, also Manuel Rosales, who pleaded with them to step in. He said he believed that judges and police officers gave his son second chances because of his light complexion; darker-skinned siblings were locked up longer for less serious crimes, the elder Mr. Rosales, who is from Honduras, said.He added that he was confounded by American institutions that both failed to protect his son from bullying as a special education student, and later did not see routine arrests over almost two decades as a cry for a harsh sentence.The younger Mr. Rosales had been born into the margins of city life. At 15, his mother moved into foster care in the Bronx to escape her shame of her protruding belly. She raised Manuel there for his first months. At birth his chest was caved in at the sternum. Doctors told the family he might not make it to 30 without a heart attack.Surgery at 13 masked the deformity, but his father said Manuel continued to be bullied at schools in Brentwood, N.Y., a Suffolk County town that is home to many Latino immigrants. Special education teachers called Manuel and his classmates \u201cspeds,\u201d his father said. The family hired a lawyer to protest the administration\u2019s attempts to have him home-schooled. But legal proceedings fizzled and Manuel dropped out around 17. (His father said he later earned a high school equivalency diploma.)A spokesman for Brentwood schools did not respond to a phone message seeking comment on Sunday.Mr. Rosales brooked no authority. And no targets were too senseless: His father said he destroyed a swimming pool and lit a fire on someone\u2019s lawn. He spent two weeks at a psychiatric center on Long Island around 15 and began taking medication for bipolar disorder. \u201cIn the end I stopped that medication,\u201d the elder Mr. Rosales said, \u201cbecause he was like a kid that would stare at you, but not register.\u201dMr. Rosales, who was 35 when he died, never again received treatment, his father said.The Suffolk police arrested him 17 times from 1998 until this year, mostly on minor charges, but once in 2006 on felony assault charges. A county police spokesman did not have details of arrests or other encounters involving Mr. Rosales, but Mr. Rosales told a friend the assault charge was for getting into a fight with a police officer. He was imprisoned from 2006 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2014 on a stolen property conviction. He later told friends he had once been in the Latin Kings gang.On Sept. 23, 2013, with Mr. Rosales locked up in Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, N.Y., his son was born.\u201cThe first time I laid eyes on you I knew that I had to make a change in myself, I have to do better for YOU not for myself,\u201d he wrote on Facebook on Antonio\u2019s third birthday. \u201cI promised myself that you would never have to wonder if your papa loves you, I\u2019d give you what I didn\u2019t have growing up.\u201dA friend, Michael Jennings, 26, said Mr. Rosales told people that his father had been physically abusive. Recently, when he was living out of his car, a black Nissan Sentra, and showering at rest stops, Mr. Rosales called home to ask if he could stay, but his father hung up on him, Mr. Jennings said. The elder Mr. Rosales said he punished his son for acting out but never beat him.Mr. Rosales\u2019s twin loves were Antonio and cars. The sale of three Nissan Sentras for $1,200 by an old Brentwood acquaintance living in Charleston, S.C., drew him there last year. He moved in with the acquaintance and his wife, Joana Avendano, until they fixed up the cars, and ended up spending most of his time in Charleston until this summer.When he talked with Antonio in video chats, \u201chis face would glow \u2014 he was so happy to see him,\u201d Ms. Avendano, 22, said.But Mr. Rosales\u2019s estranged wife often hung up on him. She got an order of protection amid frequent fights. Some time ago, his father said, Mr. Rosales was jailed after he had an argument with his wife\u2019s aunt, who told the police he had threatened her. Mr. Rosales\u2019s father said Child Protective Services had limited him to supervised visits with his son. He was awaiting a Nov. 16 court date for an arrest on criminal contempt charges.Mr. Rosales met friends at car meet-ups in a Kmart parking lot in Charleston and at drag races in the woods. He commented on how hospitable South Carolina was compared with New York. He picked up odd electrical jobs, drawing on skills he had learned working for his father, a contractor. But after moving into Mr. Jennings\u2019s mobile home, Mr. Rosales confided how desperate he still was to reunite with Antonio.\u201cThe man wanted to be near his son; the man wanted to be a father to his kid,\u201d Mr. Jennings said. \u201cWhen you have a female that won\u2019t let you be in your son\u2019s life, it\u2019s going to push you to a point that you can only take so much. He just finally got to that point.\u201dHe told friends he planned to go back to Charleston over the weekend. But first, on Thursday night, he parked his car outside his wife\u2019s apartment. She called the police; by the time they arrived, he was gone, and they told her to call 911 if he returned.On Friday morning he did return, this time with a gun, slipping inside as someone left to move a car for alternate-side parking. For four hours he stayed in the apartment with his son, his wife, her godmother and a 13-year-old girl, apparently negotiating for time alone with Antonio, law enforcement officials said. His wife was adamant he could not take him.When he stepped outside around 2:45 p.m., the godmother called 911 to report a break-in. About a minute later, Sgt. Paul J. Tuozzolo, a father of two children himself, picked up the call and spotted the Jeep. \u201cHe\u2019s heading back toward Tremont,\u201d he told the dispatcher. Forty-five seconds later he was shot dead.Al Baker and Nate Schweber contributed reporting, and Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lindsey Vonn Fractures Arm, Putting Her World Cup Season in Question", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byFor the fourth time in the last five winters, a serious injury will interrupt Lindsey Vonn\u2019s ski racing season. Vonn announced Friday on her Facebook page that she had \u201cseverely fractured\u201d the humerus bone of her right arm in a training crash on Thursday.\u201cWhile I am beyond frustrated by this latest setback, at least my knees are ok and I will return to the slopes as soon as possible, as I always do!\u201d Vonn wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cThank you for the continued love and support, it means so much to me.\u201dVonn added that she had undergone surgery to repair the broken bone. While she has charged into postsurgery physical therapy in the past, it is unclear when she will be fit to return.In February, Vonn\u2019s 2015-16 season ended abruptly with a fall that resulted in three hairline fractures of her left knee. Vonn was leading the women\u2019s World Cup standings at the time, chasing her fifth overall title. It had already been a comeback season, as she had broken her ankle four months earlier.At the 2013 world championships, Vonn tumbled violently down the course, tearing the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in her right knee. She also sustained a tibial plateau fracture in the knee in that crash. Despite a frantic rehabilitation effort, she was unable to return to form in time to race in Sochi in early 2014.Vonn, who turned 32 last month, wants to race until at least the 2018 Winter Olympics. She has been an almost unstoppable force in the super-G and downhill speed races, but staying healthy has increasingly become her biggest challenge.Vonn has won 20 World Cup season titles, two Olympic medals (including the first gold medal for an American in the women\u2019s downhill) and 76 World Cup races. She is within 10 World Cup victories of the career record set by Ingemar Stenmark, a mark once thought to be all but unassailable.But Vonn\u2019s racing style has always been to fearlessly attack each course, a tactic that usually separates her from the field but in the last three years has led to three torn knee ligaments, two substantial knee reconstructions, two fractures of her tibia, a broken ankle and now a shattered arm. Vonn even takes practice runs with an all-out aggressiveness.As Vonn said in an interview last year at her home in Vail, Colo., \u201cI\u2019m the last one standing of my generation of racers.\u201dNow she must rehabilitate another injury. Vonn will almost certainly miss the three speed races early next month at Lake Louise in Canada, where she has won 18 times. In mid-December, there are a variety of other speed races and giant slalom races; Vonn usually participates in most disciplines except slalom. The bulk of the European-based World Cup schedule begins after Christmas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Betsy DeVos for Education, Trump Taps Into Michigan Royalty", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byTransition BriefingPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has reached into Western Michigan royalty to pick Betsy DeVos as his education secretary and is looking at Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Meantime, Hillary Clinton has widened her lead in the popular vote to 1.5 percentage points, a spread not seen for a losing candidate since the disputed election of 1876.Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of Betsy DeVos to be his education secretary brings Western Michigan royalty into the Trump fold, but she was not always a fan. Mrs. DeVos sharply criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign, and spent much of the year raising money for other Republicans on the ballot.\u201cUntil we have a better reason to embrace and support the top of the ticket, and see an agenda that is truly an opportunity agenda, then we have lots of other options in which to invest and spend our time helping,\u201d she said in May.The National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, was quick to voice its opposition to Ms. DeVos.\u201cHer efforts over the years have done more to undermine public education than support students. She has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers \u2014 which take away funding and local control from our public schools \u2014 to fund private schools at taxpayers\u2019 expense. These schemes do nothing to help our most-vulnerable students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps. She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education.\u201dWith nominees chosen for C.I.A., national security adviser, secretary of education and ambassador to the United Nations, the next pick is expected to be the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That could be official as early as Friday.The department is no small corner of the government. Its programs fund public housing, subsidize rent for the poor, promote homeownership and work to revitalize struggling cities. And housing policy has been in a deep freeze since the Great Recession, when the nominally independent mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed and fell under federal control.For nearly a decade, the mortgage industry has basically been government run, with much of its profits going right into the Treasury. Mr. Carson would have a big role in figuring out how to move forward.\u201cThese government-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality create consequences that often make matters worse. There are reasonable ways to use housing policy to enhance the opportunities available to lower-income citizens, but based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous.\u201dWith new votes tallied from New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland and California, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular vote lead reached 2,017,563 overnight, prompting new calls for an audit of voting machines in battleground states.Mainly, it would seem, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record losing lead is pointing toward a structural disadvantage Democrats have with the Electoral College: Their voters are too concentrated in the bright blue states of the West Coast and Northeast. Democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, but lost two of them (Al Gore in 2000, and Mrs. Clinton) in the Electoral College.At least on Instagram, Facebook and elsewhere.\u201cOur company\u2019s mission is not political \u2014 it never was and it never will be \u2014 however, Ivanka, personally, has an increased opportunity to advocate for women and be a positive force for change.

Nikki Haley of South Carolina, the daughter of Indian immigrants, to be his ambassador to the United Nations, the transition team announced Wednesday.Mr. Trump, whose presidential run was buoyed by an uncompromising stance against immigration, has mostly chosen older white men for cabinet posts in assembling his new team.Her move would eventually elevate South Carolina\u2019s lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Ms. Haley backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the primaries.Mr. Trump arrived on Tuesday night in Florida to celebrate Thanksgiving at his private club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, a visit intended to give the president-elect some time with his family, and he isn\u2019t planning a packed schedule for Wednesday. But officials familiar with the transition process say that he will be busy deliberating his cabinet selections and may announce a domestic appointment before taking a quick break from work.The trip is the first time since Mr. Trump was elected president that he has visited his Florida club, which played host to a few primary night victory parties.President Obama will, for the last time, take part on Wednesday in one of our country\u2019s odder Thanksgiving traditions: the annual pardoning of the turkeys at the White House. Two turkeys, named Tater and Tot, will get the ritual absolution and move on to a nice home at Virginia Tech, even though only one of them will become the official national Thanksgiving turkey.It will be up to President Trump to do the honors \u2014 or not, should he choose otherwise \u2014 next year.If he does not do so, or unless Congress specifically authorizes his conduct, Mr. Trump would be considered in potential violation of the Constitution.The resolution is unlikely to see the light of day in the Republican-controlled Senate, but it will be part of what is expected to be a longer-term effort by Democrats to shine a light on the president-elect\u2019s business dealings.As Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote grows, some of her most ardent supporters are clinging to hope that she could still win the election.The electors will cast their ballots on Dec. 19. On Twitter, the hashtags #auditthevote and #audittheelection have become rallying cries for supporters of Mrs. Clinton who are directing people to flood the Justice Department with telephone calls about voting irregularities. The push is also taking place on Facebook, where calls are growing for a full investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the election.Even the sister of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, weighed in, noting the tantalizingly slim margin that Mrs. Clinton would need to make up in three swing states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 to come out on top in the Electoral College.\u201cThey are starting to recognize there really is something off about the election results as they come in,\u201d Heba Abedin wrote. \u201cConsidering everything that is at stake, a vote audit should be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He never believed polls showing Hillary Clinton ahead, he said, not after visiting friends in rural North Carolina.This former steel town west of Pittsburgh was for decades a Democratic stronghold, where Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms are proclaimed on a memorial in the small town park. But industrial decline and what is perceived as too fast cultural change in the country at large has transformed Ambridge and the rest of Beaver County around it, with the yards of faded brick homes presenting a river of Trump signs.Mr. Trump captured Pennsylvania on the way to the White House, beating Hillary Clinton by one percentage point in the state. But that narrow victory was built with huge margins in places like Beaver County, where Mr. Trump prevailed by 20 points.Joann and Mark Crano, both retired, switched their registrations to Republican this year after a lifetime as Democrats, and they reeled off the names of many other friends and family members who did likewise.\u201cIn 2008, we were wholehearted Hillary supporters,\u201d said Ms. Crano, who was an elected local official for a decade. \u201cWe went to every rally.\u201dIt was Benghazi that put her over the edge, she said.For Mr. Crano, a former steelworker who retired after a second career at the Pittsburgh airport, it was abortion and same-sex marriage. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Christian, you can only vote for Trump,\u201d he said the day before the election at K & N restaurant. It is one of the few thriving businesses still left on Merchant Street, which old-timers \u2014 and there are now mostly old-timers \u2014 remember as once so crowded you bumped into people. Now it is largely deserted.The Cranos were having breakfast beneath a poster of Elvis with several friends, all fierce Trump backers. They painted a desperate vision of America if Mrs. Clinton won, predicting a wave of terrorism by unvetted refugees and a slide into dictatorship.\u201cI\u2019m going to the bank and taking a bunch of money out and buying a lot of guns and ammo,\u201d said Mr. Crano, a former union leader with a large white beard. \u201cI\u2019m going to protect mine and my family,\u201d he added.Ambridge, like much of Pennsylvania outside Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, eagerly enlisted in Trump Nation this year. Its largely white, less educated population (15 percent have a college degree) packed a boisterous rally that Mr. Trump held at the local high school.\u201cI work for my money, and obviously I work for other people, too,\u201d said Sam Bruno, a street sweeper driver, whose yard was festooned with Trump signs.On Monday he predicted a Trump landslide. \u201cI just hope Mr. Trump can change our government and stop any terrorism coming into our country,\u201d he said.A number of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in town echoed his talking points, blaming the Affordable Care Act for rising premiums of their employer-provided health care and asserting that Mrs. Clinton wanted \u201copen borders\u201d that would turn the United States into a country as dangerous as Pakistan.The town is named for the American Bridge Company, whose plant on the Ohio River shaped the steel for the Empire State Building, the George Washington Bridge and the gates of the Panama Canal. The town inspired a Tom Cruise movie, \u201cAll the Right Moves,\u201d about a high school football player straining to escape a life in the mills.But when American Bridge and a wave of other steel plants in Beaver County shut down in the 1980s, undersold by modern competitors, tens of thousands lost their jobs. Unemployment in the county hit Depression-era levels. Ambridge\u2019s population of 6,850 is down 40 percent from 1970. The population is also grayer and poorer.\u201cWe do about 100 funerals a year, but only 20 baptisms a year,\u201d said the Reverend Joseph A. Carr of Good Samaritan Roman Catholic Church.Clinton supporters were not invisible but kept their heads down. A radio ad by the Pennsylvania Democratic Party that ran on Sunday during the Pittsburgh Steelers game urged voters to protect gains made for working people, mentioning Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, but no one on this year\u2019s ballot.Jack Lefebvre, who seemed to be the only Clinton supporter at Fred\u2019s Divot, kept quiet most of the night as he sat beneath the TV and kept busy on his phone. He showed a Facebook post by his wife, who had canvassed on Tuesday for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cAll went well until we were walking back to the car and a man who I would guess was in his late 50s came out of a store and shouted \u2018Hillary for prison,\u2019\u201d Barbara Burgess-Lefebvre had written.

It\u2019s very much like my real life.Call me old, or something, but it\u2019s starting to bore me. Maybe my life isn\u2019t cool enough to broadcast live all the time.All I know is, if it shows me anything like the weird gadgets they have in SkyMall, I\u2019m down.Imagine that: Already serving one fourth of the world and still growing like a weed. I truly don\u2019t understand how that happens. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told me it was because they have a \u201cgreat product\u201d which, uh, simplifies things a bit. I really want to know the secret sauce.But what goes up must come down, and analysts are freaked out about Facebook reaching the limits of \u201cad load,\u201d or how many ads they can jam into the News Feed over time. Which, I think, is a reasonable concern if your main worry is how Facebook is going to keep making more and more money. A rather base concern to me, but hey, I don\u2019t work on Wall Street.Sure, in the next few years, it\u2019s possible Facebook\u2019s ad business may not grow as fast as it\u2019s been growing. But getting that many people hooked is an incredible foundation on which to build all kinds of new products and other ways to make money. If your product is a daily addiction for nearly two billion people, how can you lose?So it\u2019s a bit snoozy, but it\u2019s key to the future of how we work. As more of us telecommute and forgo regular trips to the office \u2014 I\u2019m writing this on the floor of my apartment right now! \u2014 we\u2019re growing increasingly reliant on services like Slack (or Microsoft Teams) to stay in communication with our co-workers. You and I do most of our private chatting on Slack when we\u2019re not tweeting. Or, you know, talk about \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with other co-workers.So the conceit is, perhaps one or a handful of companies will be responsible for providing the connective tissue that serves us all in our nifty workplaces of the future. Slack, so far, has been doing a good job where many others like Yammer, a Microsoft-owned product, mind you, have so miserably failed in the past. Now, Microsoft wants another crack at the problem, and is using its incredible distribution clout with Microsoft Office to give its new product away to paying subscribers.What say you about collaboration? Isn\u2019t this incredibly important to you?And Microsoft has a real shot here. Slack has momentum, but Microsoft has a huge sales staff and deep connections with I.T. staff at businesses across the world. In its full-page ad, Slack confessed to being a little bit scared of Microsoft\u2019s big push. I think it should be.Also, are you going to join my Microsoft Team?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veterans, Feeling Abandoned, Stand by Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byThe roster of retired military officers endorsing Hillary Clinton in September glittered with decoration and rank. One former general led the American surge in Anbar, one of the most violent provinces in Iraq. Another commanded American-led allied forces battling the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet another trained the first Iraqis to combat Islamic insurgents in their own country.But as Election Day approaches, many veterans are instead turning to Donald J. Trump, a businessman who avoided the Vietnam draft and has boasted of gathering foreign policy wisdom by watching television shows.Even as other voters abandon Mr. Trump, veterans remain among his most loyal supporters, an unlikely connection forged by the widening gulf they feel from other Americans.After 15 years at war, many who served in Iraq or Afghanistan are proud of their service but exhausted by its burdens. They distrust the political class that reshaped their lives and are frustrated by how little their fellow citizens seem to understand about their experience.Perhaps most strikingly, they welcome Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt attacks on America\u2019s entanglements overseas.\u201cWhen we jump into wars without having a real plan, things like Vietnam and things like Iraq and Afghanistan happen,\u201d said William Hansen, a former Marine who served two National Guard tours in Iraq. \u201cThis is 16 years. This is longer than Vietnam.\u201dIn small military towns in California and North Carolina, veterans of all eras cheer Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to fire officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs. His attacks on political correctness evoke their frustrations with tortured rules of engagement crafted to serve political, not military, ends. In Mr. Trump\u2019s forceful assertion of strength, they find a balm for wounds that left them broken and torn.\u201cHe calls it out,\u201d said Joshua Macias, a former Navy petty officer and fifth-generation veteran who lives in the Tidewater region of Virginia, where he organized a \u201cVeterans for Trump\u201d group last year. \u201cWe have intense emotion connected to these wars. The way it was politicized, the way they changed the way we fight in a war setting \u2014 it\u2019s horrible how they did that.\u201dNow, as battlegrounds in the Middle East smoke and rumble once more, as V.A. wait times creep up instead of down, Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 and its resonance among veterans \u2014 is helping expose the gulf of culture and class between many Americans and those who fight wars in their name.Veterans are more likely than other Americans to view Mr. Trump favorably, and less likely to rate Mrs. Clinton positively. In mid-October, 43 percent of veterans expressed a favorable view of him in a Gallup tracking poll, while just 30 percent saw Mrs. Clinton positively.In interviews with more than three dozen veterans, many praised Mr. Trump for candidly criticizing the costs of war, an issue they see few politicians in either party taking on. And they are unconcerned with how or when he arrived at his positions.\u201cThe Iraq war was a disaster,\u201d said Dustin Stewart, a former Army captain and Iraq veteran. \u201cHe is at least not trying to tiptoe around it. And I think some of the other Republicans were afraid of it.\u201dIn the depths of the recession, veterans suffered higher than average unemployment. Career military retirees faced cuts to pensions after the sequester deal between President Obama and Congress, while other veterans endured long waits for the health care promised to them by the federal government.Medical advances reduced battlefield deaths but also, paradoxically, made veterans\u2019 sacrifice less visible to the public. They came home not in body bags but with missing limbs and traumatic brain injuries, leaving Americans less sensitive to the costs of further war, according to Douglas L. Kriner, a political scientist at Boston University who has studied post-9/11 veterans.Nonfatal casualties seem to \u201cnot have the political punch that fatal casualties do,\u201d Mr. Kriner said.Some former and current military personnel have embraced libertarian candidates, such as Ron Paul, a former United States representative from Texas, who criticized American interventions abroad. In 2012, Mr. Paul raised more money from active-duty service members during the early phase of the campaign than all other Republican candidates combined, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Mr. Stewart grew up in a conservative family in Texas, where Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show often played on the radio. In 2000, he cast a proud vote for George W. Bush. But six years later, he was leading an infantry platoon outside Ramadi, a hotbed of the insurgency then enveloping parts of Iraq. Mr. Stewart returned home alive but disillusioned. He supported Mr. Paul in the 2008 Republican primary race and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party nominee, in the 2012 election.\u201cI don\u2019t want pity. I just want people to care,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, adding, \u201cDo you know what your politicians are sending us to do?\u201dHis words startled the Republican establishment. But in the front row, Daniel Cortez nodded along. Mr. Cortez, a 65-year-old Marine Corps veteran who served in Vietnam, did not like everything about Mr. Trump. Yet he seemed to be speaking a different language, Mr. Cortez said in a recent interview, more like the one veterans themselves spoke. Mr. Trump argued for a military that was bigger and better equipped but also used more sparingly.\u201cMr. Trump is a breath of fresh air because he is promoting peace through strength,\u201d Mr. Cortez said.For some conservative veterans, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms of the Iraq war have allowed them to vent a stew of emotions: Relief and regret, bitterness and pride. They were repelled by liberal antiwar politics and felt little in common with the war\u2019s most prominent critics. So they held back their misgivings for years, unable to admit to their friends and sometimes themselves that so much had been wasted.\u201cNobody likes to say that George W. Bush was a bad president,\u201d said David Fuqua, who spent four years in the Marines and served in Afghanistan in 2011. \u201cHaving to defend the rationale for the Iraq war for so long, and then to have someone on the stage talk about how it was a mistake, touched a real nerve.\u201d\u201cThey look at Clinton as a continuance of what we\u2019ve had for the last 16 years through two administrations,\u201d said Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general who led the United States Central Command in the late 1990s.Where Mr. Bush acted rashly in sending troops into Iraq, some veterans said, the Obama administration had acted politically in pulling them out. When the black flags of the Islamic State rose over Falluja and Mosul two years ago, they recalled the sweat or blood they or their friends had shed there. Politicians had started the war, they felt, and politicians had lost it.\u201cThis war became so politicized, so P.C.,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. Mr. Trump might take them to war again, he had concluded, but Mr. Trump would not hold them back.\u201cUnder George, all we could do was straight right hooks and a couple of uppercuts,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. \u201cWhen Obama took over, we could only do straight lefts \u2014 and we had to say \u2018we\u2019re going to punch you\u2019 first.\u201dIn 2010, in a bloodily contested river valley in southern Afghanistan, Michael Verardo stepped on an old Russian-made land mine wired to two jugs packed with explosives, rocks and nails. He lost most of his leg immediately. To save his left arm, medics sewed it temporarily onto his back.Three years ago, Mr. Verardo and his wife, Sarah, moved to North Carolina, where the winters are easier. Though he has two Purple Hearts, it sometimes takes months for him to get an appointment with a neurologist at the V.A.This summer, at Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation, the family flew to Cleveland for the Republican National Convention. On the first night, Mr. Verardo and his wife sat in the V.I.P. box with Mr. Trump\u2019s family. Mr. Trump seemed to understand, Mr. Verardo recalled. Maybe he would be different.\u201cI think he\u2019s genuine,\u201d Mr. Verardo said.Mrs. Clinton, who has her own plan for improving V.A. care, said last year that the scandal had \u201cnot been as widespread as it has been made out to be.\u201d\u201cTrump was the first guy to recognize the populist appeal of this problem,\u201d said Paul J. Rieckhoff, the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.Mr. Trump has \u201can empathy and a sentiment about what the military has been through, the low morale,\u201d said Howie R. Lind, a Republican activist and former Navy commander who lives in Northern Virginia.Mr. Lind began hosting weekly Trump dinners for local veterans last spring, promoting them on Facebook, booking back rooms in diners. A few dozen people turned into 80, then 100.When Mr. Trump talks about veterans, Mr. Lind said, \u201cit\u2019s not like it\u2019s a \u2018them,\u2019 or a special interest group. It\u2019s America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American in a Strange Land", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "FeatureAfter more than a decade away, a foreign correspondent comes back to take stock of his divided homeland.Supported byI didn\u2019t really know how to respond. I hadn\u2019t lived in the United States since 2003, when The New York Times moved me to Beijing as a foreign correspondent, along with my wife and two kids. We assumed we would move back home soon enough, but it never happened. We lived for six years in China, where our third child was born, followed by four years in New Delhi, where my beat was South Asia. By the time we settled in Rome in 2013, we had drifted into the category of American expatriates. When we saw our countrymen around the city \u2014 big, friendly tourists, a bit loud \u2014 my kids referred to them as \u201cthe Americans.\u201dWe weren\u2019t completely cut off. Most summers, we visited family and friends in the States; the kids streamed the American shows; my wife listened to \u201cMorning Edition.\u201d I worked for an American company, for American bosses, and I wrote articles trying to explain the world to a mostly American audience. All of this created the gentle illusion that we were still truly connected to home. Yet as the years passed, I realized that I had lost touch, that the country I left was no longer the same.The year I moved away, George W. Bush stood beneath a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner on an aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. Facebook hadn\u2019t yet been turned into a company. The iPhone did not exist. I left before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, before Detroit went bankrupt. I missed the Great Recession (though I am still living the European translation of it). I missed most of the last two presidencies. I missed Brangelina.Instead, I witnessed from the other side the global forces that would bring profound changes to America. I visited industrial regions of southern China where the ground seemed to vibrate under the weight and bustle of all the countless new factories. Once iPhones had been invented, it was Chinese workers who assembled them. I watched Bangladeshi seamstresses stitch clothes sold at Walmart. American consumers benefited from the cheaper goods, but American manufacturers did not. Between January 2000 and December 2014, the United States lost roughly five million manufacturing jobs.Then I moved to Rome and watched the European Union grow ineffective and paralyzed, as the dream of a vibrant, unified Europe seemed to wither. Democracy was losing ground in Hungary and the Philippines; it had all but surrendered in Russia. Syria became a slaughterhouse. The Islamic State dispatched terrorists around the world. China\u2019s politics became more oppressive, as President Xi Jinping cracked down on dissent and nurtured a Maoist-style cult of personality. Economic globalization was supposed to accelerate political liberalization around the world, but instead authoritarianism appeared to be on the rise. The West, it seemed, had failed to anticipate the possibility that globalization could contribute to the destabilization of \u2014 or pose a threat to \u2014 democracy, even in the United States.This summer, I decided I wanted to explore this place that had become a foreign country to me. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. I planned a zigzag route, revisiting places where I once lived or worked, a 29-day sprint through 11 states (and four time zones). I knew I would be moving too fast to make any sweeping declaration about the state of America, and I wouldn\u2019t ask people which presidential candidate they were voting for. I was more interested in why they were so anxious about the present and the future. I wanted to find out why the country was fragmenting rather than binding together. Most of all I wanted to see with my own eyes what had changed \u2014 and so much had changed.When I asked if he had any concern about this election damaging American democracy, he said he didn\u2019t worry too much about that. He talked about the European Union as evidence of the political dangers posed by immigration and described \u201cethno-nationalism\u201d and economic nationalism as potent political forces. \u201cI look around the world, and I think all those countries are coming apart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think ours is going to come apart. The melting pot is not melting anymore.\u201dI mentioned that I was leaving the next day to travel along the Texas-Mexico border. Buchanan grimaced for a moment and jokingly offered to lend me a shotgun. I thanked him, and later I flew off into the heat.I had been in contact with United States Customs and Border Protection but never thought to mention my aerial tour. A few hours after we landed, an agency spokesman emailed me. He was friendly but anxious: Agents reported seeing someone taking photographs from a helicopter tracing the border. Was it us?I had gone to El Paso often as a national correspondent for The Times, and I always liked the atmosphere there. Everybody seemed to know everybody else. El Paso is isolated from most of Texas, yet Ju\u00e1rez lies no more than a long baseball toss away. There is a fluid give and take between the two sides, even as the disparities are stark: Ju\u00e1rez has frequently ranked among the most violent cities in the world, while El Paso routinely rates among the safest municipalities in the United States.My helicopter ride had come about in typical El Paso fashion: I called a state senator, who connected me to the county judge, who nudged a local businessman to organize the trip. They saw it as a good opportunity to help rebut the 2016 election narrative that the border was a lawless, out-of-control sieve through which illegal immigrants flooded north and wreaked violence upon unsuspecting Americans. The county judge, Veronica Escobar, had grown wearily accustomed to the assumptions made in other parts of the country. \u201cOne of the first questions people frequently ask is, Will I be safe?\u201d she told me. \u201cYou can tell people that deportations are up and that in-migration is down from Mexico. You can tell people that the border has never been safer. You can provide people with as many statistics as possible \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201dEscobar, a Democrat and El Paso County\u2019s highest elected official, grew up here and considers the city an unlikely oasis of tolerance. She is Mexican-American; the city\u2019s police chief is African-American. We had dinner my first night in El Paso, and when I mentioned something Pat Buchanan said to me \u2014 he dared me to drive around El Paso with a Trump bumper sticker on my car \u2014 she laughed. But she worried that El Paso was changing. Even some of her own relatives, people who had moved away from El Paso, have posted pro-Trump, anti-immigrant messages on Facebook. Fear and anger overcame the facts on the ground, she said.\u201cHow did America get that way?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dI was starting my journey in El Paso because six months earlier I was across the border in Ju\u00e1rez, on the outside of America, looking in. As a correspondent based in Rome, I also cover the Vatican, so I traveled with Pope Francis\u2019 retinue on his trip to Mexico in February. His final stop was Ju\u00e1rez. As he prayed for migrants at the border\u2019s edge, I stared through the fence into the United States. Snipers were posted on rooftops; police cars with flashing lights blocked an overpass; agents watched from horseback or peered across the border with binoculars. Presumably some of this was to protect the pope, but I flew back to Italy startled by this show of force, this demonstration of American power and anxiety.A girl playing at her house in Baton Rouge, La., not far from where the police shot and killed Alton Sterling.\u00a0Soon after setting out in my rental car from El Paso, I saw just how thoroughly the Texas border had become militarized. Since I left, the number of Border Patrol agents nationwide had roughly doubled, to more than 20,000, a vast majority of them stationed along the 1,989-mile border with Mexico. They have motion detectors, helicopters, cameras, fixed-wing aircraft and drones at their disposal. Their boats ply stretches of the Rio Grande. Texas state troopers have also been dispatched to \u201csecure the border.\u201dThe El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, who has criticized the buildup, told me that so many troopers were present that they often had little to do besides enforce traffic laws. \u201cIt is a waste of money,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cIt was a response to the rhetoric that the border is unsafe. And that is wrong.\u201d (A new study by the Border Network for Human Rights found that troopers have been disproportionately stopping Latino motorists in many border counties, including El Paso.) At a convention of the Texas Republican Party this year, Gov. Greg Abbott falsely stated that the Islamic State was \u201crunning through the border.\u201d In April 2015, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted that the Islamic State had a training camp in Mexico, near El Paso. Again, there was no evidence to back up the claim.Safety feels like a tenuous concept right now, when a malcontent can detonate a homemade bomb in Chelsea or suicide bombers can blow themselves up outside a soccer stadium in Paris. But so much of the safety rhetoric around the border blends legitimate concerns \u2014 especially when it comes to smuggled drugs, money and weapons moving in both directions \u2014 with political opportunism. The rate of people being apprehended while trying to cross the border from Mexico declined in 2015 and is now at its lowest point in more than 40 years. And even as President Obama pushed for immigration reform, his administration approved high numbers of deportations.One afternoon, I pulled up to a checkpoint on Interstate 10, about an hour or so east of El Paso, near the town of Sierra Blanca, Tex. A Border Patrol agent in a bulletproof vest asked if I was an American citizen while a dog sniffed the rental car for drugs. Less than an hour later, a Texas state trooper pulled me over on State Highway 90 in Presidio County for failing to use my blinker while changing lanes. The road was so quiet that a jack rabbit hopped across. The trooper asked if I was an American citizen, checked my passport and sent me on my way with a warning. Traffic enforcement.\u201cThis country is huge,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said one day. \u201cIt is like 50 countries all together.\u201dTom\u00e1s, a Chilean, has traveled the world, but this was his first long tour across the United States. On seeing one rural road sign, he asked what it meant to \u201cadopt a highway.\u201d Another day, another road sign: \u201cHitchhikers May Be Escaping Inmates.\u201d Tom\u00e1s was startled by how thoroughly so many American cities emptied out at night. In Colorado Springs, we attended a rodeo where the announcer made a long soliloquy praising our military for defending our freedom at home. Tom\u00e1s had embedded many times with American forces in Afghanistan. He liked the soldiers, but he didn\u2019t understand how sending troops to other countries, particularly Iraq, kept Americans free at home.Before the rodeo, I met two ranchers, Rob Alexander and Bill Craig. The air smelled faintly of horse manure as we sat on a plastic cooler drinking Coors. Alexander, 53, explained that the rodeo was a fund-raiser for ranch hands, who often lacked health insurance or a safety net to help out in emergencies. Ranching families had taken a hit in the past two decades, in part because trade agreements led to the consolidation of many cattle operations and an increase in imported beef from South America. Craig, 35, is a fourth-generation rancher, but he said land is now so expensive and profit so meager that he could never afford to start a ranch from scratch today. They talked like men whose lifestyles and values were endangered.\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWatch the TV. The moral compass is so far out of whack in our country right now.\u201dAt the University of Texas at Austin, I met Lisa Moore, a professor of English and women\u2019s studies who is one of three plaintiffs suing to overturn a new state law allowing students to carry concealed handguns on campus. Born in Canada but a resident of Texas for 27 years, Moore is a naturalized American citizen who is still a bit baffled by her new country. \u201cThat is the weirdness of the United States to me: Everybody is always talking about their rights,\u201d she said, while identity in Canada derives from the idea of the social compact.Moore is a gay, married mother of two children who teaches courses on L.G.B.T. literature. \u201cCampus carry\u201d infringes on free speech, she argues, by inhibiting her ability to provide a safe learning environment. What if a student becomes enraged by the subject matter and pulls out a Glock?American gun manufacturers produced 3.3 million guns the year I left for China, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. By 2014, the number was nine million (supplemented by 3.6 million guns imported into the country). According to some recent estimates, there are now roughly as many guns as people in the United States, maybe even more. To many foreigners, the American infatuation with guns is an inexplicable, if defining, national trait. On a taxi ride in Beijing once, the driver, upon discovering I was American, shaped his hand like a pistol and began shooting imaginary bullets.At a firing range outside Austin, I met six guys shooting semiautomatic rifles. Several of them worked for Defense Distributed, the open-source organization in Austin that came up with a plastic handgun whose design can be downloaded from the web and produced with a 3-D printer. The State Department ordered the company to remove the design code, but the company is challenging that order in court. For Benjamin Denio, at the time a 36-year-old who worked in desktop support and did product testing at Defense Distributed, being able to produce your own plastic gun is a safeguard against the tyranny of the state. \u201cThe term I would use to describe the level of vitriol in the country,\u201d Denio said, \u201cis that it is the \u2018cold civil war.\u2019\u2009\u201dI was running into so many disgruntled people that I began to worry, as I dipped in and out of places, that I was inadvertently being drawn to angry people. I figured I would get a taste of Middle America by stopping in Russell, Kan., which I visited 20 years earlier when a local hero, Bob Dole, was the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Walking along the redbrick Main Street, I saw a crowd streaming out of a local theater. Inside, Christina Fowler, a pastor, had just finished services for her nondenominational congregation. Today was her son\u2019s birthday, and she invited me to a potluck lunch with the congregation in her backyard.Everyone sat at folding tables eating potato salad and lasagna. I sat with the associate pastor, Lonnie Whitten Jr., and a congregant named Cindy, who asked that her last name not be published. Whitten, who had a bushy ZZ Top beard and arms covered in tattoos, described himself as a reformed bad boy. This congregation, he said, was moving away from the culture of the \u201ccorporate church\u201d and also opposed same-sex marriage. Cindy had been part of a local delegation taken to San Diego for the 1996 Republican National Convention as living proof of Dole\u2019s hometown values. \u201cWe were treated like royalty!\u201d she said. Now 59, Cindy explained that too many ministers around the country watered down the true message of the Gospel, serving up baby food, not meat. And what was the real message? That homosexuality is a sin. That Islam is incompatible with Christianity.\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time when someone gives the signal,\u201d she told me of Muslims living in America, \u201cand we\u2019re all going to be beheaded.\u201dI ate some potato salad, a bit stunned.Living in Louisiana in the 1990s, I regularly visited the capital for stories about state politics. I thought back to 1991, when the white supremacist David Duke made it to a runoff in his gubernatorial campaign against Edwin Edwards, the former Democratic governor who was perpetually under investigation for corruption. \u201cVote for the Crook: It\u2019s Important,\u201d his supporters\u2019 bumper stickers read. (Years later, he was finally convicted.) Now Duke is running for the Senate, and his re-emergence has coincided with the racial splintering of Baton Rouge.On July 5, Alton Sterling was shot by the police as he sold CDs outside a convenience store. The police shooting of yet another black man, captured on video, became a national scandal. Twelve days later, a black veteran of the Marines shot six law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, killing three, including one who was black.One afternoon, Lionel Bazile Jr. picked me up at my hotel for a tour of the neighborhood where Sterling was killed. Bazile, a 66-year-old retired postman, is a Roman Catholic and a member of an interracial, interfaith coalition called Together Baton Rouge. It was founded about six years ago, after a prominent black pastor, Lee T. Wesley, led an outreach effort to some white ministers and community leaders because he felt the city was dangerously, if silently, divided. That split became clear when a predominantly white group of organizers in southern Baton Rouge sought to create their own school system and, ultimately, incorporate their own city, St. George. They needed a new school system, they argued, because the East Baton Rouge Parish schools were struggling. But carving out a wealthy area of Baton Rouge as a new municipality would have drained tax revenues from the surrounding city and gutted the funding for Baton Rouge public schools. The new municipality was also laid out to include the Mall of Louisiana, a major source of sales-tax revenue. Bazile, along with others from Together Baton Rouge, helped defeat the St. George movement, but the underlying problems had hardly gone away.\u201cNow we are crossing Florida Boulevard,\u201d Bazile told me as we rode in his truck. \u201cWe call Florida Boulevard the Mason-Dixon line that divides Baton Rouge.\u201dOnce we entered North Baton Rouge, the historically black section of the city, the road immediately became bumpier. According to Bazile, the neighborhood received only a small slice of the money from the citywide road-improvement project. \u201cYou are not going to see too many shopping centers around here,\u201d he said as we passed dilapidated strip malls. We drove by a hospital where the emergency room had been closed down. During our drive, I did not see a single national chain store.North Baton Rouge had apparently died from gradual abandonment. Most politicians ignored the neighborhood. When crime began to rise, Bazile\u2019s home was burglarized four times, and the value of his property began to depreciate. He and his family moved out, as did many middle-class black families. The Mall of Louisiana opened in the late 1990s near the city\u2019s predominantly white southern suburbs and soon became a magnet for more public and private investment. \u201cNorth Baton Rouge was dying,\u201d Bazile said, \u201cbut southern Baton Rouge was booming.\u201dBazile and I pulled into the parking lot of the Triple S Food Mart, where Sterling was killed. Someone had painted Sterling\u2019s image on the side of the store, and soggy bouquets of flowers and tributes lay piled on the pavement. Veda Washington-Abusaleh, one of Sterling\u2019s aunts, stood nearby with a protest poster rolled up in her hands. She told me she was out there every day. When I explained that I was a journalist, she began shouting. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing changed!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still the same. I can tell you what needs to change! White police officers need to be better trained.\u201d She pointed to the spot in the parking lot where activists and political leaders erected a stage in the days after the killing. \u201cRight where his blood stained the street,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt is a political thing for them. But I want justice.\u201dA lot of people did. Today, Baton Rouge is a reminder of the entrenched racial and economic segregation in many American cities. Nationally, stubborn disparities remain between whites and blacks as far as income, college-graduation levels and employment. The median adjusted income for white households was roughly $71,300 in 2014, compared with $43,300 for black ones. The median net worth of white households is about 13 times as high as that of black ones, according to the most recent figures from the Pew Research Center. John Logan, a sociologist at Brown University, told me that racially biased economic development is one reason these disparities remain entrenched. Black communities have been routinely passed over for commercial projects, like shopping malls, which attract other development projects and lift property values.On my last morning in Baton Rouge, I met Gary Chambers Jr., a black civil rights advocate and journalist who was a leader of the protests over the Sterling killing. We met at an IHOP, which Chambers picked because the franchise was black-owned. Chambers had become an outspoken advocate for North Baton Rouge and a blunt critic of the city\u2019s racial status quo. He blamed the police and politicians, including the city\u2019s black mayor. Chambers described his own agenda as being unabashedly \u201cpro-black.\u201d \u201cWe are supposed to live in this society where we want everybody to be a part of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd we do. But I live in Baton Rouge, and it\u2019s just not the case.\u201dTo Chambers, the Sterling killing was as much about economics as bad policing. \u201cWhy is Alton Sterling selling CDs in the middle of the night, outside a convenience store in the hood?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have economic opportunities in North Baton Rouge.\u201d When I mentioned Together Baton Rouge and the efforts to build deeper relationships between whites and blacks, Chambers chuckled softly and then paused a moment. \u201cThey are all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying.\u201dBut I could tell he was skeptical. He told me that it was time for the older generation to simply get out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m 31,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve been in office since the \u201980s and my community looks like this, then you have some blame. My generation is inheriting this. We didn\u2019t create this. So don\u2019t tell us how to feel about it.\u201dA week or so after I left Baton Rouge, the city flooded; some areas were inundated with six to eight feet of water. Parts of the region were declared disaster areas. After I sent a sympathy note to Broderick Bagert, an organizer of Together Baton Rouge, he wrote back: \u201cWe\u2019ll invite you back when the plague of locusts arrives, which I understand is expected to be next week.\u201dThis has pushed some low-income people onto the streets, or out of the city, and intensified the pressure on street people to move on, often to the Tenderloin and other commercial neighborhoods downtown. After three days in the city, Tom\u00e1s and I were dazed by what we had seen: drug addicts shooting up; two people engaging in oral sex, in broad daylight; a young woman vomiting on the sidewalk, unable to digest a donated pastry; homeless people camping on streets that reeked of urine; two old men, wheeling their possessions in dueling grocery carts, fighting midday on Market Street near the offices of Twitter, with one man waving a steel rod and the other swinging a bear knife until the police arrived.\u201cHomelessness issues are very real, but they are also very symbolic of so many other inequities and stressors that are happening in the city,\u201d Peter Cohen, an affordable-housing advocate, told me one morning. \u201cYou say, What\u2019s the problem? The tech economy is booming. Employment is up. It only becomes apparent when you drill down to the level of the neighborhood. We are struggling in San Francisco, to some extent, with the excesses of wealth that have concentrated here.\u201dIn the November elections, San Francisco has multiple local ballot initiatives related to homelessness (which has been a woefully nonexistent issue in the presidential campaign). There is also a battle over the rapidly expanding sharing economy, some of whose largest companies were started in the area. Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco, markets thousands of units in the city and spent heavily to defeat a local ballot initiative last November that would have severely restricted short-term rentals. In June, the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved some restrictions anyway, prompting a lawsuit from Airbnb. Whatever the outcome, the usual parameters of housing issues \u2014 say, tenants versus landlords \u2014 seem forever changed.Dale Carlson, a consultant who has played a central role in the political fight against Airbnb, said the sharing economy has contributed to the rise in rents and has encouraged some landlords to evict tenants and convert apartments to short-term rentals. (Advocates for house-sharing platforms say the rentals are vital in helping people make extra money to afford the high cost of living in the city.)\u201cIt\u2019s essentially, Who gets to live here?\u201d Carlson said of the political fight. \u201cAnd who is squeezed out?\u201dOne day, I drove down Highway 101 to Silicon Valley to meet Reid Hoffman, a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock and the chairman of LinkedIn, the professional-social-networking company, which was then in the process of being sold to Microsoft for $26.2 billion. Hoffman founded LinkedIn the same year I left for Beijing; now he was a billionaire. He is politically active, having supported and advised Obama and raised money for and donated money to Hillary Clinton. I mentioned how the election had become a referendum of sorts on globalization and trade, yet there had been little discussion about the next big earthquake \u2014 artificial intelligence, or the approaching world of self-driving cars, smartphones that can diagnose a melanoma and much more. Globalization may have ravaged blue-collar America, but artificial intelligence could cut through the white-collar professions in much the same way.Hoffman said the reactions to artificial intelligence range from utopian to dystopian. The utopians predict huge productivity gains and rapid advances in medicine, genetic sequencing, fighting climate change and other areas. The dystopians predict a \u201cRobocalypse\u201d in which machines supplant people and, possibly, threaten humanity itself. \u201cMy point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it is a massive transformation and does really impact the future of humanity, but that we can steer it more toward utopia rather than dystopia with intelligence and diligence.\u201dEither way, another major economic shift is coming, perhaps sooner than people realize. Hoffman said that many of the jobs in today\u2019s economy will change fundamentally during the next 20 years. On the same day I met with Hoffman, Uber announced a pilot program to test self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. It also bought a company developing self-driving trucks. \u201cWe have to make sure that we don\u2019t have a massive imbalance of society by which you have a small number of people that own the robots and everyone else is scrambling,\u201d he said.Back in the Tenderloin, I met with Del Seymour, a former drug dealer who runs a nonprofit organization called Code Tenderloin, in which he trains local low-income people for the job market. In recent years, the city had granted major tax breaks to companies that opened offices in the area, and Seymour offered tours to show tech workers their new neighborhood. I joined a small group from Zendesk, a cloud-based customer-service software company founded in Denmark whose headquarters are in the Tenderloin. Its employees had already done volunteer work with a local nonprofit organization, distributing clean syringes to local drug users to prevent the spread of AIDS. It was not the usual tech job.The tour ended inside the Cadillac Hotel. Jerry Garcia once lived there in the early 1960s, Muhammad Ali once sparred there, and it now has many subsidized rooms for low-income residents. Seymour asked the Zendesk employees to sit in the lobby and praised the company for its volunteer work. But then he pointed out that tech companies hire more than just techies \u2014 about 30 percent of the jobs, he said, did not require technical training. He told them how he was once one of the biggest dope dealers on Taylor Street. He had changed, however, and other people in the Tenderloin could, too. \u201cLet us in your back door,\u201d he said, his voice rising like that of a preacher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your food. We don\u2019t want your sympathy. We want jobs.\u201d\u201cThere will be fires tonight,\u201d Elaine Cromie said as we drove through the city streets. \u201cThat is for sure.\u201dCromie, a freelance news photographer, was giving me a tour of the city. Even though Detroit was out of bankruptcy and downtown boosters were pushing a resurgence narrative, the arson fires were still happening often enough that the local media had to pick and choose which ones to cover. \u201cIt\u2019s really only news if it is a hazardous-materials fire,\u201d she said.We turned onto Goldengate Street and parked near a few vacated houses. Trees still shaded the rotting homes where middle-class families once lived, before many of them walked away from bad mortgages. The emptiness of some streets reminded me of photographs of the depopulated, decaying buildings left behind after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. That part of Ukraine has been largely without people for 30 years and is now known as the Zone of Alienation, which seemed like a fitting phrase to describe parts of Detroit too.Five years back, the organizers of Occupy Detroit spent the winter on Goldengate, but the anticapitalist movement fizzled and the street today is mostly populated by hippies and squatters. It is, in fact, a counterculture oasis, known as Fireweed Universe-City. Cromie was looking for a guy who was supposed to connect us with a community leader, Doctor Bob, but instead we bumped into Zack Zduniak. Zduniak, 26, had simply checked out of mainstream America, which today\u2019s Detroit made possible.Zduniak grew up in suburban St. Clair Shores in an era of diminished prospects, while the local auto industry declined. He liked living off the grid, but it wasn\u2019t easy; he was sleeping with his cat in a friend\u2019s delivery truck. He worked part-time at a restaurant, sometimes foraged for berries and knew which churches gave out free food. Visitors turned up, often Europeans, some via couchsurfing.com, for a binge of partying or a voyeuristic taste of life on the antimaterialist fringe. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be involved in this crazy, consumerist society,\u201d he told me.Zduniak thought Doctor Bob could better represent the community, so we knocked on his door. Bob Pizzimenti is a chiropractor, urban farmer and the proprietor of the healing center and vegetarian cafe down the street, which was the only nearby outpost of private enterprise that I spotted. Everyone called him Doctor Bob. He bought his two-story brick house six years ago for $1,400 when others were fleeing. He liked that there were seemingly no rules in Detroit. He bought several empty lots around his house and planted corn and other vegetables on them. He wanted a different type of community, something new. He thought America had lost its way.Advertisement"}

It has also highlighted some fundamental truths about the United States circa 2016, lessons that political leaders should heed beyond Tuesday\u2019s elections.But Mr. Trump has outdone even Bernie Sanders in tapping this anxiety. While economic worries cut across all demographic lines, he has gotten away with exploiting the real concerns by attacking immigrants and trade agreements, but offering no cogent policies for creating good jobs and lifting wages. His economic and tax proposals would hurt ordinary workers and blow a hole through the federal budget. By contrast, Hillary Clinton has offered practical ideas that could improve the economic situation for most Americans.These proposals are a powerful response to the anti-government zealots who have hogtied Congress into inaction on anything besides futile, partisan investigations.

{"Headline": "What Is a TinyLetter? Like Ye Olde Blog, but Less Public", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byFuture TenseLet\u2019s recap \u2014 not the election or imposture of Mr. Trump, but the trajectory of the mass-distributed personal update.In the beginning, there was the holiday letter, an annual mimeographed review delivered by post to a roster of relatives and friends.This was followed by the advent of blogs, and the private suddenly went public. These were soon usurped by social networking applications, especially Facebook, which enabled even the technically challenged to relay news about their lives to a wide spectrum of people, not always their intimates, and at more frequent intervals.But there was more to come. We now find ourselves in the era of the personal email newsletter, an almost retro delivery system that blurs borders between the public and the private, and mashes up characteristics of the analog and digital ages.But this is not quite the Wild West of standard social media, in which just about anyone can follow anyone and comment on or repost previous updates. TinyLetter, a free service, caps subscribers at 5,000 per newsletter (users who want more can pay for a MailChimp account), so it is not a platform for celebrities who want to capitalize on their popularity.With its twee name and Etsy-fied graphic design (the \u201ci\u201d in \u201cTinyLetter\u201d is sometimes dotted with a heart), it\u2019s more of a small-batch brew tailored to the creative class, particularly those seeking to hone their prose skills in a semipublic forum.Bucking the stricter limits of Twitter and Facebook posts, these TinyLetters can be any length, and can be seen as an epistolary backlash to the complexity-stunting brevity of social media. Unlike a personal email or postal letter, however, TinyLetters go to multiple recipients, just like that old family newsletter, and a performative element inevitably enters into the composition.Their creators, though, tend to profess modesty.\u201cI was a blocked writer and wanted to start writing something that was low stakes and didn\u2019t have to be perfect,\u201d said Ruth Curry, a co-publisher of the independent literary imprint Emily Books.Yet because of the subscription limit and the fact that users can remove recipients from the mailing list, TinyLetters carry a greater impression of privacy than blogs.\u201cI felt like people took advantage of my self-disclosure and vulnerability there \u2014 they would write crazy emails that were unhinged and entitled and abusive,\u201d Ms. Shane said of her blog. \u201cTinyLetter did a good job mitigating that. There\u2019s a sense of intimacy that\u2019s reciprocal with delivering an email direct to your inbox.\u201dThe partially closed format also helped further protect the identities of her anonymous clients, and she appreciated knowing exactly who was reading (or at least the email address being used).Ms. Kreizman said her subscribers take her recommendations seriously, and editors have inquired about writer friends whose work she has promoted. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite experience \u2014 doing the book matchmaking,\u201d she said.There is an old-fashioned aspect to the TinyLetter. Entries can be archived for public consumption, effectively turning it into a blog. But some writers, such as Ms. Shane, do not save them for posterity, so the only way to read certain newsletters is to subscribe and receive them at the moment they are sent.Thus they hark back to the ephemerality of pre-internet media consumption, when one likely had to buy a periodical to read that specific issue or watch a TV show in its broadcast time slot or else risk missing it forever.\u201cI liked the challenge of getting people to stick with it without a bunch of back story,\u201d Ms. Shane said, observing that the absence of previous entries for some of her recipients altered her writing style from that on her blogs. \u201cI tried to keep a more coherent, stronger narrative going, so that even if somebody got a letter and didn\u2019t know the particulars of my life, it would be accessible and engaging enough. My blog had less of a narrative \u2014 it was more a collection of anecdotes.\u201dBut not everyone\u2019s confidence (or career) will get a boost from the service, which provides click metrics on individual letters and subscribers. You can easily see if a friend you have signed up (or those who have voluntarily subscribed) has no interest in your newsletter. Even worse, users may elect to be notified if someone has unsubscribed, making it harder to opt out without causing some friction.Understandably, not all TinyLetter writers choose to tick this box.\u201cThere\u2019s enough heartache in the world,\u201d Ms. Kreizman said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "While We Weren\u2019t Looking, Snapchat Revolutionized Social Networks", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSnap Inc., the parent company of the popular photo-messaging and storytelling app Snapchat, is having a productive autumn.And yet, even when it\u2019s grabbing headlines, it often seems as if Snap gets little respect.This is all wrong. If you secretly harbor the idea that Snapchat is frivolous or somehow a fad, it\u2019s time to re-examine your certainties. In fact, in various large and small ways, Snap has quietly become one of the world\u2019s most innovative and influential consumer technology companies.Snap, which is based far outside the Silicon Valley bubble, in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, is pushing radically new ideas about how humans should interact with computers. It is pioneering a model of social networking that feels more intimate and authentic than the Facebook-led ideas that now dominate the online world. Snap\u2019s software and hardware designs, as well as its marketing strategies, are more daring than much of what we\u2019ve seen from tech giants, including Apple.Snap is still relatively small; its 150 million daily user base pales in comparison to Facebook\u2019s 1.2 billion, and its success is far from assured. In its novelty, it can sometimes veer toward the bizarre and inscrutable. And it\u2019s not obvious that all of its advances are positive. (For instance, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s always better for our relationships to lose a record of our chats with friends.)Yet it\u2019s no wonder that Facebook and its subsidiaries appear obsessed with imitating Snap. As a font of ideas that many in the tech industry hadn\u2019t considered before, Snap isn\u2019t just popular, but also increasingly important.\u201cRegardless of what happens, they\u2019ve reshaped the social media landscape,\u201d said Joseph B. Bayer, a communications professor at Ohio State University who has studied Snapchat\u2019s impact on how people communicate. \u201cThey\u2019re making risky moves, trying to rethink what people want online as opposed to taking what\u2019s already been done and adding a new flash.\u201dTechies value disruption, and it\u2019s difficult to think of another online company that has shuffled the status quo as consistently as Snap has over the past few years.Before Snapchat, the industry took for granted that everything users posted to the internet should remain there by default. Saving people\u2019s data \u2014 and then constantly re-examining it to create new products and advertising \u2014 is the engine that supports behemoths like Google and Facebook.The diminution of personalization algorithms and virality also plays into how Snapchat treats news. Snapchat\u2019s primary format is called a Story, a slide show of a user\u2019s video clips that are played in chronological order. This, too, is an innovation; before Snapchat, much online content, from blogs to tweets, was consumed in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the oldest. Snapchat\u2019s Stories, which have since been widely copied, ushered in a more natural order \u2014 start at the beginning and go from there.A few years ago, insiders at Snapchat noticed that Stories were an ideal vehicle for relaying news. They could be crowdsourced: If a lot of people were at a concert or sporting event or somewhere that breaking news was occurring, a lot of them were likely to be snapping what was happening. If Snapchat offered them a way to submit their clips, it could spot the best ones and add them to a narrative compilation of the event.While Silicon Valley was shunning editing and curation done by humans, and instead relying on computers to spot and disseminate news, Snapchat began hiring producers and reporters to assemble clips into in-depth pieces.The company calls these Live Stories, and they have been transformative, unlike any other news presentation you can find online. Every day, Snapchat offers one or several stories about big and small events happening in the world, including football games, awards shows and serious news.For instance, this summer, while the rest of the media were engulfed by Hurricane Trump, Snapchat\u2019s news team spent days following the devastating floods in Louisiana. That in itself was unusual, but Snap\u2019s presentation was also groundbreaking: Rather than showing the overhead shots or anchor stand-ups that are conventional on TV news, Snapchat offered video from inside people\u2019s houses, from shelters, from schools. It mixed the macrostory of an impending natural disaster and the government\u2019s response to it with the microtragedies of personal loss, and even the lighter moments of humor and boredom in between.Snapchat has said that it thinks of itself as a camera company rather than a social network. This sounds like marketing puffery (after all, it only just started making its first actual camera, Spectacles), but I think its determination to set itself apart from the rest of the tech industry is important to note.Snap can free itself from Silicon Valley\u2019s accepted norms because it doesn\u2019t think of itself as just another Silicon Valley tech company. It\u2019s time we all started to see it that way, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Snapchat Is Shaping Social Media", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byCreated in 2011 by two Stanford University fraternity brothers, Evan Spiegel, 26, and Bobby Murphy, 28, the Snapchat app lets people send messages that disappear. The ephemeral messaging quickly caught on with college and high school students, some of whom used the app to send racy messages and other juvenilia. Last fall, Snapchat changed its name to Snap, indicating that it planned to expand as a company beyond the messaging app. Snap, based in Venice, Calif., also released Spectacles, which are sunglasses with an embedded camera.Snapchat is full of entertaining and addictive features. They include:Advertisers can also buy a geofilter. The luxury jeweler Tiffany created a geofilter that worked only when someone was in a Tiffany store. Advertisers can create their own Stories, or create more traditional 10-second video ads that run during Live Stories.Snapchat started out as a company for young people. But much like Facebook, which began as a service for high school and college students, Snapchat has started attracting older adults. More than 40 percent of the United States population from ages 18 to 34 use the Snapchat app, and more than half of all new users in the country are older than 25, according to the company.

{"Headline": "Online, Everything Is Alternative Media", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBreitbart, the website at the center of the self-described alternative online media, is planning to expand in the United States and abroad. The site, whose former chairman became the chief executive of Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign in August, has been emboldened by the victory of its candidate.Breitbart was always bullish on Mr. Trump\u2019s chances, but the site seems far more certain of something else, as illustrated by a less visible story it published on election night, declaring a different sort of victory: \u201cBreitbart Beats CNN, HuffPo for Total Facebook Engagements for Election Content.\u201dIt was a type of story the site publishes regularly. In August: \u201cBreitbart Jumps to #11 on Facebook for Overall Engagement.\u201d In June: \u201cBreitbart Ranked #1 in the World for Political Social Media; Beats HuffPo by 2 Million.\u201d Late last year: \u201cBreitbart News #6 for Most Comments Among English Facebook Publishers Globally.\u201dA sample ranking of the most-shared sites on Facebook from January had Breitbart at No. 14, just behind ABC and The Washington Post, but ahead of Bleacher Report, Comicbook.com, Yahoo and The Hill. The month before, the site ranked between the BBC and The Guardian, just behind The New York Times, which was at No. 7.These told, narrowly, the story of reach on a new platform \u2014 one that the news industry was still coming to terms with as it redefined the terms of consumption. At the same time, they signaled much broader changes: On social platforms, all media had become marginal; elsewhere, much of the media was in structural collapse.Growing distribution systems belonged to technology companies and their users. Publishers had become mere guests, their own distribution systems, like printed newspapers, stagnant or shrinking. So a news organization\u2019s ranking in that online world \u2014 one in which the importance of legacy was diminished \u2014 meant something.Faith in the importance of social metrics was a common trait among pro-Trump media, and for obvious reasons. They were clear indicators of support, participation and success, though exposed to no methodology. They were relative to other media and, by proxy, to politics.In an interview in June, Mr. Bozell spoke more strategically: \u201cWe want people to come to our website, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s designed to do. It\u2019s Marketing 101: Go to where people are at.\u201dMuch action during the campaign, therefore, was with the tens of millions of Americans who experience media and political campaigns through Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other social media platforms. Everything else was on the outside, fighting its way in.The mainstream media was more allergic to this idea because it had more to lose: its business models, and its self-image as arbiter of fact and fiction and as agenda-setter.Still, major media companies reluctantly adjusted with more open partisanship and clearer motivation, aside from comprehensively describing the world, to challenge the legitimacy of Mr. Trump. This coverage crystallized for many in establishing Mr. Trump as not just a bad choice but also a threat.But even this aggressive, oppositional coverage \u2014 much of it thorough and hard-won, like stories about Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes or his charitable foundation \u2014 was delivered with presumptions of trust and common language, and with the privileged expectation of the benefit of the doubt. It was a season of escalating \u201cdisqualifying\u201d stories that were processed predictably by receptive audiences and ignored or rationalized by others.An alternative, oppositional media expects this response and doubles down; a media accustomed to power, or proximity to power, is dumbfounded by it.For legacy news media operations to behave as outsiders could be invigorating. Treating access as strictly transactional, rather than as some sort of norm, could reduce, or make transparent, its role in the reporting process. To focus solely on holding power to account is as concise a definition of journalism as I can think of.But these hopes butt up against commercial interests and an instinct for self-preservation. A purely aggressive CNN, for instance, would be a very different operation, less lucrative and probably much smaller. And the self-identified alternative media of this election was, on the other hand, unembarrassed by its ideology, aggressive not merely in the pursuit of stories but in the election of one candidate and the destruction of another. It was willing to submit to new distribution systems to benefit from them, and openly prioritized this, along with its animating political cause, above all else.It is telling that nobody quite knows what to ask of Facebook now that the election is over. To rid itself of false news? (How?) To help users cross ideological lines? (In which directions?) Such questions are asked with an eerily similar presumption: that by merely pointing out the popularity of fake news or misrepresentative content that appeared on the platform during the election, the point is made and will be heeded. This is also visible in the many \u201cwhat we could have done differently\u201d articles, which contain obvious presumptions of power and control \u2014 the belief, held throughout the campaign, by outlets that they, and not the audience, were in charge of the story, or popular perception.Facebook has remained passive, taking shelter behind claims that it is a tech company rather than a media company. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, in a Facebook post on Thursday, wrote that \u201cwe are all blessed to have the ability to make the world better, and we have the responsibility to do it.\u201d Twitter\u2019s chief, Jack Dorsey, was similarly noncommittal in a series of tweets: \u201cWe are one country, and we have one goal: Provide for the common good.\u201dMr. Bozell, in June, described Facebook as a \u201cmarketplace for conservatism,\u201d a suggestion that doubles as an attempt to define that vague distinction between tech and media: Tech creates marketplaces, and everyone else merely participates. It is also a reminder that markets are not neutral, but that it is in their creators\u2019 interest to suggest they are.To accept marginality as fate was one difficult option for those in the media; to defy it was another. To ignore it, however, was not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Leaders Gather to Grapple With Donald Trump\u2019s Victory", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 An emergency meeting of European Union foreign ministers on Sunday was the latest sign of the global disquiet in the wake of the election of Donald J. Trump, who has questioned some of the central tenets of American foreign policy.A number of European countries face the same powerful populist forces that elevated Mr. Trump. Some, like Hungary, may be prepared to embrace changes that could include warmer ties with Russia. Others, like Poland, want to double down on the decades-old trans-Atlantic alliance, with NATO as its cornerstone.There were concerns in some European capitals that scheduling the gathering before Mr. Trump appointed a secretary of state or announced his policy agenda cast too much doubt on his ability to devise a working relationship with Europe.Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, also did not attend the dinner, a decision that French officials attributed to scheduling issues, and Hungary\u2019s foreign minister did not make it, either. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary described Mr. Trump\u2019s win as \u201cgreat news\u201d on his Facebook page.Ms. Mogherini emphasized Europe\u2019s potential to be \u201ca superpower\u201d in an era of global cooperation after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. But the list of foreign policy challenges that Europe faces has grown longer.Before the gathering, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, underscored his concerns by warning in an opinion piece for The Observer, a British newspaper, that the West faced its greatest security challenge in a generation.But regional analysts are still grappling with the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s win, particularly for Europe. \u201cThe entire European project has always taken place in the context of American hegemony and the security guarantee, and all of that now is in question,\u201d Hans Kundnani, a senior trans-Atlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, said in an interview on Sunday.\u201cThe argument that Europeans finally pull together as a result of the election of Trump could be very wrong, as it may well sharpen their differences and help pull them even further apart,\u201d Mr. Kundnani said.Miroslav Lajcak, the Slovak foreign minister, told reporters after the dinner that concerns that Mr. Trump would base his policies on friendly relations with Mr. Putin could turn out to be overblown.\u201cThere is always a distance between a candidate and an elected president, so I don\u2019t really believe we have to waste our time speculating about this kind of stuff,\u201d Mr. Lajcak said.The meeting did give ministers an opportunity to process Mr. Trump\u2019s victory before moving forward with a long-planned meeting on Monday to outline incremental steps toward greater defense cooperation.The plan for greater cooperation, which has been in the works since long before the United States\u2019 presidential election, is intended to complement NATO, rather than provide an alternative to American-backed collective defense. An outline of the plan, which was still being discussed on Sunday, is expected to recommend steps toward more joint military procurement, activating dormant battle groups and centralizing more military decision-making in Brussels.That will do little to address the immediate threats to the bloc from Turkey\u2019s slide toward authoritarianism, the war in Syria and Russian aggression in Ukraine.Some member nations, including Austria, were expected to push on Monday to suspend talks with Turkey about its application for membership in the European Union because of a crackdown by the Turkish government after an attempted coup in July. But no immediate decisions were expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Female Solidarity", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisThe dream of female solidarity is, and always has been, a myth.Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign tried to tap into that dream. She dressed in white, evoking the suffragists and the hope of shattering the highest glass ceiling. She played up issues like child care and equal pay that polling showed had cross-party, cross-gender support. Her ads pounded away at Donald J. Trump\u2019s misogyny, hoping to lure women who would be reminded of all they had suffered in their own lives.Fifty-three percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump.The dream that women would vote for a woman overlooked the seductive pulls and interactions among party, class and racial identity that have long divided women as much as their gender was assumed to unite them.\u201cFrom the 19th century on, women saw themselves as different, cleaning up and perfecting the public sphere,\u201d said Theda Skocpol, a professor of sociology and government at Harvard. \u201cThe early suffragists believed as soon as the vote came in, women would show the same sense of solidarity. But that didn\u2019t prove to be true at all.\u201dThe first rule of political scientists who study gender is that party identification is the surest predictor of how someone will vote. And at the end of the day, Republican women voted Republican.\u201cWhether there\u2019s a D or an R in front of your name is way more a cue to the voters than the presence or absence of the Y chromosome,\u201d said Jennifer L. Lawless, a professor of government at American University.Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster, said, \u201cDemocrats never win white women.\u201dWhile Democrats have won some blue-collar white women in the past, in this election, class emerged as a powerful and divisive force that swung decisively Republican. All the talk about angry white men glossed over the fact that they were married to angry white women.Education was the great divide, for women as for men. Mr. Trump won 62 percent of white women without college degrees; Mrs. Clinton, 34 percent.\u201cClass shapes gender identity,\u201d said Nancy Isenberg, the author of \u201cWhite Trash,\u201d which examined how elites have derided rural, working-class Americans from the Colonial era to this day. \u201cI think a lot of people who support Trump think of themselves as being disinherited. They resent the fact that everything they believe in is mocked by the media elite, Hollywood, those boogeymen. That resentment is shared by men and women.\u201dIn the aftermath of the vote, the internet was flooded with plaintive and angry accusations of betrayal from African-Americans and Latinas who noted that they had voted for Mrs. Clinton by large majorities.\u201cThat sense of betrayal is sincere and comes from a place in which there was an optimism about solidarity from white-collar women,\u201d said Salamishah Tillet, an associate professor of English and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt\u2019s not like black people or Latino people aren\u2019t sexist and patriarchal. But when we thought about our self and collective best interest, we voted for Clinton.\u201dRacial fears and competition played a role for women as they did for men.\u201cThere is a racial element to this,\u201d Ms. Isenberg said of the white working-class women\u2019s votes for Mr. Trump. \u201cThey do what\u2019s right. Go to church. Try to support their families. They turn around and the rug is being pulled out from them. Groups who they see as economic competition, African-Americans and immigrants, they\u2019re getting an advantage that is not extended to poor rural whites.\u201dWomen were upset by Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior \u2014 his mockery of a former Miss Universe, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, accusations piling up \u2014 across party and class lines. Yet many voted for him anyway. Of women who voted for Mr. Trump, 78 percent said they were bothered to some extent, and 11 percent a lot, by his treatment of women.Two key constituencies Mrs. Clinton hoped might break from him chose him in the end \u2014 Republican suburban women overwhelmingly, and independent suburban women, 55 percent to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 38 percent.At a Trump rally in western Pennsylvania a few days after the tape came out in October, many women said they didn\u2019t like his comments but dismissed them as how men talk when they\u2019re alone \u2014 and some women, too.\u201cAt times, Donald Trump is crass,\u201d said Robbie Matuszko, who attended the rally with her grown son. But she argued that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband had \u201cdisgraced\u201d the White House. \u201cI would gladly see a woman in the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not under a desk in the White House.\u201dWhat did female Trump voters care about more than any mythical idea of gender solidarity? Exit polls show that they were most worried about immigration, terrorism and the impact of trade on jobs. They thought Obamacare went too far, and the government was too intrusive.These are the kinds of issues that have motivated women to vote Republican in past elections, said Ms. Lake, who wrote \u201cWhat Do Women Want?\u201d with Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager.And women can be just as prone to gender stereotypes as men.\u201cWe knew going into this election how much hatred there was for Hillary, and a lot of that hatred was from women,\u201d said Lynn Povich, the author of \u201cThe Good Girls Revolt.\u201d \u201cWhy? Because she didn\u2019t leave Bill? Because she didn\u2019t want to bake cookies? Because she\u2019s a crook?\u201dExit polls and interviews showed that many women labeled her dishonest and untrustworthy; gender research has found that women are punished more than men for such traits.So women did not link arms, and white women did not turn out in droves to send a person to the White House who looked like them. But the eruption of anger at white women, and the idea that women abandoned a woman, are misplaced.Ms. Lake and several other analysts note that Mrs. Clinton won majorities of many other women \u2014 married women, who have historically voted Republican; college-educated women; minority women; unmarried women.Yet many remain wistful. The lure of the dream endures, as well as pain that sexism was somehow acceptable.\u201cPeople voted for Obama out of hope and inspiration and proof that one is not racist,\u201d Professor Tillet said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people voted for Hillary as proof they were not sexist. No one wants to be called a racist. But sexist? Whatever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There are new creative outlets to market songs, albums and artists.\u201dA student there, Joseph Day, 17, became the first to use \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d with the video because, as he explained via direct message on Twitter, \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite song and I wanted my friends and the internet to all hear it and enjoy it as well.\u201dThe next night, at a concert in Denver, Rae Sremmurd led the crowd in its own rendition of the meme, eventually earning nearly 60,000 retweets of the video and inextricably linking \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d to the challenge.The synergy could not have come at a better time, said John Janick, the chairman and chief executive of Interscope, because the label had recently begun pushing \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d as a single.\u201cIt was like a lightning strike,\u201d Mr. Janick said. \u201cWithout the Mannequin Challenge, this song would\u2019ve been a hit \u2014 who knows how far it would go. But with the Mannequin Challenge, it\u2019s gigantic.\u201dStreams of \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d have nearly tripled from 15 million in the final week of October to 43 million last week. And paid downloads of the track shot up even more, reaching 144,000 in the most recent chart period, compared to just 22,000 two weeks prior, according to Nielsen Music. Even radio play \u2014 far from guaranteed for viral hits \u2014 has been rising consistently.Such a trajectory, from social media to the top of the charts, has become increasingly common since Billboard began tweaking its formulas, factoring in YouTube views in 2013 and adding digital streams and downloads the following year.\u201cBlack Beatles\u201d may have wider reach. While fans\u2019 #MannequinChallenge clips that use the song on Twitter and Instagram are not properly licensed through Interscope, and therefore do not count as official streams on the Billboard chart, the videos have succeeded in driving people back to Rae Sremmurd\u2019s music.\u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Gangnam Style,\u2019 this isn\u2019t \u2018Harlem Shake,\u2019\u201d which did not find as much success removed from their videos, Mr. Bakula of Nielsen said.

{"Headline": "The Art of the Protest", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byFixesPoland has one of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. Recently, a government-backed bill sought to go further, punishing women who had abortions with up to five years in prison. Last month, Polish women responded with a one-day strike. On Oct. 3, tens of thousands of people, most of them women dressed in black, protested in major cities.Poland is run by a nationalist, right-wing Roman Catholic party that controls Parliament, has taken over independent media, is disregarding rulings of the Constitutional Court and now proposes creating a militia outside the command of the armed forces.It would not seem to be a government that would listen to such a protest. But three days later, its legislators voted down the abortion bill. Why? The government saw the size and speed of the mobilization, and its high concentration of young people, as a threat \u2014 one it worried could grow.The current relevance of this to America, which enshrines in its Constitution the right to peacefully voice protest to check government power, will escape no one. The Republican Party will soon control the presidency, Congress, most governorships and state legislatures; in all probability, there will be a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Given Donald J. Trump\u2019s approval of advisers from the white nationalist far right, following his vitriolic attacks on the policies of the Obama administration, Democrats, independents and even some Republicans are bracing for assaults on \u2014 everything.Yet they are not powerless. Seldom, in fact, has an out-of-power opposition been able to count on more resources \u2014 in broad support, political clout and moral authority.But how these resources are used is what matters.If the purpose is to allow despondent or angry people to vent and show solidarity, then the anti-Trump protests going on in major cities already do that. But they will not reverse the election results, or alter what President-elect Trump seeks to do.Protests can change policies, however \u2014 and often have. In other countries and throughout American history, ordinary citizens banding together have triumphed over governments, even when a single party holds sweeping control. Many of those protests used resources that the opposition to President-elect Trump enjoys today. They can learn from how those victories were won.The movement won by making a strong moral appeal to public opinion. It showed protesters making sacrifices for their cause. It lured opponents into violence that finally swayed the views of whites \u2014 a tactic similar to the playbook of Mahatma Gandhi in India, of forcing an oppressor to show his ugliest face. When that sight tips public opinion, government often listens.No group more proudly claimed the title of \u201coutsider\u201d than Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, founded in March 1987 in New York. Many of its members were dying. They were despised and reviled.The Englers call Act Up an example of the power of the extreme outsider strategy: change through confrontation. It was noisy and angry. It was the first group ever to close down the New York Stock Exchange. Members scattered the ashes of loved ones on the White House lawn. They held a \u201cStop the Church\u201d demonstration in front of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.Act Up\u2019s polarizing language, actions and style put off even some influential gay men, who told the group it was hurting the cause. (The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had heard the same criticisms.) But even many who were repelled by Act Up\u2019s approach still heard its message.Although people condemn your tactics, they can still support your issue, the Englers wrote.By pulling from one extreme, Act Up shifted broad public opinion. The group started a global AIDS activist movement. It played a major role in changing the rules to expedite new AIDS medicines \u2014 and then it helped to bring down their cost. It forced insurance companies to cover treatment. It procured a patient voice in treatment. It was a major force behind the Ryan White CARE Act, a federal program for uninsured and underinsured people with AIDS.Senior citizens and his police were two of Milosevic\u2019s most important pillars. Otpor members worked on both whenever they were arrested (which was quite often). Grandparents got angry when high-school students were repeatedly arrested or accused of terrorism.This strategy also works for policy change. Advocates for gay marriage won early victories among many churches, the American Bar Association and child development experts. This helped transform influential opponents of gay marriage into influential allies.The most important pillar on policy matters is Congress: Presidents need to pass their bills. Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush failed to pass signal legislative priorities, despite controlling Congress. This was not because of grass-roots activism, but because of lobbying and spending by powerful and wealthy groups.Under Mr. Clinton, health care reform fell victim to, among other things, \u201cHarry and Louise\u201d ads featuring a fictional couple, financed by the health insurance industry.The Clamshell Alliance failed to stop Seabrook\u2019s construction, but it gave rise to a grass-roots antinuclear movement. Groups around the country staged protests and sit-ins that slowed the pace of new reactor construction.Then on March 28, 1979, Reactor Number 2 at the Three Mile Island station lost coolant and suffered a partial meltdown. The nuclear reactor industry never recovered.Three Mile Island came 13 years after another partial meltdown, at the Fermi 1 reactor outside Detroit. Haven\u2019t heard of it? One reason is that at the time, there was no movement ready to respond.Events that galvanize public attention occur frequently. Most lead to nothing. But a few become sparks for sweeping change. What makes the difference is the existence of a prepared movement.Thankfully, a galvanizing event need not be a nuclear meltdown. It does need to be an attention-grabbing drama where one side holds the moral advantage. When activists don\u2019t have one, they have sometimes created one: think Bull Connor\u2019s dogs, or Gandhi\u2019s Salt March.President-elect Trump has no popular mandate (Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a margin larger than John F. Kennedy in 1960, Richard M. Nixon in 1968, or Al Gore in 2000). Even many who voted for him do not endorse some of what he advocates or represents. Many traditional pillars of Republican administrations are less than firm in their support, beginning with the wary Republicans in Congress \u2014 and some are starting out opposed, notably much of the foreign policy establishment. The president-elect, as Mrs. Clinton said, can be \u201cprovoked by a tweet.\u201d He is impulsive. His campaign set a new standard for what Galston called a \u201cbitter, divisive tone.\u201d He and his advisers hold bigoted views that overwhelming majorities of the American people reject as immoral.What terrifies many people about a President Trump, in other words, is also what makes, for civil resistance, a uniquely promising moment.Advertisement"}

The country\u2019s human rights commission has initiated an inquiry into the episodes, which the panel\u2019s chairman says appear to have been coordinated.On Saturday, an Islamic group in Nasirnagar organized a protest against a Facebook post it found offensive. The post included an image of the Hindu god Shiva appearing at a Muslim holy site in the Saudi city of Mecca.The crowd demanded that the young Hindu man who created the image be put to death. Nevertheless, the group was given permission to hold a rally the next day, and mosque loudspeakers were used to mobilize an even larger group, said Anjan Kumar Deb, the vice chairman of Nasirnagar subdistrict.On Sunday, hundreds of Muslims entered a Hindu neighborhood, where they ransacked 15 temples and the homes of more than 100 families, Mr. Deb said. He said that the mob \u201cused long, hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons\u201d to assault Hindus they found there, and that at least 20 people, including a priest, were wounded.The district police chief, Mohammad Mizanur Rahman, characterized the damage as less extensive, saying that eight temples and 22 houses were damaged, and that one person was hurt.Ten suspects were under arrest, he said. The Hindu youth who is believed to have posted the controversial image was arrested on Saturday.Mr. Deb, who is Hindu, said that Nasirnagar, whose population is 40 percent Hindu, has never experienced religious violence on this scale.\u201cEven in 1971, during the Liberation War, Nasirnagar was a safe place for Hindus, when many Hindus were killed and tortured in other parts of Bangladesh,\u201d he said.Mr. Deb added that he felt the police and local officials \u201cfailed to ensure the security of the Hindu community, even after knowing about the tension and the rally.\u201dHindus make up about 11 percent of the population of Bangladesh, where Muslims constitute the majority, according to government statistics.\u201cHas the government lost confidence that the majority of the people of this country, although religious, believe in a pluralistic society?\u201d the editorial asked.Four other episodes of religious violence were recorded at roughly the same time: On Sunday, crowds ransacked four Hindu temples and households in the nearby town of Madhabpur, the police said. On Monday, unidentified men broke into a temple in Hathazari, near the city of Chittagong, stealing gold jewelry and cash left by worshipers at a Hindu festival, the Hathazari police said.Another confrontation occurred in the northeastern town of Chhatak on Monday. After Hindus celebrating a festival set off firecrackers near a mosque, several dozen Muslim men converged on a nearby Hindu temple, pelting it with stones, the police said. A group of Muslim youths also defaced an idol at a Hindu temple in the southern city of Gopalganj, according to Salim Reza, the officer in charge of the police station there.Advertisement"}

And now we have this nightmare.\u201dOthers were more succinct in their devastation. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of the corporate messaging service Slack.For some, buried in the visceral reaction was also a realization that the tech industry\u2019s relationship with government \u2014 not to mention the public \u2014 looks bound to shift in a fundamental way.Mr. Trump\u2019s win promises to rip apart that relationship. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during the interminable campaign that led to his victory. Mr. Trump promised to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon, repeatedly vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States, and then called for a boycott of the company when it challenged the government\u2019s order to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration plans are anathema to just about every company in tech.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft offered no immediate comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s win, or how the new administration\u2019s stated policy goals would affect their businesses.But it seems clear that a shift is in the offing. Leaders of these behemoths have long spoken in ambitious, gauzy sentimentalities about a broadly progressive future. Their goals weren\u2019t simply financial but, they said, philosophical and democratic \u2014 they wanted to make money, sure, but they also wanted to make the world a better place, to offer a kind of social justice through code. Theirs was a tomorrow powered by software instead of factories, and offering a kind of radical connectivity that they promised would lead to widespread peace and prosperity.In private, during the campaign, many tech leaders were positive that their vision would prevail over Mr. Trump\u2019s. When asked about whether they were preparing in any way for a Trump victory, bigwigs at many of the industry\u2019s leading tech and financial firms were bemused by the notion. They thought it would never happen.The deeper worry is that tech is out of step with the national and global mood, and failed to recognize the social and economic anxieties roiling the nation \u2014 many of them hastened by the products the industry devises.And then you get to the economic problems. Unlike previous economic miracles, the tech boom has not led to widespread employment. Much of the wealth generated by the five biggest American tech companies flows to young liberals in California and the Pacific Northwest, exactly the sort of \u201cglobal elites\u201d Mr. Trump railed against in his campaign.\u201cWe need to figure out how to connect more Americans to the economic engine of technology,\u201d said John Lilly, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners.On Wednesday, some in Silicon Valley worried about their disconnection from the mass of voters who chose Mr. Trump.\u201cIn tech, we need scale, so we look at the world through the lens of aggregate metrics like page views, active users and even revenue,\u201d Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of a start-up called Mattermark, wrote in an email. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we understand the people on the other side of the screen as individuals. That\u2019s the danger, and the opportunity.\u201dOthers weren\u2019t as high-flying, but were nevertheless resolute.Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, an online document storage company, suggested that the tech industry promote specific policy issues.\u201cTo shift to an economy driven by innovation from tech-enabled businesses, we need to get ahead on the issues we\u2019ve been talking about in Silicon Valley for years, like education, patent reform and immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, minus taxes and some tax repatriation issues, much about Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been antithetical to most of the big businesses that are driving the economy.\u201dMark Suster, a venture capitalist at Upfront Ventures, echoed the idea.\u201cTech needs to take a deep breath, and then reflect on how this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd have policy proposals that can realistically address the inequality in our country.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.comKatie Benner contributed reporting.Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Pro-Trump Media Covered Election Day", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byThe polls weren\u2019t looking all that good, and the polls of polls were looking even worse. But in the early hours of Election Day, the prevailing mood among the coterie of popular websites, internet communities and social media users who support Donald J. Trump was electric.At the blog Gateway Pundit, which has promoted the idea that Mr. Trump\u2019s social media support reveals deep flaws in polling, a writer touted a surprising new result (in uppercase letters): \u201cWow! Hillary Support Crashes in Reuters Likely Turnout Poll.\u201d (A few hours later, an update read, \u201cReuters Deletes Poll.\u201d)In the Trump community on Reddit, where scores of ardent supporters have gathered over the last year, users set a similar tone, albeit in terms of their own. \u201cWakey Wakey Centipedes,\u201d posted one user (in capital letters), using a term of endearment for fellow Trump supporters, \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Vote.\u201d Another (in capital letters) required little interpretation: \u201cMerry Trumpmas!!!!\u201dThis loosely organized, self-described alternative media has provided a steady stream of content, and affirmation, for Trump supporters over the last year, inverting, mimicking and frequently mocking what it sees as an ideologically bankrupt mainstream media. It is unabashed in its support for Mr. Trump, and in its disdain for his opponents. It has also served not just as an alternative news source but also as a testing ground of sorts, to see if messages, and tactics, might be ready for broader consumption.So Tuesday morning was something like a respite \u2014 a moment to regroup after a year of all-out war \u2014 before the final battle. (Reddit users spent the weekend scouring WikiLeaks for evidence of, among other things, a human-trafficking conspiracy.) Yet it didn\u2019t last long. By midday, the tone was changing, and celebratory headlines were making way for a story line that has recently become more familiar: The election is rigged.The first reports came almost immediately after voting started; within hours, those claims were being amplified, often uncritically, throughout the pro-Trump media.The Philadelphia Republican Party began posting complaints on Twitter about voter fraud in the city shortly after 6 a.m., saying Republican poll watchers had been barred from polling sites \u2014 the complaint was picked up by the conservative website The Daily Caller, gained steam on Reddit and proliferated across Twitter and Facebook.Separate reports that electronic voting machines in Pennsylvania were switching votes meant for Mr. Trump to Hillary Clinton reached Infowars \u2014 a site, long focused on conspiracies, that has recently gained prominence as a pro-Trump outlet \u2014 only to be further fueled by a viral video, described as from a Pennsylvania voter, showing difficulty voting for Trump on a touch-screen machine. Soon, The Drudge Report posted a link on Facebook to an article on a conservative website featuring the video with the (uppercase) caption: \u201cVoters report seeing Trump votes switch to Clinton before their eyes \u2026\u201dBy the time a Nevada judge denied a request from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to have votes impounded on the ground that poll workers had illegally extended early-voting hours, and Mr. Trump himself suggested in radio and television interviews on Tuesday that he might not accept the result of the election, the floodgates had been opened.Mr. Trump has frequently expressed doubt about the integrity of the voting process, at campaign events as well as on the night of the 2012 presidential election. \u201cThis election is a total sham and a travesty,\u201d he said on Twitter after President Obama\u2019s re-election. \u201cWe are not a democracy!\u201dBy early evening, before the polls had closed, the same alternative media ecosystem that had fostered a sense of confidence and calm in the morning had made allowances for either outcome. \u201cOnly Correct Public Brexit Poll Predicts Trump Victory,\u201d said the top headline on Breitbart, all in capital letters. However, right next to an image of Mr. Trump in a smaller typeface (though still all in capitals) was a hedge, courtesy of a series of updating headlines. \u201cReports of Voter Fraud Hit Social Media,\u201d one stated. Another provided a hint of what might be in store for the night to come, and the days after: \u201cTROUBLE AT POLLS.\u201dBut as results came in, and as states like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio went for Mr. Trump, a version of the morning\u2019s deliriousness returned \u2014 only this time, infused with joyous disbelief. Reddit users erupted into incredulous celebration. \u201cThe Deplorables have taken the field!!,\u201d wrote one. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to cry,\u201d wrote another. One declared victory, at least for the site: \u201cIS THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING??? WE ARE MEMEING A MAN INTO THE PRESIDENCY!\u201dOn Breitbart, the hedges faded into the background. A final counternarrative, it seemed, might not be necessary. Voter fraud headlines melted away, replaced by encouraging numbers. \u201cMr. Brexit?\u201d teased the lead story, after North Carolina was called for Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Search for Missing Connecticut Man Leads to a Body Found in New Jersey", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byThe search for a Connecticut man who vanished after partying in New York City over the weekend has turned into a homicide investigation stretching across three states after a body was recovered on Wednesday on the Jersey Shore.The man, Joseph Comunale, 26, of Stamford, was reported missing late Sunday after he did not return home, his father, Patsy Comunale, said.A man who lived at the Grand Sutton was taken into custody on Tuesday, and Chief Boyce described him as a suspect. The man was not cooperating with the police investigation under the advice of his lawyer, the chief said, and was being held at the 17th Precinct station house on an unrelated charge of operating a car without a license.\u201cHe is someone who took part in removing the body,\u201d Chief Boyce said.Investigators found \u201ca substantial amount of blood evidence\u201d in the building and in plastic bags that had been tossed down a garbage chute, according to Chief Boyce, who said the items recovered included bloody sheets, towels and clothing that belonged to Mr. Comunale.The investigation led the authorities on Wednesday to Oceanport, N.J., where a body was found in a shallow grave, Chief Boyce said. An autopsy was performed, the chief said, and dental records would be used to identify the person.At the Grand Sutton on Wednesday, investigators searched a garden beside the building, then went to a fourth-floor residence and surveyed the same scene from a window. The area was later cordoned off with crime scene tape.Mr. Comunale, known as Joey, graduated from Westhill High School in Stamford in 2008 and attended Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., according to his Facebook profile.In Oceanport, Billy Hazley, the owner of Foggia Florist and Greenhouses, said the police had swarmed the area behind his building early on Wednesday, but had declined to say what had brought them there.\u201cThere\u2019s news trucks, cops, reporters, and sheriffs all over the place here,\u201d Mr. Hazley said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a really bad tragedy.\u201dBeth Putterman, a real estate agent and mother of two who lives on the 24th floor of the Grand Sutton, said investigators had combed the building and sifted through the trash, taking away mounds of it.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet building. Everyone knew everyone in this building. You don\u2019t expect this.\u201dCarol Kahan, 79, of Brooklyn, arrived on Wednesday to look after her daughter\u2019s dog. Each time she went out to walk the dog, she said, she noticed more men in black suits huddled around a computer screen. She suspected they were potential buyers, and was surprised to learn that they were investigating a possible murder.\u201cSomewhere in Connecticut, there is a sad family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people here are wondering how this could have happened \u2014 anywhere, anyhow.\u201dEmily Palmer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kashmir Is Paralyzed by an \u2018Adored\u2019 Band of Militants", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byTRAL, Kashmir \u2014 They hide in the forest, emerging occasionally to lure police officers into villages where they try to kill them with explosive devices. They steal weapons from the security forces. Then they disappear back among the trees.Relatively few in number, about 200, roughly half of them from local villages, Hizbul Mujahedeen is the larger of two militant organizations and has widespread support from a populace that has lost faith in dialogue to resolve differences with the Indian government.\u201cThey are adored,\u201d said Sridhar Patil, the head of the regional police in Kulgam district, where crowds have burned a courthouse and a police station. \u201cThe younger generation of Kashmir is searching for a good leader, a good role model,\u201d he said, and it has settled, for better or worse, on these young men.Daily life in Kashmir has come close to a standstill since July, when Indian security forces killed the 22-year-old leader of the local militancy, Burhan Muzaffar Wani, who had attracted a broad following through videos he posted on Facebook and WhatsApp. He started the trend of young, charismatic militants, dressed in military fatigues and carrying assault weapons, revealing their names and faces on social media in efforts to spread their message to a wide audience.In a lengthy interview, the young man\u2019s father, Mohammad Muzafar Wani, said he had tried hard to influence the path of his son, a handsome youth who gelled his hair and changed his outfits twice a day, preferring Western-style T-shirts to traditional kurtas.But in 2010, three weeks after Burhan and his older brother were beaten up by security forces, the brainy boy who got top grades at school dropped the original plan to train as a doctor and instead joined Hizbul Mujahedeen.\u201cHe was not a small child; I couldn\u2019t have confined him to home,\u201d his father said. \u201cI could have stopped him for a day or two, but not all days.\u201dThe Kashmir police have counted 2,400 clashes since July. Schools remain closed, more than 30 of them burned, and public transportation is almost entirely shut down. The state\u2019s education minister was holed up in his home for days after receiving a threat.Kashmir, part of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, was promised some measure of self-determination and autonomy after India was partitioned and Pakistan was formed. That promise was not fulfilled, and since then, India and Pakistan have fought two border wars over the region and have assembled nuclear arsenals.A violent secession movement arose in Kashmir in the late 1980s, as thousands of militants spilled over the border from Pakistan. India responded by moving tens of thousands of troops into the scenic Kashmir valley and slowly crushing the uprising.\u201cIs people\u2019s confidence in dialogue shaken? Yes, it is,\u201d said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a founder of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, a coalition of separatist groups.The young men who have joined the Kashmir militancy grew up in a militarized land where they were routinely stopped and searched by security forces, and at times brutally beaten, their families say.Mr. Wani\u2019s older brother, Khalid, did not join the insurgency, even after the two were beaten by the security forces. Nevertheless, he was the first to be killed. In 2015, he was shot after delivering a meal to his brother and his comrades, his father said.The older Mr. Wani, 54, the principal of a government high school in the valley, said he was now focused on trying to keep his only surviving son, 16-year-old Naveed, from following his brother\u2019s deadly path into the militancy. \u201cMy life is in him,\u201d Mr. Wani said, looking over at the lean, bearded teenager who gave monosyllabic answers to visitors\u2019 questions.The current rebel commander, Zakir Rashid Bhat, 22, went through many of the same experiences as his predecessor, said his father, Abdul Rashid Bhat, 56, an assistant government engineer.Mr. Bhat said his son was arrested and jailed in 2010 for pelting security forces with stones. Mr. Bhat said he had tried to broker a deal with the police to bring back his son, then 16, who was hiding in another part of the state, in return for leniency.But not only did the police throw the son in jail for several days until a court granted him bail, they also opened several criminal cases, accusing him of violence and of destroying government property, his father and the Kashmir police say.The rebel commander\u2019s older brother, Dr. Shakir Rashid Bhat, 32, an orthopedic surgeon in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar, tried to explain why his sibling had joined the militancy. \u201cThe experience of seeing his father begging police for mercy changed him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was humiliating.\u201dIn 2012 and 2013, even as Zakir attended an engineering college in another state, he had to return to Kashmir every few months for court hearings. Then, in July 2013, one month into his summer vacation, he disappeared, leaving a note saying that his parents should not look for him and that he was at peace with himself and with his God, his father said.Mr. Bhat said his son had left his iPhone, his iPad and cards for his family\u2019s three bank accounts, taking nothing except the pants and T-shirt he was wearing.In retrospect, the father said, the only clue to his son\u2019s radicalization was an increased interest in religion in the days before he left. The youth, whose major passion had previously been his Yamaha motorcycle, suddenly began accompanying his father to the mosque each day during the holy month of Ramadan.On a recent Saturday morning, only hours after an explosive device went off a few miles from the three-story brick house where Zakir grew up, a security officer was on the phone with his father, telling him his son was the prime suspect. Three police officers had been wounded, one critically.Mr. Bhat, a stocky man who was wearing a brown woolen cape and sitting on the pink-carpeted floor of his living room when the call came through, sounded despondent at times as he responded again and again that he had no idea of his son\u2019s whereabouts.\u201cIf you want to kill me, kill me,\u201d he told the officer. \u201cIf that ensures safety to your country, do it.\u201dA few miles away, in another village in the Tral area, several dozen children and young men played cricket in a field adjoining the graveyard where Mr. Wani is buried. They stopped playing when visitors arrived.A 6-year-old boy in a blue cape, Muneeb Shah, began leading the crowd in a cheer, egged on by his father, a shawl merchant. \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d the boy shouted. \u201cAzaadi,\u201d the group responded, using the Urdu word for freedom. \u201cFor the sake of Burhan,\u201d the boy called out next, going down the list of dead militants, one by one.Local people say dozens show up at the graveyard each day to pay tribute to Mr. Wani, some carrying away clumps of mud from the mound of grass covering his grave.Security officials worry that the glamorization of militant leaders might draw a larger number of young people into the fold.The police are trying to counter the appeal, in part by aggressively tracking down the leaders and the new recruits. But it is hard to make arrests because the militants operate in the forests around the villages where they grew up. When the police close in, crowds of people rush to the scene and try to stop the security forces by throwing rocks, yelling chants and generally interfering, knowing the officers will resist shooting at them.\u201cFrom the front side you are fighting the militants, and from the back side you are getting hit by stones,\u201d said Mr. Patil, the police chief.Sameer Yasir contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica and the Secret Agenda of a Facebook Quiz", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionDo you panic easily? Do you often feel blue? Do you have a sharp tongue? Do you get chores done right away? Do you believe in the importance of art?If ever you\u2019ve answered questions like these on one of the free personality quizzes floating around Facebook, you\u2019ll have learned what\u2019s known as your Ocean score: How you rate according to the big five psychological traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset.For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans. A spinoff of a British consulting company and sometime-defense contractor known for its counterterrorism \u201cpsy ops\u201d work in Afghanistan, the firm does so by seeding the social network with personality quizzes. Respondents \u2014 by now hundreds of thousands of us, mostly female and mostly young but enough male and older for the firm to make inferences about others with similar behaviors and demographics \u2014 get a free look at their Ocean scores. Cambridge Analytica also gets a look at their scores and, thanks to Facebook, gains access to their profiles and real names.In the age of Facebook, it has become far easier for campaigners or marketers to combine our online personas with our offline selves, a process that was once controversial but is now so commonplace that there\u2019s a term for it, \u201conboarding.\u201d Cambridge Analytica says it has as many as 3,000 to 5,000 data points on each of us, be it voting histories or full-spectrum demographics \u2014 age, income, debt, hobbies, criminal histories, purchase histories, religious leanings, health concerns, gun ownership, car ownership, homeownership \u2014 from consumer-data giants.No data point is very informative on its own, but profiling voters, says Cambridge Analytica, is like baking a cake. \u201cIt\u2019s the sum of the ingredients,\u201d its chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, told NBC News. Because the United States lacks European-style restrictions on second- or thirdhand use of our data, and because our freedom-of-information laws give data brokers broad access to the intimate records kept by local and state governments, our lives are open books even without social media or personality quizzes.Ever since the advertising executive Lester Wunderman coined the term \u201cdirect marketing\u201d in 1961, the ability to target specific consumers with ads \u2014 rather than blanketing the airwaves with mass appeals and hoping the right people will hear them \u2014 has been the marketer\u2019s holy grail. What\u2019s new is the efficiency with which individually tailored digital ads can be tested and matched to our personalities. Facebook is the microtargeter\u2019s ultimate weapon.The explosive growth of Facebook\u2019s ad business has been overshadowed by its increasing role in how we get our news, real or fake. In July, the social network posted record earnings: quarterly sales were up 59 percent from the previous year, and profits almost tripled to $2.06 billion. While active users of Facebook \u2014 now 1.71 billion monthly active users \u2014 were up 15 percent, the real story was how much each individual user was worth. The company makes $3.82 a year from each global user, up from $2.76 a year ago, and an average of $14.34 per user in the United States, up from $9.30 a year ago. Much of this growth comes from the fact that advertisers not only have an enormous audience in Facebook but an audience they can slice into the tranches they hope to reach.One recent advertising product on Facebook is the so-called \u201cdark post\u201d: A newsfeed message seen by no one aside from the users being targeted. With the help of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital team used dark posts to serve different ads to different potential voters, aiming to push the exact right buttons for the exact right people at the exact right times.Imagine the full capability of this kind of \u201cpsychographic\u201d advertising. In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together.In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201csuper predator\u201d line. It targeted Miami\u2019s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Federal Election Commission rules are unclear when it comes to Facebook posts, but even if they do apply and the facts are skewed and the dog whistles loud, the already weakening power of social opprobrium is gone when no one else sees the ad you see \u2014 and no one else sees \u201cI\u2019m Donald Trump, and I approved this message.\u201dWhile Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump\u2019s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. One day in August, it flooded the social network with 100,000 ad variations, so-called A/B testing on a biblical scale, surely more ads than could easily be vetted by human eyes for compliance with Facebook\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards.\u201dPerhaps out of necessity, the Trump team was embracing a new-media lesson: It didn\u2019t have to build everything from scratch. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. When \u201cTrump TV\u201d went live on Facebook before and after the second debate it raked in $9 million in donations in 120 minutes.In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election, so many polls and experts were so wrong that it became fashionable to declare that big data was dead. But it isn\u2019t, not when its most obvious avatar, Facebook, was so crucial to victory.On Monday, after a similar announcement from Google, Facebook said it would no longer allow fake-news websites to show ads, on their own sites, from Facebook\u2019s ad network \u2014 a half-step that neither blocks what appears on your newsfeed nor affects how advertisers can microtarget users on the social network.There are surely more changes to come. Mr. Zuckerberg is young, still skeptical that his radiant transparency machine could be anything but a force for good, rightly wary of policing what the world\u2019s diverse citizens say and share on his network, so far mostly dismissive of Facebook\u2019s role in the election. If Mr. Zuckerberg takes seriously his oft-stated commitments to diversity and openness, he must grapple honestly with the fact that Facebook is no longer just a social network. It\u2019s an advertising medium that\u2019s now dangerously easy to weaponize.A Trump administration is unlikely to enforce transparency about who is targeted by dark posts and other hidden political ads \u2014 or to ensure that politicians take meaningful ownership of what the ads say. But Facebook can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and the Digital Virus Called Fake News", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byEditorialFacebook says it is working on weeding out such fabrications. It said last Monday that it would no longer place Facebook-powered ads on fake news websites, a move that could cost Facebook and those fake news sites a lucrative source of revenue. Earlier on the same day, Google said it would stop letting those sites use its ad placement network. These steps would help, but Facebook, in particular, owes its users, and democracy itself, far more.Facebook has demonstrated that it can effectively block content like click-bait articles and spam from its platform by tweaking its algorithms, which determine what links, photos and ads users see in their news feeds. Nobody outside the company knows exactly how its software works and why you might see posts shared by some of your friends frequently and others rarely. Recently, the company acknowledged that it had allowed businesses to target or exclude users for ads for housing, employment and credit based on their ethnicity, in apparent violation of anti-discrimination laws. It has said it will stop that practice.None of that will happen if he continues to let liars and con artists hijack his platform.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Chang Bets Big, Using Silicon Valley Money", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Chang says Ando is part of a larger plan: to create a more sustainable model for restaurants in a time of rising costs and slim profit margins, and to pay workers well in an industry known for low wages. He says he plans to expand beyond New York, building a business to dwarf all of his previous accomplishments.In Silicon Valley, where most venture investors are, that kind of money signals an intention to create a mass-market business, an ambition that statistically is more likely to end in failure than in the next Facebook. There\u2019s a reason venture money is called risk capital.The move is a big departure for a man who has famously eschewed outside money from anyone but friends and family.\u201cI got into the restaurant business not to make money on other people\u2019s terms,\u201d Mr. Chang, 39, said in a recent interview in San Francisco.It also shows how start-ups are seen as this era\u2019s path to riches. In 2000, with the stock market surging, cabdrivers offered up hot technology stock tips. In 2007, when real estate was booming, civilians became property developers and home flippers. And in 2016, with venture money flooding into young tech start-ups, everyone has an app and harbors Uber-style ambitions. Even Mr. Chang.Last year, venture investors poured more than $4 billion into food delivery start-ups globally, according to the reseach firm CB Insights. Several delivery-only restaurants sprouted in American cities with the promise of saving owners money by requiring less square footage and removing the need for waiters. Mr. Chang said he could use those savings to pay his cooks more. But some start-ups have struggled. A San Francisco service called SpoonRocket went out of business last spring. Others, like Munchery in New York, San Francisco and other cities, have slowed.Ms. Green made early investments in Dollar Shave Club, which was sold to Unilever for $1 billion in July, and in Jet.com, which was sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion in August. She said she hoped for nothing less from Ando.\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll make a big successful business, and then we\u2019ll look for a liquidity event,\u201d Ms. Green said. A \u201cliquidity event\u201d is Silicon Valley parlance for one of three outcomes: listing the company on the stock market, selling the business or letting a private equity firm buy out early investors.Mr. Chang has expressed some ambivalence about the possibility of cashing out. \u201cThere have been numerous occasions where we\u2019ve turned down lucrative offers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t after the almighty dollar. We were on our own path.\u201dBy now many Americans know the legend of Mr. Chang, the enfant terrible who transformed from ramen purveyor to Michelin-starred chef in just five years.Even as he enjoyed unusually quick success, he remained obsessed with the specter of failure. Each endeavor was born of an impetuous desire to start something new, followed by months of anxiety and painstaking sweating over every detail.Mr. Chang has a voracious appetite for growth. He sees it as the answer to many of the restaurant industry\u2019s most intractable challenges, including the stratospheric cost of real estate and the struggle to pay talented chefs a living wage in expensive cities.But it\u2019s hard for star chefs to grow without losing their excellence, edge or attention to detail.But Mr. Chang said he realizes that he will always have critics, even within his own organization. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve not come to grips with is, there\u2019s no more decisions to be made where everyone wins,\u201d he said.Ando is a simple concept, the kind that tends to underpin businesses that deliver big wins for venture investors. Mr. Chang founded it last fall to create dishes like fried chicken or cold spicy noodles with pork that can stand up, and even improve, under the logistical constraints of delivery.He began with one kitchen, in Midtown, and delivers only to that part of New York. He said it was unclear when and how Ando would expand.Also, Ando has not embraced Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d ethos. Take, for example, cheese sauce, a single component of the restaurant\u2019s NYC Cheesesteak.\u201cWe saw the cheese started sogging up the bread and we had to change the recipe,\u201d Mr. Basil said. \u201cThen we thought, let\u2019s put hozon in it\u201d \u2014 Momofuku\u2019s chickpea sauce. \u201cThis is great,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the hozon affected the pH of the cheese sauce and made it looser, a soggier sandwich.\u201cThen we had to figure out how to thicken it up. Then we added calcium to bring the pH up and a little bit of carrageenan. Now it travels extremely well. But it took us four months to work on this one component.\u201dThe Ando menu is still growing, and it\u2019s likely that the items at any future location will vary, adding another layer of complexity. And there is the push and pull between venture capital\u2019s data-driven culture and the instinctive way that chefs work.\u201cDave has an ability to zero in on things that people really love, not because he\u2019s got a huge computer,\u201d said Andrew Salmon, Mr. Chang\u2019s business partner in Momofuku.He said they were wary of outside money until they were introduced to Expa, which ultimately co-founded Ando and put seed money into it. \u201cDave and I were always convinced that if anything was worth doing, we\u2019d have to do it with the money we had in the bank,\u201d he said.But left to their own devices, he said, they could never have built Ando without Silicon Valley-style money and expertise.Ms. Green, of Forerunner Ventures, said she has faith in Mr. Chang, calling him the sort of formidable entrepreneur who has all of the traits for breakout success: a record of accomplishments, paranoia, expertise and grit.She is not daunted by his creative temperament. \u201cWe think about scaling a business over the course of many years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have time to evaluate customer data and understand how to drive repeat business.\u201d There\u2019s a reason venture money is also called patient capital.Mr. Chang said that he was not sure what Ando may look like in a year or two, but that he was certain \u201ca sea change is going to happen in the food world.\u201d\u201cHow the restaurant industry at large has operated will not work moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost structure just doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know what the answers will be, but I\u2019m not going to stand idle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I wish I could get a hold of you in a better way but this is going to be the fastest way and I hope you all have a computer,\u201d Mr. Avila said in his video. \u201cI miss you all very much; my heart is missing you big time.\u201dWithin days of posting the video on YouTube earlier this year, Miracle Messages had shown Mr. Avila\u2019s message to his family and begun setting in place a reunion. Today, Mr. Avila is living with his 92-year-old mother, helping to take care of her in his childhood home in Texas.Mr. Avila\u2019s reunion is one of more than two dozen Miracle Messages has successfully engineered. As families around the country gather for Thanksgiving, many are missing a relative: According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, more than 500,000 Americans are homeless. And in many cases they have lost touch with their families.The goal of Miracle Messages is to help 1 percent of the world\u2019s estimated 100 million homeless people reunite with loved ones by 2021, said its founder and chief executive, Kevin F. Adler. He said he started the organization almost two years ago in honor of his Uncle Mark, who lived on and off the streets for 30 years.\u201cThis is an effort to humanize a homeless person and reconnect them with their families,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cEven if you are homeless, you are a complete being as you are.\u201dMr. Adler said he found that through social media, it was relatively easy to find a homeless person\u2019s family. One of the first videos he recorded, on Christmas Eve 2014, was of a homeless man named Jeffrey Gottshall, who was living on the streets of San Francisco. He posted it to a Facebook group in the small town in Pennsylvania where Mr. Gottshall was from, and within 20 minutes someone had tagged his sister.\u201cNinety percent of the messages we\u2019ve been able to deliver have been received positively, and in about 40 percent of the reunions, the homeless person has stable housing or is living with family,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cIn some cases, the family does not want to be in contact for whatever reason and we have to respect their wishes. But in those cases, we often find friends or other relatives who do want to reach out.\u201dSome reunions are happy ones, like the Avila family\u2019s. In a telephone interview, Mr. Avila recounted the day he made the video. As he got food from a local homeless outreach group in Miami, he heard an announcement that Miracle Messages would be recording videos of anyone who wanted to send loved ones a message. Mr. Avila stepped forward.\u201cIt was time for me to contact my family,\u201d he said.He spoke of bouncing from printing press jobs at several newspapers in Texas before going to Miami to find work. He said that for a few years in the 1980s, he worked in the printing press shop for The Miami Herald. But he said he had a mental breakdown and walked away one day.During the time he was lost to his family, Mr. Avila lived on and off the streets, found some work at local outreach centers and suffered a heart attack. Now 66, he is thrilled to be home with his large family.\u201cThe best way to describe my family is old school,\u201d Mrs. Gottshall-Gavitt said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t even cry at funerals, because that\u2019s making a public spectacle. So when the video was made public, it was like the sky had fallen for some members of my family.\u201dWhen her family saw Mr. Gottshall\u2019s message, it was the first time in 20 years they had been in contact with him, although Mrs. Gottshall-Gavitt and her husband had tried to find him.She went to San Francisco to see her brother and with Mr. Adler\u2019s help, was able to reunite and talk to him. She says her brother suffers from mental health issues. She is trying to help him get the help he needs but says he needs to want to help himself.For now, the best she can do from her Pennsylvania home is to have people like Mr. Adler and a police sergeant she met with San Francisco\u2019s homeless outreach unit keep her updated on how her brother is doing. They help Mr. Gottshall call her on occasion so she knows he\u2019s O.K.\u201cEven if Jeffrey doesn\u2019t end up with a happy ending, other people are getting their happy ending and that\u2019s just as important,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one should be lost.

They were planning an attack for Dec. 1, Mr. Molins said, while adding that it was not yet clear what their target was \u201camong all those that the group envisaged.\u201dReferring to news reports this week that militants were targeting the Disneyland Paris amusement park outside the capital, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, and several other places, Mr. Molins said that the information was \u201cdetrimental to the ongoing investigations,\u201d but he did not deny the reports.\u201cIt appears on one hand that the offenders were in possession of, or searching for, weapons and money, and on the other hand that they were about to take action and were looking for targets,\u201d Mr. Molins said.Mr. Molins identified the suspects arrested in Strasbourg as Yassine B., 37, a school employee; Hicham M., 37, a warehouse worker; Sami B., 36, a French-Tunisian father of three who worked in a grocery store; and Zacaria M., 35, a French-Moroccan whose employment status was not disclosed.The four men were longtime friends who saw \u201ceach other on a regular basis\u201d and communicated via a dedicated telephone line, Mr. Molins said.The fifth suspect, arrested in Marseille, was identified as Hicham E., a 26-year-old Moroccan citizen who left his country in 2013 to emigrate to Portugal, from where he took multiple trips back and forth within Europe using fake identification papers. (The prosecutor earlier gave his age as 46.)The arrests followed an eight-month investigation led by France\u2019s domestic intelligence service, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Monday. A tip by a \u201cpartner country\u201d led to the arrest of Hicham E., officials said.The team in Strasbourg and the suspect in Marseille were given \u201ccommon instructions\u201d by a commander in the \u201cIraq-Syria zone\u201d on how to obtain weapons, Mr. Molins said. They received their orders via encrypted mobile apps.Mr. Molins did not identify their commander.Hicham M. and Yassine B. went to the Turkey-Syria border in March 2015 via Cyprus, while Hicham E. was turned back in the summer of 2015 when he attempted to enter Turkey, Mr. Molins said.On a USB memory stick found at Yassine B.\u2019s house, the authorities found a document mentioning the \u201cdelivery of a sum of money,\u201d as well as GPS coordinates and detailed instructions on how to obtain weapons and ammunition.Investigators also found Google Maps screenshots of searches of different places in Yassine B.\u2019s laptop and phone, which Mr. Molins said amounted to \u201ca clear will to find and spot targets, to take action in the very short term.\u201dThe suspect arrested in Marseille, Hicham E., had 4,281 euros, or $4,539, on him when he was apprehended, money that investigators believe was intended to buy weapons.Mr. Molins said that arms, documentation on potential targets and pledges to the Islamic State were found at the houses of members of the Strasbourg team. Guns and bullets were found at the homes of Yassine B. and Zacaria M.; it was not clear how they were obtained.The authorities also said writings glorifying martyrdom and \u201copenly\u201d referring to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were found in a notebook in Yassine B.\u2019s house, and several documents mentioning \u201cthreats against the integrity of our country\u201d were contained in a notebook found in Hicham M.\u2019s house.Mr. Molins said it appeared from the investigations that Yassine B. and Hicham M. had downloaded the Periscope app onto their phones, possibly to record themselves committing violence.Five people suspected of having links to the same network as the seven men were arrested on June 14 \u2014 a few days into the Euro 2016 soccer tournament being held in France \u2014 and two of them were kept in custody.\u201cThe attacks or attack plots which we have been, currently are, or will face again are shape-shifting,\u201d Mr. Molins said.Advertisement"}

My father passed away several months ago, and my mother, who is in her 70s, is incapable of financial independence. She has never been financially responsible, and now the burden has fallen on my shoulders, because she has no family and I\u2019m an only child. In my view, she lives way beyond her means; each time I suggest that she cut out a few expenses (fewer trips to the beauty parlor, shopping at a discount market), she breaks down and often lashes out at me. I fear that if I continue to support her, I\u2019ll never be able to save enough money for my own future. But as you suggest, you have a life to build, and she\u2019s burdening it. You\u2019re going to have to tell her \u2014 perhaps in a loving letter, as conversations seem to end badly \u2014 what the terms are under which you can help support her. Because of your father\u2019s death, this burden has fallen on you prematurely: It would have been more manageable if you were further along with your career. So take your own needs into account as well as hers. You mentioned the sacrifices your mother made for you. She made them because she wanted you to live a better life. Don\u2019t let her sacrifices be for nothing.My companion and I recently bought a house from a friend, \u201cJill.\u201d When I was doing some cleaning, I found an envelope at the back of a closet, where it had been obscured by old tools. I opened the envelope to see if it was something I should send to Jill or someone who lived in the house with her. It turned out to be a handwritten letter dated 20 years ago and addressed not to Jill but \u201cTo the mother of my unborn child.\u201d Glancing at the first page I saw it was a love letter pledging undying commitment. I stopped reading because it seemed really personal, although I looked at the signature so I could tell my friend who it was from.I wrote to Jill asking if she would share the recipient\u2019s address so I could send her the old letter. After a few days, Jill wrote back to say that the relationship between the letter-writer and the recipient had ended very badly \u2014 but that their daughter, \u201cEsther,\u201d wanted the letter. The daughter was a Facebook friend of Jill\u2019s, so I looked at her profile and found that she is an 18-year-old high-school senior. At that point I started to worry about sending Esther the letter, and I read it through. In addition to talking about the writer\u2019s eternal love, it also discussed the couple\u2019s physical relationship. Given the date of the letter and Esther\u2019s apparent age, I am guessing that the \u201cunborn child\u201d is likely not Esther. I now feel in over my head. I am not sure that Esther is entitled to see a letter that was intended for another\u2019s eyes and that may well open a can of worms. My dermatologist refuses to charge my wife or me for treatment and medicine at his clinic even though I have insisted on paying. He tells me not to mention it \u2014 ever again. I\u2019ve already visited his clinic three times this summer, and my wife has had one appointment.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Win Has Blacks, Hispanics and Muslims Bracing for a Long 4 Years", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byThroughout the long and contentious presidential campaign, they saw themselves on the front lines of the country\u2019s power struggle \u2014 insulted and antagonized by Donald J. Trump and courted in near-desperation by Hillary Clinton.Now that Mr. Trump has emerged victorious, Latino, black and Muslim voters, each with their own issues and agendas, are bracing for a long four years. Some Latinos already felt threatened on Wednesday and feared that Mr. Trump would pursue his mass deportation pledge, tearing apart their families and communities. Black voters anticipated an era under Mr. Trump in which intolerance would become acceptable. And Muslims worried that they would be branded as terrorists because of their beliefs.\u201cI don\u2019t fear Trump as much as I fear the monster he\u2019s awakened,\u201d said Aysha Choudhary, a Muslim American who works with the aid group Doctors Without Borders in New York City. \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s normalized discrimination, and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s open season.\u201dOn the morning after the vote, many said they felt more vulnerable, just because of what they looked like or what they wore. And none felt particularly reassured by Mr. Trump\u2019s vow in his victory speech on Wednesday to \u201cbind the wounds of division\u201d and \u201ccome together as one united people.\u201dIn New York, Cesar Vargas, an immigrant rights leader, said he had received \u201ca torrent\u201d of death threats on Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday and Wednesday. \u201cWe are going to come and find you,\u201d one message said.In Washington, several dozen young immigrants gathered in front of the White House early Wednesday for a comforting vigil, where, they said, they were accosted by several men who had come to celebrate Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cTrump will build the wall!\u201d the men shouted.In Phoenix, Alejandra Gomez, a Latino activist, saw in her father\u2019s eyes a terror she had not seen for years, since he had become a legal resident and was no longer at risk of deportation.Latinos had embraced the opportunity on Tuesday to finally exercise their full electoral clout by turning out in record numbers in states like Colorado, Florida and Nevada to swing the election for Mrs. Clinton.But after news of the victory by Mr. Trump \u2014 who had described Mexican immigrants as criminals, disparaged a Mexican-American judge and promised to cancel a program that gave nearly 800,000 of them protection from deportation \u2014 waves of shock spread among Latinos, then raw fear.\u201cWhat upsets me is how in this whole election he has brought so many of these racists out,\u201d said Maria Flores, a Cuban-American in Miami, who had once been a Republican but supported Mrs. Clinton this year. She said strangers had begun taunting her to speak English or leave.Claudia Martinez, who is Mexican-American, Catholic and a devoted Republican, said she had wept in anguish after voting for Mrs. Clinton. But choosing Mr. Trump was not an option.\u201cIf he said those things as a candidate, what will he say as president?\u201d she asked.Democrats had seen Latinos as a path to victory in states like Nevada and Florida, where they grew this year to 19 percent of the electorate, from 17 percent in 2012. But while turnout swelled in Miami and in the central Florida counties where Puerto Ricans have settled, and Latinos supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by 63 percent to 34 percent, the mainly white voters in Florida who flocked to Mr. Trump surpassed the Latino numbers for Mrs. Clinton.Down ballot, there were some small victories for anti-Trump Latinos. In Arizona, activists like Ms. Gomez succeeded in ousting Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, the enduring face of the state\u2019s unforgiving stance against illegal immigration.And in Nevada, where Latino turnout also surged, months of intensive turnout efforts by labor unions helped elect Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, to fill the Senate seat of Harry Reid, who is retiring, making her the first Latina in the Senate. They also elected the first Latino congressman from Nevada, Ruben Kihuen, another Democrat. And Mrs. Clinton took that state.Some Hispanic voters were proud to say they had voted for Mr. Trump.John Santamaria, a Cuban-American real estate agent from Miami, said he thought the Republican candidate\u2019s tough immigration proposals were just talk. \u201cI felt it was red meat for the vote,\u201d Mr. Santamaria said. \u201cThe man is an egotistical maniac, but I hope he can bring the success he had in business to this country.\u201dBut Claudia Ramos, a Nevada hotel worker from Mexico who has been an American citizen for 10 years, seemed dazed by the results. \u201cWe are scared, and we don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do,\u201d Ms. Ramos said.When election results on Tuesday night started pointing to a Trump victory, Ibrahim Rashid, a sophomore at Boston University, began getting nervous.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to bar Muslims from entering the United States in an attempt to curb terrorism, Mr. Rashid, an American citizen who is Muslim, worried that his family \u2014 Pakistani nationals who live in Dubai \u2014 could never visit him here again. And he ached for a young cousin in Michigan whose classmates were mean to her after Mr. Trump won a mock election at school, prompting her to cry all day.\u201cAll of us are just scared,\u201d Mr. Rashid said on Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk on Facebook about getting ready for the next four years because people are going to question you, and your point of view won\u2019t matter. The feeling is, we\u2019re not accepted any more.\u201dStill, he did not want his fear to show. And so he boldly dressed in Pakistani clothes and clipped a sign to his shirt that declared, \u201cI\u2019m not Scared.\u201dMuslims across the country were suddenly grappling with the reality of a Trump presidency and trying to calibrate their responses to it \u2014 including worries that Mr. Trump would keep mosques under surveillance and establish a database for all Muslims living in the United States. A recent study puts the number of Muslim Americans at 3.3 million, just over 1 percent of the United States population.In some ways, Mr. Rashid\u2019s personal response reflects that of the nation\u2019s organized Muslim groups.In one bright spot for Muslims on Tuesday, Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar, a refugee from the Somali civil war, to its state House, making her the nation\u2019s first Somali-American Muslim lawmaker.But social media reflected other fears. As one person wrote on Twitter: \u201cAs I\u2019m stopped at a gas station this morning, a group of guys yell over: \u2018Time to get out of this country, Apu!\u2019 Day 1.\u201dAnd another: \u201cMy mom literally just texted me \u2018don\u2019t wear the Hijab please\u2019 and she\u2019s the most religious person in our family. ... \u201dAt a community advocacy center in Brooklyn, older women in hijabs sat in an English class and shared their fears in a mixture of English, Urdu, Arabic and Bengali.\u201cThey said to me, \u2018How can America elect such a person who is so openly about hate of others?\u2019 \u201d said Mohammad Razvi, the executive director of the Council of Peoples Organization.Nadeem Mazen, a member of the City Council in Cambridge, Mass., who is deeply involved in Muslim matters, said that local Muslim leaders were \u201cshocked by the outcome\u201d and unprepared to deal with it.\u201cWe\u2019re all scrambling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take years for us to catch up when we have to spend all our time defending ourselves against hate speech.\u201dMrs. Clinton spent considerable effort courting black voters. She formed bonds with the mothers of black men who had been killed by the police, giving them a prominent place on stage at the Democratic National Convention. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, served as her most powerful surrogates.It wasn\u2019t enough. Although black voters overwhelmingly cast their ballots for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 88 percent to 8 percent for Mr. Trump nationwide \u2014 the number of black voters who made it to the polls lagged behind the last two presidential elections. As the results came in, black voters reflected on what they meant.\u201cI just realize that people are more racist, sexist and misogynist than I ever realized,\u201d Johanne Blain, a Haitian-born graduate of Wellesley, said at an alumnae watch party at the college on election night. \u201cToday is kind of like the end of the world.\u201dNow, black voters are grappling with the idea of a president-elect whose tone, personal history and policy pronouncements fly in the face of so much of the social justice agenda many have fought decades for, including gains made under Mr. Obama.\u201cWhen people say Trump\u2019s presidency will be bad, it\u2019s not theoretical,\u201d DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist, said on Twitter. \u201cThis is real life.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Trump presented himself as the antidote to the Black Lives Matter movement, which has protested the killings of black men by the police over the past two years. While young black activists demanded that college campuses curb speech that could be considered offensive to minorities, Mr. Trump railed against \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d While black activists protested police killings and racial profiling, Mr. Trump promised to restore \u201claw and order\u201d and expand New York\u2019s contentious \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing policy nationwide.Far from ruining Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of being elected, his remarks lay at the heart of his appeal to white voters, who expressed resentment over what they consider political correctness gone overboard.Adding to the disappointment was Mr. Trump\u2019s own history. Once sued by President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s Justice Department for racial discrimination in his family\u2019s housing rentals, Mr. Trump had served as the loudest voice behind the so-called birther movement that spread the false claim that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya, and was thus ineligible for president.The celebration of Mr. Trump\u2019s election by far-right groups sent a wave of fear through African-Americans across the country. Social media sites on Wednesday were full of reports of racial slurs that have been hurled by Trump supporters, and of fears of hard-won civil rights being rolled back.\u201cWe are scared,\u201d Yassir Lester, a black comedian from Los Angeles, said on Twitter.Reporting was contributed by Lizette Alvarez, Caitlin Dickerson, Adeel Hassan, Liz Robbins, Giovanni Russonello, Fernanda Santos and David Philipps.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Quit Social Media. Your Career May Depend on It.", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsI\u2019m a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a blog. Demographically speaking I should be a heavy social media user, but that is not the case. I\u2019ve never had a social media account.At the moment, this makes me an outlier, but I think many more people should follow my lead and quit these services. There are many issues with social media, from its corrosion of civic life to its cultural shallowness, but the argument I want to make here is more pragmatic: You should quit social media because it can hurt your career.This claim, of course, runs counter to our current understanding of social media\u2019s role in the professional sphere. We\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s important to tend to your so-called social media brand, as this provides you access to opportunities you might otherwise miss and supports the diverse contact network you need to get ahead. Many people in my generation fear that without a social media presence, they would be invisible to the job market.I think this behavior is misguided. In a capitalist economy, the market rewards things that are rare and valuable. Social media use is decidedly not rare or valuable. Any 16-year-old with a smartphone can invent a hashtag or repost a viral article. The idea that if you engage in enough of this low-value activity, it will somehow add up to something of high value in your career is the same dubious alchemy that forms the core of most snake oil and flimflam in business.Professional success is hard, but it\u2019s not complicated. The foundation to achievement and fulfillment, almost without exception, requires that you hone a useful craft and then apply it to things that people care about. This is a philosophy perhaps best summarized by the advice Steve Martin used to give aspiring entertainers: \u201cBe so good they can\u2019t ignore you.\u201d If you do that, the rest will work itself out, regardless of the size of your Instagram following.A common response to my social media skepticism is the idea that using these services \u201ccan\u2019t hurt.\u201d In addition to honing skills and producing things that are valuable, my critics note, why not also expose yourself to the opportunities and connections that social media can generate? I have two objections to this line of thinking.My research on successful professionals underscores that this experience is common: As you become more valuable to the marketplace, good things will find you. To be clear, I\u2019m not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant. I\u2019m instead arguing that you don\u2019t need social media\u2019s help to attract them.My second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless. Consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy. Social media weakens this skill because it\u2019s engineered to be addictive. The more you use social media in the way it\u2019s designed to be used \u2014 persistently throughout your waking hours \u2014 the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom.Once this Pavlovian connection is solidified, it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require, and your brain simply won\u2019t tolerate such a long period without a fix. Indeed, part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate \u2014 the skill on which I make my living.The idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete, and it should be to you if you\u2019re serious about creating things that matter.Most social media is best described as a collection of somewhat trivial entertainment services that are currently having a good run. These networks are fun, but you\u2019re deluding yourself if you think that Twitter messages, posts and likes are a productive use of your time.If you\u2019re serious about making an impact in the world, power down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work.Cal Newport is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and the author of \u201cDeep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World\u201d (Grand Central).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: When the Tech Industry Lives in a Bubble", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byBitsWhy was the turkey not hungry on Thanksgiving?Because he was already stuffed.You and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, the epicenter of the tech industry and also one of the most liberal places in the country. In San Francisco, Trump won less than 10 percent of the vote. In Santa Clara County, home to Google, Facebook and Apple, he got barely over 20 percent.What we should talk about is whether the tech business\u2019s distance from so much of the country is a bad thing, and something that can be solved in some way.For what it\u2019s worth, the so-called secession plan is little more than a few tweets and a website at the moment, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere. But it did create an instant tech angle!Back to tech. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great that so much of the tech business swims in the same waters. I\u2019m not saying people in tech should be more open-minded toward Trump. I\u2019m not saying it would be better if 50 percent of Facebook employees voted for Trump.But I do think this election underscores a problem for the tech industry. It works on scale. The whole premise of a software business is that a few people can make something that the entire world can use. But the flip side of that magic is that the whole world ends up using products that only a small group of people control. It\u2019s not just Trump voters. Tech giants are making products that are being used by subsistence farmers in India, taxi drivers in China, bankers in London and schoolteachers in Brazil, to name a few random people off the top of my head.The election emphasizes how crazy that task is. How can a 24-year-old white male engineer at Google who graduated from Stanford ever hope to empathize with the vast majority of people who use the products he\u2019s working on?There is no way a recent, extremely well-paid Stanford graduate can be expected to empathize with the rest of the country if the extent of his or her worldliness means knowing the best time to cut out of work to beat traffic from Silicon Valley back to San Francisco.Not only do these employees have no personal incentive to travel to the Midwest, but they aren\u2019t forced to do so by those in upper management, who also live in a bubble largely of their own making.By the way, I am self-aware enough to recognize the irony of this criticism coming from a coastal media type who has lived in New York and California while working for The New York Times. But I will say, I grew up all around the country, including largely in the South, so I don\u2019t feel as out of touch as, say, someone who has lived their entire life in the 100-mile radius of the Bay Area.I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think the tech companies are either. The facile answer is to work much harder on diversity \u2014 not just racial and gender diversity, but also geographic diversity and diversity of thought. I hope they do that. But that goes only so far. After all, Apple can\u2019t go out and recruit a bunch of workers just because they like Trump.Why not hire a more diverse candidate pool? Those with liberal arts degrees and students of history? People from across the country? I think that would be a start. And Mark Zuckerberg himself said on Facebook\u2019s earnings call that 2017 would be a big year for recruiting investment.I\u2019ve seen many techies offer to work with the White House to get talented people on board with the next administration. And to the opposite effect, I\u2019ve seen some who will fight the Trump administration tooth and nail, against any injustices they may see.I admire both impulses, though I think what\u2019s most important is to have an actual opinion rather than, I don\u2019t know, blandly letting the next four years go by while doing one\u2019s own thing inside the island of California. Be civic-minded, both locally and nationally. Don\u2019t let public relations and company statements speak on your behalf.That\u2019s what I plan on doing. At least until I get canned someday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 14, 2016Joshua WrightMatt StollerThe proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger is a watershed moment for our political system. Will we continue to allow the further concentration of economic power at the top, or will this be the moment when democracy fights back?ATT-Time Warner would be a giant in pay-TV, wireless service, broadband, news and entertainment \u2014 it could certainly shape the media to its advantage in a myriad different ways. But most people don't need these studies to know they are being ripped off by their cell phone, broadband, and cable providers, and that medicine and air travel, for example, cost too much. But the U.S. has a model for de-concentrating power in order to lift up the middle class. More interesting still: The concentration bill was approved by all parties in Israel, from the extreme right to the extreme left \u2014 a rare feat in a country with fractious politics. Starting with AT&T-Time Warner, perhaps stronger anti-monopoly policy is something all Americans can agree on.\u201cBig is bad\u201d is perhaps the only thing this year's presidential candidates agreed upon.  Too many big mergers, too little enforcement, goes the narrative.Sometimes a concentrated industry is noncompetitive. Consider hospitals, where the Federal Trade Commission has successfully challenged proposed mergers with convincing economic evidence that greater concentration would lead to increases in price and reduced quality of service. What's more, the evidence that supports the conclusion that markets are actually becoming more concentrated is  exceptionally weak.  The Council of Economic Advisors concluded that we have a monopoly problem because, in a handful of industries, the combined market shares of the top 50 firms have seen a modest increase over the past few decades. But a closer look shows that the council found that the combined market shares of the top 50 firms is below 50 percent in nearly all industry sectors.  The average market share for a firm in these industries is less than 1 percent. That is certainly not evidence of a monopoly problem. Economists have long rejected the \u201cantitrust by the numbers\u201d approach.  Indeed, the quiet consensus among antitrust economists in academia and within the two antitrust agencies is that mergers between competitors do not often lead to market power but do often generate significant benefits for consumers \u2014 lower prices and higher quality. Sometimes mergers harm consumers, but those instances are relatively rare. Because the economic case for a drastic change in merger policy is so weak, the new critics argue more antitrust enforcement is good for political reasons. Big companies have more political power, they say, so more antitrust can reduce this power disparity. Big companies can pay lower wages, so we should allow fewer big firms to merge to protect the working man. And big firms make more money, so using antitrust to prevent firms from becoming big will reduce income inequality too.  Whatever the merits of these various policy goals, antitrust is an exceptionally poor tool to use to achieve them. Instead of allowing consumers to decide companies\u2019 fates, courts and regulators decided them based on squishy assessments of impossible things to measure, like accumulated political power.  The result was that antitrust became a tool to prevent firms from engaging in behavior that benefited consumers in the marketplace. The antitrust agencies are full of talented economists and lawyers who use the most up-to-date and sophisticated techniques to identify mergers worthy of challenge on behalf of consumers.  Economic analysis has more often than not trumped ideological politics in antitrust policy for the past 35 years.  Let\u2019s keep it that way.Does the government need to more proactively pursue antitrust cases? Is it time to bring back trust-busting?"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Hard to Make a Website for the Government?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.O\u2019Farrell, who has been involved with government food programs since graduating from college nearly three decades ago, understood why his office would be a promising target for this kind of tech push. California\u2019s food-stamp participation rate, roughly 50 percent of eligible residents, was one of the lowest in the country, and the bureaucratic friction in the application process deserved at least some of the blame. Enlisting technology\u2019s aid made a lot of sense: More than three-quarters of Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year now use the internet, and Obamacare has ushered in a new generation of social-service clients who grew up on their smartphones and expect to interact with government the same way they do everything else. Yet CalFresh \u2014 in contrast to the Silicon Valley companies in the neighborhood, where teams of designers, product managers and data scientists cater to their online users with intense precision \u2014 offered a poor \u201cuser experience\u201d for clients on its digital channels. It lacked text or email support; its website didn\u2019t work well on mobile devices. These were just the sorts of problems that Code for America fellows figured they knew how to solve.The fellows soon discovered that an external vendor, Hewlett-Packard, had been contracted for years to maintain the site. A bigger obstacle to remaking MyBenefits CalWin would have been negotiating the cooperation of all 18 counties that used it. But one fellow, Jake Solomon, had an idea. The only information legally needed to submit a complete food-stamp application, he had learned, was a name, an address and a signature. Code for America could work around MyBenefits CalWin and build its own simple website just for CalFresh applicants. At the very least, this would make for a good proof of concept, a way to show various government officials that social-service delivery could be, in Solomon\u2019s words, \u201cdead simple.\u201d In 2014, after his fellowship had ended \u2014 he was still affiliated with Code for America \u2014 Solomon pitched this idea to his colleague Dave Guarino one afternoon, and they coded a prototype over the next few days.The following week, Solomon and Guarino gave a demonstration at O\u2019Farrell\u2019s office. Guarino handed a phone with the prototype on it to O\u2019Farrell, who filled out an application in a few minutes. With its clear language and big buttons, it felt slick, like Twitter or Facebook, not kludgy, like most .gov sites. O\u2019Farrell was impressed. \u201cThis could be a game changer,\u201d he said. \u201cGo for it. We like it.\u201d\u201cMy biggest lesson this year was that local governments are constrained,\u201d Solomon wrote in a blog post. \u201cThey\u2019re constrained by a complex web of local politics, state legislation and federal laws. The constraints cascade downhill, as does the responsibility.\u201dIn 2013, Code for America had nearly 30 fellows \u2014 selected by competitive application \u2014 working on behalf of 10 partner cities. Its annual operating budget was $7 million, more than half of which came from private grants. Pahlka often found herself on the road, giving talks and courting donors. Her pitch was simple: Use technology to make government better. What exactly she meant by that could be hard to parse, but the apps she cited and the anecdotes she shared were compelling, with a folksy, community-driven appeal. (Take care of your neighborhood storm drain!)Solomon, Guarino and Williams, part of the 2013 class of fellows, were initially assigned to different cities and themes. Solomon went to the Human Services Agency of San Francisco. Before Code for America, he worked for the RAND Corporation on health policy; before that he was at Palantir, a Silicon Valley data-analytics start-up that created software for intelligence services and other clients. Guarino, a software developer and policy wonk who had spent time at the California Health Benefits Review Program, devoted his fellowship year to building an app that allowed residents in South Bend, Ind., to report on the conditions of vacant and abandoned properties. Williams, a designer, built digital trail maps for parks in northeast Ohio. As a junior at Tulane during Hurricane Katrina, he had seen the storm sweep across Lake Pontchartrain and then flood much of New Orleans. \u201cI watched government fail on so many levels,\u201d Williams says. \u201cIn this very visible, physical way, where levees failed, but also the soul-crushing process that people went through afterward to get FEMA support.\u201dThe three young men had an easy rapport from the start. None of them fit the stereotype of the Silicon Valley engineer. Each majored in a social science \u2014 Solomon in economics, Guarino in political economy, Williams in English and political science. I saw them at their most animated in long conversations over Mexican takeout, talking about John Rawls and social contracts and the unfortunate amount of discretionary power wielded by street-level bureaucrats. For them, and for many of their Code for America colleagues, technology was a means more than an end, a lever with which they could move people\u2019s lives toward the good. While their peers in Silicon Valley wanted to play with cool new programming languages for the sake of playing with cool new programming languages, Solomon, Guarino and Williams, it seemed, found their motivations elsewhere. \u201cI care about helping people, period,\u201d Guarino told me.The normal process worked like this: Once an application was received \u2014 whether delivered in person, online or via fax \u2014 and entered into the database, the CalFresh office in the applicant\u2019s county would schedule an interview, to be held either over the phone or in person. At these sessions, eligibility workers, whose job is to determine whether clients qualify for social services, review documents like pay stubs, utility bills and identity cards. Eligibility is set at 200 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $41,000 in gross income for a family of three, but subject to a host of caveats; in granting exceptions to these caveats, eligibility workers exercise a great deal of discretion. They can choose to overlook missing documentation or demand additional receipts. They can verbally elicit information omitted from the application.The Code for America team\u2019s plan had always been to leave the scarier stuff off the website \u2014 questions like, \u201cHave you ever traded food stamps for explosives?\u201d or \u201cHave you ever committed a felony?\u201d Those questions could be answered during the live interview. The key was to settle on how much information to ask for at the start. Require too much, and users would be put off and give up; too little, and the eligibility workers, who preferred more details rather than fewer, would complain. In the end, the team settled on a compromise. After the user submitted a name and an address, two choices would present themselves: to continue filling out the rest of the application or to \u201cStop working and submit application now.\u201d Clicking the second option would lead to another page and the warning: \u201cAre you sure you want to submit right now? Since we only know your name and address, it will be hard to process your application. Instead of finishing it on the phone, we will have to send you paperwork in the mail.\u201dThe main technical challenge confronting the team followed directly from Solomon\u2019s initial flash of insight to create an independent site. Because GetCalFresh wasn\u2019t actually replacing MyBenefits CalWin, but was instead just offering an alternative point of access, they still needed to work with its existing infrastructure, which lacked an A.P.I., or application programming interface. Modern websites consist of a front end, or web page (what a user sees on the computer screen); a back end (a database and a server that hosts it); and usually an A.P.I. that sends data between them. We all regularly rely on things that function like A.P.I.s in the physical world. Say, for instance, you want to get takeout from your favorite Chinese restaurant. In this analogy, the front end would be your phone, the back end is the kitchen and the A.P.I. is whichever restaurant employee relays your order to the cooks. She\u2019s how you place an order of dumplings, cancel that order or modify it to include sweet-and-sour soup.In software development, A.P.I.s allow coders to change front-end or back-end components easily, while leaving the core of a program intact. The lack of an A.P.I. for MyBenefits CalWin meant that GetCalFresh, however great it looked, couldn\u2019t actually put any information into the earlier site\u2019s database. The state would not officially know about any of the applications it received; it wouldn\u2019t even know where to send a check. So the Code for America team\u2019s members, when they received an application through GetCalFresh, needed to figure out a way to get that information into the MyBenefits CalWin system.In April 2015, Guarino, while on a trip to Utah with Solomon and Williams, finally came up with a workaround. If the problem they faced was relying on people to manually enter information into the database, why not just write some code to take care of that part? Guarino used a technology called Selenium WebDriver that mimicked a user\u2019s activity on a website. Playing the role of the applicant, the webdriver would go to MyBenefits CalWin\u2019s front end and fill in each question using the information collected through GetCalFresh, then click \u201cnext.\u201d This was not exactly best practice when it came to coding: Webdrivers are used primarily in testing web applications, not in their actual operation. Because the webdriver couldn\u2019t catch all errors, when someone mistakenly submitted an impossible birth date, for example, or a nonexistent ZIP code, that information would trigger an error when it was entered into the legacy system. A human being would then have to correct the information from that faulty entry by hand.Williams worried, when giving demonstrations to county representatives, that the whole process would seem amateurish to them, the way it sometimes did to him. But he came to realize that the existing systems used by CalFresh staff members tended to be far more cumbersome and time-intensive than his inelegant webdriver. They didn\u2019t see the absence of tests and logs, the redundant code, the inability to deal with errors like missing information gracefully. He recalled a presentation at which the projector was broken, so the audience gathered around his computer. When he ran the webdriver, a new browser window opened up straight away to the legacy website, and the applicant\u2019s data automatically appeared, as if typed in by unseen fingers. Williams describes it as \u201ca magical moment.\u201d The genius of the webdriver was that it didn\u2019t require clerical workers to do anything different: no encryptions, no new data entry or software systems to deal with. It did exactly what workers at food banks and community-based organizations already did \u2014 fill out the legacy application on behalf of clients \u2014 except faster. It reinforced technology\u2019s most basic power: the ability of automation to eliminate boring and repetitive tasks.No one had a good answer, including the executives at Code for America. By many measures, GetCalFresh had surpassed all of the nonprofit\u2019s previous projects, and Code for America now found itself in unfamiliar territory. It had typically presented its projects as proofs of concept, but many of them, as one of the organization\u2019s officials later admitted in a blog post, lacked \u201cconsistent paths to sustainability.\u201d By that fall, out of the many dozens of apps created by Code for America fellows, fewer than 10 had found enough support to justify being spun off into start-ups. Many of them had not been updated on Github, the website where most collaborative coding projects are hosted, in months.As Solomon, Guarino and Williams saw it, a couple of obvious paths lay before them. The first was to solicit funds from traditional philanthropic sources. The second was to become a government I.T. vendor and sell to other counties and states. Neither path appealed to them. Donor funding, while probably necessary in the short term, seemed unsustainable in the long term \u2014 especially because, under the reigning Silicon Valley ethos, even philanthropic tech projects are expected to present a business model. Government I.T. vending work, on the other hand, was self-sufficient but uninspired. It was limited, by definition, to what was imagined under any given contract. \u201cIt abdicated responsibility for anything outside the software,\u201d Williams says. And for all of Code for America\u2019s beliefs that tech could serve as a lever for good, the bad code plaguing the public sector was rarely the only problem with a particular program; it would be a hollow improvement to give CalFresh a better application site without, say, making sure that reminder letters were sent out before an appointment or that the customer-support lines were adequately staffed.As the months passed and the financing remained unresolved, the team submitted proposals to several organizations \u2014 including Molina Healthcare in Long Beach, Calif., from which they sought $3 million over three years, characterizing their project as a preventive-health measure. But their reluctance to work for the government seemed to come from some deeper motivating force. In the beginning, I wondered whether it had to do with prestige. Public employees can get stuck working in rooms with ugly linoleum floors writing memos that may never be read; I.T. vendors, meanwhile, are the equivalent of enterprise software sales. Perhaps either fate seemed at odds with the team\u2019s self-image.But in talking to them, I found that their worries seemed to revolve less around social standing than around effectiveness. Having been exposed to the way government operated, they saw a decision-making system in which the status quo always wins. The lengths to which the team would have had to go to modify the legacy site, MyBenefits CalWin, was one example. The process to amend a notice of action \u2014 a letter informing CalFresh clients of changes in their eligibility, for example \u2014 was another. \u201cWhen you work for the government, ties go to the county, ties go to the state,\u201d Solomon told me. At the moment, the Code for America team controlled almost every aspect of GetCalFresh: If they wanted to, say, experiment with live chat for customer support, they could. That freedom would be curbed if they began collecting paychecks from the state.\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Cantonese, do you?\u201d he asked me as soon as I entered. I did not, alas. Many of the clients of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank were non-English speakers, and among them Cantonese was the most common native tongue. But the Cantonese-speaking employee who was supposed to be on duty that morning had called in sick. Liliana Sandoval, the food bank\u2019s senior program manager, was scrambling to find a replacement.A half-hour later, Sandoval and the replacement arrived, dragging a large file folder between them. His name was Calvin Yan, he worked for the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and, thankfully, he spoke Cantonese. They pulled out a pair of Microsoft Surface tablets. \u201cGo to demo.GetCalFresh.org,\u201d Solomon instructed. The landing page for GetCalFresh showed a glossy image of an Asian woman holding a toddler and standing in front of the produce aisle in an unidentifiable grocery store. At the top, it read: \u201cGet extra money for groceries every month. Take the first step. Apply for CalFresh in 10 minutes.\u201d In the footer: \u201cGetCalFresh.org is a service delivered by Code for America on behalf of the people of California.\u201d The favicon, the tiny image that appeared in the browser tab space when you navigated to the site, was a federal building with Corinthian columns and the symbol for Wi-Fi overlaid on the roof.Yan flipped through the screens. \u201cOh, this is really short,\u201d he said.\u201cYup,\u201d Solomon said, satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d Yan said, before asking if eligibility was still at $1,900 per month.\u201cNo,\u201d Sandoval chided. She tossed him a San Francisco-Marin Food Bank resource guide. \u201cYou should be fine. The only thing might be sponsors.\u201d Sponsors backed immigrants, making them financially responsible for the new arrivals, but in practice they could be difficult to track down. Sometimes food-stamp applicants said they hadn\u2019t had contact with their official sponsors in years.At 10 a.m., the doors opened, and the first clients arrived: an attractive young couple, the man blond and beefy, the woman dark and wide-eyed. Each wore a backpack. Sandoval began speaking to the woman in Spanish. What was her monthly income? How many people in her household did she regularly shop for groceries with? Were any of them students? The woman reached out and touched her boyfriend\u2019s arm. Sandoval switched to English. How many classes was he taking at city college? Three, he said. Did he know how many credits that was? He didn\u2019t. There was a meek, quiet pause. \u201cWould it be helpful if I found out?\u201d he asked.The issue, Sandoval told him, was that full-time students were ineligible for CalFresh, although there was a long list of exceptions \u2014 he could be eligible, for instance, if he had kids. He shook his head. No kids. Then he should probably go to the registrar and confirm his status, Sandoval said. Meanwhile, she would submit a CalFresh application for his girlfriend and refer them to a food pantry in their neighborhood.Sandoval turned to Yan. \u201cCan you pull up the food-pantry locator?\u201d she asked. Another in-house civic-tech team had put together a search tool for food pantries.\u201cWhich neighborhood?\u201d Yan replied, typing on the Surface.\u201cNorth Beach,\u201d the woman answered.Yan flashed her a smile. \u201cMy neighborhood. O.K., the bad news is that there aren\u2019t too many options. But the good news is that there is a food bank just around the corner from your building. It\u2019s not in the search tool.\u201d He tapped his temple. \u201cBut I know it because it\u2019s just down the street from me. I\u2019ll write down the address for you.\u201dSandoval continued: \u201cOnce a week, you can go and pick up a bag of groceries.\u201d\u201cYou can pick what you want?\u201d the woman asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a 30-pound bag, more than 15 pounds of which is fresh produce, and then the rest, staples.\u201d She said they would hear back about their application in a few weeks. The couple shrugged on their backpacks. They thanked Sandoval.After the couple left, everyone waited. A good 45 minutes went by. No one else showed up. After noon, Solomon and I went to grab lunch. In all of our previous meetings, Solomon had projected an unrelenting positivity bordering on pretense. Today he seemed tired, less guarded. \u201cJust think about if every person from all those organizations \u2014 their energy were redirected toward software development,\u201d he said. I pointed out that not everyone had the skills for software development. And in any case, the event suggested the limits of technology. Sandoval\u2019s Spanish skills, Yan\u2019s local knowledge \u2014 these were the things that the technology, at least as of now, had yet to replace, and their softening effect called to a mind an earlier line from Solomon himself, that \u201cstigma was created or eroded at the point of service delivery.\u201dAs we waited for our sandwiches, Solomon got some bad news he\u2019d begun to expect: The $3 million they were seeking from Molina Healthcare \u2014 which could have kept their effort to expand GetCalFresh going \u2014 had been rejected because of restrictions on what the company could support.\u201cWhat else do you have in the pipeline?\u201d I asked.\u201cRight now, nothing,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cC.F.A. has been extremely generous, but they can\u2019t just let us carry on without strategic funding and strategic partners.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe need to figure out whether this model\u201d \u2014 digital nonprofits in the social-services sector \u2014 \u201cactually works or not.\u201dAs in the private sector, the GetCalFresh team\u2019s work would apparently be judged by people\u2019s willingness to pay for it. To me, this seemed absurd: Wasn\u2019t the whole purpose of government to fund collective projects that are irrational for individuals to take on alone? But Solomon and his team seemed to be caught between a public sector unwilling to finance them and a private philanthropic culture that didn\u2019t see enough value in what they did.Williams and Jaime-Alexis Fowler, then director of marketing at Code for America, joined Solomon for lunch. The waiter who came up to take the orders greeted them like old regulars. \u201cHey! I thought one of you guys was done.\u201d\u201cThis is his new office,\u201d Fowler quipped.\u201cMy new H.Q.,\u201d Solomon said.Fowler told me that in the last couple of weeks, a few significant individuals and foundations in Silicon Valley had come forward as sources of funding for GetCalFresh. The money wasn\u2019t in the bank yet, but things were looking promising, despite all the stresses and doubts of the previous months. Some people still believed in improving digital delivery by government \u2014 \u201cpeople who are saying what you are doing is really important and it\u2019s O.K. that you haven\u2019t figured out all the ins and outs of it.\u201dAfter the kale salads arrived, I asked Solomon what he was going to do now. GetCalFresh was his brainchild, and this creation process, he had told me before, represented the best job he ever had.His plan was to dream up similar projects, he said, but as a kind of social entrepreneur. \u201cIt just became increasingly apparent that moving forward we were going to be working for the government, which is great. There\u2019s a lot that can be done there. But I think my interests are closer to advocacy work than enterprise software. I need to set up a situation where I\u2019m working for my clients, my users.\u201d He paused. \u201cOne of the first things I\u2019m going to do is figure out whether there\u2019s a market for an intermediary in food stamps, the way that people are willing to pay $50 not to deal with the I.R.S.\u201d At the high end, these intermediaries were attorneys and financial advisers. In the middle, they were TurboTax, travel agencies, real-estate brokers. At the low end, of course, there was nothing.If government interactions are so unpleasant that intercessors are necessary, I suggested, then perhaps we should reform government instead of creating another go-between.\u201cBut I think intermediation is often \u2014\u201d Solomon began.Williams threw up his hands. \u201cYes!\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes!\u201d\u201cIn many cases it is those intermediaries who are the strongest pressure for reform,\u201d Solomon said.\u201cThey\u2019re also the strongest opponents of reform in some cases.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Solomon admitted. \u201cIntuit is a great example.\u201d Several years ago, California proposed simplifying tax returns for some taxpayers, but it was opposed by Intuit lobbying.Williams prodded his food with his fork. \u201cSo who\u2019s the most powerful actor?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the intermediaries oftentimes. And that can be a force for good, or a force for self-serving interest.\u201dAs lunch wound down, I asked where Dave Guarino was. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. \u201cDave is coding,\u201d Williams said.Now that things on the funding side were looking up, feature development could begin again. The GetCalFresh team was replacing Solomon with an engineer, Andrew Hyder, who was a Code for America fellow with Solomon, Guarino and Williams in 2013. And once the money arrived, there would be resources for hiring more people too. Williams looked meaningfully at Solomon when he said that.As it happened, the money would come in, and then some. In April, California declared its intent to award GetCalFresh a two-year \u201coutreach\u201d contract, federal money designed to reimburse nonprofits that helped clients through the application process for social services. It would be the first time California had made an award for web-based application assistance. \u201cWe see this as a major first piece of a client-based revenue model \u2014 since we will receive reimbursement based on the number of people we help,\u201d Williams told me. He credited, above all, the support of people like Leo O\u2019Farrell and Kim McCoy Wade, who became the state\u2019s new head of CalFresh in 2015. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who really pulled for us,\u201d Williams said. The team\u2019s immediate financial future secured, its members \u2014 Williams, Guarino and Hyder (three new hires were planned) \u2014 steeled themselves for a long summer leading up to a Code for America summit meeting in Oakland, where they hoped to persuade the various CalFresh directors to try them out.In my last conversations with Williams, the tone was one of cautious optimism. While the California contract kept GetCalFresh going for another two years and gave the team a sense of momentum, it hardly solved all their problems. A real A.P.I. needed to be built and additional county CalFresh directors won over. Above all, the team needed to show impact \u2014 in terms of numbers of users, applications and food-stamp approvals \u2014 on the scale that everyone had come to expect from tech ventures. Everything they had done until now \u2014 all the prototyping, hand-holding, cajoling, fund-raising \u2014 was just preparation. Now the work would really begin.It\u2019s hard to predict whether GetCalFresh will become the vanguard of a new movement in social services or a forlorn entry in the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. But GetCalFresh has made it further than the vast majority of civic-tech projects. It has overcome every kind of crisis \u2014 technical, financial, existential \u2014 while exposing the distance between the current fetishization of innovation and the reality of implementing even the best ideas within intransigent organizations. Perhaps most important, its team has demonstrated a commitment that goes beyond Silicon Valley opportunism.\u201cFor the longest time, if someone asked me what I did at a party or something,\u201d Williams told me, \u201cI would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a product designer,\u2019 or \u2018I work in tech.\u2019 Now I say I work in social services.\u201d Even Solomon, the prodigal son, hasn\u2019t strayed far. Back at the lunch at Citizen\u2019s Band, it occurred to me that despite his qualms, the public sector built so little of its own software that even so-called in-house projects were often procured from vendors. So in the end, you could either pay $30 to have someone outside the government handle the food-stamp application process for you, which is what Solomon wanted, or the government would pay a contractor $30 per successful food-stamp application, which is what Williams and the team wanted: a system in which government contracting outside the I.T. world could align with users\u2019 interests. This seemed a distinction without a difference \u2014 maybe they\u2019d all work together again at some point.Solomon smiled at that. \u201cI think over the next year, he\u2019s going to continue to try to recruit me, and I\u2019m going to continue to try to recruit him, and we\u2019ll probably meet somewhere in the middle.\u201d \u2666Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer based in New York.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Vasiliy Kolotilov found out about an American football league in Russia where most people discover bizarre, out-of-the-ordinary things: the internet. After a bit of investigation, he pitched a piece on the Spartans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a local football team in Moscow \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to a newspaper. In March, he attended some training sessions and published the article. But that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to spend more time with these guys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Until October, Mr. Kolotilov embedded himself with the Spartans as they played biweekly games among roughly 20 teams across Russia. His work boasts few photographs of tackles or catches. Instead, he looked off the field: in locker rooms, social activities and the everyday lives of players. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole idea was not to show the game itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kolotilov said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut to show what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behind it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn his photographs, players barbecue and share drinks in one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homes, they place tape over their nipple rings before donning pads and jerseys, they make helmets out of cardboard for their mascot, they get bandaged and they wait tables \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because while the football is American, the pay isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are spending money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kolotilov said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot of money.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt costs each team about $1,500 a month to rent a field and buy things like water for the sidelines. In addition, each player buys his own equipment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually overseas in the United States, where the dollar is stronger than the ruble. In one of Mr. Kolotilov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photographs, a stone-faced member of the Spartans balances a helmet between his knees as he rides the metro to a game \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something most players do.The man in the photograph is 45 years old and one of the older players on the team. Mr. Kolotilov said he joined because he saw the game played in the 1990s and finally decided this year to play. There are many like him on the team, working men with day jobs and children, looking for a hobby and some camaraderie. Then there are others, like a 19-year-old who discovered the Spartans on YouTube and moved to Moscow just to play for them. He dreams of playing professional football one day.For now, he, like the other handful of players with pipe dreams of pro ball, settles for a team that on most nights is lucky to draw a handful of people to the stands. In Mr. Kolotilov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one photograph of the spectators, the bleachers are desolate except for three people. It was the first game of the season. The championship game, which the Spartans lost in St. Petersburg, drew closer to 400.The games, their scores and the Spartans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 record are not important to Mr. Kolotilov. He admits he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even sure of the rules of American football. What interests him is a team of 60 or so men who put a great deal of time and effort into a sport that few in their country understand; a sport that, unlike soccer or boxing, will never gain them any money or fame.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI kind of envy them in a way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kolotilov said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey found their passion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Going Flat\u2019 After Breast Cancer", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byBefore Debbie Bowers had surgery for breast cancer, her doctor promised that insurance would pay for reconstruction, and said she could \u201ceven go up a cup size.\u201d But Ms. Bowers did not want a silicone implant or bigger breasts.\u201cHaving something foreign in my body after a cancer diagnosis is the last thing I wanted,\u201d said Ms. Bowers, 45, of Bethlehem, Pa. \u201cI just wanted to heal.\u201dWhile plastic surgeons and oncologists aggressively promote breast reconstruction as a way for women to \u201cfeel whole again,\u201d some doctors say they are beginning to see resistance to the surgery. Patients like Ms. Bowers are choosing to defy medical advice and social convention and remain breastless after breast cancer. They even have a name for the decision to skip reconstruction: They call it \u201cgoing flat.\u201d\u201cReconstruction is not a simple process,\u201d said Dr. Deanna J. Attai, a breast surgeon in Burbank, Calif., and a past president of the American Society of Breast Surgeons, adding that more of her patients, especially those with smaller breasts before diagnosis, were opting out of reconstruction. \u201cSome women just feel like it\u2019s too much: It\u2019s too involved, there are too many steps, it\u2019s too long a process.\u201d\u201cBreasts aren\u2019t what make us a woman,\u201d Ms. Leaphart said.\u201cThat\u2019s the dirty little secret of breast reconstruction: The risk of a major complication is higher than for the average elective surgery,\u201d said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who performs the procedure.Ms. Cuozzo, who appeared in the Facebook video with Ms. Bowers, spent a year having her breasts rebuilt after a double mastectomy, but after four infections in five months, she had the implants removed. The reconstruction, she said, \u201cwas getting worse than the cancer.\u201dWhile some states, including New York, now require physicians to tell women about the availability of breast reconstruction, women say they often are not informed of the option to remain flat. \u201cI was never told there was a choice,\u201d Ms. Cuozzo said. \u201cI went from the breast surgeon to the plastic surgeon, and they said, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to do.\u2019\u201dDr. David H. Song, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Chicago and immediate past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said that the risk of complications was real, but that focusing on them was like focusing on plane crashes when \u201cmillions of flights land safely.\u201dGiven advancements in surgical techniques, \u201cthe aesthetic result can be better than the native breast,\u201d Dr. Song said. \u201cPatients can come out the other end looking more youthful, with a better aesthetic in her breast than before.\u201dBut it is that kind of talk \u2014 suggesting that a reconstructed breast is an improvement on a woman\u2019s natural breast \u2014 that enrages many women who have undergone mastectomies. For starters, a reconstructed breast is often numb and can no longer play a role in sexual arousal. It often lacks a nipple, since the nipple is usually removed in a mastectomy.After looking at photos of reconstructed breasts, \u201cI was slightly horrified,\u201d said Charlie Scheel, 48, of Brooklyn, who decided against implants after a double mastectomy. \u201cYou don\u2019t have nipples and you have scars everywhere.\u201dMs. Pine, 40, had reconstruction after her first mastectomy, but had the implant removed later when she had a prophylactic mastectomy on her other breast. \u201cThey don\u2019t look or feel, in most cases, like our breasts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nerves are cut, so they\u2019re not receptive to feel or touch.\u201dDr. Susan Love, author of a best-selling book about breast health, said that doctors aiming to expand access to reconstruction may have become overly enthusiastic about the surgery.\u201cSurgeons became so proud of what we were able to do that we may have forgotten that not everybody may want it,\u201d Dr. Love said.Dr. Marisa C. Weiss, founder of breastcancer.org, said doctors should not assume every patient wants reconstructed breasts. \u201cI\u2019ve had go-go dancers who do not want reconstruction and nuns who say, \u2018I need reconstruction,\u2019\u201d she said.Some women say physicians pressured them to get implants. When Catherine Stapleton, of Florida, woke up after her mastectomy, she discovered that her breast surgeon, a woman, had left unsightly flaps of skin and tissue that could be used for breast reconstruction later, in case she changed her mind.\u201cWhen I woke up from anesthesia, I was in shock,\u201d said Ms. Stapleton, 58, who is now facing additional major surgery to correct the first procedure.Geri Barish, president of the Long Island advocacy group 1 in 9, said a doctor had chided her when she opted against reconstruction. \u201cOne doctor said to me: \u2018How can you walk around like that? You look deformed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.Support groups and social media have allowed women to share stories about the realities of reconstruction. \u201cA lot of the women in my support group had infections, and they were surprised at how many surgeries were involved,\u201d said Alicia Staley, 45, who stayed flat after a double mastectomy. \u201cAs I compared notes, I wondered, \u2018Why are all these women doing this to themselves?\u2019\u201dComing to terms with a flat chest after breast cancer can be difficult. While some women wear a prosthesis in their bra, it is not uncommon for them to stop using it. \u201cThey\u2019re heavy, they\u2019re uncomfortable, and they\u2019re in a sensitive area where you have scars,\u201d Ms. Pine said.Women say they take many of the clothes they wore before surgery to Goodwill and begin wearing scarves and long strands of beads to hide their flat chests. Others try to embrace their new form by having elaborate tattoos inked where they once had breasts. Ms. Pine has a lotus flower tattoo on one side and a dragonfly on the other.Sara Bartosiewicz-Hamilton, 39, a technical writer in Kalamazoo, Mich., tried two types of implants but had a constant burning sensation and got rid of them. She then started a virtual support group called Flat and Fabulous. \u201cWe\u2019re not anti-reconstruction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut many women never feel it\u2019s part of their body.\u201dFor Kate Cloudsparks, 64, a farmer in southern Iowa who has been flat since a preventive mastectomy 21 years ago, discovering the Flat and Fabulous Facebook page this year led to her first communication ever with women who had made the same choice.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody else like me. I was carrying it around for 20 years without having anywhere to share it,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally, I had an opportunity to talk about what it\u2019s been like to live as a woman without breasts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lies in the Guise of News in the Trump Era", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byIF you get your news from this newspaper or our rival mainstream news sources, there\u2019s probably a lot you don\u2019t know.Oh, the scoops we miss here at The Times!None of those items is actually true, of course, but all have been reported by alt-right or fake news websites (the line between them is sometimes blurred). And one takeaway from this astonishing presidential election is that fake news is gaining ground, empowering nuts and undermining our democracy.As I\u2019ve argued for most of this year, I think we in the mainstream media \u2014 especially cable television \u2014 sometimes bungled coverage of Trump. There was too much uncritical television coverage of Trump because he was good for ratings; then there was not enough investigation of his business dealings, racism and history of sexual assaults, and too much false equivalency that equated the two candidates as equally flawed.More broadly, we in the mainstream media are out of touch with working-class America; we spend too much time chatting up senators, and not enough visiting unemployed steel workers.Yet for all of our sins in the mainstream media, these alt-right websites are both far more pernicious and increasingly influential. President-Elect Trump was, after all, propelled into politics partly as a champion of the lie that President Obama was born abroad and ineligible for the White House.While the poisonous 2016 campaign is behind us, these alt-right websites will continue to spew misinformation that undermines tolerance and democracy. I find them particularly loathsome because they do their best to magnify prejudice against blacks, Muslims and Latinos, tearing our social fabric.Some of the people promoting these sites aren\u2019t even conservatives; they\u2019re foreign entrepreneurs trying to build websites that gain a large audience and thus advertising dollars.Facebook has been a powerful platform to disseminate these lies. If people see many articles on their Facebook feed, shared by numerous conservative friends, all indicating that Hillary Clinton is about to be indicted for crimes she committed, they may believe it.These sites were dubbed \u201calt-right\u201d because they originally were an alternative to mainstream conservatism. Today they have morphed into the mainstream: After all, Steve Bannon, the head of Breitbart, one of these sites full of misinformation, ran Trump\u2019s campaign.It\u2019s particularly troubling that alt-right sites agitate for racial hatred. Freedom Daily lately has had \u201ctrending now\u201d headlines like \u201cBlack Lives Thug Rapes/Kills 69 y/o White Woman.\u201d In fact, the killer was black but seems to have had no connection to the Black Lives Matter movement, and the murder happened in 2015.There are also hyperpartisan left-wing websites with inaccuracies, but they are less prone to fabrication than the right-wing sites. Indeed, the Macedonian entrepreneurs originally came up with leftist websites targeting Bernie Sanders supporters but didn\u2019t find much reader interest in them.Rather, the problem with mainstream news sources is in part that we\u2019re out of touch with many of the ordinary voters whom we purport to care about.The landscape ahead looks grim to me. While the business model for mainstream journalism is in crisis, these alt-right websites expand as they monetize false \u201cnews\u201d that promotes racism and undermines democracy. Worse, they have the imprimatur of the soon-to-be most powerful person in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It\u2019s Like to Make It in Showbiz With Your Best Friend", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Meet the songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d and \u201cLa La Land.\u201dSupported byThey met at 18, the worst dancers in a college ballet class, and sought refuge in a basement practice room, taking a first stab at songwriting with a tune about adolescents playing hooky and footsie at a suburban diner.Now, at the age of 31, after a decade of being touted as promising, up-and-coming, and ones-to-watch, Pasek and Paul have arrived.\u201cI love them,\u201d said Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, who hired the pair to write three songs for the television show \u201cSmash,\u201d and became so enamored that he is now a co-producer on \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d \u201cTo me, they\u2019re the future of the musical, on stage or screen.\u201dThey are handsome and charming, quick-witted and exuberant, observant, obsessive, and, of course, neurotic. Mr. Pasek writes words, and Mr. Paul writes music, but they have opted, right from the beginning, to share credit for both elements of their songs.They estimate that they spend 350 days a year together, for six to 12 hours at a stretch, sending texts and video clips back and forth when they are not in the same room, and even sometimes when they are.\u201cEverything that we\u2019ve studied and loved has all built to get to be in a moment like this,\u201d Mr. Paul said during a joint interview at Sardi\u2019s, surrounded by caricatures of the industry\u2019s greatest talents. \u201cOur goal was always, if we could just write songs and tell stories, and get to do that every day, that\u2019s our dream.\u201dAlthough their sensibility is contemporary, they are deeply rooted in the musical theater tradition, and their sound is somewhere on the border between show tunes and pop \u2014 they are not part of the hip-hop revolution on Broadway.\u201cI think we\u2019re attracted to material that\u2019s hopeful and messy, and in that mess, there\u2019s an attempt at getting at truth,\u201d Mr. Pasek said.They are, on the surface, quite different from each other. Mr. Paul, who lives in Harlem, is a churchgoing Christian from Westport, Conn.; straight; married; and the father of a 7-month-old daughter. Mr. Pasek, who grew up in Ardmore, Pa., and now lives on the Upper West Side, is gay, Jewish and single.But they both began as little boys who loved to sing.Mr. Paul, a talented pianist, started early. At age 3, he was singing gospel music with his father, a pastor, in church. Later, he sang and danced at senior centers with Music Theater of Connecticut; and then, at Staples High School, he performed in \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d conducted the orchestra in \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d and spent his free time poring over Broadway \u201cfake books,\u201d which help pianists master melodies.Mr. Pasek also sang with a parent: His mother is a developmental psychologist and professor with a propensity for bursting into song. (\u201cShe\u2019s like a real-life musical theater character, in the best possible way,\u201d he said.) She wrote and performed songs from a child\u2019s point of view (\u201cThey were a big hit on the synagogue circuit,\u201d he said), and he remembers guest starring with her at about age 7.Mr. Pasek sang and traveled with the Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale, and then, as a student at Friends Central School, performed in musicals including \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d and \u201c42nd Street.\u201dThey compare themselves to brothers, who bicker and bond, knowing their relationship will endure. A recent fight, over whose bad habits were to blame for their difficulty replacing the final first act song in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d sent Mr. Pasek stalking out of their Columbus Circle studio into the street, but then, 10 minutes later, calling Mr. Paul for a lengthy air-clearing that prompted the pair to ditch the disputed number and start over.Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul met the summer before college, at a freshman orientation weekend, and connected over a shared sense of humor, a passion for the work of Jason Robert Brown and an obsession with \u201cMerrily We Roll Along.\u201d (The title \u201cEdges\u201d alludes to a \u201cMerrily\u201d lyric.) Mr. Pasek wanted to record some songs he had written as a high school senior, and he recruited Mr. Paul as an arranger and accompanist; with that, their collaboration began.They mined their own experiences, and those of their friends, for material, acting out songs as they wrote. \u201cI kept watching them observe the social experiment of college and find ways to articulate it,\u201d said Nick Blaemire, a fellow Michigan student who is now an actor in New York, recalling a night when he told Mr. Pasek about his difficulty expressing love to a girlfriend, and seeing that become \u201cI Hmm You.\u201dRaised in the digital age, and aware of the role social media played in fueling their popularity, they have demonstrated an ease promoting their work \u2014 at first with CDs and a homespun tour of \u201cEdges,\u201d and more recently with producers, performers and journalists \u2014 that has served them well. \u201cThey\u2019re salesmen, and always have been \u2014 they know how to explain what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Mr. Blaemire said.Michael Gracey, the director of \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d had imagined asking a number of songwriters to contribute songs to his film, but, as he talked with Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul about the movie, abandoned that plan to give them all the work. He even videotaped their songwriting sessions, convinced that they would be of significance for posterity. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to describe the enormous impact those two have had on this film,\u201d he said.The director of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle, had a similar experience: He was looking for seasoned lyricists who could write words for songs composed by Justin Hurwitz when Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, seeking the gig, gave him proposed lyrics for a song called \u201cCity of Stars.\u201d That became a signature number. \u201cIt was screamingly obvious that we had stumbled onto a gold mine with these guys, and we brought them on right away,\u201d Mr. Chazelle said.Their promise was evident as soon as they started writing together. Brent Wagner, the emeritus chairman of the musical theater program at the University of Michigan, still remembers the night in 2005 when Mr. Blaemire, then a junior, persuaded him to stop by the Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor to see \u201cEdges.\u201d\u201cIt was a youthful work, and it wasn\u2019t completely advanced \u2014 there wasn\u2019t even music written down \u2014 but it was marvelous, and at that moment, you knew you were in the midst of real talent and real understanding of theater craft,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cBy the time they left school,\u201d he said, \u201cwe knew it would just be a matter of time.\u201dJeff Marx, the Tony Award-winning co-creator of \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d was equally convinced \u2014 so sure that he placed a bet on them. A Michigan alumnus, he had taken on Mr. Pasek as an assistant in the summer of 2005. (\u201cI looked at his Friendster profile and he seemed like a nice kid.\u201d) The next year, when Mr. Pasek asked to return, Mr. Marx told him he needed to stop interning and focus on writing shows with Mr. Paul.Mr. Paul couldn\u2019t afford to write full time \u2014 he needed to earn money for school \u2014 but Mr. Marx was so intent that he offered to give Mr. Paul money in lieu of what he would have earned from a summer job. Then, when Mr. Paul said he was unwilling to accept charity, Mr. Marx repositioned his offer as a wager, staking him $7,000, to be repaid only if Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul made it to Broadway within the next decade.It happened, but in an unexpected way.They had a frustrating experience adapting the Roald Dahl children\u2019s book \u201cJames and the Giant Peach,\u201d which was mounted at Goodspeed Musicals in 2010, and has been revised since. They remain proud of their songs, and the show is still being produced at small theaters, but the Dahl estate has decided to restrict professional productions to make room for a different adaptation.Six years after Mr. Marx\u2019s bet, Mr. Paul handed him a check at the opening night party. \u201cMy money was safe,\u201d Mr. Marx said.Other mentors have stepped in, too. Stephen Schwartz, the writer of \u201cPippin\u201d and \u201cWicked,\u201d has been advising them since Mr. Paul met him as an undergraduate. Mr. Schwartz recommended them to Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (\u201cRagtime\u201d), who admitted them to a Dramatists Guild fellowship. Ms. Ahrens and Mr. Flaherty assigned them to observe the development of \u201cNext to Normal,\u201d where they met the director Michael Greif (best known for \u201cRent\u201d), who is now directing \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201dThe new show was borne from an observation Mr. Pasek had about how his own high school community reacted when a former student died unexpectedly; he noted the desire of many, including himself, to be counted among the bereaved for someone they did not know well.Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul had talked about the idea for years when a producer, Stacey Mindich, who had helped commission \u201cDogfight,\u201d offered to finance their dream project. She introduced them to the work of a playwright, Steven Levenson, who became the \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d book writer, turning their musings into a narrative.The duo\u2019s work demonstrates an understanding of the contemporary lives of teenagers, but several of their collaborators have also been struck by their empathy for parents. \u201cThe insight they seem to have into the heart of a middle-aged mother has been there as long as I\u2019ve known them,\u201d said Ms. Jones, who has played Pasek and Paul mothers in \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d and \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d\u201cThey use these tiny moments to describe enormous feelings that have no words \u2014 a lyric about a Ninja Turtle night-light, or glow stars on the ceiling,\u201d she said, referring to a song that was used during the early stages of \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201dBoth Ms. Jones and Mr. Platt distinctly remember the day Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul brought in a new song, \u201cSo Big/So Small,\u201d in which her character describes the impact of the breakup of her marriage on his character\u2019s childhood. \u201cIt makes you die inside because it\u2019s so real,\u201d she said. Mr. Platt agreed. \u201cEverybody was a big wreck.\u201dAs they now prepare for the openings of the musical and movie, Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul describe what looks like sudden success as largely a coincidence. They have been working on \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d for six years, they finished writing songs for \u201cTrolls\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d more than a year ago, and they haven\u2019t yet begun work on \u201cSnow White.\u201dBut still \u2014 on one particularly busy recent day, they started in Dumbo, Brooklyn, at 8:30 a.m. for a \u201cGreatest Showman\u201d script meeting; traveled to Midtown to tweak \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d arrangements with their orchestrator, Alex Lacamoire; split up so Mr. Paul could go to a Chelsea studio to record tracks for \u201cShowman\u201d while Mr. Pasek sat in on auditions for Mr. Platt\u2019s understudy; went to MoMA for a screening of \u201cLa La Land\u201d hosted by Jennifer Lawrence; and then to an after-party at the Rainbow Room\u2019s Bar SixtyFive.Most days aren\u2019t nearly that varied or that glamorous. And at the start of each project, it is still the two of them, trying to figure out how to tell a story through music.\u201cNothing changes \u2014 the next time we have to write a song we\u2019re going to sit down at a piano and bang our heads against it for a long time and talk ourselves blue in the face about what it should be,\u201d Mr. Paul said.Mr. Pasek jumped in, finishing the thought: \u201cFacing the blank page doesn\u2019t get any easier.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Others were mismatched or borrowed. Many were fished out of the back of a closet, along with a memory of a long-lost job or a somber occasion.These suits were redeployed by thousands of American women on Election Day, when taking a photo of yourself in a pantsuit and posting it to the \u201csecret\u201d Facebook group Pantsuit Nation became the digital equivalent of slapping an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker on a lapel.\u201cThey\u2019re coming in at about 1,000 every few minutes,\u201d Libby Chamberlain, the founder of the group, said of the social media posts. \u201cWe have over 20,000 posts that are waiting to be approved. We have dozens of moderators and they can\u2019t keep up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s intense,\u201d she added.Ms. Chamberlain, 33, created Pantsuit Nation to support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, less than three weeks ago. Since then, more than 2.5 million people have joined the group \u2014 which is invitation only \u2014 and have reported donating more than $216,000 through the Pantsuit Nation fund-raising drive. But even that growth didn\u2019t prepare the group\u2019s organizers for the explosive activity on Tuesday.People, mainly women, posted photos of their daughters wearing \u201cFuture President\u201d T-shirts or creating an \u201cH\u201d with their bodies. They posted images and memories of their pioneering grandmothers, like an early airplane pilot. Many thanked the group for the virtual support it provided when they went to their polling places in mostly red states. These users called themselves \u201cblue dots.\u201d\u201cThere was a post from an 18-year-old who went to vote with her 91-year-old grandmother,\u201d Ms. Chamberlain said. \u201cIt\u2019s a montage of every sappy thing you\u2019ve ever seen about America. Only these are real people, in their own voices, and I think it\u2019s a picture of the real diversity in the country.\u201dA member of Pantsuit Nation, who says she runs the digital operations for Hillary for America, shared a message from Mrs. Clinton to the group: \u201cI wanted to take a moment to thank you for your support from the bottom of my heart. This election hasn\u2019t been easy: It\u2019s been long, hard-fought, and at times it made us question who we are as Americans.\u201cFor some of you, it\u2019s been difficult to feel like you could wear your support on your sleeve \u2014 and that\u2019s why this community has been such a special place.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019m honored and humbled to have all of you with me, but I\u2019m even prouder to see this community represent the best of America.\u201dMs. Chamberlain is a mother of two young children who has two part-time jobs in school administration in rural Maine. She said she had formed the Facebook group to create a space to celebrate the historic possibility of the first female president. The response, she said, reflected a need for positivity during a cynical, often dispiriting, campaign.Kristin Williams, 33, a member from Raleigh, N.C., said in a phone interview: \u201cIt did sort of revive my spirit. I didn\u2019t believe in \u2018election depression\u2019 until I realized it was happening to me. I\u2019ve cut ties with my family, or rather, they\u2019ve cut ties with me.\u201dMs. Williams, an assistant professor of sociology, described her family as \u201cvery conservative.\u201d She dressed in a pantsuit and a bandanna, like Rosie the Riveter, when she went to vote. She posted a selfie on the group\u2019s Facebook page with the caption, \u201cI walked through a sea of Trump supporters to vote today, proudly and emotionally, for her.\u201dMs. Williams added in the interview: \u201cSomeone thanked me, in the comments, for being a strong woman. How often do we say that to one another, in real life? That\u2019s been the biggest benefit. This group brings out the supportive side of women.\u201dThe stated goal of Pantsuit Nation is to express support for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, but it has also served as a forum to discuss the issues raised by the rhetoric of her opponent, Donald J. Trump. Many members have embraced the tropes of the Trump campaign, like \u201cBad Hombres\u201d and \u201cNasty Woman.\u201d\u201cThis Nasty Woman proudly voted in Forsyth County, Georgia, one of the few Republican strongholds in metro Atlanta!\u201d wrote Fatu Forna, 40, a physician and chief of department at a large medical organization. \u201cI am a proud immigrant, doctor, author, taxpayer, mother and, over all, Nasty Woman!\u201dMs. Forna, originally from Sierra Leone, wore a gray pantsuit and a pink shirt on Tuesday. She said in an interview: \u201cI sat in my car and took a picture.

We are living in an era when some advertising executive gazes at the moon and sees not beauty, or a humbling reminder of his insignificance, but the Earth\u2019s most unignorable billboard.The history of the slow, steady annexation and exploitation of our consciousness \u2014 whether by television commercials, war propaganda or tweets \u2014 is the subject of Tim Wu\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.\u201d He starts with the penny press newspapers of New York City, moves on to the heyday of radio and television, and concludes with the chaotic online bazaar of the present, surely better suited to bugs with eyes all over their heads than to ordinary human beings. En route, he covers snake oil, commercial psychology, Timothy Leary, AOL chat room Gomorrahs. His bandwidth is broad.\u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d is more survey than treatise. Few chapters offer startling new arguments, though Mr. Wu is well attuned to paradoxes and ironies. His tone is measured, careful.Only in the last 50 pages, when he appraises the excesses of the modern internet \u2014 which mutely scrapes our data and stalks us with weight-loss ads; which narcotizes us with listicles and hands to preening no-talents their own micro-platforms on which to strut their micro-stuff \u2014 does Mr. Wu turn savage, sinking enough venom into Twitter and Instagram to kill a baby monkey: \u201cFame, or the hunger for it, would become something of a pandemic, swallowing up more and more people and leaving them with scars of chronic attention-whoredom.\u201dThroughout his book, Mr. Wu explores \u201cthe fundamental, continual dilemma for the attention merchant \u2014 just how far will he go to get his harvest?\u201d Almost inevitably, these merchants run afoul of our core sense of privacy. But over time, that sense has eroded.By the end of the 1920s, most Americans were accustomed to being \u201ccajoled and sold to\u201d in print and on billboards. By the end of the 1950s, advertisers had wormed their way into the family living room, with television and radio networks \u201cowning\u201d times of the day that were previously sacred, like dinner hour. Then came the personal computer, the internet and, finally, the \u201cfourth screen\u201d: our mobile phones. They devoured every morsel of attention we had left, \u201crather in the way fracking would later recover great reserves of oil once considered wholly inaccessible.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s chapters about the early days of advertising are some of this book\u2019s most enjoyable, easily serving as a reader\u2019s companion to \u201cMad Men.\u201d (They contain great product trivia, too: Listerine was once marketed as a floor cleaner.) But it\u2019s the last third of \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d in which Mr. Wu charts the rise and fall of the utopian internet, that is truly memorable.\u201cOnce a commons that fostered the amateur eccentric in every area of interest, the web, by 2015, was thoroughly overrun by commercial junk,\u201d he writes. And the most pathetic part? That commercial junk barely generates a profit. All those clicks amount to \u201crounding errors in the scheme of commerce.\u201dIn other words, the internet has become Vegas without the revenue.Mr. Wu is plenty aware of the web\u2019s virtues, not least of which is that it connects us to others. But we pay a price for our gmail and social media habits. Google and Facebook keep track of our purchases and wishes and fears \u2014 we\u2019ve become their product, their content. A number of commercial entities, including news organizations, subject online visitors to \u201cextraordinary surveillance,\u201d too, collecting data about them without their awareness or explicit consent. \u201cIt is a more thoroughly invasive effort,\u201d he writes, \u201cthan any N.S.A. data collection ever disclosed.\u201dAnd how connected are we, really, under the new terms and conditions of our lives? When we all gathered around the boob tube, Mr. Wu writes, we at least had \u201ca new degree of shared awareness, even shared identity.\u201d But we\u2019ve since become a nation of niches, each of us vanished into our customized, ego-enlarging, time-thieving worlds.And so Mr. Wu concludes his book with a cri de coeur, imploring us to regain custody of our attention. It is written so rousingly that it just may make you reconsider your priorities. He brings up the work of the psychologist and philosopher William James, who \u201cheld that our life experience would ultimately amount to whatever we had paid attention to.\u201d He also quotes James\u2019s quasi-palindromic complement, the ethicist James Williams: \u201cYour time is scarce, and your technologies know it.\u201dWe are what we choose to focus on, the sum of our concentrations. What will we choose? This is an age of glorious individualism. Yet never, it seems, have we belonged less to ourselves.The Attention MerchantsThe Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our HeadsBy Tim Wu403 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $28.95.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teslas in the Trailer Park: A California City Faces Its Housing Squeeze", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byThe town of Mountain View, Google\u2019s home, wants to do something about that. Given new marching orders from a reform-minded City Council that was swept into office here two years ago, Mountain View is looking to increase its housing stock by as much as 50 percent \u2014 including as many as 10,000 units in the area around Google\u2019s main campus.\u201cWe need to provide housing because there\u2019s a housing shortage,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a Mountain View councilman. That may seem an obvious tautology, but it turns out to be highly contentious in a state where most cities and suburbs are still dominated by anti-growth politics that seek to maximize the construction of tax-generating offices while minimizing the number of budget-depleting residents.Mountain View\u2019s political evolution, combined with some limited cases elsewhere, suggests that as rent and home prices have reached the point where even highly paid tech workers are struggling \u2014 the median home here costs $1.4 million, according to Zillow \u2014 the tide is slowly shifting away from resisting growth at all costs and instead trying to channel it.This Silicon Valley city of about 80,000 people is also a reminder that, despite the outsize attention given to big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, any solution to California\u2019s housing crisis is going to rely heavily on suburbs as well.This was underscored by the results of last week\u2019s election, when voters across California passed various affordable housing measures along with new transit funding, and, in some cases, rejected efforts to restrict or cap development. In Palo Alto, several pro-housing candidates were elected to the City Council. Residents in Mountain View approved rent control.\u201cHousing used to be about \u2018them\u2019 \u2014 like poverty or unemployment,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. \u201cBut it has become so expensive in the Bay Area that housing now touches enough people to win elections.\u201dMany employees say they would prefer to live closer to work. But these companies reside in small cities that consider themselves suburbs, and the local politics are usually aligned against building dense urban apartments to house them.Take Palo Alto, the Silicon Valley city that has become emblematic of the state\u2019s reputation for rampant not-in-my-backyard politics. Palo Alto has one of the state\u2019s worst housing shortages. With about three jobs for every housing unit, it has among the most out-of-balance mixes anywhere in Silicon Valley.But instead of dealing with this issue by building the few thousand or so apartments it would take to make a dent in the problem, the city has mostly looked to restraining a pace of job growth that the mayor described as \u201cunhealthy.\u201dFarther up the peninsula near San Francisco, the small city of Brisbane told a developer that its proposal for a mixed-use development with offices and 4,000 housing units should have offices for about 15,000 workers, but no new housing.Play that out a thousand times over and the crux of the state\u2019s housing crisis is clear: Everyone knows housing costs are unsustainable and unfair, and that they pose a threat to the state\u2019s economy. Yet every city seems to be counting on its neighbors to step up and fix it.The results are strange compromises like the one made by Rebecca and Steven Callister, a couple in their late 20s who live in a double-wide trailer in a Mountain View mobile home park whose residents are retirees and young tech workers.Mr. Callister is an engineer at LinkedIn, the sort of worker who, in most places, would own a home. But given the cost of housing in Mountain View and the brutal commute times from anywhere they could afford, a trailer makes the most sense and lets him spend more time with the couple\u2019s two young children.\u201cWe joke that it\u2019s the only mobile home park with Mercedeses and Teslas in the driveway,\u201d Mrs. Callister said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the new middle class in California.\u201dIn contrast to Palo Alto, Mountain View is trying to wedge new apartments into its office parks. Much of the action centers on the North Bayshore area, a neighborhood of low-slung office buildings surrounded by asphalt parking lots.Each weekday morning, North Bayshore fills up with cars and young Google employees. They pack the narrow sidewalks and zip around on multicolored bikes. But then the day ends, everyone goes home and there is not much left besides sounds from the nearby freeway and overachievers working late.Mr. Siegel, the city councilman, wants to turn this prototypical example of sprawl into a bustling urban neighborhood. The city has plans for nearly 10,000 new apartments and hopes that businesses like a grocery store, bars and retail shops will follow them.Here in Mountain View, as in many places, residents are mostly aligned against putting too many apartments near the city\u2019s core single-family-home neighborhoods. The city is looking to create new neighborhoods by pushing growth to areas like North Bayshore, where there are already a lot of jobs and few neighbors to complain.Versions of that strategy are taking hold across the Bay Area.Sunnyvale, where Yahoo is based, is looking to transform an older industrial area near one of its rail stations into a new development that would include offices and housing. Menlo Park is studying how to allow for up to 4,500 housing units to be built on industrial land near Facebook\u2019s headquarters.Chris Meany, a partner at Wilson Meany, a real estate development firm in San Francisco, recently headed up a project in San Mateo, about a half-hour south of San Francisco. There, a defunct horse-racing track is being redeveloped into a mixed-use project that sits along a train stop and will eventually comprise five office buildings and 1,000 houses, apartments and condos.Given the political resistance to new housing and the cascade of lawsuits that are a good bet to follow any new proposal, Mr. Meany said he and other developers were more likely to focus on mega-projects with a bigger payoff.\u201cA planner would go out and say, \u2018We should do things regionally and scatter housing throughout the area,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re the developer who has to actually get it done, it is better to go off and find large areas of problematic land than trying to choose the smartest location.\u201dNorth Bayshore was historically farmland and the site of the city dump, but in the 1970s, when tech first started booming, Mountain View looked to develop it into a low-density office park.The area has since become a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s booms and busts. Early tenants included faded giants like Silicon Graphics. Then came the 1990s and the dot-com boom and bust.In 1999, just before the bust hit, a little start-up named Google moved from Palo Alto to North Bayshore when it had only a few dozen employees. Today, Google has about 20,000 workers here, and the crush of daily commuters leads to long backups at the three freeway exits into the area.Four years ago \u2014 as Google was swelling, rents were exploding and eviction stories were becoming commonplace \u2014 Mountain View started looking to redevelop North Bayshore. The acrimonious debate over whether to add housing included both predictions that the neighborhood would fill up with the tech equivalent of Chinese factory dorms and worries that residents would disturb a habitat for local burrowing owls.Since then the Council has approved about 2,000 new units elsewhere in town. In all, Mountain View is studying how to add a total of 17,000 units. Mr. Siegel said developers submitted more proposals for housing than the city could process, so the town was looking to hire more planners.There are plenty of desks and a budget to pay them, but few want to take the job.\u201cThey can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byGood SentencesTo the Editor:It was his opening paragraph that took me aback, when he wrote that \u201ca good thriller and a good sentence exist at cross purposes.\u201d As a writer who is constantly self-doubting and second-guessing herself, I instantly started questioning the quality of my own writing. I work hard to write literate English, but I began to wonder if the turns of phrase I labor over are turgid or if they obscure the action in my novels.However, I was also reminded of a famous exchange between Raymond Chandler and Dorothy L. Sayers. Sayers had written in \u201cThe Omnibus of Crime\u201d that the detective story \u201cdoes not, and by hypothesis never can, attain the loftiest level of literary achievement.\u201dIn 1944, Chandler responded in \u201cThe Simple Art of Murder\u201d:\u201cI do not know what the loftiest level of literary achievement is: Neither did Aeschylus or Shakespeare; neither does Miss Sayers. Other things being equal, which they never are, a more powerful theme will provoke a more powerful performance. Yet some very dull books have been written about God, and some very fine ones about how to make a living and stay fairly honest. It is always a matter of who writes the stuff, and what he [sic] has in him [sic] to write it with. .\u2008.\u2008. All reading for pleasure is escape, whether it be Greek, mathematics, astronomy, Benedetto Croce or \u2018The Diary of the Forgotten Man.\u2019 To say otherwise is to be an intellectual snob, and a juvenile at the art of living.\u201dThere certainly are lazy and sloppy crime and thriller writers, as there are lazy and sloppy writers of mimetic fiction, but most of us work hard to create good sentences (building to good paragraphs, etc.). I don\u2019t know Lee Child well enough to know how he writes his immensely readable and successful novels, but his clipped prose is ideal for the Jack Reacher novels \u2014 like Finch, I suspect he subordinates his style to the demands of his literary form.SARA PARETSKYCHICAGOThe writer is the author, most recently, of \u201cBrush Back\u201d and a past president of the Mystery Writers of America.\u2b25Which Came FirstTo the Editor:In terms of plot and characterization, the two works are nearly congruent, despite changes in the nationality of a few of the characters and the book\u2019s quasi-happy ending. But far from being the \u201clittle masterpiece\u201d Penzler describes, the novel is one of Greene\u2019s weakest and is, by overwhelming critical consensus, far inferior to the brilliant film classic \u2014 the product of many collaborators working at the top of their form \u2014 for which it provided the humble seedbed. Although he had not written it for publication and it does not appear in the movie\u2019s credits, Greene eventually decided to publish the short novel, which appeared in 1950, a year after the release of the film.ROBERT F.

{"Headline": "The In-Law in the Trump Inner Circle: Jared Kushner\u2019s Steadying Hand", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byIt was the low point for a campaign that had been in steady decline for weeks.Less than 24 hours earlier, an 11-year-old recording of Donald J. Trump boasting about forcing himself on women had surfaced and gone viral. Now, on a Saturday morning in October, his closest advisers had assembled in his Trump Tower apartment to discuss what to do.The group included a handful of seasoned politicians and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew who ordinarily observes the Sabbath strictly.While the others \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Reince Priebus \u2014 emphasized the gravity of the situation, urging Mr. Trump to express contrition, Mr. Kushner reminded him of what he had built. Amid the discussions, the Republican candidate briefly went down to greet 100 or so supporters gathered in front of the building.\u201cThere\u2019s 2,500 people down there,\u201d Mr. Trump told his advisers when he returned.\u201cThose are the people who are going to elect you president,\u201d Mr. Kushner replied, opting not to correct the candidate\u2019s crowd estimate. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the other people.\u201dIn the chaos that often seems to surround Mr. Trump \u2014 the churn of advisers, the Twitter wars with reporters, the daily uncertainty over who is making decisions \u2014 Mr. Kushner has emerged as the closest thing to a steadying influence, injecting optimism, playing down controversies and reinforcing Mr. Trump\u2019s perceptions, worldview and instincts.In an ever-shifting organization chart of friends and advisers, Mr. Kushner, 35, has been the lone constant. Raised by one family that prizes loyalty above all else, he married into another. And he is well acquainted with Mr. Trump\u2019s personality type, with his own father a volatile real estate magnate.Now, there is talk of his following Mr. Trump into the White House. What some may see as Mr. Kushner\u2019s greatest liabilities as an adviser \u2014 his lack of political experience, policy expertise or familiarity with the ways of Washington \u2014 the president-elect views as his greatest strength: a single-minded devotion without a competing agenda.\u201cEveryone else has their own constituencies, but Jared is just there to protect the interests of the president,\u201d said Thomas Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who is heading up the inaugural committee.Whatever role Mr. Kushner may play in the administration, he has already had a hand in helping assemble it. Both of Mr. Trump\u2019s most senior advisers, Mr. Priebus, his new chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, seek Mr. Kushner\u2019s advice routinely, considering his buy-in almost a prerequisite for their proposals to Mr. Trump, two senior Trump officials said. (In deference to Mr. Kushner, the transition team delayed announcing the two men\u2019s appointment until after the Jewish sabbath last weekend.)\u201cJared has the trust, confidence and ear of the entire inner circle of the Trump administration, including the most important member of that group, the president-elect,\u201d said Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He described Mr. Kushner as \u201cone of the most important players right now beyond the president- and vice president-elect.\u201dInside the Trump operation, he is known as the staunchest defender of Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment. When Mr. Bannon was recently accused of anti-Semitism and of promoting white supremacist views and conspiracy theories, Mr. Kushner reassured the Trump team. He called Mr. Bannon a man of character and said the widespread criticism was a smear, according to a senior Republican official, speaking about private discussions on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Kushner declined to be interviewed for this article. Although he is a newspaper owner and publisher, he has not been quoted in the media since the start of the campaign.Before that, Mr. Kushner did not have much of a public political identity, but appeared to lean left. He was raised in a Democratic household, and several years ago, he and his wife hosted a fund-raiser in their Park Avenue penthouse for Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey and former Newark mayor, who has become a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.The couple moves in a predominantly liberal Manhattan circle. \u201cTheir social politics seem more what I would expect from New Yorkers of their generation,\u201d said Adam Silver, the National Basketball Association commissioner and a friend of Mr. Kushner\u2019s who has frequently contributed to Democrats.Some New York business leaders, who had recoiled at Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, say privately that they are hoping Mr. Kushner will be a moderating influence on the new president. But it remains to be seen how receptive he will be to their concerns. Trump officials say that Mr. Kushner underwent an ideological conversion over the course of the campaign, and that he was particularly affected by the experience of wading into the crowds at Trump rallies.Mr. Kushner projects a very different image from his father and father-in-law. He speaks in a near-whisper, punctuated by long pauses, conveying both intimacy and awkwardness.Unlike most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, Mr. Kushner is unfazed by Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent fits of anger, sitting silently rather than flinching or fighting back when he is being dressed down, several campaign officials have said. The relationship between the two men is relatively uncomplicated. Unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s two eldest sons, Mr. Kushner did not have to live through his father-in-law\u2019s public and messy divorces, and the businesses that he presides over are his own, not part of the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump has described him as a \u201cbrilliant young man.\u201dHis quiet manner belies a driving confidence; his family\u2019s wealth has allowed him to plunge into new ventures, sometimes stumbling in the process. In his mid-20s, he took charge of his father\u2019s real estate empire and bought The New York Observer. Much as he once courted the media mogul Rupert Murdoch as a mentor, now that he is immersing himself in politics, he has been seeking the counsel of Henry Kissinger.He oversaw the creation of the campaign\u2019s $90 million digital operation, including a database of millions of Trump supporters, which was developed by a Texas business that had previously worked on the Trump Organization website. He also brokered important meetings for Mr. Trump, including his sit-down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, which Mr. Kushner arranged with Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\u201cHe\u2019s a cool customer,\u201d Mr. Dermer said of Mr. Kushner.Mr. Kushner\u2019s political inexperience was at times evident during the campaign. He told one aide that he did not need to pay for traditional focus groups because he could measure voter reaction from the applause at Mr. Trump\u2019s events.Like his father-in-law, he ran hot and cold on senior campaign advisers, and played a role in ousting two of them, Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, after their conduct or affiliations made them liabilities. More recently, Mr. Kushner backed away from a member of the transition team he had previously supported, when the man\u2019s work as a lobbyist for foreign governments attracted headlines.Though he is not particularly bookish, Mr. Kushner is an admirer of \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo,\u201d the story of an innocent man seeking vengeance against people who have wronged him. It is a story that feels particularly resonant now: In recent weeks, Mr. Kushner has been able to exact a measure of revenge against his own family\u2019s nemesis, Governor Christie.During the campaign, Mr. Kushner opposed Mr. Christie\u2019s appointment to oversee the transition team, but Mr. Trump overruled him, aides have said. This past week, however, Mr. Kushner helped push Mr. Christie out.Their history dates to 2005, when Mr. Christie, then the United States attorney for New Jersey, sent Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, to federal prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations. The case involved a tawdry family feud: At one point, Charles Kushner sought to blackmail his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with the federal authorities, by hiring a woman to seduce him and videotape the encounter.\u201cThis had nothing to do with personalities or individual relationships,\u201d Jason Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman, said of Mr. Christie\u2019s departure. \u201cThis was purely about putting in the best leadership and the most-qualified individuals to form the government that the president-elect wants in place when he\u2019s sworn in on Jan. 20.\u201dOther Trump officials were critical of Mr. Christie\u2019s performance as transition chief, and said his role had become untenable after the so-called Bridgegate scandal resulted in the convictions of two former Christie aides days before the election.In defending Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner told the story of his grandmother\u2019s narrow escape from the Nazis in the Soviet Union during World War II. The article provoked an angry response on Facebook from two estranged cousins, one of whom accused Mr. Kushner of exploiting their family\u2019s history for political purposes.Like Mr. Trump\u2019s children, Mr. Kushner was raised in a privileged environment. He went to a private Jewish school in Livingston, N.J., and attended Harvard after his parents pledged a $2.5 million gift to the university. Later, he got a joint M.B.A. and law degree from New York University.His wife described him as a \u201cgreat New Jersey boy,\u201d in a Vogue magazine interview last year. When the couple were married at a Trump golf course in 2009, guests were given white flip-flops with the words \u201cJared\u201d and \u201cIvanka\u201d on the insoles and a tag reading, \u201cA Great Pair.\u201dMr. Kushner had no journalism experience when he purchased The Observer for $10 million in 2006, installing a chess board in his office that former staff members don\u2019t recall ever being used.He found himself presiding over a newspaper of reporters and editors more or less his age, and he responded with solicitousness. \u201c\u2018This is so great I\u2019m getting to hang around with journalists, and they are really smart,\u201d Nancy Butkus, the paper\u2019s former artistic director, recalled Mr. Kushner saying in a cab packed with Observer employees.Mr. Kushner became the public face of his family\u2019s real estate business, Kushner Companies, when his father was sent to prison. In an effort to rehabilitate the family name, the younger Mr. Kushner oversaw a series of transactions geared toward moving holdings out of New Jersey and into New York.The centerpiece was the purchase of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper for $1.8 billion. It was then as record price for a New York office building; as it turned out, the timing could not have been worse. A couple of years later, in the face of recession, the Kushners were forced to sell a stake in the building to cover a secondary loan on the property.Since then, the real estate market has rebounded; the Kushners have acquired $7 billion worth of commercial and residential property over the last decade, according to real estate executives who have been briefed by the Kushners but were not authorized to discuss the matters.Charles Kushner remains an active presence in the business. The company named a new president over the summer as his son, the C.E.O., became increasingly involved in the Trump campaign. Jared Kushner has found a new passion, and his father-in-law is counting on him.Jason Horowitz and Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And Facebook hired Yann LeCun, an expert in \u201cneural networks\u201d who left New York University to start a research program at the social media giant.On a recent train ride to Zurich, Dr. Schmidhuber, an athletic 53-year-old who is co-director of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research here, reflected on how he believed his early research was often overlooked or ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s like much of the rest of society,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s postfactual.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber\u2019s complaints are well known within the fraternity of researchers who have turned what until a half-decade ago was an academic backwater into a multibillion-dollar industry. He has been accused of taking credit for other people\u2019s research and even using multiple aliases on Wikipedia to make it look as if people are agreeing with his posts.\u201cJ\u00fcrgen is manically obsessed with recognition and keeps claiming credit he doesn\u2019t deserve for many, many things,\u201d Dr. LeCun said in an email. \u201cIt causes him to systematically stand up at the end of every talk and claim credit for what was just presented, generally not in a justified manner.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber counters that criticism with a bigger point: He is not the only one who is not getting due credit among A.I. researchers. In fact, he says work going all the way back to the 1960s is regularly ignored by today\u2019s research luminaries.Although he insists he doesn\u2019t harbor ill will toward those better-known researchers, it grates on him that history hasn\u2019t been kinder. \u201cCertain researchers in my field have acted as if they invented something, although it was invented by other people whom they did not even mention,\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber said.But understanding the disconnect between his early work and his lack of celebrity isn\u2019t easy \u2014 and cannot be entirely explained by the fact that he lives thousands of miles from the tech industry\u2019s center of gravity.The dispute is about the roots of neural networks, which allow machines to learn by recognizing patterns that can then be applied generally. Applications include recognizing speech and language, visually identifying objects, navigating in self-driving cars and making robot hands grasp more deftly. As a scientific field, it dates to the 1940s. But only in recent years have researchers in this area made striking progress.For decades, neural networks were laboratory curiosities, often met with skepticism. But in the 1990s, with faster and cheaper computers as well as new ideas about how to design neural nets, there was finally progress.Just as humans do not restart learning from scratch every second, a certain type of neural network adds loops or memory that interpret each new word or observation in light of what has been previously observed. LSTM strikingly improved these networks, leading to huge jumps in accuracy.It may be that Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s misfortune is that he was simply too early \u2014 a few years ahead of the powerful and more affordable computers we have today. It was not until recently that his concepts started to pan out.But between Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s and Dr. Hochreiter\u2019s research and today\u2019s progress there was a big gap \u2014 and that\u2019s the rub. Other researchers say it took many contributors to get from Point A to Point B, where we are today.\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of seminal stuff,\u201d said Gary Bradski, an A.I. scientist who created a popular computer vision system known as OpenCV. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t the one who made it popular. It\u2019s kind of like the Vikings discovering America; Columbus made it real.\u201dDr. Schmidhuber also has a grand vision for A.I. \u2014 that self-aware or \u201cconscious machines\u201d are just around the corner \u2014 that causes eyes to roll among some of his peers. To put a fine point on the debate: Is artificial intelligence an engineering discipline, or a godlike field on the cusp of creating a new superintelligent species?Dr. Schmidhuber is firmly in the god camp. He maintains that the basic concepts for such technologies already exist, and that there is nothing magical about human consciousness. \u201cGenerally speaking, consciousness and self-awareness are overrated,\u201d he said, arguing that machine consciousness will emerge from more powerful computers and software algorithms much like those he has already designed.It\u2019s been an obsession since he was a teenager in Germany reading science fiction.\u201cAs I grew up I kept asking myself, \u2018What\u2019s the maximum impact I could have?\u2019\u201d Dr. Schmidhuber recalled. \u201cAnd it became clear to me that it\u2019s to build something smarter than myself, which will build something even smarter, et cetera, et cetera, and eventually colonize and transform the universe, and make it intelligent.\u201dToday, he will not be pinned down on when such thinking machines might arrive, saying only that given the vast improvements in computing power it will be soon.In 2014, he and others founded a company to commercialize some of the technology that he helped create and to work on \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d artificial intelligence.Nnaisense\u2019s chief executive is an American computer scientist, Faustino Gomez, who has been Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s research collaborator for many years. He defends both his partner\u2019s claims of having done pioneering work and his optimism about the field that has begun shaking up industries and economies around the world.\u201cWe are at the beginning of the end of the beginning in A.I.,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: JPMorgan Said to Settle Bribery Case, Ending \u2018Too Big to Fail,\u2019 Goldman\u2019s Pitch to the Masses", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byJPMorgan Chase\u2019s long Chinese family drama is coming to a close.As early as Thursday, the United States authorities are expected to announce that, after more than three years of investigations, they have determined that the bank hired the children of Chinese leaders with the specific intent of winning business from Chinese state-run companies, in violation of the United States foreign bribery law.The bank had argued that the hires fell into a gray area, but the United States government found that several JPMorgan bankers made it clear that the jobs were arranged to secure deals with Chinese state-run companies, people briefed on the matter said.Since then, the bank has resolved those cases by paying huge penalties but avoiding criminal prosecution.This latest settlement also allows JPMorgan to avoid criminal charges, people briefed on the matter said. Instead, the bank negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement.Since becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in January, Neel Kashkari has repeatedly sounded the warning about American banks, saying that they were still too big to fail even after the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.In a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, he said his plan would require banks with $250 billion or more in assets to issue common equity of 23.5 percent, up from 13 percent required under current rules.Long-term debt would not be allowed to be counted as part of that cushion because history showed it was not a foolproof buffer to losses, Mr. Kashkari said.The plan would be likely to prompt banks to break apart because of the high cost of holding so much capital.Many in the banking industry say that the plan will go nowhere. However, these days few people can say with any certainty what policies President-elect Donald J. Trump will ultimately adopt.As part of Goldman Sachs\u2019s push into consumer lending, the bank wants Americans to know that debt happens.The 15- and 30-second video ads, which will appear on Facebook, Hulu, Pandora and YouTube, depict debt as an unavoidable nuisance of modern life, not something shameful. \u201cDebt happens. It\u2019s how you get out that counts,\u201d the ads say.Dustin Cohn, who oversees brand management for Goldman\u2019s new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank\u2019s aim was to \u201cdestigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.\u201d\u2022 William C.

{"Headline": "How Much Disclosure About an Op-Ed Author Is Required?", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byThe Public Editor\u201cNo matter how many editors Facebook hired, it would be unable to monitor the volume of information that flows through its site, and it would be similarly impossible for readers to verify what was checked,\u201d she wrote.Who is this woman brave enough to come forward in Facebook\u2019s defense?I wouldn\u2019t expect Times editors to necessarily put all that information in a piece explaining Jessica Lessin\u2019s connections to a company she\u2019s writing about. But simply saying her husband \u201cworked at Facebook for a brief period\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.Clearly, there is the potential for a conflict of interest here and one that readers should be made aware of. After all, the author landed a spot on the coveted New York Times Op-Ed page for a piece that could easily be interpreted as largely defending Facebook.I asked Jim Dao, editor of the Op-Ed pages, to help me understand why such a minimal description was made of Lessin\u2019s Facebook ties. Here\u2019s what he said:The piece made a reasonable argument applicable not just to Facebook but also to other social media platforms. We obviously allow writers with conflicts to write for our page, so long as they disclose those conflicts. In this case I\u2019d agree that we could have provided a bit more specificity. But I also think that the central question \u2014 did she (or in this case, her husband) ever have a financial relationship with the company \u2014 was answered. And since it was answered in the affirmative, readers were given some essential information upon which to base their judgments about the piece.I then went to Jessica Lessin to get her take on the modest disclosure. Lessin said she believes in conflict of interest disclosures and said she would have included whatever language the editors had requested. But she also maintains that her website has written critically of Facebook many times and says she has never been an apologist for the company.In fairness to Lessin, part of her argument in her Op-Ed piece is that giving Facebook too much editorial power \u2014 by urging it to fact-check and censor \u2014 would be unprecedented and dangerous.I don\u2019t object to letting Lessin write the piece she did. I assume it was one that the editors thought was original and smartly argued. Lessin, after all, has her own journalistic bona fides \u2014 having covered technology at The Wall Street Journal before she started her own tech site.What I question is the rather half-hearted effort to tell readers just whose argument they were hearing. A disclosure that simply says her husband was a Facebook employee makes it seem almost not worth mentioning \u2014 as if he was one of thousands who passed through the doors of the sprawling tech company every day. It reveals nothing about the elements of Lessin\u2019s biography that seem most pertinent.Withholding information about possible conflicts has the effect of shortchanging everyone, the readers who are trying to evaluate the argument and the writer trying to make it.Advertisement"}

Trump at a concert on Saturday in California before tumbling into a 17-minute, free-associative speech addressing radio programmers, MTV, his friends and collaborators Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and more.After getting an array of grievances off his chest \u2014 from real-world politics to awards-show politics \u2014 Mr. West ended the performance with a microphone drop, having played only three songs, leaving fans bitter and upset, according to reactions on social media.People in the crowd look shocked. Disappointed. Starting to leave the arena.The brief concert, at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, came two nights after Mr. West shocked his audience by announcing at a show in San Jose, Calif., that he had not voted, but would have cast a ballot for Mr. Trump if he had. Though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like Black Lives Matter and women\u2019s rights, he praised Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmethod of communication\u201d as \u201cvery futuristic.\u201d\u201cA lot of people here tonight felt like they lost,\u201d the rapper began. \u201cYou know why?

{"Headline": "Obama, With Angela Merkel in Berlin, Assails Spread of Fake News", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byBut instead of basking in the glow of his valedictory tour of Europe, Mr. Obama used the moment to make a passionate and pointed attack on bogus news stories disseminated on Facebook and other social media platforms, twice calling such false reports a threat to democracy in his hourlong news conference.Mr. Obama also warned Mr. Trump of the need to take the job of the presidency seriously and to be tough on Russia.\u201cThe extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States not just by its own people, but by people around the world \u2014 that forces you to focus,\u201d Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency. \u201cThat demands seriousness.\u201d\u201cAnd if you\u2019re not serious about the job, then you probably won\u2019t be there very long,\u201d Mr. Obama added.But it was on the subject of false information coursing through social media and television that Mr. Obama was most impassioned, so much so that at one stage he lost track of the question he was answering.\u201cBecause in an age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect.\u201d\u201cI got all caught up in that one,\u201d he said.Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, recently said fake news on the social network was rare, and dismissed notions that such reports might have swayed the election as \u201cpretty crazy.\u201dIn the three months before Election Day, the most popular stories produced by hoax sites and \u201chyperpartisan blogs\u201d generated more engagement \u2014 likes, shares and comments \u2014 on Facebook than the most popular articles by major news websites, the analysis found.Among the 20 most popular fake election stories identified by BuzzFeed, all but three favored Mr. Trump or denigrated Hillary Clinton.In Berlin, Mr. Obama pointed a second time to the potential dangers of false news reports.\u201cIn the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened,\u201d he said in response to a question about the recent election.\u201cIf we are not serious about facts and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can\u2019t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.\u201dMs. Merkel offered her own warnings about the disruptions associated with digitization, likening the present period to the social disruptions that occurred during the Industrial Revolution.Germans have shown deep ambivalence toward social media, worried that global companies fail to respect the country\u2019s strict laws protecting personal privacy. Facebook has also come under scrutiny from the German government for allowing the spread of hate speech in postings that would be illegal in traditional media.The chancellor thanked Mr. Obama for putting \u201cpersonal privacy on the agenda,\u201d a nod to the strain in relations between the two after it emerged in 2013 that the National Security Agency had been monitoring Ms. Merkel\u2019s cellphone, prompting outrage among Germans.Mr. Obama urged Mr. Trump to cooperate with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when the Russians behave, but said he hoped \u201cthat the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.\u201d\u201cAnd I don\u2019t expect that the president-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cThat will be something we\u2019ll learn more about as the president-elect puts his team together,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump has repeatedly complimented Mr. Putin and has sought to improve ties with Russia. The United States has accused Russia of hacking emails of Democratic Party officials in order to influence the election, and Mr. Putin warmly welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.Mr. Obama said he spoke to Mr. Trump last week about ensuring that his actions help to unify and not divide the country.\u201cAnd what I said to him was what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn\u2019t support him,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s indicated his understanding of that.\u201d\u201cThat has to reflect itself not only in the things he says but also in how he fills out his administration,\u201d Mr. Obama said, apparently referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as a senior adviser. Mr. Bannon has been criticized for his association with racist, nationalistic and anti-Semitic views.\u201cMy hope is that that\u2019s something he is thinking about,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cBecause not only is the president of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction, but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways.\u201dMr. Obama said Mr. Trump had reassured him that he would remain committed to the NATO alliance once in office, and that he was encouraged by that.Yet the Europeans, including Germany, have failed consistently over the years to uphold their financial commitment to supporting the alliance, long a sore point with Washington.Germany has fallen short of its contributions over the past several years, and in 2015 made good on only about half its pledge, despite record tax income for the government.Ms. Merkel vowed that this would change in the future, crediting Mr. Obama with delivering the message that Germany needed to increase military spending.\u201cIn the long term, the imbalance over defense spending cannot be maintained, and Germany has understood this message and already begun to react,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.Mr. Obama added that Germans should appreciate what the United States had done for the country since World War II.\u201cBut I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cHas looked out for Germany. Has provided security for Germany. Has helped rebuild Germany. And unify Germany.\u201dMr. Obama also said that if he were German, he would probably vote for Ms. Merkel, who may run next year for a fourth four-year term. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that hurts or helps,\u201d he said with a smile.Mr. Obama arrived in Berlin on Wednesday night, and the two leaders had a private dinner. Mr. Obama spent much of Thursday morning waiting at his hotel for Ms. Merkel\u2019s schedule to clear.The two dined again Thursday evening and will meet Friday morning along with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Mr. Obama leaves for an Asian-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, early Friday afternoon.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the caption for the video with this article misidentified the world leader who referred to President Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel as \u201cveterans\u201d of the international political stage.

{"Headline": "Paul Newman Who? Salad Dressing Company Adjusts to Reach Millennials", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingWESTPORT, Conn. \u2014 Newman\u2019s Own was having trouble getting the word out about its philanthropy.The brand has \u201cAll Profits to Charity\u201d inscribed across every label on its popular salad dressings, tomato sauces and microwaveable popcorn \u2014 a pledge that has amounted to more than $485 million donated since 1982.But some wondered if consumers were simply being distracted by the movie star Paul Newman\u2019s dazzling smile.\u201cThey might see it the first time, but the second or third time they only see Paul\u2019s face,\u201d said Bruce Bruemmer, vice president of marketing for Newman\u2019s Own. \u201cThe \u2018All Profits to Charity\u2019 is lost.\u201dWell, the grin is not going anywhere. But Newman\u2019s Own is making more of a show of its record of magnanimity, rolling out a marketing initiative aimed at millennials who might not recognize the famous face of the brand and might have little to no knowledge of its altruistic story.For a no-frills company that has tried to avoid the spotlight \u2014 its celebrity co-founder notwithstanding \u2014 the new promotional effort is an unusual step. But it follows a growing pattern among large corporations to highlight their philanthropic work to appeal to a younger audience. Millennials especially have demonstrated a propensity to favor companies with a generous mission.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is not new,\u201d said Robert Forrester, chief executive of the Newman\u2019s Own Foundation and a longtime friend of Mr. Newman, who died in 2008. \u201cThis is in our DNA.\u201dNewman\u2019s Own worked with the production company the Narrative Content Group, which is based in Atlanta, to produce videos that highlight a few of the 600 charities the company works with each year. Three of the videos are set to be released on Monday on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube; the rest will be circulated in 2017.Newman\u2019s Own is also rewording and repositioning the \u201cAll Profits to Charity\u201d banner that typically frames Mr. Newman\u2019s face. The new label, which is expected to start appearing in stores in December, will be more prominently located on the products. The wording has also changed to \u201c100 Percent Profits to Charity,\u201d which Newman\u2019s Own feels is a slight but significant clarification to consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s definitive,\u201d Mr. Bruemmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s unambiguous.\u201d\u201cWe give it all away. That makes a big difference,\u201d he added.Newman\u2019s Own\u2019s charitable endeavor remains unchanged. It gives all proceeds to people or organizations in need. That was Mr. Newman\u2019s original concept.\u201cPaul had two founding values: Quality would always trump the bottom line,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cAnd if we ever have any money, we\u2019d give it away.\u201dThe foundation, which is funded entirely through sales of Newman\u2019s Own products and does not accept donations, gave away $260.8 million before Mr. Newman\u2019s death and $224.4 million since then, or about $28 million annually since 2008.But only a third of Newman\u2019s Own customers said they realized the company gave away its profits, according to Mr. Bruemmer. That figure was even lower among millennials, he said; only 12 percent acknowledged they knew how much of Newman\u2019s Own\u2019s profits were donated.Mr. Forrester said those numbers surprised him, until he took another look at the label and realized that the banner did not stand out.\u201cA lot of people, particularly older generations, just understood this is what Newman\u2019s Own always did,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cIt was this younger consumer that, frankly, we were overlooking.\u201dThis did not surprise Jason Dorsey, a researcher at the Center for Generational Kinetics, a consulting group based in Austin, Tex., that specializes in millennial marketing. He thinks young buyers were having a hard time connecting with the Newman\u2019s Own story, partly because many of them are too young to be aware of the entertainer.\u201cThis is a perfect example of a great model that is not positioned well for the generation they\u2019re trying to influence,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in a telephone interview.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s research shows that millennials are more likely to come back to a product if they believe it has a social conscience. Brands have certainly noticed. Joel Babbit, founder and chief executive of the Narrative Content Group, which counts AT&T, Coca-Cola and Delta among its clients, said it was becoming more common for companies to highlight philanthropic works in their marketing strategy.Still, when Newman\u2019s Own called and said it needed a campaign to highlight its good will, he was a bit surprised.\u201cIt was surprising that millennials weren\u2019t aware of it to the degree they should be,\u201d Mr. Babbit said.The videos are not typical promotional ads, because they do not mention anything about Newman\u2019s Own products. Instead, they highlight its partnerships, such as those with organizations that provide guide dogs to blind veterans and a school for girls in Kenya.These partnerships are recognized throughout Newman\u2019s Own\u2019s new headquarters in Westport, Conn., a couple of miles down the road from where it resided for more than 30 years. The offices are bright and airy, filled with reclaimed wood and adorned with gifts from the charities it supports, such as a bubble gum statue of a puma made at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a free summer camp for children with serious illnesses (the gum was softened using hair dryers, not by chewing).Mr. Forrester said he was encouraged when millennial buyers used three words to describe what Newman\u2019s Own meant to them: trust, authenticity and consistency.When asked what his old friend might say about the company\u2019s new advertising initiative, Mr. Forrester guessed that Mr. Newman would react in the understated manner he normally used to convey his appreciation for a job well done: \u201cGood start. Let\u2019s go have a beer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019d be it,\u201d Mr. Forrester added. \u201cThat was Paul.\u201dAn article on Monday about a new marketing campaign for the Newman\u2019s Own brand rendered the wording on a new label incorrectly. It is \u201c100 Percent Profits to Charity,\u201d not \u201c100 Percent to Charity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Williams IV knew early on what he was going to do with his life: the same thing that Byrd, Byrd II and Byrd III did\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 take pictures. Byrd Williams IV\u00c2\u00a0is the last member\u00c2\u00a0of a Texas photography dynasty, one that spans 120 years and three centuries, as his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests went from snapshots and landscapes to studio work and art.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was my dad, granddad and great-granddad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any choice what I was going to do. Photography was what we did. We worked in the studio, we were all kind of amateur, professional and fine art guys. At the dinner table we talked about Edward Weston, not Mickey Mantle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe images mirror the use of photography in the larger society and the way it\u00c2\u00a0shifted from generation to generation. Byrd I, the family patriarch, started out in 1880 like many\u00c2\u00a0other people, by purchasing\u00c2\u00a0a small camera that he used for snapshots. The owner of a hardware store in Gainesville, he caught the bug and built a darkroom in his home, selling photo postcards in his store (as well as amassing the usual collection of family pictures).His son, Byrd II, became an engineer but worked his way through college as a portrait photographer. Later, he would use the skill in\u00c2\u00a0his job, as well as for capturing landscapes. (While working on a bridge in El Paso in 1915, he encountered, and photographed, Pancho Villa.)Byrd III took the leap and opened a commercial studio in Fort Worth, producing hundreds of images of both the ordinary and the celebrated. He also started to take pictures outside for himself, developing particular interests, his son said, in night scenes, dance and other themes.Byrd IV, who teaches photography at Collin College, north of Dallas, where he has a studio, became an artist, though all four generations shared that sentiment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of us thought we were fine-art guys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were no photo galleries at the time, but if you follow the work, it follows the zeitgeist of the time. My grandfather photographed landscapes like Carleton Watkins. Dad was a journalism student in the 1930s and was aware of Cartier-Bresson and Kertesz. All of us were aware of what was going on in the photo world.\u00e2\u0080\u009dByrd IV said the archive does reflect his own take on the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture, reflecting his own uneasiness\u00c2\u00a0as a liberal in a conservative state. One of his projects shows the infamous televangelists of the 1980s, as they lived upscale lives\u00c2\u00a0before they fell. Byrd IV had been hired by one of them to train staff\u00c2\u00a0members\u00c2\u00a0but was retained\u00c2\u00a0when they preferred his own images.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a large project my dad and I did on imprinting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow we teach our kids about violence as a solution in the South: playing with guns, cowboys and Indians, how the story of the Alamo promotes racism. We grew up thinking the Mexicans were the bad guys because of those John Wayne movies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOf course, the archive also tracks the lives of his relatives, often from cradle to grave. After a while, he said, it becomes more like a graveyard than a photo collection.He hopes to soon travel to Connecticut, where his brother, Timmy, was shot dead by police in 1967 after stealing a car (he had been a roadie with a band that stole cars on the side).\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to go to Connecticut to look at his death pictures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI took the last picture of him. I have a lot of the first picture and also the last picture when they die. People think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s macabre. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut that all will end with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a son, Byrd V, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not interested in photography,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of disappointing. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get choice, we were a poor working class family. When my sons came up I gave them a choice. They said they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anything to do with that business. I sort of wish they would have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "News Outlets Rethink Usage of the Term \u2018Alt-Right\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byMany of them had a similar message.\u201cPlease, please stop referring to a white Christian supremacist movement as the \u2018alt-right\u2019 \u2014 a phrase that sounds like a subgenre of rock music,\u201d one reader wrote.Another was more pointed: \u201cSTOP CALLING THEM \u2018ALT-RIGHT.\u2019 THEY ARE RACISTS, WHITE SUPREMICISTS, NAZIS.\u201dWith the election of Donald J. Trump \u2014 and his subsequent appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing website Breitbart News, as his chief White House strategist \u2014 the term alt-right has emerged as a linguistic flash point. Generally deployed by news organizations to describe a far-right, white nationalist movement known for its aggressive online expression, the term has attracted widespread criticism among those, particularly on the left, who say it euphemizes and legitimizes the ideologies of racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and white supremacy.It was the selection of Mr. Bannon, who has called Breitbart \u201cthe platform for the alt-right,\u201d that brought the term under fire. Now, prompted in part by the kind of condemnation evident in the comments on The Post article, news organizations are examining their use of the term.Last Wednesday, The Washington Post circulated style guidelines for several terms, including alt-right, which it defined in part as \u201ca small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state\u201d whose adherents are \u201cknown for espousing racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal has used the term, but a spokeswoman said in an email that it prefers to be \u201cmore precise about groups or individuals, reporting on their specific actions or statements.\u201dThe New York Times has had many conversations about the term but has not banned it, said Phil Corbett, The Times\u2019s standards editor. Reporters are encouraged to explain what the term means rather than use it as a label, he said.Defenders of the term argue that it is an appropriate characterization of a new group for which existing definitions do not capture the full range of ideologies and prejudices.\u201cIn the case of the alt-right, I think that the tendency has been to want to simply do away with the term and use the term \u2018white nationalist,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think that captures the stew of hate,\u201d said Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, who studies conservatism and the media. Existing terms, including white nationalism, do not reflect the group\u2019s distinct history, media tactics or myriad hostilities, including its \u201chard-core misogyny,\u201d she said.She said news organizations should routinely define the meaning of alt-right so that readers understand the specific viewpoints it encompasses. \u201cWe can\u2019t just use new words and new labels without describing what they are,\u201d she said. \u201cI think if news organizations are meticulous about defining their terms, then I think people will come to understand what the alt-right is.\u201dRich Lowry, the editor of National Review, a conservative magazine, said he was not opposed to using the term, either, if it was applied narrowly \u2014 that is, to describe \u201cpeople who are obsessed with race and, in one form or another, are white supremacists.\u201dBut he said it would be incorrect to use the label more broadly to describe others on the conservative spectrum, such as the populist and nationalist wing of the Republican Party. \u201cFrom where we sit, the alt-right is kind of a motley collection of white supremacists and neo-Nazis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to label people who aren\u2019t that the alt-right.\u201dNews organizations have often contended with the issue of terminology used to describe certain groups, viewpoints or ideologies, particularly when they carry political implications.\u201cJournalists and other people in political life are always arguing about the naming of things,\u201d said Roy Peter Clark, a senior scholar at the Poynter Institute.In the past, the terms \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life,\u201d to identify people who either support or oppose abortion rights, have both generated backlash, as have the terms \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d and \u201cundocumented worker\u201d to describe foreigners who are in the country without legal documentation.News organizations have also grappled with the word \u201ctorture\u201d to describe the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation techniques. For years, The Times avoided using the word to avoid taking sides in a legal and political fight.Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have increased the intensity of debates over language and broadened their audience. That could prompt news organizations to more quickly examine the words they use, said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab.\u201cJournalists who are on Twitter are seeing the negative reaction to a word choice, a headline choice, whatever it may be,\u201d he said, adding that he expected to see more rapid action from news organizations in response to such criticism.But while it is inevitable that certain terms, especially ones that may be politically charged, will provoke some level of debate, the solution, many journalists say, is to describe rather than label.Parsing a term heavy with connotations is \u201chard work\u201d said Cameron Barr, a managing editor at The Washington Post. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us to provide clear and dispassionate definitions of what these things mean.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We\u2019ve Learned About the Media Industry During This Election", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWhen the 2016 campaign began, legacy news organizations already faced dim industry projections. Slides in print revenue at newspapers and magazines were accelerating; online advertising, the escape plan for these businesses, teetered.Television executives, lamenting smaller audiences and less enthusiastic advertisers, had finally realized that the huge changes elsewhere in the media industry were coming for them, too.By now, we realize that these stories were only half-told. Established news media continue to face strong financial headwinds. But these organizations still exist and exerted clear power, too. Election-defining stories frequently arrived through familiar outlets, such as The Washington Post, which published the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video of Donald J. Trump.In media business terms, it is now clear, the 2016 election could not have arrived at a more precarious moment, as industries defined by their futures struggled to handle what was happening in the present. A new business model had not replaced an old one \u2014 not yet. There was, for the duration of the campaign, effectively no model at all.Through this lens, some of the defining narratives about the media and the election start to make a little more sense. Major news organizations, household names trusted for decades, lost a great deal of ownership over audiences. The organizations exist among many contributors in infinite feeds. Their news stories could be more easily brushed aside and ignored as a product of bias or motivated reporting. Once privileged with the leverage to shape narratives, or declare stories important, they now found themselves competing with rivals shaped by new incentives.The suspicions arrived in links above an article; by a video below it; by the friend or family member whose utterly unfamiliar media bubble bounced into yours. But it extended beyond that, too: by the delivery of your news in an entirely new way, complete with new and obliterating signifiers of authority and truth; by constant confirmation that, yes, the media really is just people saying things; and, finally, by opportunistic insinuations that the level of deception by news organizations knows no bounds.It is a mistake, of course, to minimize the role played by the social networks that helped create this situation, and the companies that benefit from it.But calls for Facebook to fix the problem \u2014 presumably through some sort of new editorial filtering, or prioritization \u2014 misunderstand the company and its situation. While asking Facebook to fix it is reasonable, it is probably equally unrealistic. In many ways, the company has already moved on to the future.The fake news problem, as it has been identified, is occurring on what the company, based on its public statements and actions, would consider an old version of the network, one it seems determined to abandon. In this version, people post links to outside websites, and those websites make money from advertising. This is the Facebook most users probably know best \u2014 but it is also increasingly on the margins.Facebook would rather keep people inside its walls, and the company has already taken major steps to achieve that. In March 2015, it teamed up with more traditional media companies, including The New York Times Company, to host articles directly on the platform, then opened up applications to all news sites. The feature, called Instant Articles, speeds up viewing for readers and makes sharing within the site easier.Mr. Zuckerberg has also made clear that he considers video to be central to the company\u2019s future. Video-based Facebook, which is beginning to take shape, will have to deal with similar issues, but it may also be structurally different. It may end up more organized, with an emphasis on official partnerships that more clearly select winners and losers. Maybe it is less newsy in general; maybe it duplicates, in some ways, television news.Of course, this future version of Facebook has not fully arrived, and its predecessor is not yet gone. But the site on which the false report of the pope\u2019s endorsement originated, WTOE 5 News \u2014 which describes itself openly as \u201ca fantasy news website\u201d \u2014 is not part of any social media platform\u2019s grand plans for the future. The proliferation of fake news links on Facebook, in other words, is probably a problem that will be forgotten before it is fixed \u2014 and that might have peaked just as Americans chose their next president.But it is likewise a mistake \u2014 a grave and common one \u2014 to underestimate just how liberating these last years have felt for audiences. Facebook and Twitter, the cycle\u2019s most mature and influential platforms, may be profoundly centralized. But they explicitly place the individual at the center of his or her media universe, recording, amplifying and perpetuating their preferences into complete, customized media experiences that no traditional news provider can rival.The beginning of this shift in power represented a chance to personally right wrongs, long felt and often credible, stemming from legacy media\u2019s presumptions of power and authority. Old media could be held to account for its cozy relationships, its disclosure failures, its hiring practices and its blinkered or slanted coverage \u2014 real or perceived. But it also, necessarily, represented a chance to punish ideological opponents, or to exact revenge. And it presented an opportunity, for those so motivated, to sow doubt about the entire project of journalism. .It will be clear, in retrospect, that this was an election experienced from the bottom of a media trough. Votes were cast from the valley between a collapsing media that was, at one time, at least nominally trusted, and a new media that is not yet ready for the responsibilities it is inheriting.It is a moment that is less a referendum on the media or the systems that are superseding it, or a sign of where either one might end up, than it is a snapshot of messy change in progress. For all the attempts to understand or explain this year\u2019s endless shocks and surprises, this story \u2014 one that connects so many others \u2014 will have been a product of unfortunate timing. Elections arrive every four years. Industry sets its own pace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other White People", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported bySince the election, the West Coast has been abuzz with talk of breaking away from Donald Trump\u2019s America \u2014 a Calexit, or a linking of the nation\u2019s most populous state with Oregon, Washington and British Columbia to form a Cascadia by the sea.It\u2019s a fantasy, of course, fueled by Trump\u2019s drubbing on the West Coast, where he got less than 10 percent of the vote in some cities. But it would also be a monumental mistake for the most prosperous and progressive part of the United States to even consider abandoning a country that could be dominated by the old Confederacy.A better idea is to reach out across a yawning class divide. People in the West could listen to their fellow Americans in the old industrial heartland. And people in struggling towns could learn something from the workable policies of the left coast. Difficult as that conversation may be, it could start with some white-on-white dialogue.In Portland, Ore., often called the whitest city in America, Trump pulled barely 17 percent of the vote in the county covering most of the metro area, and even less in the city proper. In Seattle, which is nearly 70 percent white, Trump is on track to get only 8 percent of the vote \u2014 a historic low for a major party nominee. Denver, which is 63 percent white, didn\u2019t even give Trump one in five votes. And in San Francisco, with a black population of 6 percent, Trump finished in single digits.This fortress of the forward-looking is not all white, certainly; California, after all, has no ethnic majority. But for the sake of preventing a certain clueless conventional wisdom from taking hold, let\u2019s consider the other white people.This West Coast majority cares about climate change, tech and trade. They care about where their food comes and want family-friendly policies that don\u2019t knock women out of their career trajectories. They aren\u2019t afraid of raising taxes to make their cities more livable \u2014 in fact, they just raised taxes to build new infrastructure. They don\u2019t think lunatics should be able to buy assault rifles. And their issues were completely forgotten in the presidential campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re a nation state,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s lieutenant governor, after the election. \u201cIn so many ways we are America. But we\u2019re just ahead of the curve.\u201dCalifornia, which went Democratic by a nearly two-to-one margin and is one big reason Hillary Clinton will win the popular tally by well over a million votes, feels particularly left out. People in the state are beating drums to the spectral rhythms of the old Bear Flag Revolt, which briefly produced an independent California Republic in 1846.Instead, California should leverage its political clout \u2014 with almost one-in-eight members of the House hailing from the Golden State \u2014 to stop Trump\u2019s backward ideas.The biggest lesson from the West Coast is about job and wage growth. Trump wants to return to the 19th century of dirty energy. But coal\u2019s biggest enemy is cheap natural gas, not environmental regulation. No sane company wants to build a new coal-fired electrical plant.In September, 42 percent of all new jobs created in the country were in California. At the same time, Oregon posted a job creation rate that was double the national average. And earlier this year, Washington State was ranked No. 1 for combined job and wage growth.Yes, wage growth. The West Coast has consistently voted to make minimum wage a livable wage \u2014 something opposed by Republicans in the capital. But even better jobs are there for the making in infrastructure.Trump claims he\u2019ll put people to work building roads, bridges and airports, while lowering taxes on the rich. He can no more make Flint tap water into Trump wine. But there is a simple solution, adopted on Election Day throughout the West Coast: targeted tax increases. Voters approved of them because the money will be dedicated to new infrastructure \u2014 expanded and ambitious light rail systems in Seattle and Los Angeles, for example. No burger flipping there.It was absurd and unpatriotic when Texans talked of secession rather than be led by Barack Obama. Apparently, they couldn\u2019t handle all the job growth that came with his historic presidency. It\u2019s equally absurd for Californians to talk of taking their Macs and walking out after Trump\u2019s barbarians move into the White House. The United States, without the innovative West Coast, would be a yesterday country.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scary Dogs! Rigged Machines! Votes From the Grave! This Election, Paranoia Reigns", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byThere was the myth of Trump supporters sending wild dogs to scare off black voters in Ohio. In Texas, some of the voting booths supposedly became possessed, switching ballots cast for Donald J. Trump to Hillary Clinton. And then there was the amateur genealogist said to be committing voter fraud by jotting down names found on gravestones.\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely more paranoia this year,\u201d said Pamela Smith, the president of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that promotes the integrity of elections. \u201cThere has been a lot of talk about election rigging. If you think an election is going to be rigged, then you look at everything through that filter.\u201dMany of the rumors of rigged votes have taken on a life of their own on social media, where conspiracy theories flourish and accusations fly. The reports have left election officials and the local authorities scrambling to verify claims of mischief and, often, to offer reality checks.One of the most fiercely contested battlegrounds, Ohio, has been a hotbed of suspicion. Over the weekend, a political activist with more than 30,000 Twitter followers wrote a post saying that Trump supporters with dogs were threatening black voters who went to the polls early in Cincinnati. The post sent his followers into a frenzy, but local officials said the man, Jim Wallis, was making a false claim. The message was later deleted.A man who said that he was the one later detained at the cemetery, Frank Flack, posted a reply that assailed Ms. Edwards for being irresponsible. He said he had been photographing grave markers for a \u201cfind a grave\u201d memorial project.\u201cSorry to dispel your conspiracy theory on voter fraud,\u201d Mr. Flack wrote. \u201cIf you would have stopped and talked to me, I could have let you know that I am a registered Republican!\u201dVoter registration problems in North Carolina and other states have led to confusion and long lines. With talk of rigging so pervasive, anything out of the ordinary can be taken as potentially untoward. When faulty machines would not accept ballots in Boone, N.C., Allison Critcher was asked by a poll worker to slip her ballot through a little metal slot on the ballot box. She felt that something might be fishy.\u201cThey did not, however, explain what they were going to do with our ballots, which made me a little wary,\u201d said Ms. Critcher, who voted in late October.Not all of the early-voting problems reported this year are figments of imagination. Kristen Clarke, the executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that her organization\u2019s national hotline for reporting problems at the polls had received about 50,000 calls this year, and that there had been more complaints about voter intimidation than in 2012.\u201cWe have observed a more fevered pitch in the kinds of calls that we received from voters,\u201d Ms. Clarke said. \u201cMost certainly this is an election cycle fueled by toxic rhetoric and one in which anxiety levels are higher.\u201dThe local authorities have been taking action against people who may have committed voter fraud, and civil rights groups are pushing back against what they say are acts of disenfranchisement.On Monday, the North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. filed a federal lawsuit to try to stop state and local election boards from canceling the registrations of thousands of black voters.Voters appear to be more suspicious of one another this year, said Wendy Weiser, the director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. But Ms. Weiser said she did not expect voter fraud to be more prevalent than in other general elections. In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s loud assertion that the election is rigged may have the effect of making irregularities even rarer.\u201cOne of the silver linings is that people are even more prepared,\u201d Ms. Weiser said. \u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly more attention being paid to what\u2019s going on in polling places.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Trump appears content to keep the integrity of the voting process in doubt. At a rally in Colorado on Sunday, Mr. Trump suggested that people were probably voting multiple times across the country and that their votes were probably not being counted properly.\u201cI know they\u2019re all saying, \u2018Of course, everything is so legitimate,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a more skeptical person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Thin Gene", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byAbby Solomon suffers from a one-in-a-billion genetic syndrome: After just about an hour without food, she begins to starve. She sleeps in snatches. In her dreams she gorges on French fries. But as soon as she wakes up and nibbles a few bites, she feels full, so she ends up consuming very few calories. At 5 feet 10 inches tall, she weighs 99 pounds.Now 21 years old, she is one of the few people in the world to survive into adulthood with neonatal progeroid syndrome, a condition that results from damage to the FBN1 gene. This mutation mangles noses and eyes and destroys the layer of fat under the skin so that even teenagers look middle-aged. It also interferes with the body\u2019s ability to make a hormone called asprosin, which regulates blood sugar. Atul Chopra, a medical geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine, told me that people with the disorder don\u2019t experience ordinary hunger \u2014 instead they waver on the edge of hypoglycemia and must constantly snack to keep from passing out.And yet when I asked Ms. Solomon if she wished she could magically repair her damaged gene, she answered without hesitation: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it for anything.\u201dThis is because her painful body may hold the clues to a lifesaving treatment for millions of people with obesity and diabetes.Dr. Chopra told me that, as far as medical science is concerned, Abby Solomon is worth thousands of the rest of us. By observing her, scientists can see how a hormone deficiency affects a living person, from her thoughts to her liver function. Several years ago, she spent a day inside a metabolic chamber in a lab so that Dr. Chopra could measure everything she breathed and ate. The results showed that Ms. Solomon takes in about half the calories of a typical woman her age, and also expends half as much energy.\u201cNothing comes close to starting with people who are naturally different,\u201d he said. This is why he searches out patients at the extreme ends of the spectrum \u2014 those who are wired to weigh 80 pounds or 380 pounds. He said, \u201cWe have the opportunity to help a bigger swath of humanity when we learn from these outliers.\u201dIn 2013, after hearing about Ms. Solomon\u2019s unusual condition from another patient, he asked her to visit his clinic. Ms. Solomon warned him that she would be able to carry on a conversation for only 15 minutes before she needed to snack on chips or a cookie. That remark inspired a revelation. Dr. Chopra realized that \u201cshe had to eat small, sugary meals all day to stay alive, because her body was constantly running out of glucose,\u201d he said.The clue led Dr. Chopra and his colleagues to their discovery of the blood-sugar-regulating hormone, which they named asprosin. Ms. Solomon\u2019s natural asprosin deficiency keeps her on the brink of starvation, but Dr. Chopra\u2019s hope is that an artificial compound that blocks asprosin could be used as a treatment for obesity. He and his team have already tested such a compound on mice, and found that it can reverse insulin resistance and weight gain.Of course, for decades, scientists have attempted to develop a drug that could flip the appetite switch \u2014 and they\u2019ve always come up short. Still, Dr. Chopra believes asprosin is an unusually promising hormone for drug development \u201cbecause we have a living, breathing human who has the natural depletion of this hormone in her blood.\u201d Since Ms. Solomon is essentially immune to obesity and diabetes, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the compound would affect other people in the same way.If you\u2019ve already heard of neonatal progeroid syndrome, it\u2019s probably because of Lizzie Velasquez. Aside from Ms. Solomon, she may be the only American to suffer from the disorder. Ms. Velasquez, 27, weighs less than 70 pounds and is blind in one eye. She has endured vicious ridicule and bullying since childhood. But after internet trolls called her the \u201cworld\u2019s ugliest woman,\u201d she decided to flip the script and delivered a heart-wrenching TED Talk about inner beauty that reached millions of viewers.Ms. Solomon\u2019s genetic mutation is slightly different from Ms. Velasquez\u2019s, and the damage to her face and body weight is much less severe. Although strangers treat her rudely because they assume she has an eating disorder, she can melt into a crowd without being noticed. More than stigma, she has been worn down by surgeries.In 2013, she enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Texas with dreams of becoming a biologist and medical researcher. But because she suffered from headaches, exhaustion and deteriorating vision, she had to move back home, where her parents and five siblings could look after her. \u201cThis has been the most difficult year of my life,\u201d she wrote to her Facebook friends in August. Doctors rebuilt her nasal passages, which had been blocked by bone spurs; then they replaced the lens in one of her eyes to prevent blindness. A photo she posted on Facebook shows her in a hospital bed with her hair tucked under a blue surgical cap; she\u2019s giving a thumbs up. The caption reads, \u201cMy second home.\u201dThe bright spot in Ms. Solomon\u2019s difficult year came in April, when Dr. Chopra and his team announced her role in the discovery of asprosin. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to wrap my head around how damn cool that is,\u201d she said. Indeed, Ms. Solomon has made it her life\u2019s work to collaborate with the medical researchers who poke and prod her; for years, she has given them small parts of herself \u2014 blood and saliva and even her own breath. She\u2019s glad to do it. She points out that she herself has benefited from tricky surgeries that have saved her eyesight \u2014 procedures that exist because earlier patients suffered them. \u201cThat\u2019s why I volunteer for every research study,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if I\u2019m really nervous about it.\u201dThis fall, I had a chance to spend time with Ms. Solomon when she traveled up from Austin, Tex., to help her younger sister move into an apartment near Boston University. One Sunday I met three of the Solomons \u2014 Ms. Solomon, her sister and their mom \u2014 for brunch.Ms. Solomon turned out to be a poised woman in wire-rimmed glasses with chestnut-colored curls gathered into a ponytail. Her skin is beautifully clear and translucent, but also prematurely wrinkled into deep folds around her mouth, because she lacks collagen and bone. She told me that even when she was 15 years old, waiters would mistake her for a grown woman and offer her the wine menu.She had spent the day before in her sister\u2019s dorm room, unpacking boxes. This must have been bittersweet \u2014 she herself had recently dropped out of college because of her vision problems and grueling surgical schedule.Still, she and her mother were making the best of the situation \u2014 they had decided to drive the scenic route home, stopping off at a vineyard in Virginia. Ms. Solomon may not experience hunger in the usual way, but she loves to sample flavors and foods. Now, in the restaurant, she wandered around the buffet tables happily sizing up the temptations.Chefs were doling out eggs Benedict and waffles, sending up clouds of buttery steam. We all piled our plates high. I ate like a typical American woman: I swore that I would sample just a few of the home fries on my plate, but then discovered to my dismay that I had inhaled all of them. Though I\u2019m not overweight, my appetite often fills me with shame. I remain convinced that if I \u201clet myself go,\u201d I will balloon up \u2014 that it is only this struggle, this self-hatred, that keeps my body in check.Ms. Solomon, on the other hand, took a few bites of her cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast and then sighed and said she was full.Soon, the conversation shifted from her unusual appetite to her struggles with anxiety. \u201cSometimes in a place like this,\u201d she said, gesturing at the diners in the restaurant around us, \u201cI feel like everyone\u2019s staring at me.\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019re not,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI mean, check it out.\u201d Indeed, people were swarming around the cheese table and elbowing their way into lines. No one paid the least bit of attention to Ms. Solomon and her gaunt frame.After all, Americans regard weight as a moral issue. Despite plentiful evidence to the contrary, we assume that people\u2019s minds can control their metabolism \u2014 and that they merely need to make a decision to gain or lose weight. But studies demonstrate that this is simply not true. For instance, the contestants on the \u201cBiggest Loser\u201d TV show became paragons of self-control; some shed more than 100 pounds, something very few of us could ever achieve. And yet a recent study showed that even these incredibly disciplined dieters gained all the weight back. In the long run, our hormones win.Dr. Chopra cited research that suggests that a vast majority of dieters will fail to reach or maintain their goal. \u201cThat means there\u2019s no point in talking about willpower,\u201d he said. Our ancestors survived because they were hungry, and that\u2019s why many parts of our bodies, from fat cells to our brain cells, have been designed to send up alarms when we cut calories. So how to short-circuit the mechanism? Scientists know surprisingly little about that. Even after decades of research, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any single drug that\u2019s effective against obesity,\u201d Dr. Chopra said.Until recently, many scientists thought of fat cells as inert \u2014 like butter stored in the refrigerator. But in the last decade, that idea has undergone a radical revision. Researchers have discovered dozens of hormones produced by fat cells \u2014 indicating that these cells send out powerful signals that tweak our attention, feelings, cravings and habits. For instance, our fat cells use asprosin to communicate with the liver and brain, drive the production of glucose and influence our eating behavior.\u201cOne of the questions I often get is this: How are we still discovering hormones?\u201d Dr. Chopra said. \u201cHow is that possible? My answer is that we\u2019re just at the tip of the iceberg. Asprosin is not the last hormone left to discover. In the next few decades, we\u2019re going to find many, many others.\u201dTo do that, we will depend in large part on the generosity of people like Ms. Solomon, whose bodies hold the clues to human hunger. We should exalt the outliers among us. But all too often we treat them shabbily. When she was 17 years old, Ms. Velasquez found a YouTube video of herself plastered with poisonous comments like \u201cKill it with fire!!!\u201d and \u201cJust put a gun to your head.\u201d We are way too cruel to those with genetic differences.Ms. Solomon told me that she has struggled with crushing depression \u2014 in part because her deteriorating eyesight made it impossible to keep up with college classes or live independently. But this fall, she underwent a wildly successful series of eye surgeries and is relishing her newfound freedom: \u201cI got a car yesterday and I\u2019m starting to drive again. It\u2019s all happening,\u201d she reported.Recently, she urged her Twitter friends to \u201cgo outside and look at the moon. The clouds floating by are insanely beautiful. I can actually see it and I\u2019m utterly mesmerized.\u201d Unlike the rest of us, she is taking nothing for granted.Advertisement"}

And since its debut in August, it has emerged as a digital safe space for the far right, where white nationalists, conspiracy-theorist YouTubers, and minivan majority moms can gather without liberal interference.This election laid bare the ideological divide on social media, and since the election, the rift has deepened. Just as dejected Hillary Clinton supporters have come together in Pantsuit Nation \u2014 a \u201csecret\u201d Facebook group of nearly four million members \u2014 some on the right have found their postelection online oasis in the invitation-only Gab.Right-wing rhetoric pervades the site, even the lifestyle and sports categories. With more than 28,000 followers, Mr. Yiannopoulos is one of the site\u2019s biggest stars, though he rarely posts anything. On election night, Mr. Torba excitedly live-Gabbed Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, then wrote, \u201cGab is going to be absolutely massive under President Trump.\u201dBehind the rah-rah free speech attitude, dissenting opinions on Gab are quashed in their own way. Overtly racist accounts were created by enemies to make Gab look bad, Mr. Torba said in a post. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe have fake shill profiles attempting to play into the media narrative.\u201dBut some have worried that the site\u2019s insulation can dampen their message. \u201cNow that Twitter is purging everyone, I think it\u2019s important for Gab to branch out and attract leftists so we\u2019re not just preaching to the choir,\u201d wrote Paul Joseph Watson, editor at large at Infowars.When I asked why the site leans conservative, Mr. Sanduja denied that Gab had any ideological bent. \u201cWe challenge this premise completely \u2014 to the contrary, Gab has a number of diverse users globally,\u201d he wrote. (There is a politely argumentative Democrat who goes by the handle @Democrat, for instance.) But he added that right-wing users would be naturally drawn to Gab. \u201cWhen a group of people are being systematically dehumanized and labeled as the alphabet soup of phobias,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey will look for a place that will allow them to speak freely without censorship and devoid of Social Justice bullying.\u201dBut that\u2019s the trick, isn\u2019t it? You can\u2019t sell a social destination where conservatives are free from liberal pestering and expect the pitch to resonate across the spectrum. Even the idea that harassment rules are oppressive \u2014 instead of protective of the vulnerable \u2014 is itself a pointed worldview. I suspect that any concern about inclusion will be assuaged by the comfort of chatting with people who think and talk the same way. It\u2019s the next logical step after all the blocking and muting on Twitter and filtering and unfollowing on Facebook split America into two social media realities. Where there once was a bubble, now there\u2019s a wall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Tool Aims to Parse the Value of Online Ad Viewing", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe idea is it\u2019s a single metric that\u2019s universally comparable across platforms, whether you\u2019re looking at a video site or a social site,\u201d said Jonah Goodhart, Moat\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s no value to having an ad on a screen for a short period of time. We\u2019re just saying, Let\u2019s put that on a continuum and decide what that\u2019s worth.\u201dUnder the new Moat system, if a person watched and listened to all of a 15-second ad while streaming a TV show in full-screen mode, that would receive a score of 100. If the person watched that same ad with the sound off, it would score a 50. But if a six-second video ad played on say, Snapchat, but the sound was off and the viewer flicked away after three seconds, it would receive a 25.\u201cGiven all the press around Facebook recently, I think a lot of people are asking what the measurement is going to be on Snapchat, given their strategy and currency, and what they\u2019ll do in this whole space, and I think this is the answer to that,\u201d Mr. Goodhart said. He said Moat conducted research with Nielsen that showed screen real estate and audio and visibility duration have a positive correlation with people remembering an ad after they\u2019ve watched it.It is an ambitious goal to create a system that can compare video ads regardless of whether they appear in a feed on Facebook or Twitter or while streaming a TV show, and it may not work as Moat intends. The score could simply favor certain platforms over others or encourage those with lower scores to pursue actions not in the best interests of users, like autoplaying sound. It may also pressure platforms with lower scores to use other means to prove their ads lead to sales.Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said the metric is \u201ca huge step in the right direction,\u201d particularly for TV networks that \u201cbasically walked into a digital measurement gunfight empty-handed.\u201dHe described an example in which a 20-second car ad shows a brand in the first two seconds, a celebrity endorsement in the middle and the price at the end.

Scrambling to salvage his reputation, Mr. Neschling is now going on the warpath against his enemies, upending a rarefied classical music scene in Brazil, where art and politics have long been intertwined.\u201cI\u2019m being attacked by liars and thieves in a witch hunt of the lowest caliber,\u201d Mr. Neschling said in an interview, arguing that he is the victim of a smear campaign by self-acknowledged lawbreakers who are seeking leniency through plea deals. \u201cIt makes me sad that I have to undergo this humiliating situation at my age, after having done so much for this country.\u201dBy taking his fight to the court of public opinion, Mr. Neschling, who has not been charged with any crimes, is questioning whether Brazil\u2019s anticorruption crusades are entangling innocent people along with the truly guilty.In the case involving Mr. Neschling, two administrators of the Theatro Municipal, Jos\u00e9 Luiz Herencia and William Nacked, admitted embezzling about $3 million from the opera house controlled by S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s municipal government.After reaching plea deals, the two men claimed that Mr. Neschling illicitly profited from hiring international opera stars through agents who also represented Mr. Neschling to arrange conducting jobs abroad, placing the maestro in the cross hairs of investigators.His accusers also claimed that Mr. Neschling made illicit gains from arranging a project with La Fura dels Baus, a theatrical group from Barcelona, which never materialized.\u201cThe public prosecutors don\u2019t have the slightest idea about opera administration,\u201d said Mr. Neschling, contending that he was an easy target for such accusations because of envy over his success.Supporters of Mr. Neschling have rushed to his defense, pointing out that up until now he has never been accused of doing anything illegal in a career spanning five decades.\u201cMy personal knowledge makes it impossible to believe that his personal dealings have even a hint of illegality or dishonesty,\u201d said Yoram David, an Israeli conductor who has worked with Mr. Neschling. \u201cIf this man is collaborating with his own agents, this is perfectly normal in the music world.\u201dStill, by Mr. Neschling\u2019s own admission, his abrasive, hard-charging personality did him few favors before he was caught in the whirlwind of the Theatro Municipal scandal.\u201cVienna drives anyone crazy,\u201d he once told an interviewer, describing how he scraped by on a meager scholarship, enduring loneliness while taking refuge in psychoanalysis.He returned to Brazil, composing the soundtracks for prizewinning films, but still felt Europe\u2019s tug. He returned to conduct at the Op\u00e9ra de Bordeaux in France, the Teatro Nacional in Lisbon and the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, Italy. In 1996, he moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, taking on the task of reviving the state\u2019s moribund symphony orchestra.At the orchestra, some of the musicians called Mr. Neschling dictatorial. He chafed at the criticism, quarreling with a board that was overseeing a succession plan. He called Jos\u00e9 Serra, the S\u00e3o Paulo governor who is now Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, \u201ca spoiled boy,\u201d before the authorities fired him in 2009.\u201cLook, I deliver the goods,\u201d Mr. Neschling said. \u201cThen the Brazilian mediocrity that\u2019s never delivered says, \u2018Oh well, if that\u2019s the way he does it, I can do it, too.\u2019 But they can\u2019t.\u201dS\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s mayor, Fernando Haddad, gave Mr. Neschling another chance by naming him the Theatro Municipal\u2019s artistic director in 2013 with an annual salary of more than $500,000. Mr. Neschling set about improving the theater, which was designed by the architect Ramos de Azevedo and completed in 1911, mixing Renaissance, baroque and Art Nouveau styles.\u201cNeschling took over with his customary arrogance, embracing an outdated concept of the opera from the previous century,\u201d Mr. Calil said. \u201cNow he wants to cast himself as the victim of politicians, of traitors, of those who are mediocre, of the country.\u201dMr. Neschling is stewing as he contends with such views, contemplating how to react to the tumultuous bookend of what had been an illustrious career.\u201cTwo types of animals inhabit my soul,\u201d Mr. Neschling recently wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cIn one corner, sheep are grazing and doves are fluttering. In the other, wild dogs are growling, yearning to mangle anything that gets in their way.\u201d\u201cI confess,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat I don\u2019t know what to do with the little sheep and white doves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh, an Update From the Bo Schembechler Line", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 While not quite as famous as Babe Ruth\u2019s called shot or Joe Namath\u2019s pledge to win the Super Bowl, the promise Jim Harbaugh, the University of Michigan football coach, made 30 years ago is remembered even more fondly around these parts.As nearly every Michigan fan knows, Harbaugh followed through on his brash promise, leading the Wolverines to a 26-24 victory and a Rose Bowl berth. So at a tailgate party outside Michigan Stadium this month, one fan, Annette Wozniak, had little trouble recalling the moment she had become enamored with Harbaugh, who is now in his second year as Michigan\u2019s head coach.\u201cWhen he guaranteed the win,\u201d Wozniak said. What won her over then, as now, she said, was Harbaugh\u2019s \u201cunending dedication to winning.\u201dWhat many may not know, though, is that Harbaugh\u2019s guarantee at the time displeased Michigan\u2019s legendary coach, Bo Schembechler \u2014 who, according to Lloyd Carr, then an assistant coach, did not like to give opposing teams extra motivation.\u201cBo was not happy,\u201d said Carr, who later became a Michigan head coach.This week, Michigan plays the same opponent in a similarly emotional moment \u2014 and one with perhaps even higher stakes. The No. 3 Wolverines will face the No. 2 Buckeyes on Saturday afternoon in Columbus, Ohio, with the chance to go on to win the Big Ten championship, cementing a place in the season-ending College Football Playoff.Harbaugh, who returned to Michigan after four years at Stanford and four more in the N.F.L. with the San Francisco 49ers, is undeniably Schembechler\u2019s successor: the son of a longtime Schembechler assistant and the old coach\u2019s former quarterback. Yet Harbaugh also represents a decided swerve from the gruff, Cold War-era personality of Schembechler, who revived Michigan after taking over in 1969 and reigned over his program with storied benevolence for 21 years.John Arbeznik, who played center for Schembechler, said Harbaugh was quite the contrast: \u201cHe takes his shirt off,\u201d Arbeznik said, recalling a notorious moment from a summer camp. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of goofy.\u201d\u201cYou put someone like Jim Harbaugh,\u201d said Glenn Schembechler III, Bo\u2019s son, who is known as Shemy, \u201cwho absolutely comes from that legacy \u2014 not only from Michigan, but also my dad \u2014 with his success he\u2019s had already, and what you\u2019ve done is created a nuclear phenomenon that brings all those sources together.\u201dThis abstract connection is made concrete in something called the Har-Bug. Wozniak, 40, has an old Volkswagen Beetle that her family long ago painted in Michigan maize and blue, with Wolverines knickknacks and slogans adorning its bulbous body. Its name changes to honor each Michigan head coach: from the Bo-Mobile to the Mo-Mobile, to Lloyd\u2019s Carr and the Hokes-Wagen, for Brady Hoke, a former Carr assistant who ascended to the top job in 2011.The meaning of the Har-Bug name is clear: Harbaugh is the latest model of a storied ideal. It is a point Harbaugh himself made at that first news conference, when he said, \u201cI\u2019m standing on a foundation that has been built for over 100 years by some great men.\u201d\u201cPeople truly still consider him a disciple of Bo, even if he\u2019s kind of a weird dude,\u201d said Tom Sheppard, 29, a Michigander who has rooted for the Wolverines his whole life.Many fans and close observers attributed the differences between Schembechler and Harbaugh less to the men themselves and more to the times in which they operated.\u201cIt\u2019s smart,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a new millennium, and you\u2019ve got to reach the kids in a certain way in the 21st century. He gets it.\u201dDecades ago, great football coaches like Schembechler, Hayes and Alabama\u2019s Bear Bryant were expected to be distant men of vague but great authority. Today, they are more likely to be (slightly) more vulnerable, detail-oriented workaholics like Harbaugh, Urban Meyer of Ohio State and Nick Saban of Alabama.\u201cThe difference between him and Jim,\u201d Carr said, referring to Schembechler\u2019s famed distaste for talking to reporters, \u201cwas, in those days, the media, in relation to what it is today, is night and day.\u201dWhat could be the most consequential difference between Schembechler and Harbaugh has yet to be determined. Michigan was Schembechler\u2019s final stop as a coach, and he stayed more than two decades. Harbaugh\u2019s conspicuously peripatetic career \u2014 three seasons at the University of San Diego, four at Stanford, four in San Francisco and now two at Michigan \u2014 has bred fears that despite a $9 million salary, the highest in college football and comparable to N.F.L. pay, he will soon leave Ann Arbor again.Those who stay may be champions. But will champions stay?\u201cPeople think he\u2019ll stay around,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cOr at least hope so.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf Harbaugh came in and traded one national championship for three years of service, I think people would take it.\u201dThat could begin Saturday. If Michigan (10-1), an underdog, prevails, it will head to the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis, where a win would almost certainly send it to next month\u2019s playoff semifinals. But an Ohio State (10-1) victory would devastate Michigan\u2019s chances, since it would most likely prevent either team from becoming Big Ten champion.With that in mind, it is worth recalling Schembechler\u2019s eventual response to Harbaugh\u2019s guarantee of 30 years ago.In the next day\u2019s team meeting, according to Carr, a fuming Schembechler gathered his players around him and growled: \u201cHarbaugh\u2019s shot his mouth off. Guaranteed a win.\u201cNow we\u2019ve got to back him up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You know that everyone has left you alone to face your doom and have offered you no help.\u201dHisham al-Skeif, a member of a council of rebels and civilians in eastern Aleppo, said by telephone on Tuesday that warplanes had hovered closely over the area, steadily dropping barrel bombs, as a delegation of civic activists explored the idea of using so-called safe routes to leave the city, though many were not confident they could escape with their lives.\u201cFor the civilians, they have the choice whether they want to leave or stay, but for those of us who don\u2019t trust the regime, we have no choice,\u201d he said through tears, adding that he did not want to leave his home. \u201cI can\u2019t turn my back on my city.\u201dRami Jarrah, a Syrian anti-government activist and citizen journalist who is based in Turkey but regularly travels to rebel-held Aleppo, said via Facebook that he did not believe that there was such a thing as safe passage.Five years into the civil war, he said, many of those remaining in eastern Aleppo are on the Assad government\u2019s \u201cblack list,\u201d having participated in protests or openly defied it.\u201cAll have lost loved ones or have family members who are fighting to protect the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Syrian regime does not tolerate any form of opposition to its narrative, and this means that leaving eastern Aleppo through \u2018safe\u2019 passageways that have been set up by Assad\u2019s forces is not an option for the vast majority of the population.\u201dHe added: \u201cSyrians would prefer to live under chaotic bombardment than be apprehended by the Syrian regime and tortured to death. Five years of people staying put even when leaving was the easiest option is sheer proof of this.\u201dAround 10,000 civilians have escaped from the city\u2019s rebel-held east into government-controlled western Aleppo, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations emergency relief coordination office, told reporters in Geneva. An additional 4,000 to 6,000 have managed to flee to the Kurdish-controlled Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood on the northern edge of the city, he said.Russian and Syrian television channels showed people who had crossed into government territory cheering and thanking the government and complaining of bad treatment by rebels inside.In the rebel-held neighborhood of Bustan al-Qasr, where bombs rained down, Dr. Salem Abdulnasser said the medical center where he worked had notified the staff that it would close on Thursday because it was too dangerous to keep operating.Russia said it would be sending mobile hospitals to Aleppo to assist in the crisis. Russian officials also said that 80,000 people lived in the districts retaken by the Syrian government and that they were receiving humanitarian aid; but there was no footage immediately available of such operations inside the areas until Monday held by rebels.Bassem Ayoub, an activist in eastern Aleppo, said that even those sympathetic to the rebels were on the brink of despair. \u201cI\u2019m ready to agree to the regime\u2019s terms \u2014 whatever they are \u2014 for the sake of stopping the killing,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying by the hundreds. Everybody is ready to leave. Stop the killing.\u201dThe United Nations appealed repeatedly for access to deliver food and medical aid to eastern Aleppo and to evacuate the wounded. Jan Egeland, the United Nations special adviser on humanitarian affairs, said last week that Russian officials had agreed verbally, and armed opposition groups in writing, to a four-point plan submitted this month, but the agency\u2019s plan had not received backing from Damascus and no further action had followed.United Nations officials also said that indiscriminate shelling of western Aleppo had continued killing and injuring civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, and had forced about 20,000 people from their homes.The World Food Program said it was able to supply bread and other rations to community kitchens in western Aleppo, but residents in the eastern parts of the city have had no food distribution for two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s really dire,\u201d said Bettina Luescher, a spokeswoman for the agency, citing accounts of residents sifting through garbage for something to eat. \u201dIt\u2019s a slow-motion descent into hell,\u201d she said.At the same time, about 700,000 people are trapped in besieged areas in other parts of the country, Mr. O\u2019Brien said. As in eastern Aleppo, \u201cpeople in these besieged areas are trapped, terrified and running out of time,\u201d he said.Hwaida Saad reported from Beirut, and Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva.

{"Headline": "Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s Education Pick, Has Steered Money From Public Schools", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIt is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nation\u2019s education system.But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls \u201cfailing government schools.\u201dConservative school choice activists hailed her on Wednesday as a fellow disrupter, and as someone who would block what they see as federal intrusion on local schools.Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where Ms. DeVos helped push legislation establishing tax credits for scholarships to private schools, called her an \u201coutstanding pick,\u201d a \u201cpassionate change agent to press for a new education vision.\u201dFrederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a \u201csmart, principled small-government conservative who\u2019s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy.\u201dBut to teachers\u2019 unions, she is anathema.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos \u201cthe most ideological, anti-public education nominee\u201d since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago.Even some groups that share her support for charter schools worried that picking someone so closely identified as a champion of vouchers signaled that the Trump administration would try to starve public schools.As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed steering $20 billion in existing federal money toward vouchers that families could use to help pay for private or parochial schools, perhaps tapping into $15 billion in so-called Title I money that goes to schools that serve the country\u2019s poorest children. He called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issues of our time.\u201dMichigan is one of the nation\u2019s biggest school choice laboratories, especially with charter schools. The Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids school districts have among the nation\u2019s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by for-profit organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation.But if Michigan is a center of school choice, it is also among the worst places to argue that choice has made schools better. As the state embraced and then expanded charters over the past two decades, its rank has fallen on national reading and math tests. Most charter schools perform below the state average.And a federal review in 2015 found \u201can unreasonably high\u201d percentage of charter schools on the list of the state\u2019s lowest-performing schools. The number of charter schools on that list had doubled since 2010, after the passage of a law a group financed by Ms. DeVos pushed to expand the schools. The group blocked a provision in that law that would have prevented failing schools from expanding or replicating.Ms. DeVos, 58, got into education advocacy primarily as a backer of vouchers, and has served on the board of several organizations that have campaigned for them across the country.A ballot initiative she led to establish vouchers in Michigan failed in 2000. The next year, she established the Great Lakes Education Project, which became an ardent proponent of charter school expansion, and has donated generously to candidates who have supported it.The Michigan law pushed by Ms. DeVos to establish charter schools 20 years ago allows an unusually large number of organizations to start such schools, yet established little mechanism for oversight. Even Republican supporters of charter schools say the law has allowed failing charter schools to expand or replicate.Like many conservatives who supported Mr. Trump, she does not support Common Core, the set of standards for what students should know at each grade level that was developed by the National Governors Association and other groups \u2014 and that has been incorrectly branded as a federal policy.She also had not supported Mr. Trump; her family was behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican presidential primary.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Olympics History Rewritten: New Doping Tests Topple the Podium", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byAfter disclosures of an extensive, state-run doping program in Russia, sports officials have been retesting urine samples from the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, in Beijing and London. Their findings have resulted in a top-to-bottom rewriting of Olympics history.More than 75 athletes from those two Olympics have been found, upon further scrutiny, to be guilty of doping violations. A majority are from Russia and other Eastern European countries. At least 40 of them won medals. Disciplinary proceedings are continuing against other athletes, and the numbers are expected to climb.Anyone looking at the record books for the Beijing and London Games might think them an illusion. Medals are being stripped from dozens of athletes and redistributed to those who were deprived a spot on the podium.\u201cThe numbers are just impossible, incredible,\u201d said Gian-Franco Kasper, an executive board member of the International Olympic Committee. \u201cWe lose credibility. Credibility is a major concern.\u201dThe Olympic committee announced penalties for 16 athletes last week and another 12 on Monday. Suddenly \u2014 and unceremoniously \u2014 some undecorated Olympians are inheriting medals for their performances eight years ago. Even some sixth-place finishers are discovering that they are bronze medalists.Sitting at home last week, Ms. Lowe received a curious Facebook message from a German athlete against whom she competed in 2008: \u201cCongratulations, bronze medalist,\u201d it read.After three women who finished ahead of Ms. Lowe were disqualified for doping \u2014 Anna Chicherova and Yelena Slesarenko of Russia, and Vita Palamar of Ukraine \u2014 she moved up to third place, newly successful in a jump she took when her 9-year-old daughter was an infant.\u201cI kept doing the math,\u201d said Ms. Lowe, who originally finished sixth. \u201cWait: 6, 5, 4. \u2026 Oh my gosh \u2014 they\u2019re right. I started crying.\u201dAccompanying the joy of her belated recognition, she said, was an awareness of the opportunity costs she suffered. In 2008, her husband was laid off. The couple\u2019s house in Georgia was foreclosed on that year, something Ms. Lowe said would not have happened had she distinguished herself in Beijing.\u201cI was really young and promising at that point, and sponsors were interested in me,\u201d said Ms. Lowe, now 32. \u201cA lot of interest goes away when you don\u2019t get on that podium.\u201dEdwin Moses, the American Olympic hurdler and chairman of the board of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said it was difficult to measure the \u201cagony of winning and losing, of having medals ripped away.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how you recover those damages,\u201d he said.The Olympic committee generally coordinates with the federations that govern each sport, along with the national Olympic committees of the affected countries, to collect medals from penalized athletes and redistribute them. Of the athletes so far implicated in the retests, a vast majority competed in track and field events and weight lifting.Dr. Olivier Rabin of the World Anti-Doping Agency, who has been collaborating with the Olympic committee on the retests, confirmed that officials had been informed by disclosures regarding specific drugs Russian athletes used.\u201cClearly when you look at the findings, they correlate with the intelligence about Russia,\u201d Dr. Rabin said.When an Olympic medalist is caught doping, any medals he or she has won are usually ordered returned, to be awarded to the next finisher in line.\u201cThe good old-fashioned drugs work very well for strength,\u201d Dr. Rabin said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they\u2019re still around.\u201dThe drugs were not detected by the Olympic committee\u2019s drug-testing lab years ago, during the Games, because the science at the time was not sensitive enough to detect such small residual concentrations, according to Dr. Richard Budgett, medical and scientific director of the I.O.C.New testing methods have increased the period of time during which long-familiar drugs can be detected in the body.\u201cScience progresses every day,\u201d Dr. Rabin said. \u201cJust over the past probably five years, the sensitivity of the equipment progressed by a factor of about 100. You see what was impossible to see before.\"Rarely are doping violations found during the Games. At the London Games, the Olympic lab found only eight possible violations, a fraction of the dozens more exposed this year.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to say,\u201d Ms. Lowe said, \u201cbut a lot of times when you go to these competitions, you\u2019re like: Just get close enough to top three because you never know who\u2019s going to test positive.\u201dAs the I.O.C.\u2019s retests continue, the standings of the past Winter Games may be upended, too. Officials have focused on samples from past Summer Games this year, seeking to ensure they caught possible cheaters who were eligible to compete in Rio de Janeiro in August.Ahead of the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the I.O.C. is expected to turn its attention to samples from the 2010 Games in Vancouver. Officials have already scrutinized some 500 samples from the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, but the I.O.C. has not provided details on how many violations were discovered.\u201cThe I.O.C. cannot and will not issue further comments with regard to this process, nor will it answer questions, at this point in time,\u201d a spokeswoman wrote by email on Monday regarding the tests from the Turin Games.Such a sizable number of violations by one country\u2019s delegation at a single Olympics could prompt sports officials to consider penalties ahead of the next Games.\u201cTo say that justice is being served is very pretentious,\u201d said Francesco Ricci Bitti, chairman of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations and former president of the International Tennis Federation. \u201cBut we\u2019re on a path forward.\u201dMr. Kasper, the Swiss I.O.C. executive who also oversees the sport of skiing, had a more pragmatic perspective. \u201cWe need to stop pretending sport is clean,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a noble principle, but in practice? It\u2019s entertainment. It\u2019s drama.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How LinkedIn Drove a Wedge Between Microsoft and Salesforce", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Once so close they flirted with a merger, the software giants became archrivals when they realized the value of the data amassed by social networks.Supported byThis is a story of love lost after a fight over social media.Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn \u2014 hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople. When Microsoft won, Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European antimonopoly laws.But not long ago, the two software giants were tight. They even talked about merging their businesses \u2014 not once, but twice. The second round of talks hasn\u2019t previously been reported.A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce, which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model, and Microsoft, which is racing to adjust, exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter. The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.There are big personalities behind the battle. At Microsoft, the job of adjusting course has fallen to Satya Nadella, a poetry-quoting chief executive who is trying to aggressively remake the company in hot areas like the cloud business applications where Salesforce is a leader.\u201cMicrosoft decided it could go ahead and recreate the best parts of Salesforce,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures who has spoken with Mr. Nadella and other business-development executives at Microsoft.Marc Benioff, a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, is considered a self-assured visionary. But he had doubts about staying independent around the time he understood that Microsoft was getting serious about competing with his company.At the time, software used by businesses was usually sold through huge licensing deals for software that would be installed directly on company PCs. Mr. Benioff\u2019s idea was to undercut that model: He would offer the same thing over the internet, without expensive installations, and customers would pay by the month.The idea proved prescient. Though it only recently began turning a profit, Salesforce is on track to have more than $8 billion in revenue this year, representing annual growth of about 25 percent. The total market value of the company is over $50 billion. Salesforce is the largest tech employer in San Francisco, and the company will move into the city\u2019s tallest building, Salesforce Tower, when it is completed.It took Microsoft years to see the potential in what Salesforce was doing. Microsoft had its own C.R.M. product, Dynamics, but it took a back seat inside an empire that, under the former chief executive Steven A. Ballmer, was consumed with battling more prominent competitors like Apple, Google and Sony.Mr. Nadella, a longtime Microsoft executive whose career odyssey at the company included overseeing its C.R.M. product, was less combative than his predecessor. He began reaching out to leaders of many rival companies after he became chief executive in early 2014, with a special goal of improving Microsoft\u2019s standing in Silicon Valley.John W. Thompson, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who had recently become chairman of Microsoft\u2019s board, arranged a dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., for Mr. Nadella to meet other tech executives, including Mr. Benioff, the Salesforce chief said in a 2015 interview. \u201cAt the end of dinner, I really gave Satya a number of areas I thought we could work closely on,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in the interview. \u201cHe took me up on all of them.\u201dMr. Nadella and Mr. Benioff declined to be interviewed for this article.At one point, Mr. Benioff offered to buy the Dynamics business that Salesforce competed with, but Mr. Nadella turned him down, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Several people briefed on the talks said that account was accurate, though two of them said another factor was that Mr. Benioff thought Microsoft was not respectful enough of his accomplishments in building Salesforce. It was unclear whether Mr. Benioff would be happy in a subordinate role at Microsoft after building Salesforce from the ground up, and it was equally hard to imagine a successful Salesforce without him.Quickly, there were signs that Microsoft planned to get its act together in the C.R.M. business. As part of a broader shake-up, Mr. Nadella moved Dynamics under Scott Guthrie, one of Microsoft\u2019s most respected engineering leaders. This telegraphed that it intended to go after Salesforce\u2019s business.\u201cThey\u2019re serious in a way they haven\u2019t been before,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, an angel investor in Seattle and a former Microsoft manager who occasionally consults with the company.Salesforce did not sit idle. In November, it hired a former head of Dynamics, Bob Stutz, to oversee its data analytics products.Still, Microsoft and Salesforce had reasons to keep the peace. Mr. Nadella wanted Salesforce to use Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure, called Azure, to run its internet applications. A marquee customer like Salesforce could lend credibility to Azure as Microsoft tried to catch Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure provider.In the months after, Mr. Benioff met privately with Mr. Nadella to talk business. Mr. Benioff discussed using Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens augmented reality headset in a Salesforce presentation; that never panned out. And he again brought up the idea of Microsoft\u2019s acquiring Salesforce, according to several people briefed on the talks.Microsoft seemed less receptive to the idea than before, partly because of Salesforce\u2019s price tag and also because Microsoft had decided to compete more aggressively with its own product, these people said. By last February, the discussions were dead, they said.The conversations became contentious enough to place a strain on the longtime friendship between Mr. Benioff and Mr. Thompson, according to two people with knowledge of the relationship. The two men did not speak for months (although things have since thawed). That\u2019s around the time Mr. Benioff seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by Microsoft \u2014 a well-capitalized competitor, many times the size of Salesforce \u2014 according to people who discussed the issue with him.The most alluring acquisition target for both companies, though, was LinkedIn.The business social networking site has become an indispensable tool for people to advertise their employment histories and professional achievements. LinkedIn\u2019s enormous database of profiles could be coupled more tightly with C.R.M. systems to help sales representatives close deals, both companies believed. LinkedIn\u2019s data could also be used to strengthen Microsoft products such as Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s most lucrative products. And LinkedIn comes with a steady revenue stream.For the next several months, Microsoft and Salesforce privately made competing offers for LinkedIn, each sweetening their bids as the competition increased. Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a board member, wooed Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and chairman, according to the LinkedIn filing. Salesforce code-named its LinkedIn effort Project Burgundy.In mid-June, Microsoft won LinkedIn with a bid of $196 a share, all of it in cash, which provided more certainty for LinkedIn shareholders than the combination of cash and stock that Salesforce was offering. Microsoft has more than $136 billion in cash and short-term investments. Salesforce has less than $1.2 billion.\u201cWe were closer than we realized \u2014 maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it!\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cBut we were definitely over our skis!!!!\u201dAs the prospect of a LinkedIn deal began to dim for Salesforce, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, Burke Norton, sent an email to the board saying the company, as result, could contemplate a number of other acquisition targets, one of which \u2014 Demandware \u2014 it ended up buying. Other possibilities, including Adobe, Box, Tableau and Workday, remain independent, according to a presentation attached to the email, which was published on DCLeaks.com.Mr. Benioff has bought at least 10 companies in all. His most expensive purchase, at $2.8 billion, was Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. One big acquisition, the document software company Quip, took direct aim at Microsoft Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s cash cows.There is, of course, no guarantee that LinkedIn will give Microsoft the edge it seeks in data analytics, machine learning and C.R.M. software. The company has a history of fumbling big acquisitions, including its disastrous acquisition of Nokia, which ended in a $7.6 billion write-off, after which Microsoft backed away from mobile phones.While Salesforce\u2019s acquisitions and war chest are relatively small, the company highlighted in a presentation to analysts this fall that it had acquired Quip in part to land its co-founder, Bret Taylor, a former Facebook and Google executive. Analysts view Mr. Taylor as someone who can weave Salesforce\u2019s pieces into a more competitive company.In the meantime, Mr. Benioff cut a deal in May to use primarily Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, not Microsoft\u2019s. The deal was worth $400 million over four years for Amazon.Microsoft wooed away a big Salesforce customer, HP, in September to use Dynamics.\u201cGiven Microsoft\u2019s history and existing monopolies, it is sometimes necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to intervene to ensure that Microsoft is operating in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\u201d said Mr. Norton, Salesforce\u2019s chief legal officer.It\u2019s not clear if the complaints will be a problem for the deal, which has already been approved in the United States.In response to Salesforce\u2019s complaints, Microsoft has said it will bring more price competition to the market. But neither company is totally estranged from its rival, and they say they must work together. In a statement, Peggy Johnson, an executive vice president at Microsoft, said that \u201cwhile we\u2019ll continue to compete, we look forward to continuing to partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Officer Who Shot Philando Castile Is Charged With Manslaughter", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byIn outlining the case against Officer Jeronimo Yanez, prosecutors described a traffic stop on July 6 that spiraled out of control when Officer Yanez overreacted to the presence of Mr. Castile\u2019s lawfully carried gun and shot him despite pleas that he was not reaching for the weapon.\u201cNo reasonable officer \u2014 knowing, seeing and hearing what Officer Yanez did at the time \u2014 would have used deadly force under these circumstances,\u201d the Ramsey County attorney, John J. Choi, said. Officer Yanez, who will appear in court on Friday, was also charged with two felony counts of intentional discharge of a dangerous weapon.But when Officer Yanez pulled Mr. Castile over in the tiny suburb of Falcon Heights, the conversation described by prosecutors started out as ordinary, with no mention of the robbery and no discussion of the smell of marijuana that Officer Yanez would later recount to investigators. (Mr. Choi said Wednesday that Mr. Castile was not a suspect in the armed robbery case.)Within seconds, Officer Yanez, of the St. Anthony police, had shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it out,\u201d and Mr. Castile and his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, tried to assure him that he was not grabbing the gun. But Officer Yanez quickly fired seven rounds, fatally wounding Mr. Castile just 62 seconds after the traffic stop began. An instant later, Mr. Castile moaned and said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t reaching for it.\u201d\u201cHis dying words were in protest that he wasn\u2019t reaching for his gun,\u201d Mr. Choi said.Mr. Castile\u2019s death is among the highest-profile cases of the countless police interactions with black men that have roiled the country, and especially Minnesota, in the last two years. The case drew international attention, largely because Ms. Reynolds streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live, calmly but firmly recounting her version of events and disputing Officer Yanez\u2019s narrative as blood soaked through Mr. Castile\u2019s white T-shirt.Officer Yanez would later tell investigators that he feared for his life and that he believed Mr. Castile was trying to grab a gun. But Mr. Choi, the prosecutor, suggested a different narrative. He said that Mr. Castile had gone beyond what the law required in alerting Officer Yanez to his gun, and that he had never drawn the weapon. Paramedics eventually found the weapon, a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun, in the pocket of his shorts as they were positioning him on a backboard. There was no round in the chamber.None of those other cases have led to criminal charges, and activists and Mr. Castile\u2019s family greeted Wednesday\u2019s announcement as a validation of their efforts and a possible turning point.What happened in recent cases where blacks were killed by the police or died in police custody.\u201cHad the people not camped out at the governor\u2019s mansion for 21 days and consistently kept this issue in the public eye, it\u2019s possible that this outcome would not have been reached,\u201d said Nekima Levy-Pounds, the president of the Minneapolis N.A.A.C.P. and a candidate for mayor of that city.Ms. Levy-Pounds, who protested Mr. Castile\u2019s death in July, said the charges brought \u201csome semblance of justice\u201d even as she noted the long road toward trial.Officer Yanez could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted on the manslaughter count, and up to five years for each of the weapons charges. Glenda Hatchett, a lawyer for the Castile family, said that she wished those penalties were more severe, but that she supported the charging decision and Mr. Choi\u2019s approach to the case.\u201cWe see this as a historic decision, a historic time,\u201d Ms. Hatchett said.Mr. Castile has been remembered since his death as a kind, peaceful man who knew the names of the children at the school where he worked and took pride in managing the cafeteria.As the case against Officer Yanez moves toward trial, Mr. Castile\u2019s mother, Valerie, urged any protests to remain peaceful and said her family was pleased with the decision to bring charges. \u201cWe all hope and pray that the right thing is done,\u201d she said.Christina Capecchi reported from St. Paul, and Mitch Smith from Chicago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding a Rich Vein of Humor in China\u2019s Past", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported bySinosphereIn an interview, Mr. Rea discussed cursing as a spectator sport, the invention of humor and his debt to Monty Python.What led you to write about Chinese humor?China isn\u2019t usually thought of as a funny place. It seems that many Chinese humorists back then turned to cursing. Why?For a couple reasons. First, a print culture boom made disputes public as never before. Now you\u2019re taking down your adversary not in a teahouse, but in the newspaper. Slights and sarcasm quickly escalate to name-calling and character assassination. Writers with a penchant for funny insults became famous as \u201crenowned revilers\u201d \u2014 ming ma \u2014 cursing celebrities, if you will. Second, early 20th-century China was a violent place of rampaging militarists, political assassinations, foreign invasion and crushing poverty. Many critics felt that extreme conditions called for extreme rhetoric. Hypocrites, traitors and wimps became objects of contempt.Can you share an example that could be printed in a family newspaper?What was the role of the writer Lin Yutang, who coined a term for humor: youmo?Your book mentions \u201cthe invention of humor,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t that humor didn\u2019t exist in China previously, right?How did people respond to the promotion of humor? It was a hit. The press dubbed 1933 \u201cThe Year of Humor,\u201d and the term youmo has stayed with us since. But Chinese humor writers had traditionally been on the defensive. When they cracked jokes, they\u2019d say it was just a way to pass the time over a cup of tea. The reflex was to belittle humor. The moderns, too, felt they had to justify what they were doing. Lin Yutang wanted it to be O.K. to be funny without losing face. But he acknowledged that the general prejudice was that \u201cno one except a clown would condescend to crack a joke in public.\u201dWhat are some of your favorites from this period? What does this history tell us about Xi Jinping\u2019s China, which doesn\u2019t seem very funny?The internet is rife with mockery too. Eighty years ago, Wu Zhihui\u2019s salty tongue had journalists trailing after him for his latest quip or gaffe. He\u2019d be at a university to give a speech and when he pulled it out of his pocket all his change would come out. Then Wu and the principal would spend five minutes picking his pennies off the floor. So Wu was catnip to the press. In the 1930s, one writer said that Wu was remarkable \u201cin the sense of being uncouth and yet that very uncouthness has become an attraction in itself.\u201dSounds oddly familiar.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re performers, too.The internet has elevated supporters to the role of surrogates, capable of creating their own messages and running their own online campaigns on their social media feeds. Memes and other tools of digital culture empower them to twist carefully orchestrated campaign images \u2014 or candidates\u2019 gaffes \u2014 until they take on new meanings and take over the news cycle.As demonstrated by the entries below, voters \u2014 like the candidates themselves \u2014 have become adept at wielding the weapons of the social media age, and their role promises only to grow in future election seasons. So even when Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton exit the campaign stage, the next iterations of \u201cDeplorable\u201d merchandise, Nasty Woman Twitter handles and Hillary health memes will live on. But never before have we seen the campaigns revel in their opponents\u2019 insults with such obvious glee. After Mr. Trump, during the third debate, leaned into his microphone and called Mrs. Clinton \u201csuch a nasty woman,\u201d hordes of Hillary supporters rushed to claim the title in their Twitter accounts, mocked up images of Mrs. Clinton as Janet Jackson (Madam President, if you\u2019re nasty) and sold T-shirts emblazoned with the offending words. A similar metamorphosis occurred weeks earlier when audio leaked of Mrs. Clinton calling some Trump supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d Now \u201cdeplorable\u201d is printed on T-shirts and buttons and mashed up with the Minions of \u201cDespicable Me.\u201dCandidates in future elections may once again wish for a good, clean fight. But for their supporters, a reclaimed insult represents a rare opportunity to connect with a campaign in a way that feels visceral and real. Campaign slogans like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cStronger Together\u201d reek of focus-grouped pandering. But \u201cnasty woman\u201d or \u201cdeplorable\u201d feel like prizes seized from opponents in battle. And they\u2019re the perfect campaign artifacts to pin onto Twitter accounts, where users want to publicize their support of a candidate while also telegraphing their sense of humor and sense of self. The new campaign slogan is goading your opponent into saying something deliciously mean.Welcome to the age of information overload. In this glutted and distractible social-media landscape, a nugget of agitprop can rise to overwhelm actual fact, as long as it\u2019s presented in an ominous enough package.The right-wing guerrilla journalist James O\u2019Keefe is the master of creating a vaguely scandalous aesthetic, churning out dark, shaky, blurred-out (and selectively edited) undercover videos meant to hint at Democratic conspiracies. But now that most Americans carry around recording devices in their pockets, scandal production is no longer just the domain of experts and ideologues. The democratic vibe makes the content even more compelling.A bystander-filmed cellphone video of Hillary Clinton nearly collapsing outside a Sept. 11 memorial event lit the right-wing internet on fire because it revealed her in a state of weakness, but also because the video wasn\u2019t captured by professional cameramen from CNN or MSNBC. The shaky tape just looked like something the public wasn\u2019t supposed to see.Now that one of the most simple and accessible document forms \u2014 an email \u2014 has been recast as a blueprint for scandal, we can expect only more hacks, leaks and sinister highlighting down the road. The hackers who exposed the emails of Mr. Podesta and the Democratic National Committee have been rewarded for their risk. And the scandalmongers\u2019 job is a lot easier when all they need to find is an email, no matter what it says. These memes are more than just gags; they\u2019re campaign opportunities. Richard Dawkins coined \u201cmeme\u201d in 1976, defining it as a \u201cunit of cultural transmission\u201d that persists by \u201cleaping from brain to brain.\u201d Just as right-wing memes used images of Mrs. Clinton coughing and stumbling to help whip up a Hillary health crisis, these Trump memes helped to extend the shelf life of news stories about Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women.Not that memers have that thought in mind \u2014 they\u2019re more likely coping with the psychological torture of the campaign cycle with some comic relief, or just scanning the political landscape looking for a joke that will rack up followers and likes. It seems likely that debate prep will soon adapt to take memeability into account. One can easily imagine a candidate in 2020 plotting to prepare a \u201cshimmy moment\u201d for the stage. But the memes are moving so swiftly and savagely, they also threaten to supersede campaign image control. No candidate is slick enough to appear presidential in every single frame.Donald J. Trump, the ringmaster of 2016, will not always dominate the American political imagination. But even when he\u2019s gone, his fiercest supporters and opponents will still be logging online. With every election cycle, the citizenry seems to amass more and more tools for bending the online political narrative to their will \u2014 or to feel as if they\u2019re doing so, anyway.A picture caption last Sunday with an article about internet memes and the presidential campaign misstated the debate that was shown. The photograph, of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, was taken at their second debate, not their third.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Myanmar Urged by U.N. Expert to Let Aid Flow to Rakhine State", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byGENEVA \u2014 Amid mounting reports of violent unrest and brutal reprisals by Myanmar\u2019s army in a predominantly Muslim part of Rakhine State, a United Nations expert said on Friday that the country\u2019s government should let aid agencies into the area and investigate allegations of abuse instead of brushing them aside with blanket denials.A closely supervised two-day visit to the region arranged by the authorities for 10 diplomats in early November did little to address the humanitarian crisis and should not be used as a \u201csmoke screen\u201d for giving the military a free hand to increase its operations, Ms. Lee said.The office of Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, rejected the accusations against the military, saying in a Facebook post that they were \u201cabsolutely not true,\u201d according to Reuters.The army has reported scores of deaths in the area in the past week, but pro-Rohingya activists say that more than a hundred people have been killed by troops, including women and children, and that soldiers have destroyed property and seized livestock.The population of Rakhine, like Myanmar overall, is mostly Buddhist, but the areas near the Bangladeshi border where the recent violence has occurred are predominantly Muslim.International aid agencies say they have heard reports that hundreds of Rohingya Muslims have crossed into Bangladesh to escape the crackdown and that others were shot dead as they headed for the border.A spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, Adrian Edwards, said on Friday that the agency did not have access to border areas and that it was unable to verify those accounts. Mr. Edwards called on Myanmar to provide the access required for the delivery of aid to 160,000 civilians the United Nations supports in Rakhine State, including about 30,000 Rohingya said to have been forced from their homes since violence flared in October.Ms. Lee also expressed skepticism over a statement by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi that the government\u2019s response to the violence in Rakhine State was based on the rule of law, echoing growing unease that she is doing little to rein in Myanmar\u2019s powerful military establishment.\u201cI am unaware of any efforts on the part of the government to look into the allegations of human rights violations,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cIt would appear, on the contrary, that the government has mostly responded with a blanket denial.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Rakhine State. Its population is mostly Buddhist, not Muslim, though the area where recent violence has occurred is predominantly Muslim.

{"Headline": "Is Social Media Disconnecting Us From the Big Picture?", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Donald Trump could be elected president, but I was. I live in Brooklyn and work in Manhattan, two of the most liberal places in the country. But even online, I wasn\u2019t seeing many signs of support for him. How did that blindness occur? Social media is my portal into the rest of the world \u2014 my periscope into the communities next to my community, into how the rest of the world thinks and feels. And it completely failed me.In hindsight, that failure makes sense. I\u2019ve spent nearly 10 years coaching Facebook \u2014 and Instagram and Twitter \u2014 on what kinds of news and photos I don\u2019t want to see, and they all behaved accordingly. Each time I liked an article, or clicked on a link, or hid another, the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought I wanted to see. That meant I didn\u2019t realize that most of my family members, who live in rural Virginia, were voicing their support for Trump online, and I didn\u2019t see any of the pro-Trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election. I never saw a Trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds, and the only Election Day selfies I saw were of people declaring their support for Hillary Clinton.To be clear, I\u2019m not blaming the algorithms for what I assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview. They did exactly what I told them to do, blocking out racist, misogynist and anti-immigrant comments, hiding anyone who didn\u2019t support Black Lives Matter, all with such deftness that I had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election. But considering that more than 40 percent of our country\u2019s population consumes news on Facebook, finding alternative perspectives shouldn\u2019t have been that hard. I knew about Eli Pariser\u2019s theory on filter bubbles, or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see, and even so, I still chose to let algorithms shape how I perceive the world. Everything I could want to see is available at my fingertips, and yet I didn\u2019t look.In April, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network. Facebook, he said, has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet. \u201cThe internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community, and we are all better off for it.\u201dBut that\u2019s not what has happened. Zuckerberg\u2019s idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site. On Facebook, the political divide has only been entrenched further. It\u2019s the BuzzFeed dress debate, only for our entire lives: We are two countries, one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold. The internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another. But they are rapidly disappearing.Most social media \u2014 like Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it, but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness, a Gal\u00e1pagos of sorts, where culture thrived untouched. They included Vine (whose closure was announced in October) and Snapchat, and even Tumblr, which were homes for marginalized ideas, theories and lifestyles.The video-sharing app Vine was the first place I got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own, including those of the Middle East. I was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them: prospering, aware. A young woman living in Saudi Arabia who goes by the name Amy Roko used Vine to show clips of herself living her life \u2014 her version of normalcy \u2014 at the mall, goofing off at home. In her most viral video, she stares into the camera, her face covered in a niqab, save for her perfectly outlined eyes. \u201c[expletive] called me ugly,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI said, [expletive] where?\u201d The emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath. I was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own.Vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community. But Vine links could be shared independent of the network, and people did so with abandon, meaning that Vines appeared scattershot around the web, defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds. They could land on your screen via text message, direct message, email.Roko\u2019s Vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black American named Brionna London, who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty. You can draw a straight line from brown women in Saudi Arabia to black women in America, a marvel unto itself, a window into the way the internet flattens space and time \u2014 a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides. At Vine\u2019s peak, it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of times, and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities: that, say, black kids in New Orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in Florida. (At the very least, they shared a similar humor and taste in music, which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as well.)And yet Twitter, which owns Vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers, could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature (which reportedly costs millions a month to maintain) afloat. Following news about Twitter\u2019s decision to close the service, there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing Vine\u2019s remains. But it\u2019s most likely too late to salvage the community there.In its earlier days, Snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange. The app had an incredible series on \u201ccity life\u201d that gave users direct windows into different worlds. People submitted short video diaries about life in their cities, which the company compiled into a single video, viewable by anyone using the app. I remember feeling delighted watching people in Istanbul and S\u00e3o Paulo showing off their routines and customs. But the company is now prioritizing \u201clive stories,\u201d which feature more mainstream events like the Super Bowl and music festivals. The effect is still fascinating, but less intimate. Snapchat seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar.The future of Tumblr, the blogging platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender theory, critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the internet, is the most uncertain. Yahoo, its parent company, succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by Verizon, raising questions about the future of its properties.What we\u2019re seeing with Snapchat, Tumblr and Vine reflects a larger shift in the social-media economy. User-generated content, by and large, is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies investors, and as a result, most social-media companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams. One of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging. Semiprivate messaging applications \u2014 group text threads and applications like WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook) and Slack \u2014 have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for conversation, a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks. New features are introduced daily, it seems, to make messaging with your friends more \u201cfun.\u201d The latest version of the iPhone\u2019s software includes the ability to make messages \u201cexplode\u201d with confetti. WhatsApp now offers the ability to tag people in messages, as you might tag them in a photograph online. These changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications overseas, which used similar features to attract and retain customers. (Line, a Japanese company that built an addictive messaging app with 220 million monthly users worldwide, had one of the biggest initial public offerings \u2014 $1.1 billion \u2014 earlier this year.) These new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter together, by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large.What happens when we would rather look inward? I have found something of an answer in a short story called \u201cThe Great Silence,\u201d by Ted Chiang, about humankind\u2019s search for signs of alien life. The story is narrated by a parrot in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. \u201cTheir desire to make a connection is so strong that they\u2019ve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe,\u201d the creature begins. \u201cBut I and my fellow parrots are right here. Why aren\u2019t they interested in listening to our voices?\u201d The paradox is not to be missed: We are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with. The story ends on a somber note. \u201cHuman activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction,\u201d the narrator explains. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it maliciously. They just weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201dChiang\u2019s lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment. Social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with people; instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we don\u2019t agree with. But if we can\u2019t pay attention to one another, we might as well not live on the same planet at all.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Here are six takes on a divided America, in the wake of Donald J. Trump\u2019s narrow election victory.Her friends (she has 4,996) had posted images of a supposed Democrat defecating on a Trump sign. Another shared a protest video \u2014 \u201cIdiot Paid Anti-Trump Anarchists Yell \u2018Peaceful Protest\u2019 as they Bash Cars\u201d \u2014 with the message, \u201cRun these vile Liberal dirtbags down!!!\u201d Others called protesters \u201cspoiled brats\u201d and urged friends to keep their guns loaded.Ms. Haun had added a video of her own \u2014 \u201cAnti-Trump rioters brawl \u2014 with each other!\u201d \u2014 with a note: \u201cAre we having fun yet?\u201dThen I opened a new window and logged in as Meredith Dodson, 42, a Hillary Clinton supporter who lives in Washington, D.C. She has 1,176 friends. On her feed, no one was talking about the protests. Instead, there was fear. How would women, African-Americans, Latinos, immigrants, gay people and others be treated under President Trump?\u201cAs a woman and a Latina I\u2019m feeling lost and afraid,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cFriends please tell me you have my back.\u201d\u201cThis morning,\u201d another wrote, \u201cI started mentally planning how I would react if someone were to refer to me as the N word. It has already happened to 3 of my friends.\u201dMs. Dodson had tapped out her own message: \u201cThe vast majority of my daughter\u2019s DC Public Schools PreK classmates are the children of immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are 3 and 4 year olds! I am so frightened.\u201dIn some ways, the echo chamber was the winner of this election. Here we are, deeply connected. And yet red America is typing away to red America, and blue America is typing away to blue America. The day after the election, some people said the echo chamber had begun to feel like a prison.I called Ms. Haun and Ms. Dodson and thanked them for letting me hang out in their social spaces. Ms. Dodson said that she had two or three Facebook friends who supported Mr. Trump, but no real-life friends who did, and that she had been trying to get out of her bubble. \u201dI have this suspicion that I have no idea what\u2019s going on in the rest of white America,\u201d she said.Ms. Haun has a few friends who support Mrs. Clinton, but they largely avoid talking about politics online, she said. She was less concerned than Ms. Dodson about getting trapped in a loop of ideas. \u201cWe want to be inclusive in our echo chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone wants to come in, come on in.\u201d JULIE TURKEWITZNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Perhaps the best way to understand \u201cthe elite\u201d that Mr. Trump railed against is to consider what it is not \u2014 or at least how it differs from the way Clinton supporters might see it.Elite does not simply mean having a lot of money. Mr. Trump, who inherited millions, is not considered an elite sellout by his supporters any more than Edward J. Snowden is considered a tool of the government for having worked at the National Security Agency. Rather, the thinking goes, it\u2019s because Mr. Trump knows how it all works that he is in the best position to take it all apart.\u201cThe people he hung around, with all those wealthy folks and how they manipulated everything,\u201d made him uniquely qualified, said Pat Bruce, a conservative activist in the suburbs of Jackson, Miss., who grew excited about the Trump campaign when she saw that \u201che never changed what he said to fit what they wanted him to say.\u201dElite does not necessarily mean educated, either. While university professors might be scorned as condescending eggheads, book smarts are prized when used against the bookish. While covering the 2012 Republican primary races in the Deep South, I remember conservatives crowing giddily about Newt Gingrich\u2019s ability to demolish foes in a debate.Elite is certainly not, as many on the left would argue, a function of historical advantage: being, say, a white Christian male in a country that has long made little room for anyone else. It is in some ways exactly not this. Rather, much of Mr. Trump\u2019s support arose from frustration that the majority must grant marginalized groups \u2014 immigrants, transgender people \u2014 particular protection and deference.This is, to many, what constitutes the elite: the people who set the cultural and societal norms, and who do so without their input or influence.And even with the Republicans having achieved near-total control of all levels of government, this remained an aggravating conundrum: The elites are still the ones who decide who gets to be elite. CAMPBELL ROBERTSONReligion is a purple state. There were indeed plenty of religious folks cheering at Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, but there were many clergy members who fought hard to elect Mrs. Clinton.The Clinton camp included many evangelicals, but they were predominantly black, Latino, Asian and female. Her supporters also included two-thirds of Latino Catholics and four in 10 white Catholics; Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities; and those who say they have no religious affiliation.After the election, Mr. Barber\u2019s Twitter feed went silent until Friday, when he put out a stream of posts. \u201cThis is where we redouble our commitment to be instruments of truth, love, and justice,\u201d he wrote, rallying people of faith to lead the way in resisting the Trump administration. LAURIE GOODSTEINA Trump supporter called me Thursday to criticize my coverage of the president-elect\u2019s immigration policies. He pointed to it as an example of egregious bias that he said had led the news media to miss the groundswell of support that lifted Mr. Trump to victory.His tone was hostile at first, but we got to talking. The supporter, Douglas Freeman, a 67-year-old retired postal worker from Knoxville, Tenn., explained why Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to raise a border wall and punish cities that protect immigrants here illegally resonated with his view of the United States as a nation under siege \u2014 from outside and within.\u201cHe speaks with conviction and passion,\u201d Mr. Freeman said of Mr. Trump, \u201cand he is obviously an American patriot who is very upset with the political ruling class, which is selling our sovereignty out to globalism.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen he said Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, we stood up and cheered.\u201dFor Mr. Freeman, Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt immigration talk signified that he was a true rebel who would take on the powers that be, including in the Republican Party.But Mr. Freeman wants Mr. Trump to add a lot more border security to send a message to migrants to stay out, and to reassure his American supporters that the borders \u201care no longer open.\u201dHe said he did not expect Mr. Trump\u2019s actions to match all the heated statements of his campaign. The wall does not have to cover remote, impassable stretches of the border, he said. He understands the country needs guest workers for agriculture. He does not expect agents to go door to door looking for immigrants to deport.But he wants Mr. Trump to cut federal funding for cities that do not cooperate with immigration authorities. And he strongly favors \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for refugees from the Middle East. \u201cWe are deliberately importing Muslims who are very intolerant and don\u2019t believe in live-and-let-live,\u201d Mr. Freeman said.\u201cIf Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t deliver,\u201d he said, \u201che won\u2019t have support for very long.\u201d JULIA PRESTONIn vowing to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump laid bare competing visions of what America is \u2014 or should be.For years politicians have framed the divide as Red America versus Blue America. But Mr. Trump\u2019s victory has me thinking about our national divide as a clash between Americans who prize the melting pot, and those who embrace the concept of the \u201csalad bowl.\u201d So I reached out to several women I knew.Mary Barket is 60, a Republican strategist and avid Trump supporter in Nazareth, Pa., squarely in the Rust Belt. Her grandfather emigrated from Poland shortly before World War I, joined the Army and returned to Europe to fight. He learned English and insisted his children do the same.\u201cHe was all about assimilation,\u201d she said.Mrs. Barket said she had watched with alarm as identity politics and racial divisions flourished under President Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president. She works in her church, helping run a food pantry, and once took in a black friend of her daughter\u2019s for six months.She said she approved of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, but today\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests against the police have unnerved her: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like they come from a place of peace.\u201d She has a gay cousin who is in a long-term relationship, but she is not enamored of the gay rights movement; she says the focus should be on \u201chuman rights\u201d instead.\u201cI just don\u2019t like this striating of our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have to go back to thinking of ourselves as Americans.\u201dI met Tessa Hill-Aston \u2014 who is \u201c60-ish\u201d and the president of the Baltimore chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. \u2014 while covering the unrest spurred by the death of Freddie Gray after his arrest by the police. Her grandfather, a doctor in Kentucky, was the descendant of a slave impregnated by her master. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here looking for a melting pot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were tortured and brought here.\u201dLike Mara Kiesling, 57, who began life as a boy in Harrisburg, Pa., and now fights for transgender rights in Washington, Ms. Hill-Aston envisions an America where differences are celebrated, not airbrushed away. Both women are terrified Mr. Trump will roll back their hard-won rights.\u201cThe feeling that is the strongest for me this week is that this is my country,\u201d Ms. Kiesling said, \u201cand no one is going to tell me I can\u2019t be here. \u201cAll of these women insist they want a unified America, and in many respects \u2014 including their age and socioeconomic status \u2014 they are very similar. Yet as they fight for their version of America, they could not be further apart. SHERYL GAY STOLBERGNone of this bothered Texas Republicans a great deal. There were a few apologies and statements of regret, but not much more.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters in blue America cringed at Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks during the campaign, but his supporters throughout red America barely flinched. They were used to it. They lived in places where public figures had been making Trump-esque comments for years. In red Texas in particular, I have found, the notion of being offended is regarded as a \u201cblue\u201d concept.Lance Herrington, 73, has long offended Democratic motorists on State Highway 71 in La Grange, plastering the marquee and other signs outside his classic car company with provocative slogans. He told me a story about someone he had offended with his marquee in 2012. Red America will take it one way. Blue America will take it another.After the debates between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama in 2012, his marquee read: \u201cThe Mormon won. The moron zero.\u201d He also hung a white plastic chair, a reference to Clint Eastwood\u2019s conversation with a chair during the Republican convention that year.\u201cThis minority, she was out front,\u201d he said. She later called him and threatened to turn him into the F.B.I. \u201cI said, \u2018For what?\u2019 She says, \u2018For that chair.\u2019 I said, \u2018Darling, as you can see, it\u2019s a white chair.\u2019 And she hung up on me.\u201d\u201cThe pendulum swung so far toward political correctness that you can\u2019t do anything without offending someone,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel\u2019s Bet on Donald Trump Pays Off", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor at odds with much of Silicon Valley, will have President Trump\u2019s ear on tech issues.He won\u2019t be moving to Washington, Mr. Thiel made clear in an interview Wednesday afternoon. He is unlikely to have a formal role. He has no desire to fulfill his youthful dream of joining the United States Supreme Court.But he will have a voice.\u201cA page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to help the president in any way I can.\u201dBut now that Mr. Thiel\u2019s bet on Mr. Trump has paid off, he seems to be in a position to reap some rewards.Mr. Thiel said that he never doubted the Republican candidate would triumph despite predictions from pollsters and the news media.\u201cHis odds were very badly underestimated,\u201d Mr. Thiel said of Mr. Trump. \u201cTrump voters were not being captured by the polls. A lot of the dynamics were very similar to the Brexit vote in the U.K.,\u201d which also took many commentators by surprise.Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, Mr. Thiel said, forgot the motto that Bill Clinton had won the presidency with in 1992: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d\u201cSomehow the Clintons did not remember,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a blind spot.\u201d Mr. Thiel said that against Senator Bernie Sanders, who competed against Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, it \u201cwould have been much tougher for Trump to win, and a healthier race for the country. It would have been two candidates who agreed about the country\u2019s stagnation but had very different policy prescriptions.\u201dOne of the supposed rules of American presidential politics is that the candidates must be upbeat \u2014 a decree ever since Ronald Reagan trounced Walter Mondale in 1984 with the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s morning again in America.\u201dMr. Thiel said he sensed this year that the rule would not hold.\u201cI\u2019ve thought for quite a long time that the happy clappy Panglossian Republican politics that we had over the last few decades was deeply out of touch,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, a more pessimistic candidate would do better, because they would resonate with these broad economic realities.\u201dEven as Mr. Thiel\u2019s bet on Mr. Trump was proved right, many in Silicon Valley\u2019s tech industry on Wednesday reacted negatively to the presidential victor. Some venture capitalists floated the idea of a California secession.The investor said Silicon Valley was not completely opposed to Mr. Trump; there was also some secret support.\u201cI was having dinner last week with a high-profile venture capitalist and he said, \u2018I\u2019m voting for Trump but I have to lie and tell everyone I\u2019m voting for Gary Johnson,\u2019\u201d the third-party candidate, said Mr. Thiel. \u201cHe was stunningly matter-of-fact about it.\u201dNow, he said, it\u2019s \u201call hands on deck.\u201d That includes the technology community.\u201cIt\u2019s important for it to be able to work with the rest of the country and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it would be crazy to simply spend four years issuing denunciatory tweets on Twitter. For a day or two, that\u2019s fine. But I hope Silicon Valley will be more productive than that.\u201dThe enormous wealth created by the tech industry has not been widely shared. It\u2019s a problem the community needs to reflect on and address, the investor said.Mr. Thiel, whose net worth of nearly $3 billion partly derives from being the first outside investor in Facebook and being a cofounder of the electronics payments company PayPal, has a history of making contrarian bets.Before Mr. Trump, the investor backed other outsiders: Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, during the 2016 primaries. None of those bets paid off.Mr. Thiel said he not only spoke out for Mr. Trump and gave him money, but voted for him in a state \u2014 California \u2014 where the candidate was bound to lose.\u201cI did vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t always vote, but I thought you might ask, so I did.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billionaires vs. the Press in the Era of Trump", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "FeatureA small group of superrich Americans \u2014 the president-elect among them \u2014 has laid the groundwork for an unprecedented legal assault on the media. Can they succeed?Supported byTrump was wrong: Warner Books spent less than he did, and O\u2019Brien paid nothing. But that doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s central idea any less jarring: that libel law can be a tool of revenge. It\u2019s disconcerting for a superrich (if maybe not as rich as he says) plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics. Once installed in the White House, Trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal, and his record suggests that, more than his predecessors, he will try to use the press \u2014 and also control and subdue it.But when the newspaper appealed to the Supreme Court, the justices threw out the Sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel. The court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with \u201cactual malice,\u201d translated as \u201cknowing or reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d By the 1980s, the number of libel suits decreased, and if suits did go to trial, they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff. In two examples from that era, Gen. William Westmoreland sued CBS, and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli defense minister, sued Time magazine. Neither man won damages. Those outcomes, as well as losses in other high-profile cases, \u201cwere a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers,\u201d says George Freeman, executive director of the Media Resource Law Center (and formerly a lawyer for The New York Times).Over three years of proceedings, which included turning over internal emails, Mother Jones racked up about $2.5 million in legal fees. Insurance didn\u2019t cover the whole cost. \u201cThe suit was a huge drain on us,\u201d Clara Jeffery, editor in chief of the magazine, told me. \u201cWe\u2019re still digging our way out.\u201dIt\u2019s common for judges to dismiss privacy suits when the plaintiff has encouraged news interest. In a preliminary ruling before trial, the Florida Court of Appeals said that Gawker posted the sex tape as part of an \u201congoing public discussion,\u201d citing Hogan\u2019s appearance on \u201cTMZ\u201d and later on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show.\u201d But Judge Pamela Campbell, who presided over the trial, instructed the jury to decide for itself whether the publication of the sex tape was \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person\u201d and \u201cnot of legitimate concern to the public.\u201dIn the half-century since New York Times v. Sullivan, the United States has often held itself up to the world as a beacon for the free press. American libel law, the theory goes, protects writers and publishers better than the laws of countries like Britain, where it\u2019s easier to win a libel judgment. Yet giant jury awards don\u2019t topple publications in the United Kingdom: The country has an unofficial damages cap of about \u00a3250,000 (plus legal fees). British publishers can, in essence, treat compensating someone whose reputation they have harmed as a cost of doing business. And it\u2019s less risky for them to apologize for a story that turns out to be wrong. \u201cThere are limits on damages for malpractice suits against doctors,\u201d says Robert Post, dean of the Yale Law School. \u201cWhy not for journalists?\u201dAn article on Nov. 27 about the future of libel law in the Trump era misidentified Clara Jeffery.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Alessia Glaviano is the senior photo editor at Vogue Italia. She has started a fashion photography festival in Milan with Franca Sozzani, the editor in chief of Vogue Italia. The first PhotoVogue Festival will run from Nov. 22 through Nov. 26. Angelica McKinley interviewed Ms. Glaviano by phone. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. How did the PhotoVogue Festival start? I owe a big thanks to my visionary editor in chief, Franca Sozzani, who has always believed in the power of images, and the power of images to deliver messages and statements beyond fashion. We decided to do this festival together. I adore photography. I grew up in a family of artists, and my father is a quite famous fashion photographer. Photography really means a lot to me, and not just fashion photography. So I travel a lot and come to all the festivals I can go to, but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a fashion photography festival. Everyone wakes up in the morning and everyone has to wear something, and we all wear something that makes us feel good and makes us feel ourselves. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not about following trends, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first interface that we have to the world. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so important. I mean, fashion is a language in itself. And fashion photography is a language too. From the beginning of fashion photography, there have been different kinds of images. There are fashion images that are just there to show you the clothes. And there are images that become art, like [Richard] Avedon and [Irving] Penn in the past, or Guy Bourdin. There are fashion images that go beyond the clothes and are talking about society and culture. Those images are the ones that stand in time, and today you see them in Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Sotheby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or at MoMA. Fashion is a strong part of culture. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at all a superficial thing. You have to make a distinction between fashion and fashion victims, O.K.? Two completely different things.  One of the central exhibits is \u00e2\u0080\u009cFemale Gaze.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What do you mean by that term? The exhibit I co-curated with Chiara Bardelli Nonino features women artists from Cindy Sherman and Sarah Moon to people like Arvida Bystr\u00c3\u00b6m or Petra Collins. The female gaze is the reassertion of the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity, and the idea of a different kind of beauty that is less artificial. Finally you see people that are not too thin; one day someone has a pimple and who cares. Or, you know, someone with cellulite. So you see all these kinds of things that before you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to see. Because before the web, if you wanted your images to be published, you had to go through the magazine. And what the magazine was publishing was just beautiful girls. And you know, beautiful was like Cindy Crawford, Eva Herzigova, that kind of beauty. Then we had the \u00e2\u0080\u009990s, with Kate Moss, which was the kind of heroin chic sort of thing. I feel that it was a bit fake. What happened with the web and social media instead is young women started to photograph their friends in very natural ways. Sometimes erotic. Sometimes just the way you could play around with your girlfriends. I think it did a lot for us, for the empowerment of women in being able to be who we are, without feeling insecure or without feeling \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not beautiful because I am not Cindy Crawford.\u201dI believe that the most important thing that happened in the past five years in photography is how women have actually taken back the gaze. We see so many images of women shot by women on social media and Instagram. And so many of these photographers are brilliant and are somehow completely changing the way we look at the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. And somehow, this also has affected the more institutional magazines.  What do you mean when you say women photographers have \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaken back the gaze\u00e2\u0080\u009d?  In the mid-\u00e2\u0080\u009970s, the film critic Laura Mulvey theorized about the male gaze, which was a system where the vision of the movie was always through a male perspective. The viewer would identify from this point of view, and would gain pleasure in objectifying the women. I thought a lot about this. And at the same time I think that part of what gets us going as women, parts of our pleasure from a sexual point of view, is to be considered objects of desire. So I thought hmmm, does it always have to be negative? Some feminists think that if there is a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naked, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re objectifying it. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with that. I believe that you always have to see case by case, judging the awareness of the subject and the motivation of the artist. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not be so black and white, maybe there are some areas of gray that we should look at, no?The fashion industry is always linked to the creation of desire. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about desire, women being desirable, women photographed in a way that we could find that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objectifying them, but at the same time, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always like that.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that you can say that objectifying a woman is always a negative thing. The  act of claiming back the lens and redefining a female gaze toward another woman, it becomes a subversive act. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a revolution.  What about the other exhibits? This is called the PhotoVogue Festival because we have a section of the magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website, called PhotoVogue. There is a platform open to everyone, where people can upload their pictures. Chiara Bardelli Nonino and Francesca Marani and myself go through all the images. And if we approve them, they go online. We have more than 125,000 photographers from all over the world doing all kinds of photography. And one of the exhibitions in the festival is actually the result of a contest that we launched through PhotoVogue to find talent in fashion photography. The exhibit has 30 of the best fashion photographers from the contest, and the winner is Kiki Xue, a young guy from China. I helped him go to Paris.There are also more than 30 galleries in Milan that will have photography exhibits of all kinds at the same time. In addition, the festival will have many talks on photography and free portfolio reviews. What makes a good fashion photo?  In a good fashion photo, all the aspects must be perfect. There has to be harmony between the elements of the picture and like every other kind of photograph, it has to give you an emotion. Beyond that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at all about the clothes. The clothes are one of the elements that you use in the picture to create this dream that you have, this vision that you have. The clothes help, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the storytelling that is fundamental. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be linear storytelling but something that is coherent from a visual point of view. All of the best fashion photographers that I know, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not crazy about fashion. They are crazy about the idea that through fashion they can tell stories. Or they can show their vision. Their vision about the world, their vision about women.A good fashion image has to stand out. You have to go wow. And all the elements should be there. I tell young photographers whatever you put in the picture, ask yourself, what does it do to the picture? Does it make it better or worse? Every little detail you have to go through.  What separates the novice fashion photographer and the expert? If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fashion photographer, you have to be like a director of a movie set. The fact that you have photographic talent is not sufficient. If you are working with the wrong people, your picture is going to be bad. Because the team in fashion photography is essential. If the makeup artist and the hairstylist are not doing a good job, you have to tell them. If the stylist is not choosing the right clothes and accessories, you have to tell her. The model, too. You have to be able to judge the people working with you and you have to be tough, because at the end it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your name on the picture. How important is it for a fashion photographer to have an individual vision?  If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have your own vision you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going anywhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 your work is not authentic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even interesting. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have your own vision when you start. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something you can build up. Step by step."}
{"Headline": "How the Internet Is Loosening Our Grip on the Truth", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtNext week, if all goes well, someone will win the presidency. What happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess. Will the losing side believe the results? Will the bulk of Americans recognize the legitimacy of the new president? And will we all be able to clean up the piles of lies, hoaxes and other dung that have been hurled so freely in this hyper-charged, fact-free election?For years, technologists and other utopians have argued that online news would be a boon to democracy. That has not been the case.Why? Because if you study the dynamics of how information moves online today, pretty much everything conspires against truth.The root of the problem with online news is something that initially sounds great: We have a lot more media to choose from.In the last 20 years, the internet has overrun your morning paper and evening newscast with a smorgasbord of information sources, from well-funded online magazines to muckraking fact-checkers to the three guys in your country club whose Facebook group claims proof that Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are really the same person.This dynamic becomes especially problematic in a news landscape of near-infinite choice. Whether navigating Facebook, Google or The New York Times\u2019s smartphone app, you are given ultimate control \u2014 if you see something you don\u2019t like, you can easily tap away to something more pleasing. Then we all share what we found with our like-minded social networks, creating closed-off, shoulder-patting circles online.\u201cThis creates an ecosystem in which the truth value of the information doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Walter Quattrociocchi, one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cAll that matters is whether the information fits in your narrative.\u201dDigital technology has blessed us with better ways to capture and disseminate news. There are cameras and audio recorders everywhere, and as soon as something happens, you can find primary proof of it online.You would think that greater primary documentation would lead to a better cultural agreement about the \u201ctruth.\u201d In fact, the opposite has happened.One of the apparent advantages of online news is persistent fact-checking. Now when someone says something false, journalists can show they\u2019re lying. And if the fact-checking sites do their jobs well, they\u2019re likely to show up in online searches and social networks, providing a ready reference for people who want to correct the record.But that hasn\u2019t quite happened. Today dozens of news outlets routinely fact-check the candidates and much else online, but the endeavor has proved largely ineffective against a tide of fakery.\u201cWhere hoaxes before were shared by your great-aunt who didn\u2019t understand the internet, the misinformation that circulates online is now being reinforced by political campaigns, by political candidates or by amorphous groups of tweeters working around the campaigns,\u201d said Caitlin Dewey, a reporter at The Washington Post who once wrote a column called \u201cWhat Was Fake on the Internet This Week.\u201d\u201cIn many ways the debunking just reinforced the sense of alienation or outrage that people feel about the topic, and ultimately you\u2019ve done more harm than good,\u201d she said.Other fact-checkers are more sanguine, recognizing the limits of exposing online hoaxes, but also standing by the utility of the effort.Yeah. Though soon, I suspect, that boulder is going to squash us all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Tide of Red on Electoral Map, West Coast Stays Defiantly Blue", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The West Coast has long prided itself as an engine for reinvention and progressive ideals, distinct from the rest of the country. But after Tuesday\u2019s election, the states bordering the Pacific Ocean feel increasingly like an island unto its own.\u201cWe are a nation state,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, referring to the state\u2019s diversity and vast, dynamic economy.\u201cIn so many ways, we are America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are just ahead of the curve.\u201dThe notion of West Coast states leaving the United States is fanciful and often tongue-in-cheek. But it reflects a sentiment here that after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory on Tuesday, the West increasingly sees itself as separate \u2014 a place of innovation, economic dynamism and a belief that government can be an agent of change.Abby Ginzberg, a documentary filmmaker who lives in Albany, Calif., said she felt both deflated by the result but somewhat insulated from its consequences.\u201cRight now, I am depressed and upset and aware we live in a bubble,\u201d she said. \u201cThank god for the bubble!\u201dIn Oregon and Washington, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s margin of victory was close to President Obama\u2019s four years ago. She received about 73 percent of the vote in Oregon\u2019s biggest urban county, Multnomah, which includes the Portland area \u2014 with most of the votes counted in an all-mail election.In Washington, the concentrations of blue intensified from the last presidential election. In King County, which includes Seattle and is the most populous in the state, Mrs. Clinton did better than Mr. Obama, with nearly three out of four residents voting for her, compared with 69 percent for Mr. Obama in 2012.Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle, a Democrat, described his city in recent days as almost like a fortress under siege, scanning for attack on the ramparts. Fighting, he said \u2014 in defense or offense \u2014 seems inevitable.\u201cThis country has elected a president who, during the campaign, demonstrated outright misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, nationalism, racism and authoritarian tendencies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have to challenge what we believe is wrong.\u201dMr. Murray, the city\u2019s first openly gay mayor, said he believed Mr. Trump, based on his comments as a candidate, could also aim to \u201ctrim back\u201d gains that places like Seattle have made in gay rights.\u201cLet me tell you, this city is committed that we will not lose the things that we have gained, the rings that we wear on our fingers,\u201d the mayor said.Not every result was so liberal. Californians voted to keep the death penalty, and some inland counties clearly supported the Trump candidacy. Still, one reason Mr. Trump\u2019s populist revolt bypassed the West is that the economic landscape did not reflect decades of decay and job losses.Yes, there are areas of anger and strain, from the high-desert ranches of eastern Oregon to coal towns in northwestern Colorado to strawberry farms in the Central Valley of California to steel towns struggling to reinvent themselves.But there are also new solar and wind farms, no-vacancy tourist towns and cities from Denver to San Jose, Calif., to Seattle that are buzzing with businesses, construction cranes and swarms of new residents.\u201cPlaces like Colorado, we have a robust economy,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents the Denver area. \u201cWhat you see in the West is the development of a new economy that they\u2019re not seeing the Midwest and the South.\u201dOver all, Colorado sided narrowly with the Democrats on Tuesday, but the state embraced liberal ballot measures like a rise in minimum wage and a law allowing medical assistance in dying for terminally ill people. Voters rejected a single-payer health care system, however.Like states across the nation, California is unsure to what extent Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to slash government programs such as the Affordable Care Act will be carried out. Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco and for decades a major player in state Democratic Party politics, said he did not believe California would be singled out for its support of Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a Trump jihad on California,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not so much into policy. He\u2019s into saying what he thinks people want to hear.\u201dKevin de Le\u00f3n, Senate president pro tem of California, said that his staff was not taking any chances and had begun a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of all federal programs that had an impact on California, and that it was looking at the impact that \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d would have. Kamala Harris, California\u2019s newly elected senator and a Democrat, said on Thursday that she would fight to protect immigrants and push back against Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed policies.Some mayors in the West vowed to push ahead with plans to protect salmon, to limit greenhouse gases, to feed undocumented immigrants and to outlaw discrimination against gay and transgender residents.\u201cOur agenda here in Colorado, our agenda here in Denver, does not change,\u201d said Michael B. Hancock, the mayor of Denver. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to design policies that are more inclusive. States like Colorado, cities like Denver, are ahead of the curve. We\u2019re trying to forge a future where we say, \u2018How do we not leave people behind?\u2019\u201dOther West Coast political leaders said they did not necessarily envision a war with the Trump administration and its allies but more a kind of competition for hearts and minds. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was elected to her first term in Congress on Tuesday representing part of Seattle, said that whispers of what might be called West Coast values \u2014 particularly a higher minimum wage \u2014 found echoes on Tuesday in states like Arizona that also voted for Mr. Trump.West Coast states, she said, should look for those allies and cultivate them.Voters in Colorado, Maine and Washington State also voted to raise their minimum wages.\u201cI absolutely believe that we can pull people toward this model,\u201d said Ms. Jayapal, the first Indian-American woman to serve in Congress. \u201cI think we are showing how to do things \u2014 we passed gun control legislation for the second time in three years on the ballot. We passed a statewide minimum-wage increase, the highest in the country.\u201dOn Thursday, as Mr. Trump visited the White House for the first time as president-elect, city officials in Portland, Ore., and environmental activists met to discuss a restriction on export terminals for coal, oil and other fossil fuels.\u201cRegardless of whether we have climate deniers in charge at the national government, it doesn\u2019t change the facts,\u201d said Mayor Charlie Hales of Portland. He said he was \u201cheartsick\u201d over the election, calling it a \u201cnational catastrophe.\u201d\u201cRivers flood. Droughts persist. We don\u2019t have the luxury of living in an ideological bubble on this,\u201d he said.The Obama years had given Portland a close partner in Washington. That relationship could be upended if Mr. Trump follows through on promises to cut off all federal funding for cities deemed to be \u201csanctuary cities\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Federal money flows to everything from rail lines to crime fighting to school lunch programs for poor children.\u201cWe\u2019ve built a better place, and the world is beating a path to our door,\u201d Mr. Hales said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how to feed people with or without the federal government\u2019s help.\u201dIn other liberal towns across the West, students joined protests against Mr. Trump, chanting what has now become a familiar motto, \u201cNot Our President.\u201d In Portland, some of the protests turned violent on Thursday night.In Boulder, Colo., Mrs. Clinton had a bigger win than Mr. Obama four years earlier. High school students streamed out of classes on Wednesday afternoon there to protest the election results, as they have in a several secondary schools across the West.On the pedestrian Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Heidi Ames, 41, kept a lonely vigil with a sign that said, \u201cTrump Is Not My President.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of shocked and depressed people right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to show other liberal people I\u2019m doing something. I\u2019m not just talking on Facebook.\u201dOn the day after the election, Mr. de Le\u00f3n, of the California Senate, sent out a statement written with a colleague in the Legislature that said the victory of Mr. Trump made them feel like \u201cstrangers in a foreign land.\u201dIn an interview on Thursday, Mr. de Le\u00f3n said he felt a mix of disillusionment and defiance.\u201cCalifornia has long set an example for other states to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to allow one election to reverse generations of progress.\u201dThomas Fuller reported from San Francisco, Jack Healy from Denver, and Kirk Johnson from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook, in Cross Hairs After Election, Is Said to Question Its Influence", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Late on Tuesday night, as it became clear that Donald J. Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election, a private chat sprang up on Facebook among several vice presidents and executives of the social network.What role, they asked each other, had their company played in the election\u2019s outcome?Facebook\u2019s top executives concluded that they should address the issue and assuage staff concerns at a quarterly all-hands meeting. They also called a smaller meeting with the company\u2019s policy team, according to three people who saw the private chat and are familiar with the decisions; they requested anonymity because the discussion was confidential.Some employees are worried about the spread of racist and so-called alt-right memes across the network, according to interviews with 10 current and former Facebook employees. Others are asking whether they contributed to a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d among users who largely interact with people who share the same beliefs.Even more are reassessing Facebook\u2019s role as a media company and wondering how to stop the distribution of false information. Some employees have been galvanized to send suggestions to product managers on how to improve Facebook\u2019s powerful news feed: the streams of status updates, articles, photos and videos that users typically spend the most time interacting with.This image of Facebook as a partisan influencer and distributor of bad information is at odds with how the company views itself, former and current employees said. Chris Cox, a senior vice president of product and one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s top lieutenants, has long described Facebook as an unbiased and blank canvas to give people a voice. Employees and executives genuinely believed they were well-intentioned and acting as a force for good, these people said.Facebook declined to comment beyond a previously released statement that it was \u201cjust one of many ways people received their information \u2014 and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\u201d\u201cOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cOverall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\u201dHe added: \u201cI am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\u201dInside Facebook, employees have become more aware of the company\u2019s role in media after several incidents involving content the social network displayed in users\u2019 news feeds.Both those incidents seemed to worsen a problem of fake news circulating on Facebook. The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook\u2019s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity, employees said. The \u201cnapalm girl\u201d incident reminded many insiders at Facebook of the company\u2019s often tone-deaf approach to nuanced situations.On Thursday, after a companywide meeting at Facebook, many employees said they were dissatisfied with an address from Mr. Zuckerberg, who offered comments to staff that were similar to what he has said publicly.Even in private, Mr. Zuckerberg has continued to resist the notion that Facebook can unduly affect how people think and behave. In a Facebook post circulated on Wednesday to a small group of his friends, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Zuckerberg challenged the idea that Facebook had a direct effect on the way people voted.In the three-paragraph post, the chief executive cited several statistics about low voter turnout during the election.Then Mr. Zuckerberg wrote: \u201cSo rather than focusing on strengths or weaknesses in specific demographics, or other factors that may have pushed this race in one direction or another, these stats clearly suggest what many people have said all along. Both candidates were very unpopular.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brand Awareness is the Goal at Vacheron Constantin", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byPLAN-LES-OUATES, Switzerland \u2014 Mechanical timepieces are a testament to endurance, so with longevity in the Swiss watch industry comes a great deal of prestige.By that standard, one company far surpasses the competition. Founded in 1755, Vacheron Constantin is the world\u2019s oldest continuously operating watchmaker. The accomplishment is especially impressive in light of the Swiss industry\u2019s turbulent history in the second half of the 20th century, when the advent of Japanese quartz technology put scores of mechanical watchmakers out of business.At the height of the tumult, in 1981, Juan Carlos Torres, then 25 years old, joined the company as an accountant. \u201cWe were 55 people at this time,\u201d Mr. Torres, now the brand\u2019s chief executive, recalled during a recent interview at Vacheron\u2019s headquarters in the Geneva suburb of Plan-les-Ouates. \u201cWe are close to 1,300 now. That\u2019s a different perspective, eh?\u201dThe size of the work force isn\u2019t the only thing that has changed during Mr. Torres\u2019s tenure. He has weathered two dramatic shifts in ownership: In 1988, the Ketterer family, involved with the firm for 50 years, sold it to Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a former oil minister of Saudi Arabia and an avid watch collector. The sheikh then sold the company in 1996 to the Vend\u00f4me Group, later renamed Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont, owner of such prestige watch and jewelry makers as Cartier, Jaeger-LeCoultre and Panerai.Appointed to the top post in 2005, during Vacheron Constantin\u2019s 250th anniversary, Mr. Torres, known as Charly by his colleagues, guided the company during a period of intense growth in the Swiss watch industry, spurred by the mechanical watchmaking renaissance of the 1990s. Not even the financial crisis of 2008 could dent the demand for Switzerland\u2019s high-end timepieces, exports of which peaked in 2014 at 22.3 billion Swiss francs, or $23 billion at the current exchange rate, on the strength of the Chinese market.Now, however, the Swiss industry is in the midst of its worst crisis since the 1970s, the result of issues including global currency shifts and the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on extravagant gifts for officials.In November, Richemont announced that sales at its \u201cspecialist watchmakers\u201d from April through September had fallen 17 percent, from the same period in 2015; it does not disclose sales by individual brand.\u201cIt\u2019s a crossroads for watchmaking,\u201d Mr. Torres said.However, after 35 years with Vacheron Constantin, the chief executive is convinced that change is not always the best strategy: \u201cStick to your roots, stick to your people,\u201d said Mr. Torres, a carpenter\u2019s son born in Barcelona.His one major concession to that philosophy has been a commitment to developing in-house manufacturing. \u201cWhen I was deputy C.E.O., I started a policy of verticalization,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we control all the components, all the sourcing of the brand.\u201dIn 2005, Mr. Torres initiated a 10-year-plan to have 100 percent of the company\u2019s mechanical watch production \u2014 about 25,000 pieces annually \u2014 certified with the Hallmark of Geneva, a prestigious seal bestowed on timepieces that go through a rigorous certification process to meet standards for aesthetic detail and timekeeping precision. Only mechanical watches assembled and adjusted in the Swiss canton of Geneva are eligible.The introduction of the revamped Overseas sports watch collection this year completed the move to in-house manufacturing, which required an expansion of the brand\u2019s movement components workshop in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux in 2013, as well as its factory in Plan-les-Ouates, completed in 2015.The multimillion-dollar investments reinforce Mr. Torres\u2019s long-term commitment to manufacturing independence. But they have come at a difficult time.Still, Mr. Torres said that despite the decline in sales to the Chinese mainland \u2014 Swiss exports to the region are down 9.6 percent from January to August, compared with the same period in 2015 \u2014 the Far East remains a promising market. \u201cHonestly, we are more hurt by the terrorist attacks in Europe, because Chinese are not traveling there anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they continue to buy, and, most important, they\u2019re buying more in China.\u201dAnd Mr. Torres is eager to establish a larger foothold in the United States, leading with Vacheron Constantin\u2019s presence in Los Angeles, where the brand has held several high-profile events, including a 2015 soiree at the Pacific Palisades home of the television producer Ben Silverman and a cocktail party at the Peninsula Hotel in September, co-hosted by the watch website Hodinkee.\u201cWe started in Los Angeles three years ago, selling not only to Chinese but to big collectors, people who have a lot of money, especially in I.T.,\u201d Mr. Torres said. \u201cThese Facebook guys, they all want to have something tangible, not virtual.\u201dDespite the buzz around the revamped Overseas line \u2014 introduced in 1996, the sporty wristwatch is Vacheron\u2019s rejoinder to Patek Philippe\u2019s Nautilus and Audemars Piguet\u2019s Royal Oak \u2014 the brand has forged much of its reputation in America through its Patrimony collection of classic dress watches.While many Swiss brands are introducing more accessibly priced models to woo younger buyers, Mr. Torres insists that Vacheron will never produce a quartz-regulated or steel Patrimony while he\u2019s at the helm. He said that the brand, which carries an entry price of $14,900 (for the customizable Quai de l\u2019Ile model), performs best in the $30,000 to $60,000 range and that timepieces \u201cabove $200,000 are very well accepted.\u201dThe elaborate watch represents everything Mr. Torres has achieved at Vacheron Constantin: \u201cHe brought everyone together under one roof, making proper movements, proper complications, proper design and style,\u201d said Alexander Linz, founder of Watch-Insider.com. \u201cBut the next big challenges are to bring all these messages to the end consumer, to make them believe in the story of Vacheron Constantin and believe in the link between the future and past.\u201dMr. Torres acknowledges that the biggest task before him is driving awareness of the brand, which lags behind its rivals in consumer recognition. \u201cAll these efforts will take time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you can take eight years to create a watch, you can wait five years to increase awareness.\u201d After all, endurance is Vacheron Constantin\u2019s strong suit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple\u2019s App Store in recent weeks \u2014 just in time to deceive holiday shoppers.The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard\u2019s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a barrage of fake apps,\u201d said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time.Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless \u2014 essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said.But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information.The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple\u2019s process for reviewing every app before it is published.That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google\u2019s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company\u2019s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers.In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them.With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pok\u00e9mon Company, among others.\u201cIt\u2019s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,\u201d he said.\u201cWe strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. \u201cWe\u2019ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We\u2019ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.\u201dIn September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove \u201capps that no longer function as intended, don\u2019t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.\u201d The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing.Despite Apple\u2019s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple\u2019s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered.\u201cIt\u2019s a game of Whac-a-Mole,\u201d Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said.Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients.\u201cWe hope that our clients are all official sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services.\u201dMr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi \u2014 about $3,000 \u2014 for an app written in English.But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook\u2019s campus in Menlo Park, Calif.In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have \u201ctens of employees\u201d at the Facebook address.China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts.Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, \u201cOur angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday.\u201dData from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. \u201cWould give zero stars if possible,\u201d wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. \u201cConstantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.\u201dMr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands.\u201cThe retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,\u201d he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard\u2019s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps.But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real.The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store \u2014 including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear.Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume.Some of the fake apps have even used Apple\u2019s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store.Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple\u2019s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google\u2019s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said.But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pok\u00e9mon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available.\u201cThe criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,\u201d Mr. Clay said.Emily Feng contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reviving Fears for a New Generation of Watch Fans", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWhen Nicholas Bowman-Scargill\u2019s mother made a joke at a Sunday lunch about restarting the family\u2019s 170-year-old Fears watch business, he laughed. The company closed 60 years ago, and its revival wasn\u2019t something he had thought much about.\u201cIt was my eureka moment,\u201d Mr. Bowman-Scargill, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019d been working at Rolex for two and a half years, and although I was enjoying working in the workshop, I have always wanted to try my own thing and create my own company.\u201d He was sitting in the office at his home, a 1920s townhouse on a gated cul-de-sac in the London Docklands, in early September, just days before the first 200 watches were delivered.\u201cIt would have been easy to have a modern watch and stick the name Fears on it, but there would have been something very inauthentic about that,\u201d said Mr. Bowman-Scargill, the great-great-great grandson of Edwin Fear, who established the company in 1846 in Bristol, England.Instead, the quartz Redcliff Date combines the old and the new, designed, he said, to appeal to his millennial peers. The name Redcliff refers to the street where the company was originally located, and Mr. Bowman-Scargill has added a date window at the 3 o\u2019clock position. \u201cI was keen to find a name that everything could come from,\u201d he said, noting, \u201cI started with a date because I can\u2019t wear a watch without a date. The date is one of the most useful features.\u201dHe designed the dial on a computer, adapting it from vintage Fears watches found on eBay, like the blue model from the 1940s that he wears daily. They come in classic white or shiny teal blue, since \u201cblue isn\u2019t as formal as black but is still smart \u2014 with teal being more distinctive than navy,\u201d he said. The hands, which end in small arrowheads similar to those on the original watch, were created through the Swiss company that manufactures the timepieces. (Mr. Bowman-Scargill said the company wanted to remain anonymous for commercial reasons.)Interchangeable leather straps come in the same teal blue, as well as in red, tan, mink brown and the traditional black. \u201cSo you can wear the watch with a suit or jeans and T-shirt,\u201d he said.Mr. Bowman-Scargill\u2019s experience as a Rolex watchmaker\u2019s assistant and quick-service technician helped him shape his new company. He said the watches will have consistent elements \u2014 like the arrow-tipped hands \u2014 \u201cso in 10 years\u2019 time you can recognize a Fears watch.\u201d And he has created several after-sales services, such as battery supplies, repairs and engraving, that he hopes will keep customers coming back.Mr. Bowman-Scargill said the brand\u2019s history has been a bonus: \u201cBefore I had a physical watch, I had a story to tell, which has started conversations, either in the pub or with suppliers, as it elevates the watch from an idea to there actually being something behind it,.\u201dLucy Cheesewright, the director of SalonQP, agreed. \u201cI brought the brand in because of the story rather than the specifics of the watches,\u201d she said.But Mr. Bowman-Scargill acknowledged that hitting the right blend of heritage and modernity was like walking a tightrope.\u201cI had to decide how much of the heritage I use \u2014 as what is interesting to me, might not actually be interesting to anyone else,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI wanted to create a watch with its own personality, otherwise it\u2019s stuck in the past.

She demonstrated some floor stretches, though she herself could not do them with perfect alignment on the right. \u201cThat\u2019s my side with the hip replacement,\u201d she said, fiddling with a large clip-on earring that had popped off.\u201cI\u2019m 50 years younger than her, and her schedule exhausts me,\u201d said Teresa Kay-Aba Kennedy who (along with Janie Sykes Kennedy) was an author with Ms. Porchon-Lynch of the memoir \u201cDancing Light: The Spiritual Side of Being Through the Eyes of a Modern Yoga Master.\u201dThe night before, Ms. Porchon-Lynch and Ms. Kay-Aba Kennedy had returned from California, where Ms. Porchon-Lynch headlined an event for Athleta, an athleisure brand owned by Gap Inc., at its store at the Grove in Los Angeles. She also did a photo shoot for the label.Perhaps more than any other physical regimen, yoga has gotten tremendous public-relations benefit from social media. The images of women and men wrapped into graceful, gravity-defying poses are arresting and highly shareable in the visual worlds of Facebook and Instagram.The result is a new subset of professional instructors: the yogalebrity who makes much of her living on the road, not unlike a small-time rock star, appearing at retreats and conferences, posting inspirational quotes fashioned in flowery Pinterest-friendly fonts, and pictures of inner peace found through arm balances or legs over one\u2019s head.Athleta will feature Ms. Porchon-Lynch in its January catalog and in its new \u201cPower of She\u201d campaign. \u201cT\u00e4o aligns perfectly with our mission,\u201d said Nancy Green, the Athleta president. \u201cWe are working hard to break stereotypes of what youth and wellness means.\u201dMs. Porchon-Lynch is an avid traveler, who in a few weeks will head to the Berkshires to lead a workshop at Kripalu, and then to Hawaii for another in Maui.When she was 8, she walked to the beach and spotted young boys making silly shapes with their bodies. \u201cI thought it was a new game,\u201d Ms. Porchon-Lynch said. \u201cI went to my aunt and said, \u2018Can they let me be part of it?\u2019 And she said: \u2018That isn\u2019t a game, it is yoga and it\u2019s not for girls. It\u2019s not ladylike.\u2019 So I started doing it.\u201dThe far-flung stories of her life that Ms. Porchon-Lynch tells render her as something of a Zelig figure, from India to Britain to Hollywood. She supplies details and dates with a young person\u2019s mental clarity, and loaded her memoir with photographic evidence.When she was 12, she said, she came home to find \u201ca little man sitting on the floor\u201d and saw visitors bowing to him. Then, she said, her uncle told her to pack a suitcase and they spent a few weeks traveling and marching with Mahatma Gandhi.In the World War II years, she landed in London, having fled India after her family came under Nazi suspicion for hiding British and French expatriates. There, she said, she met No\u00ebl Coward when she was working as a dancer in nightclubs.\u201cI didn\u2019t speak English that well and he taught me to say, \u2018I presume that your presumptions are precisely incorrectly, your sarcastic insinuations too obnoxious to be appreciated,\u2019\u201d Ms. Porchon-Lynch said, sitting on a bench in the yoga room at the Fred Astaire studio. She then repeated the line, verbatim. \u201cThat was in 1940,\u201d she said.\u201cShe sees things in people they don\u2019t see in themselves,\u201d said Susan Douglass, 61, a trademark lawyer who began studying yoga with Ms. Porchon-Lynch in 1999. \u201cHer students love her. She has a large band of students who would do anything for her.\u201dMs. Porchon-Lynch showed up for the shoot in a red ballroom dancer\u2019s flamenco dress and high heels. He questioned her choice to wear spikes to a park, and she told him she only wears high heels. \u201cShe said they helped elevate her consciousness,\u201d said Mr. Sturman, who ended up carrying her through the muddy park.With her social media cred firmly established, Ms. Porchon-Lynch began fielding invitations to yoga festivals and retreats from Bosnia to Dubai. \u201cI am invited all over the world!\u201d she said.Joann Burnham, a founder of the annual Nantucket Yoga Festival, asked Ms. Porchon-Lynch to lead workshops at the event in 2014, after she heard about her from James Miller, who had hosted her at the Iowa City Yoga Festival.\u201cAt this point, you can\u2019t have a yoga festival and not invite T\u00e4o,\u201d said Ms. Burnham, who dedicates a whole weekend to \u201cT\u00e4o workshops\u201d at Dharma Yoga Nantucket, the studio she owns with her husband. \u201cBeing in her presence and seeing the expectations of what someone would think about someone who is 98, and seeing all those expectations squashed, is so incredible.\u201dThough Ms. Porchon-Lynch lives by herself, she most often travels with companions.Ms. Douglass accompanied her on several trips to workshops in the last few years. Almost always, she said, Ms. Porchon-Lynch is recognized by strangers on the street and in airports by people who ask her to pose for cellphone snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s like going around with a celebrity,\u201d Ms. Douglass said.And yet the lines of lived experience on Ms. Porchon-Lynch\u2019s face, and the expression of peace and vivacity in her eyes, are powerful reminders that the practice is about more than clicks.\u201cIt\u2019s like being a rock star, it\u2019s one in a hundred-thousand chance,\u201d Ms. Kamm said. \u201cI think that people were so hungry for someone to look up to who wasn\u2019t a young, skinny, blond yogi in a bra top.

{"Headline": "\u2018Fantastic Beasts\u2019 Is a Hit for Warner Bros.", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling pulled off an exceptionally difficult magic trick over the weekend. Not only did they bring the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film franchise back to life, they also did it without Harry Potter.At the weekend\u2019s start, it was unclear how Harry Potter fans would react to \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d which Ms. Rowling (writing her first screenplay) based on her 2001 creature compendium of the same name \u2014 one of Harry Potter\u2019s textbooks, as the mythology goes. But \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d does not feature any of the same central characters, and it takes place in 1926 New York instead of present-day Britain.\u201cThat speaks volumes about the future of this franchise \u2014 about reaching a new generation of fans,\u201d Sue Kroll, Warner\u2019s president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said by phone on Sunday morning.\u201cWe knew we had a lot to live up to with this movie,\u201d continued Ms. Kroll, fresh off a plane from China, where \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d will roll out in the days ahead. \u201cPeople have enormously warm memories of those earlier Harry Potter movies. So we are very, very happy with the way that audiences responded to this completely fresh and original story. We are now set up beautifully for a very long run.\u201d\u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d couldn\u2019t match the heights of a B-list comic book character?Ms. Rowling\u2019s new wizards and witches also faced inevitable comparisons with the eight Harry Potter movies that Warner released between 2001 and 2011. The lowest opening among those films \u2014 each adapted from a smash-hit novel \u2014 was for \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d which collected about $90 million (after adjusting for inflation) over its first three days in North American theaters.Part of Warner\u2019s goal with \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d was to reposition Ms. Rowling\u2019s wizarding world as a limitless movie universe. Ms. Kroll\u2019s team introduced the first trailer for the new film last December. Five more trailers and featurettes followed. Marketing also included extensive partnerships with Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Google, Amazon and China\u2019s Weibo.It was a delicate line to walk: Warner used snippets of music from the original Harry Potter movies and invoked the boy wizard\u2019s name in certain marketing materials, but was careful not to create overt connections that did not exist in the movie \u2014 something that studios often do with franchise spinoffs, much to the displeasure of fans.Ms. Rowling\u2019s publisher, Scholastic, also expects a \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d bump. The screenplay, for instance, was published in book form on Friday. \u201cAny new story from J. K. Rowling is an event, lifting sales and interest in the backlist books,\u201d Ellie Berger, president of Scholastic Trade, said in a phone interview last week. More than 450 million copies of Ms. Rowling\u2019s books have been sold worldwide.The \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d screenplay, Ms. Berger said, should deliver \u201cstrong, sustained\u201d sales. \u201cWe know there is just tremendous interest,\u201d she added.Three other movies arrived in wide release at domestic theaters over the weekend, and each was trampled.Also bombing was \u201cBleed for This\u201d (Open Road), a boxing drama starring Miles Teller that collected just $2.4 million. Open Road paid a reported $4 million for distribution rights. Faring slightly better was \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen\u201d (STX), a teenage comedic drama starring Hailee Steinfeld and produced by James L. Brooks on a slim budget of $9 million. It arrived to $4.8 million in ticket sales.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michigan Voters Say Trump Could See Their Problems \u2018Right Off the Bat\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWARREN, Mich. \u2014 This state was one of the biggest upsets in last week\u2019s jolting election, going narrowly to Donald J. Trump and giving the Republican Party its first victory in a presidential race here since 1988.In Macomb County, just north of Detroit, where the term \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d was coined after white autoworkers abandoned the party for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, Mr. Trump captured 53.6 percent of the vote, compared with 47.6 percent statewide, according to preliminary results. Many of his supporters here were blue-collar Obama voters who saw modern-day Republicans as out of touch with their interests until Mr. Trump, with his brash outsider message, came along.Chris Vitale, a longtime Chrysler employee and United Auto Workers member, supported Barack Obama twice, as did his union and his county. But on Tuesday, Mr. Vitale rejected the U.A.W.\u2019s choice, Hillary Clinton, and voted with gusto for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe Republicans that generally get run are anti-manufacturing, anti-Midwest,\u201d said Mr. Vitale, 44, of St. Clair Shores, explaining why he rejected Mitt Romney in 2012 and Senator John McCain in 2008. \u201cMr. Trump understood our problems right off the bat, without being told by anyone.\u201dMacomb County\u2019s autoworkers were hardly alone in gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Patricia Meadows, a retired waitress, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 because she liked him, she said, and was hopeful about his health care law. But this time around, Ms. Meadows had no use for Mrs. Clinton or any candidate who had spent time in the nation\u2019s capital. Mr. Trump was the lesser of two evils because he was \u201cnot so political,\u201d she said.\u201cI think everybody in Washington needs a kick in the rear,\u201d Ms. Meadows, 68, said on Thursday as she ate fried fish at a diner in Warren, a weathered city at the county\u2019s southern end. \u201cAnd I think Washington needs to be done with the Clintons.\u201dShe added, however, that she hoped Mr. Trump would not \u201cdo away with the health care\u201d \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 as he had promised on the campaign trail. Her daughter had obtained subsidized insurance coverage through the law for $50 a month.\u201cI think he was bluffing,\u201d Ms. Meadows said with a frown.Mayor James R. Fouts of Warren said Trump supporters here were especially motivated by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to overturn or overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs to Mexico. All year, Mr. Trump has attacked Ford Motor Company in particular for planning to move all of its small car production to Mexico.Noting that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also criticized free trade agreements when he ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary race, Mr. Fouts said that some who normally vote Democrat in Macomb County had initially supported Mr. Sanders and migrated to Mr. Trump only after Mrs. Clinton became the Democratic nominee.\u201cThere were a significant number of Sanders people who made the transition to Trump,\u201d said Mr. Fouts, whose office is nonpartisan. \u201cBernie might have won here; Joe Biden might have won. But Hillary was never going to be the candidate to convince people around here that she was going to make a difference in their lives.\u201dMr. Fouts voted for Mr. Obama twice. But this time he rejected both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump for a third-party candidate \u2014 which one, he would not say.The last time the county backed a Republican presidential candidate was in 2004.Mr. Trump may also have energized a segment of Macomb County voters who had not bothered to participate in the 2012 election. Voter turnout in the county was 4 percent higher this year, according to preliminary results, with 67 percent of registered voters casting ballots. On the other hand, some of the state\u2019s most heavily Democratic counties, including Wayne, home to Detroit, and Genesee, home to Flint, saw less turnout than four years ago.Amanda Rogers, a bartender in Warren, sat out the 2012 election but hustled to the polls to vote for Mr. Trump. Her boyfriend and her brother voted for the first time in their lives, she said. Ms. Rogers, 34, was motivated in part by what she saw as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lenient stance on immigration.\u201cWe are drowning right now,\u201d she said. \u201cOur vets are homeless. There\u2019s one out of every five American children starving right now. And Clinton wants to open the floodgates and let everybody else in.\u201dMs. Rogers, who said she had \u201cloved Bill Clinton as a president\u201d and found Mr. Obama \u201call right,\u201d added: \u201cThere\u2019s people who\u2019ve been here 12 years who don\u2019t even care to learn the language but want to reap all the benefits of this country: food stamps, free health care, Section 8 housing, welfare checks. People are sick of that, especially in Macomb County.\u201dMuslims from places like Yemen and Bangladesh are the most visible immigrants here. Just south of Macomb County is Hamtramck, which in one generation went from overwhelmingly Polish Catholic to majority Muslim. In Macomb, the City of Sterling Heights, home to a large Ford plant, is facing a federal lawsuit after rejecting a proposed mosque last year.Mr. Trump held a rally last Sunday in Sterling Heights, where he elicited boos against Mrs. Clinton when he said she wanted \u201cvirtually unlimited immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world,\u201d and would \u201cimport generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and your communities.\u201dMacomb County, though still largely white, is becoming more diverse: 82.3 percent of its 865,000 residents were white in 2015, according to the Census Bureau, down from 85.4 percent in 2010. The black population grew to 11.4 percent, from 8.6 percent. About 10 percent of the population is foreign born.Many here also complain that poverty and crime are growing. As Macomb helped assure Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on Election Day, it also played a major role in the defeat of a local ballot initiative that would have taxed its residents, and those of four neighboring counties, to build a public transportation system connecting Detroit and its suburbs.Jason Powrozek, 18, a high school senior from New Baltimore, on the more affluent north side of the county, said he had voted against the transportation measure because \u201cI just felt it would speed up the transport of drugs up here from the inner city.\u201d A first-time voter, he had volunteered for at the county Republican headquarters and went to New York for the Trump campaign\u2019s election night party.\u201cHe tells it like it is,\u201d Jason said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe speaks what people don\u2019t want to say because it\u2019s politically incorrect.\u201dMr. Trump also spoke on Halloween at Macomb Community College.Frank Pitcher, 49, who lives in Sterling Heights and has worked at its Ford plant for 23 years, went to the Trump rally there and said he was surprised at how many of his co-workers he saw.\u201cI took some pictures with people there and posted on my Facebook because I wasn\u2019t going to hide how I was voting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of where I stand.\u201dBrittany Greeson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Yanukovych is now expected to testify on Monday.At the news conference, Mr. Yanukovych and his lawyer accused the Ukrainian government of deliberately dragging out the trial in order to prevent him from telling an alternative version of what had happened.

{"Headline": "Facebook Will Stop Some Ads From Targeting Users by Race", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byAs Facebook has grown, so too has its ability to slice and dice the habits of its hundreds of millions of users, and offer them up to advertisers that want to reach specific groups for specific reasons.But while the social network has evolved to the point that it can target audiences as narrow as 18-to-24-year-old men in Connecticut who are in long-distance relationships, it has also created tools that allowed advertisers to discriminate against Americans in ways that were outlawed in the 1960s.Facebook responded on Friday to concern that it was violating anti-discrimination laws, announcing that marketers placing housing, employment or credit ads on the social network would no longer be able to use tools that target people by ethnicity.The decision casts a perhaps unwelcome spotlight on what Facebook calls its \u201cethnic affinity marketing solution,\u201d which is still available for use outside the areas of housing, employment and credit advertising.One of Facebook\u2019s main draws for marketers is how narrowly it lets them target messages to its users. Ads can be sent to people based not only on standard demographics like age, gender and location, but also on a bevy of other factors, like whether they have an anniversary coming, their interest in horseback riding, whether they use Gmail or Hotmail, and the languages they speak. Users can also be excluded from seeing ads based on this data.While much of this information is provided voluntarily by users, ethnic affinity is one demographic offered to marketers that users cannot choose, but it is instead assigned based on their interests and activities on Facebook. That includes page likes, group memberships and friendships, the company said. You can list your religious views and languages on your Facebook profile, but you cannot self-identify as, say, Asian-American.On Facebook\u2019s ad-buying website, however, advertisers can choose to include or exclude certain demographic \u201caffinities\u201d from ads in the United States. For instance, they can exclude African-American, Asian-American and four \u201ctypes\u201d of Hispanic \u2014 bilingual, English-dominant, Spanish-dominant or all of the above. Facebook lists the number of people who match those affinities within its ads tool.For example, if an advertiser wants to reach Americans ages 18 and up on Facebook, the company indicates that there are 26 million people with the \u201cethnic affinity\u201d of African-American. The company confirmed that because the assignment is based on activity, a white person could be targeted as African-American and vice versa.ProPublica, for its article last month, bought an ad targeting Facebook users who were house hunting, and excluded people with an \u201caffinity\u201d for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people. The publication showed the ad to a civil rights lawyer, who called it a \u201cblatant\u201d violation of the Fair Housing Act.On Friday, Facebook declined to disclose the number of housing, credit and employment ads placed using ethnic affinity targeting. The company brought in roughly $18 billion in revenue last year, almost all of it from advertising.In her blog post, Ms. Egan wrote that this type of targeting \u201cgives brands a way to reach multicultural audiences with more relevant advertising.\u201d In addition to tools that will disable ethnic affinity marketing for housing, employment or credit ads, Facebook will \u201crequire advertisers to affirm that they will not engage in discriminatory advertising\u201d on the site and offer them information so they \u201cunderstand their obligations with respect to housing, employment and credit.\u201dAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York State attorney general, said its civil rights bureau \u201cinquired about Facebook\u2019s practices and, while we are still reviewing them, we are pleased to see this positive step by the company.\u201dYvette D. Clarke, one of the members of Congress who called on Facebook to change its ad policy, commended the decision and took the opportunity to rap Silicon Valley\u2019s knuckles for its lack of racial and gender diversity.\u201cTo avoid these problems in the future, I urge Facebook and other technology companies to address the lack of diversity in the ranks of their leadership and staff by recruiting and retaining people of color and women,\u201d Ms. Clarke said in a statement.This is hardly the first time Facebook has received intense scrutiny over its ad-targeting practices. In 2013, Facebook paid $20 million to settle a class-action lawsuit against the company for sharing data with advertisers about users\u2019 \u201clikes\u201d without asking permission. The same year, a lawsuit accused the company of scanning users\u2019 private messages on the network and using the information for advertising purposes. In September of this year, a federal judge in California ruled against a bid to certify the case as a class-action lawsuit.The changes to Facebook\u2019s ethnic marketing tool will very likely deal a difficult blow to the company\u2019s longstanding boasts about its superior ad-targeting capabilities, especially in the face of competitors like Google, Twitter and Snapchat. Shares of Facebook closed down 1.5 percent on Friday.Advertisement"}

How she \u2014 and he \u2014 rebuild their lives, together and apart, is what makes \u201cLove Warrior\u201d so riveting.The best-selling memoir, which was also an Oprah\u2019s Book Club pick, begins with her descent \u2014 and her fall is precipitous. \u201cBulimia is my safe, deadly hiding place,\u201d she recalls. She was 10 years old when she started to binge and purge. \u201cEach night, I bring two cups to bed with me \u2014 one filled with food and one to fill with vomit.\u201d Later, when she is an adult, even a job teaching third grade doesn\u2019t slow down the self-destruction. She spends the first half of the day sobering up from the night before. She\u2019s still \u201ca good teacher,\u201d she writes. \u201cMy love for my students is my grip on the world. I lose that grip every day after dismissal when I drive out of the school parking lot and toward the grocery store to pick up two huge bottles of wine.\u201dShe finds solace in church, but is frustrated that it closes just when bars are opening up. \u201cThe priest clears his throat and tells me it\u2019s time to go,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI beg, \u2018At night? Why do you close at night? That\u2019s when people need to come.\u2019\u200a\u201dAfter she gets married, sobers up and starts a family, the news of her husband\u2019s betrayal, when it comes, is overwhelming: \u201cHe looks away from me and starts talking. The first words he says are, \u2018There have been other women. They\u2019ve all been one-night stands. The first was a few months after our wedding.\u2019 I stop breathing.\u201dIt can be easier to write your secrets than to say them. Anyone who has ever scrawled the words \u201cDo you like me? Check yes or no,\u201d on a slip of paper and passed it to a classmate in elementary school knows this. Melton first finds the courage to tell her truth in a blog: \u201cThere is no way to be as honest in spoken words as I can be in written words. I wonder why it\u2019s so much easier to be honest with strangers than with family.\u201d So there is something particularly special about listening to her narrate the audiobook version of \u201cLove Warrior\u201d; the experience is a little like being holed up with a friend on a girls\u2019 getaway weekend and hearing her spill that, despite the Facebook posts and holiday cards you\u2019ve shared for years, there\u2019s a lot more to her story. She tells you how she fought for her marriage and, most importantly, fought for herself. Listening to the audiobook, one feels even more powerfully that Melton is not merely relaying a narrative; she is offering her story with the hope and purpose of connection. \u201cIn all my close friendships, words are the bricks I use to build bridges,\u201d she says. \u201cTo know someone I need to hear her, and to feel known, I need to be heard by her. The process of knowing and loving another person happens for me through conversation.\u201dYou may not listen to \u201cLove Warrior\u201d all at once, but it offers the best of what audiobooks can do: It slows the narrative down and draws you in close, as if the author is talking to you, and only to you. You can\u2019t skim or skip pages the way you can with a printed book, so you don\u2019t miss a word. At seven and a half hours, \u201cLove Warrior\u201d can be finished in a weekend or during a week\u2019s commute. Even after all the book\u2019s success, I know there are some who might find the title and the touchy-feely subject off-putting. To them I would say this: Listening to such a warm and emotionally intelligent author is a worthy investment in a course on difficult conversations, if nothing else. But I suspect that if you give in to the possibility that this book has real wisdom, what will win you over is \u2014 to use Melton\u2019s words \u2014 all the \u201cterrible magic\u201d that happens when things fall apart.Veronica Chambers is the editor of \u201cThe Meaning of Michelle: 16 Writers on Our Iconic First Lady and How Her Journey Inspires Our Own,\u201d which will be published in January.

Many have marched or plan to march; many more are searching for something constructive to do and weighing the value of symbolic gestures. Some mothers in Brooklyn said they were thinking about a transcontinental hand-holding \u2014 palms clutched from Cobble Hill to Santa Monica \u2014 but actions like these are as likely to invite accusations of liberal cluelessness as they are to change minds about the deportation of undocumented immigrants.In the age of Instagram activism, it is not necessarily a simple thing to tell the earnest do-gooder from the self-promoter, particularly when history has just made it clear that social-media celebrity is the path to world domination. Within the professional political class, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, both Democrats, now seem to be elevating their longstanding rivalry to one for the role of progressive opponent in chief. In the days immediately following the election, the mayor tweeted, and emailed, and tried to comfort.On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio met with the president-elect at Trump Tower and then held a news conference in which he proceeded to recount the concerns he had raised \u2014 about a rolling back of Wall Street regulations, tax cuts for the wealthy, rising fears among immigrants, the prospect of increased conflict between the police and the people they serve \u2014 without divulging anything of Mr. Trump\u2019s responses. A spate of television appearances followed, as well as the announcement of a speech planned for next week at Cooper Union.Asked about the potential effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s high-security presence on Fifth Avenue, near major businesses like Gucci and Tiffany, Mr. de Blasio offered that those stores weren\u2019t his \u201ccentral concerns in life,\u201d as if the tax and tourist revenue they generated for the city were dismissible in the face of the good sound bite he could produce by deriding luxury brands.Later in the day, the mayor sent out a Twitter storm repeating everything he had already said. Then, using his re-election campaign letterhead, he sent out an email (\u201cSisters and Brothers,\u201d it began) asking New Yorkers to share their thoughts and feelings with him about the coming four years of a Trump administration, as though the answers weren\u2019t obvious.It is hard to imagine the outcome of this election as anything other than a net political positive for both the governor and the mayor, in the same way that the dullest colleagues can suddenly seem a lot better once you realize that all you have is one another, and a new boss who seems unhinged. Mr. de Blasio had been facing a campaign for re-election next year in a climate in which white voters, particularly in the brownstone Brooklyn precincts that first elected him, were disaffected by his performance.EMAIL bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Trump has intensified their whiplash. After a year in the Maryland suburbs, having arrived with their four children as refugees from Iraq, they find themselves comparing the threats they fled with those that might still emerge.They did not sleep on election night after watching television coverage of the results.They are \u201cvery afraid and worried,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli said on Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this will mean.\u201dActs of hate and intimidation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, occurred across the country during the campaign, and have increased significantly since Mr. Trump was declared the president-elect. But the back and forth between acceptance and rejection can be particularly confusing for new arrivals like the Lalqaraghulis.Their new home of Dundalk is an inner-ring suburb of Baltimore, one of the many working-class communities where the nation\u2019s battles over identity have become most intense. It was once a lively hub of workers filing into plants for Bethlehem Steel, General Motors and other manufacturing giants. Now it is dominated by strip malls.Ra\u2019ad Lalqaraghuli said he was initially eager to call it home.\u201cWhen I arrived in America, I was so happy,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli, 43, said. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream country for my children.\u201dHe\u2019d had experiences with Americans before. A graduate of Mosul University, in 2004 he began working as a group engineer for American contractors and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to help rebuild his country after the American invasion.A promotion to project manager in 2009 led to his overseeing the construction of water treatment plants and several schools in Baghdad and two cities south of the capital, Nasiriya and Basra.But his work for the Americans also brought him unwanted attention from terrorist groups. He spent one winter sleeping outside in the forest, to keep himself hidden, while his wife and children stayed with her family.Militants from the Islamic State abducted two of his younger brothers and one older brother instead. \u201cThey said, \u2018In exchange for you, we\u2019ll give them back.\u2019\u201d He and his father didn\u2019t believe them, and the three brothers were killed.His work on behalf of the United States government made him and his family eligible for humanitarian protection under special immigrant visas.Lawyers in New York supported his application, and he received approval quickly. Then, last year, a militia bombed the family home.\u201cI lost everything,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli said.At the Baghdad airport, heading to the United States, he still worried that he was being followed. All he had was his plane ticket, his passport, $100, and his wife and four children.\u201cThe people who enter this country as refugees are fleeing from terrorism,\u201d she said. \u201cThey cannot live in a place with violence.\u201dShe added of the message posted on the family\u2019s door, \u201cNot only is a note like this horrifying, it should be deeply embarrassing for every American that this family was threatened, because the reason they are in this country is because he was of service to our country.\u201dAdvocates \u2014 like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is helping the family \u2014 say that many refugee families are reluctant to come forward when they become victims of hate crimes because they fear a greater backlash.But after the note appeared \u2014 with a crude drawing of a woman in a hijab \u2014 Mr. Lalqaraghuli notified the police, telling an officer in the neighborhood who happened to be on a foot patrol near his apartment.The police said that the note had been written by a 14-year-old neighbor, and that officers had talked to her and her parents but determined that no crime had been committed.The neighbor\u2019s family did not respond to a message requesting comment.Criminal or not, the episode was enough to stir up a response \u2014 an effort to counter intolerance.Alta Haywood, a retired teacher who lives in Perry Hall, Md., sent the family a towering fruit basket and included a note that read in part, \u201cI sincerely hope that other people in the area show you that they can be kind and accepting.\u201dAnother gift-giver, Dr. Lindsay Fitch, said the news of what had happened to the family \u201cjust grabbed me more personally.\u201d While talking to her two children about it, she said, she decided to send the family the most American of welcomes: a home-baked apple pie and a pumpkin pie.Included in her card were a photograph of her family and an invitation to have their families get together. \u201cI wanted to welcome you to the Baltimore area,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are a lot of people here who want to welcome you with open arms. Hopefully, you\u2019ll find that welcome. Remember us when you encounter ugliness.\u201dMr. Lalqaraghuli, who works as a driver, said he greatly appreciated the outpouring of support.But after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, he said, it is hard to trust that acceptance will emerge as the country\u2019s dominant force.He missed two weeks of work after the note was left, because, he said, his children felt safer when he was around. His youngest, Abdullah, 5, no longer sleeps in his own room. He joins his parents instead.\u201cBecause he sees when militias come to my home, they come with the weapons,\u201d Mr. Lalqaraghuli said.He was referring to their life in Baghdad. But as soon as possible, he said, his family will be looking to move out of Dundalk and start fresh in another town or state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Floats an Olive Branch: Might Keep Parts of the Health Law", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byPresident-elect Donald J. Trump overhauled his transition team from top to bottom on Friday, expanded his outreach to more establishment Republicans, and even offered an olive branch to President Obama \u2014 albeit a narrow one.On the other side, Democrats signaled they would move left in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s narrow-but-startling defeat, and the president-elect\u2019s legal antagonist, Gloria Allred, made it clear that neither she nor many of the women who have accused him of sexual assault are going anywhere.Join us again on Monday for continuing live updates on the transition to the 45th presidency of the United States.Mr. Trump said Friday that, after talking with President Obama this week, he might be willing to leave in place parts of the Affordable Care Act once he\u2019s in office.But in the interview, Mr. Trump said he told the president that he would consider keeping two provisions of the law: the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of a patient\u2019s pre-existing condition; and the one that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance plans until they turn 26.The problem: Without a mandate for everyone to buy health insurance, the popular pre-existing condition provision could send insurance companies into a tailspin, because their costs would rise with sicker customers, and that would not be offset by healthy consumers forced to buy insurance.Mr. Trump said in an interview to be shown on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday that Mrs. Clinton \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been nicer\u201d in a congratulatory call she made to concede the election, and that Bill Clinton had complimented him on \u201cone of the most amazing\u201d presidential runs he had ever seen.\u201cIt was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her \u2014 I mean, I can imagine, tougher for her than it would have been for me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, \u2018Congratulations, Donald, well done.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump, who on Thursday said he would seek Mr. Obama\u2019s counsel about the presidency, said he would consider asking for Mr. Clinton\u2019s as well.Mr. Trump also promised that there would be no lapse in health insurance for millions of Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act when he repeals and replaces the law.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it simultaneously \u2014 it\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff. We\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. And we\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing.\u201dMr. Trump has quietly reached out to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who took an impassioned stand against Mr. Trump during the campaign.The call came after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory on Tuesday night, according to two people briefed on it, although it was unclear how it went and what was said.Aides to Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney did not respond to requests for comment.With her eye on the right\u2019s Paula Jones legal crusade of the 1990s, Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer representing women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, is trying to lure the president-elect into a legal battle before he takes office.Ms. Allred challenged Mr. Trump on Friday to retract his threat to sue his accusers for defaming him and suggested that she might bring a case against him if he refused. She also said that she was prepared to countersue if Mr. Trump made good on the threat.Ms. Allred cited a precedent for suing a sitting president: Ms. Jones.\u201cObviously the lawsuit against President Clinton by Paula Jones did proceed while he was in office for actions that were alleged to take place prior to his becoming president,\u201d she said.The Jones case forced Mr. Clinton into a deposition that resulted in his impeachment on charges of lying under oath about an affair with an intern.A sobbing Ms. Zervos sat next to Ms. Allred and offered her own solution: \u201cWhat happened to a good, old-fashioned I\u2019m sorry?\u201dGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is under a cloud after two aides were convicted of conspiring to shut down traffic on the George Washington Bridge in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, moves aside.Mr. Trump told advisers that he wanted Mr. Pence\u2019s Washington experience and contacts. An executive committee, which will include members of Congress, will advise Mr. Pence as the process moves forward.See the full story.Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager and then went to work for CNN, even as he continued to consult with the campaign, resigned Friday from his political commentator role, the network confirmed.Mr. Lewandowski is expected to take a position in the Trump administration.He was seen in Trump Tower on Wednesday immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, chatting with senior aides and attending meetings. Mr. Lewandowski did not return calls for comment.Mr. Lewandowski was viewed as a controversial appointment by the network; he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Trump that prevented him from criticizing the candidate publicly, and he was still being paid by the campaign while working for CNN.Two former governors, Howard Dean of Vermont and Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, also expressed interest Friday in being the party\u2019s new committee chairman.So much for a warm welcome to Washington.Groups on social media are trying to coordinate a Million Woman March the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in protest of the new president. The march will go from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21 to show \u201cstrength, power and courage.\u201d Men are also encouraged to attend.\u201cNo woman is free unless all women are free,\u201d the organizers of the march wrote on the Facebook page where it is being organized.State groups for the march have already been formed for people to coordinate travel to the capital. However, some fear that the idea could become a logistical nightmare coming so close to Inauguration Day because of the lack of hotel rooms and the potential for clashes with Trump supportersAmong the president-elect\u2019s most pressing questions as he prepares to take office is where he should live.Mr. Trump, a provincial homebody who divides his time among golf courses in Florida and New Jersey and his townhouse apartment in Manhattan, is weighing how much time to spend in Washington, according to two people familiar with his deliberations.One option is spending weekends in New York and most of the week in Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, is ultimately planning to move to Washington, according to one person briefed on the discussions, but their 10-year-old son, Barron, is still in school.Mr. Trump may be triumphant, but Gloria Allred isn\u2019t done with him yet.More than 10 women accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault after a video bragging about his groping habits emerged last month. Ms. Allred, the lawyer who has been working with many of the women, does not appear to be letting the president-elect off the hook.At 2:30 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, she said that she was going to issue a challenge to Mr. Trump at a news conference with one of his accusers who has already come out publicly to tell her story. Ms. Allred would not reveal the name of the woman before the event or share any details of the challenge.Before the election, Mr. Trump said that the accusers were all lying and that he might sue them. Ms. Allred told ABC News on Thursday that her clients had no plans to sue Mr. Trump at this point, but that they would countersue if he did so.The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America.White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump\u2019s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear \u2014 especially African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, L.G.B.T. Americans and Asian-Americans. Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.Some of the anti-Trump protesters who have taken to the streets this week are supporters of Mr. Sanders, and on Friday the former Democratic presidential candidate reminded them that creating chaos and disorder should not be their goal.Trump Tower, the skyscraper on Fifth Avenue and the home base of the president-elect, has become a fortress in the wake of the election.The lobby, designated a public space by the City of New York, was closed off on Friday morning as Mr. Trump met with advisers. A large police presence surrounded the building.The tower was built with a special permit more than 30 years ago. The city granted Mr. Trump extra space in exchange for maintaining public access to the lobby.Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley libertarian who secretly financed a lawsuit against the website Gawker, was named a member of the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee on Friday afternoon.Advertisement"}

Jimmy Moriarty, an American Special Forces soldier on a training mission in Jordan, called his sister to check in. Everything was \u201chunky-dory,\u201d as his father put it. In just two weeks, he would be home.In an era of continuing danger to American forces overseas, the shooting at the King Faisal air base in southern Jordan still seemed shocking. Jordan, which has worked closely with American military and intelligence services for many years, had largely escaped the sort of violence that has plagued so many of its neighbors.\u201cWe thought Jordan was safe,\u201d James R. Moriarty, the slain sergeant\u2019s father and a trial lawyer from Houston, said by telephone on Saturday.The killings of the three American soldiers remained publicly unexplained on Saturday. Was it some sort of misunderstanding, as the Jordanian military has asserted? Or was it an intentional attack on Americans by a supposedly friendly soldier?The United States and Jordan have begun a joint investigation, and a Jordanian official said the two sides were studying video recordings. The shooter was a soldier and was also injured in the exchange, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.Sergeant Moriarty\u2019s family has expressed doubt about the only account of the shootings given so far. Jordanian officials initially said the three Americans were killed after their vehicle failed to stop as it approached the gate of the base.\u201cThe Jordanian explanation has to be\u201d nonsense, said Mr. Moriarty, a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible. These guys had years in Jordan, were highly motivated, bright. It has all the indices of being a deliberate attack.\u201dAn American Army casualty officer told the family on Saturday that the shooting had been a \u201cfriendly-on-friendly\u201d engagement, Mr. Moriarty said. The soldiers had been at a gun range, and were traveling back to the base when someone opened fire, the officer said.Mr. Moriarty said he wanted answers. \u201cI get so tired of people in the government lying about what happened, and if the Jordanians on that base killed my son, I want to know it and I want the American public to know it,\u201d he said.Sergeant Moriarty, 27, grew up in Texas and studied economics at the University of Texas before joining the Army. As part of the 5th Special Forces Group out of Fort Campbell, Ky., he was more than three months into his third tour in Jordan.He seemed upbeat as he talked with his sister, Melissa, on Thursday. He sent her a photograph of himself wearing a hat with a slogan playing off the presidential campaign: \u201cMake UT Football Great Again.\u201d The two had planned to go to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, for Thanksgiving after he returned from Jordan.Ms. Moriarty wrote on Facebook that the family was \u201cdevastated,\u201d and asked why the United States was still fighting in so many places. \u201cHe was a proud soldier and loved his job,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut he was sent to fight a war that we shouldn\u2019t be fighting.\u201d\u201cHow much is enough?\u201d she asked.

Bannon already at his desk, which was cluttered with takeout coffees. They were co-writers on a Ronald Reagan documentary, but Mr. Bannon had pretty much taken it over. He had been at work for hours, he told her, writing feverishly about his political hero.\u201cA man with a vision,\u201d the trailer says. \u201cAn outsider, a radical with extreme views.\u201dThe Reagan presidency has been a recurring touchstone for Mr. Bannon since 1980, when as a 26-year-old Navy officer he talked his way into Mr. Reagan\u2019s election night celebration. It was at an early screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil\u201d that he met fellow Reagan admirer Andrew Breitbart, the budding conservative media provocateur.Breitbart.com\u2019s scorn for Muslims, immigrants and black activists drew a fervent following on the alt-right, an extremist fringe of message boards and online magazines popular with white supremacists, and after Mr. Bannon took control of the website in 2012, he built a raucous coalition of the discontented.Mr. Bannon told a colleague in multiple conversations during the presidential campaign that he knew Mr. Trump was an \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d for the revolution he had in mind. But the upstart candidate and the media entrepreneur bonded anyway.Like Reagan, Mr. Trump addressed the people he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d \u2014 the white working and middle class. He vowed to take on Islamic radicalism, as Reagan had faced off against communism. Echoing the sole-savior theme of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d Mr. Trump declared of the nation\u2019s predicament, \u201cOnly I can fix it.\u201dMs. Jones, for one, had no trouble seeing the parallels. \u201cTrump,\u201d she said, \u201cis Steve\u2019s Reagan.\u201dTo understand what to expect from the Trump administration means in part to fathom the driven, contradictory character of Mr. Bannon, whom the president-elect has named senior counselor and chief White House strategist. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a president-elect, thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities and many other Americans.How did this son of Richmond, Va., who attended Harvard Business School, spent years at Goldman Sachs and became wealthy working at the intersection of entertainment and finance come to view the political and financial elites as his archenemy? Why does a man who calls himself a \u201chard-nosed capitalist\u201d rail against \u201cglobalists\u201d of \u201cthe party of Davos\u201d and attack the Republican establishment with special glee?As a filmmaker, Mr. Bannon, 63, has cited both the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl and the left-wing documentarian Michael Moore as models. In top physical shape as a young Navy officer, and for years wearing the banker\u2019s uniform of expensive suits, Mr. Bannon has in recent years sported flannel shirts and cargo pants. With a paunch and a sometimes scraggly beard, Mr. Bannon has a rugged look that Stephen Colbert described as \u201cRobert Redford dredged from a river.\u201dVociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an anti-Semite and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable self-confidence and striking intensity. (Mr. Bannon turned down a request for an interview, saying he was too busy with the presidential transition.)\u201cNo one has called him nice,\u201d said Patrick McSweeney, a former chairman of the Virginia Republican Party and a Bannon admirer who has known his family for years. \u201cHe is the least politically correct person I know. His overriding concern is getting the mission accomplished.\u201dSome longtime associates said they had never heard him express bigoted views. \u201cIn the 14 years I\u2019ve known him, I\u2019ve never heard him utter a racist or anti-Semitic comment,\u201d said Peter Schweizer, a conservative author and the president of the Government Accountability Institute, where Mr. Bannon was a founder and the executive chairman.Mr. Bannon\u2019s backers note that several of Breitbart\u2019s top editors and managers are Jewish \u2014 as was Mr. Breitbart himself \u2014 and the site is staunchly pro-Israel. They also point out that Mr. Bannon\u2019s longtime assistant, Wendy Colbert, is African-American; so are Sonnie Johnson, a conservative writer he promoted on Breitbart, and a former Goldman colleague who has been a close friend for three decades and considers Mr. Bannon family, but who asked not to be named to avoid a flood of media attention.Mary Beth Meredith, Mr. Bannon\u2019s sister, said accusations of personal bigotry against him were \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d \u201cWe have interfaith marriages in our own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have interracial marriages \u2014 our family is a microcosm of the U.S.\u201dWhere some perceive racism and nativism, others see a different -ism: opportunism. Whatever may be in his heart, they say, Mr. Bannon was happy to draw a white nationalist following to Breitbart, while denying that was his intent.Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who has been sharply critical of Mr. Bannon, called him \u201ca manipulator\u201d who had \u201cmainstreamed\u201d far-right extremists for cynical political purposes.Ms. Jones, Mr. Bannon\u2019s former film collaborator, who describes herself as very liberal, said, \u201cSteve\u2019s not a racist.\u201dBut, she added, \u201che\u2019s using the alt-right \u2014 using them for power.\u201dRobin Mickle, a fellow Navy officer of Mr. Bannon\u2019s aboard the destroyer Paul F. Foster, remembers that he and some of his idealistic mates were struck by something Mr. Bannon told them in 1978.\u201cHe said he joined the Navy so it would look good on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because he wanted to go into politics someday,\u201d said Mr. Mickle, a retired defense contractor.Another officer, Sonny Masso, who would stay in the Navy and eventually make admiral, recalls a devoted reader of The Wall Street Journal who picked stocks to buy through a San Diego broker and had an astonishing ability to retain information.He was fit, too. \u201cHe\u2019d run five miles at lunch and he had a 32-inch waist,\u201d Mr. Masso said. \u201cVery preppy when we were out of uniform \u2014 polo shirts with alligators on them, and penny loafers with no socks.\u201dMr. Bannon was the middle child of five in an Irish Catholic family from a leafy North Richmond neighborhood. His father, Martin, 95, to whom he remains very close, was a telephone lineman who had worked his way into middle management at the phone company.Steve was bit of a brawler as a boy, said his older brother Mike Bannon. \u201cHe was a fighter. He was a guy that believed what he believed.\u201d On occasion, Steve summoned Mike to the neighborhood pool for reinforcement. \u201cHe\u2019d get in little scrapes and come back and get me, and I\u2019d say, \u2018I wished it wasn\u2019t eight guys we were fighting. If it was two or three, I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u2019\u201dMike Bannon, eager to rebut charges of racism against his brother, said the boys took two buses to get to Benedictine, and their parents instructed them to give up their seats if a woman boarded: \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference if they were black or white or Indian or Jewish or anything else,\u201d he said.Their mother, Doris, who died many years ago, loved to tell them about sneaking Jewish friends into her neighborhood pool in Baltimore \u2014 past a sign that said \u201cNo Jews Allowed.\u201d She later worked on campaigns for Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who became the first African-American governor of Virginia.For Mike Bannon, his brother Steve is \u201ca son of the South\u201d who has never shifted his principles or his character. \u201cHe knew who he was in fourth grade and he\u2019s never changed much over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in his own skin.\u201dAt Virginia Tech, Steve Bannon got his first taste of politics, winning the Student Government Association presidency in a 1975 race that grew quite heated after he challenged the status quo. An opponent, Gary Clisham, told the student newspaper that Mr. Bannon had \u201cimmense charisma\u201d but predicted that he would get nothing done.After graduation, Mr. Bannon joined the Navy, attended Officer Candidate School and served two deployments aboard the Foster, a destroyer that took him all over Asia and into the Persian Gulf. His basketball style \u2014 running the length of the court without passing \u2014 earned him a sarcastic nickname, Coast-to-Coast, said Mr. Masso, his shipmate. Still, he said, Mr. Bannon was popular with the sailors he led in the engineering department, nearly 50 men, the majority of them African-American, Hispanic or Asian.Though his family had Democratic roots, Mr. Bannon, like most of his fellow officers, was scornful of President Jimmy Carter and entranced by Ronald Reagan. At Mr. Masso\u2019s condo, while they watched the two candidates\u2019 debate on television in 1980, Mr. Bannon could hardly contain his excitement.\u201cHe was pacing my living room, and whenever there was a point-counterpoint, he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 like we were watching a boxing match,\u201d Mr. Masso said. When Mr. Bannon heard later that the Reagan election night party was planned for a Los Angeles hotel, the Century Plaza, he worked the phones to try for tickets.When he got the brushoff, Mr. Masso said, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cHey, listen pal, we just got back from the Persian Gulf.\u201d Soon, he had Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger on the phone saying, \u201cThe governor would be honored to have you there.\u201d It was 4 a.m. when their group left the victory celebration to return to the ship, Mr. Masso said.Both men went on to take Pentagon jobs, and Mr. Bannon earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations at Georgetown at the same time. Mr. Masso thought his friend might try to get into politics, but he was accepted at Harvard Business School, and he left the Navy in 1983 to begin a new life.Friends at Harvard and later at Goldman Sachs were aware of Mr. Bannon\u2019s conservative views, but politics was rarely discussed. \u201cHe was in mergers and acquisitions, I was in corporate finance, and we were both working 100 hours a week,\u201d said Scot Vorse, who met Mr. Bannon on their first day at Harvard and joined Goldman at the same time.After less than four years, Mr. Bannon left Goldman to start his own firm, Bannon & Co., which Mr. Vorse soon joined. As head of a scrappy start-up going up against financial behemoths to get Hollywood deals, Mr. Bannon showed the fierce competitiveness that would later drive his politics.\u201cWe were the underdog,\u201d Mr. Vorse said. \u201cWe were competing for the business of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and we did well.\u201d Mr. Vorse said Bannon & Co. represented the Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; the Italian media tycoon and later the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi; Samsung; Westinghouse; and other big players.Mr. Vorse was the detail man, he said. Mr. Bannon \u201cwas the visionary, seeing things before anyone else. He was the rainmaker. He was a leader.\u201dEven as they became successful, Mr. Bannon was not a lavish spender. \u201cHe was driving an eight-year-old Celica convertible,\u201d he said.But in 1993, as part of the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Turner Broadcasting System, he acquired a share of the royalties from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d a move that would prove extremely lucrative as the show became a cultural force.In 1998, Bannon & Co. was acquired by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and Mr. Bannon ran a series of companies working at the intersection of entertainment and finance.\u201cVery intense, very passionate,\u201d said Trevor Drinkwater, who worked with him in film distribution from 2004 to 2010. \u201cI was impressed that while he was very right wing, he had a lot of liberal friends.\u201d He saw Mr. Bannon\u2019s dress evolve toward the casual, \u201cthe flannel shirt over the polo shirt.\u201dThrough films, Mr. Bannon was turning his attention back to politics. Tim Watkins, his co-director on the Reagan documentary, said Mr. Bannon worked from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to, say, go to a ballgame,\u201d he said. But Mr. Watkins found his collaborator\u2019s combativeness wearying.\u201cSteve thinks everything has to be a fight,\u201d he said. Once, an argument broke out when he told Mr. Bannon that the rough cut of the film, at two hours and 10 minutes, should be trimmed further. Angry, Mr. Bannon \u201cactually flipped over the table,\u201d Mr. Watkins said.At first, he recalled, before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, they intended to make a standard biopic. But the attacks \u201cchanged the film radically,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War battles merged with the coda, which showed the hijacked airliners hitting the World Trade Center and people jumping to their deaths.\u201cSteve crafted a lot of the big ideas,\u201d Mr. Watkins said, notably that \u201clife is a battle of good and evil, and history repeats itself.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again,\u201d they read.When his eldest child, Maureen, got into West Point, Mr. Bannon was thrilled and joked about switching his allegiance to Army from Navy. He never missed her volleyball games, and he was at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 2011 when she returned from a deployment to Iraq. \u201cThat was one of the greatest feelings I\u2019ve had, seeing my dad when I walked off the plane,\u201d she said.But through his daughter\u2019s service, he saw an inequity that fueled his anger at the privileged Americans among whom he had long worked.At West Point, \u201che saw a complete, utter lack of people from the upper economic levels of American society,\u201d said Mr. Schweizer, the conservative writer. \u201cHe thought it was appalling, especially because the elite set so many policies that sent these kids into war.\u201dMr. Bannon was put off by the George W. Bush administration\u2019s creation in 2003 of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which he saw as a blatant giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies. The financial collapse of 2008 and the bailouts that followed infuriated him, including the devastating effect of the stock market collapse on the retirement accounts of men like his father, a phone company retiree.Mr. Bannon often spoke to friends about his father\u2019s \u201chonest work,\u201d contrasting it with the paper-pushing he had seen on Wall Street. \u201cWe consider ourselves middle class, and we think the middle class has been shafted,\u201d Mike Bannon said. \u201cBlack, Hispanic, white, everybody. The political class has given them happy talk but delivered nothing. I think that\u2019s what Steve\u2019s talking about.\u201d\u201cNot one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the 2008 crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon fumed. \u201cAnd in fact, it gets worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken.\u201dBut if his scathing economic analysis sometimes seemed to dabble in Marxism, on other subjects, including race and religion, he made no concessions to political sensitivities. After Mr. Bannon met Mr. Breitbart at the 2004 screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d the two men hit it off, bonding over their similar views and a common irreverent streak.Ms. Jones, the film colleague, said that in their years working together, Mr. Bannon occasionally talked about the genetic superiority of some people and once mused about the desirability of limiting the vote to property owners.\u201cI said, \u2018That would exclude a lot of African-Americans,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jones recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u2019 I said, \u2018But what about Wendy?\u2019\u201d referring to Mr. Bannon\u2019s executive assistant. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\u2019\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s African-American friend from his Goldman years said that he had been at pains to defend him in recent years to mutual acquaintances put off first by Breitbart\u2019s reputation and now by Mr. Bannon\u2019s association with Mr. Trump. Most Christmas seasons over the past two decades, he said, Mr. Bannon was \u201cmy only token white guy,\u201d or one of two or three, invited to an annual dinner at a New York City club for nearly a score of African-American friends who work or worked in finance.\u201cNow I\u2019m getting a lot of, \u2018What happened to Steve?\u2019\u201d from concerned black acquaintances, the friend said. He said he hoped Mr. Bannon \u2014 and more important, Mr. Trump \u2014 would more forthrightly denounce the bigots who have cheered them on. Still, he said, he completely rejects the accusations against Mr. Bannon.\u201cHell, no, he\u2019s not a white nationalist,\u201d the friend said.Mr. Bannon took over as executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 after Mr. Breitbart died, playing a hands-on role in assigning, approving and sometimes dictating changes to articles, according to several former Breitbart employees. Staff members grew polarized for or against him. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed a nondisclosure agreement.They describe a decentralized operation overseen by Mr. Bannon in two conference calls a day. Employees rarely had any idea where their peripatetic boss was because he seemed to be constantly moving between homes, offices or borrowed premises in Florida, Washington, New York and occasionally Los Angeles or London.Mr. Bannon\u2019s critics assert that he sometimes put his political preferences ahead of fairness or even of the facts, directing that stories be rewritten to his specifications and shrugging off protests that his changes might make them inaccurate. While Breitbart did not traffic in outright racial slurs, it specialized in inflammatory coverage of police shootings, immigration and Islam in ways intended to prick liberal pieties.Alex Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart, denied that Mr. Bannon ever deliberately permitted an inaccurate story to run on the site. \u201cBreitbart represents certain values, like conservatism, populism and nationalism, and Steve Bannon wanted our content to reflect that,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. He said the site has 45 million readers and should not be judged by \u201ca couple thousand people on Twitter\u201d who express offensive views.In 2011, as Mr. Trump pondered a 2012 presidential run, David Bossie, a conservative activist who headed Citizens United, took Mr. Bannon to Trump Tower in New York to meet him. \u201cThey definitely hit it off,\u201d said Mr. Bossie, who has collaborated with Mr. Bannon on a series of films.Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon had in common a willingness to defy some small-government conservative notions \u2014 for instance, by pushing for a large, costly infrastructure plan to create jobs.Mr. Bannon was deeply impressed in 2014 when an insurgent Virginia Republican, David Brat, managed an unexpected primary race upset of Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader. \u201cHe began casting around for other unconventional candidates to support \u2014 people that were not a part of the establishment and would run populist campaigns,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said.As Mr. Bannon became a steadily more obvious supporter of Mr. Trump, some Breitbart editors and reporters thought he was turning a news site into a propaganda platform \u2014 though other staff members approved. Mr. Shapiro was the most outspoken critic, saying that Mr. Bannon had \u201cbetrayed\u201d Mr. Breitbart\u2019s mission of \u201cfighting the bullies.\u201dIf the criticism bothered Mr. Bannon, he did not show it. He was already deeply involved in advising Mr. Trump, and he believed, unlike most pollsters and pundits, that the chaotic, low-budget campaign had a chance.One warm evening in August, after Mr. Trump called on Mr. Bannon to take charge of the campaign, Mr. Caddell, the pollster, met with him at a New York hotel, sitting outside on a veranda.Mr. Bannon said he knew the campaign needed discipline, with Mr. Trump more consistently presenting himself as a populist outsider, Mr. Caddell recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Believe me, I\u2019m going to bring this home. I know what needs to be done, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Caddell said.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Whatever Reagan scholars like Mr. Cannon might say, Mr. Bossie, who also joined the Trump campaign, said that he and Mr. Bannon discussed Reagan parallels as they saw huge crowds waiting for hours to hear Mr. Trump. Mr. Reagan had run when many voters felt the country was threatened at home and abroad, Mr. Bossie said. \u201cYou can see the same things today with Donald Trump \u2014 that America has lost its way and it\u2019s lost its strength, and Americans are looking for leadership,\u201d he said.Kellyanne Conway, who took the job of campaign manager when Mr. Bannon became chief executive, would later call him \u201cthe general\u201d who made many critical decisions. He pushed for Mr. Trump to visit Flint, Mich., where the water supply was contaminated with lead, and to appear at a black church. Mr. Bannon also hugely accelerated the tempo of what he thought had been a 9-to-5 campaign.In the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Bannon was sure the polls pointing to a Clinton victory were wrong, other campaign officials said. His family, including all four siblings and his 95-year-old father, made the trip to New York City for election night.For Mr. Bannon, the long night at the New York Hilton was his second presidential campaign victory gathering, coming 36 years after the first. At 4:30 a.m., Mr. Vorse, his former colleague, reached him to offer congratulations. He was reminded of their Hollywood days, when \u201cwe would have victories and Steve would celebrate for two seconds, and then it was on to the next thing.\u201d\u201cHe said, \u2018I got to go because we have a meeting in three hours. I got to hop.\u2019\u201dAn article on Monday\u2019s front page about Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist for President-elect Donald J. Trump, misidentified the type of ship on which Mr. Bannon served. The ship Paul F. Foster was a destroyer, not a guided-missile destroyer.Sharon LaFraniere, Jo Becker and Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolshoi Gives Building Pass to Dancer Involved in Acid Attack on its Director", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The scandalous acid attack that has shadowed the storied Bolshoi Ballet here for almost four years took yet another bizarre twist on Wednesday, as the ballet confirmed it had allowed the dancer convicted in the assault to take practice classes there again.That means he is working under the same roof as Sergei Filin, whom he was convicted to have ordered an attack on in January 2013.\u201cI feel that I am a traveler who has returned home after a long round-the-world trip,\u201d Mr. Dmitrichenko, 32, said in response to emailed questions. \u201cI feel happiness and tranquillity.\u201dThe Bolshoi management would not comment, except to make clear that Mr. Dmitrichenko was given the pass at his request merely for morning exercise routines. \u201cBut that does not mean that he will join the company later,\u201d said Katya Novikova, the spokeswoman for the Bolshoi. \u201cThis question is not even under discussion for now.\u201dVladimir Urin, the general director of the Bolshoi, said immediately after Mr. Dmitrichenko\u2019s release that he could audition for the company if it had an opening and if he proved himself as an artist.Mr. Dmitrichenko said he had encountered Mr. Filin at the theater, describing the meeting in an offhand manner as \u201cnothing special.\u201d\u201cFilin was never interesting to me, so I cannot really tell you anything about him,\u201d he said.Mr. Dmitrichenko said he got his new Bolshoi pass when he happened to encounter for the first time the company\u2019s new artistic director, Makhar K. Vaziev, on a Moscow street.Mr. Vaziev offered the pass after Mr. Dmitrichenko, a former soloist, explained how he was trying to return to the profession, Mr. Dmitrichenko said. He was also performing around Russia in a new production of \u201cSwan Lake\u201d for charity, he said.Opinion in Russia\u2019s ballet world swung between questioning what some called an ethically dubious decision sure to ignite the scandal anew and considering it a kind act for someone who had already paid for a past mistake.Basically, the rifts within the Bolshoi that led to the attack have never healed, with rank-and-file dancers tending to champion Mr. Dmitrichenko while the elite dancers favor their mentor Mr. Filin.Before the attack, Mr. Filin and Mr. Dmitrichenko clashed openly for control over the dancers\u2019 union, with Mr. Dmitrichenko denouncing Mr. Filin for corruption and high living while most dancers were paid and treated badly. Mr. Filin was often perceived as an intriguer prone to favoritism who pressured dance critics to pan dancers he did not like, such as Mr. Dmitrichenko.Simon Morrison, the author of a new book, \u201cBolshoi Confidential,\u201d and a retired Bolshoi official who was not authorized to speak publicly both said there was an argument to be made that by allowing Mr. Dmitrichenko back to practice, the Bolshoi management was finding a way to mollify his allies while not giving him any kind of official status that would alarm his foes and bring yet more bad publicity.\u201cThe theater is very polarized and Balkanized and has been for many years,\u201d said Mr. Morrison, who is a professor of music at Princeton.Mr. Dmitrichenko, whose specialty as a Bolshoi soloist was playing villains, said he had not sensed so much as a ripple of disapproval while exercising.\u201cThe ballet world \u2014 artists, teachers, managers, choreographers \u2014 are all one big family that is united by one thing that they love: the art that is called ballet,\u201d he said, before claiming that the entire ballet world realizes that \u201cthe case against me was fabricated.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I get so many offers of help as well as offers to perform and work in different theaters,\u201d he said.His dream, he said, was naturally to return to the Bolshoi.Word that Mr. Dmitrichenko had received a pass was first reported by a tabloid, Moskovsky Komsomolets.The retired Bolshoi official and two others affiliated with the theater who were not authorized to speak publicly said that chances of his rejoining the company were highly unlikely despite his seeing the building pass as the first step.In court, prosecutors depicted Mr. Dmitrichenko as the person who had hired Mr. Filin\u2019s attacker, asserting he was incensed that Mr. Filin had denied starring roles to Mr. Dmitrichenko\u2019s girlfriend, Anzhelina Vorontsova. He had also expressed open frustration over what he called corruption and poor working conditions under Mr. Filin. At the trial, his lawyer suggested that what was meant to be a simple warning went badly amok.The attacker, Yuri Zarutsky, a former convict, embellished the job by throwing acid in Mr. Filin\u2019s face, Mr. Dmitrichenko said in court, although he now denies having had any role in the events. In December 2013, Mr. Dmitrichenko was sentenced to six years in prison, but he was released early for good behavior.After extensive surgery, Mr. Filin hides his noticeable scarring and damaged eyes behind sunglasses. Earlier this year, he was removed as artistic director and put in charge of a program fostering young choreographers. Some young dancers close to Mr. Dmitrichenko were also let go after the attack.Mr. Morrison noted that members of that cloistered world often have trouble distinguishing between the operatic dramas onstage and those in their daily lives. For them, getting back to work with the two main characters enmeshed in a real crime \u2014 one of them horribly scarred and the other fresh from jail \u2014 might not seem too weird, he said.In addition, in the cycle of ballets at the Bolshoi, it will soon be time for an anniversary performance of Yuri N. Grigorovich\u2019s \u201cIvan the Terrible\u201d \u2014 Mr. Dmitrichenko\u2019s star vehicle.It is difficult to imagine, but not impossible, that he will audition for the role and get it, Mr. Morrison said. \u201cClearly, as P.R., it would not be great if he was onstage again performing as Ivan the Terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that could happen.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko in Moscow, Roslyn Sulcas in London and Ellen Barry in Mumbai contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Twitter Addresses Troll Problem. Again.", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byBitsIt has been said before but it bears repeating: Twitter\u2019s biggest problem is Twitter.When the social media site was created, its founders thought it could be the water cooler or town hall for the world. It was a nice thought. What they probably never anticipated was that Twitter would become a meeting place for all sorts of people you would never want to meet at the water cooler.Even in its early days, tech writers used Twitter to call one another out about their coverage \u2014 who got what story first and why they got it all wrong. Was it juvenile? Of course. But it was usually harmless.What happens on Twitter today, critics would argue, isn\u2019t so harmless. From racist trolls to terrorist recruiting to gaslighting \u2014 today\u2019s popular way to describe lying so often that people can\u2019t quite tell the truth anymore \u2014 Twitter has some serious issues.That both companies are taking a hard look at how their services are being misused shined a harsh light on Facebook, where Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, dismissed the company\u2019s problem with fake news posts, despite the reported misgivings of some of his own employees. But by late Monday night, Facebook did add language to the guidelines of its ad network spelling out that fake news sites were barred from the ad network. To be clear, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll disappear from Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg must run in different Facebook circles than the rest of us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Price We Pay for an Ad-Powered Internet", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.We don\u2019t usually think of Timothy Leary as a consumer advocate, but in his zealous promotion of LSD, the iconoclastic 1960s psychologist was searching for what today we would call an ad blocker \u2014 though his tiny tabs relied more on messing with our sensory receptors than dropping code on our mobile phones.In his new book \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d Tim Wu reminds us that Leary pushed acid in the pursuit of \u201ca complete attentional revolution\u201d in which his followers would reject the growing external stimuli of commercial media in favor of an inward, spiritual journey.It\u2019s more than a bit ironic, then, that Leary felt compelled to resort to a classic marketing trick, the jingle, to press his case. His \u201cTurn on, tune in, drop out\u201d was so catchy that, though failing to smash the attention economy, it was ultimately complicit in contributing to it, showing up in a campaign for Squirt, a grapefruit-flavored soda: \u201cTurn on to flavor, tune in to sparkle, and drop out of the cola rut.\u201dThis gets at the heart of the compelling thesis of \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d namely that the age of mass media and mass marketing is characterized by an arms race between those who seek to capture the valuable commodity of our attention and capitalize on it for gain and those who resist this harvesting of time either through drugs; regulation; or most effectively, collective boredom, distraction and indifference. Wu\u2019s argument is that each boom in commercial media in some way went too far and provoked an either minor or major revolt, pushing the advertising industry to adopt more sophisticated or extreme methods to monetize our time.Drawing a line from the snake oil salesmen of the early 20th century, through the birth, rise and decline of broadcast to the \u201cattention plantation\u201d of Facebook, Wu\u2019s history also illustrates the cyclical resistance movements against advertising. First came the unscrupulous false advertising, then the corrective of investigative journalism; first the tidal bore of broadcast television, then the corrective of the remote control; first the era of spam, then the development of filters and blockers.The book is studded with sharp illustrations of those who have tried to stop the encroachment of advertising on our lives, and usually failed. In the 1930s, for example, Rexford Tugwell, an economist and member of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, sought to introduce far stricter legislation on drug advertising, which would have barred pharmaceutical and cigarette industries from making false claims about their products. The pressure brought by manufacturers on broadcasters to resist the proposed legislation saw both Tugwell\u2019s recommendations watered down and Tugwell himself smeared as a Communist. Newspapers and radio barely covered the controversy, in part, Wu writes, as a response to pressure from advertisers.This struggle has only become more relevant today. Many media companies, including The New York Times, are now almost entirely dependent on the ability to build and sustain a business model that captures people\u2019s time and resells it to advertisers, or provides something so valuable to individuals that they will pay for the journalism, programming or experience they receive. If you walk the floor of a modern newsroom, you will most likely see journalists staring at real-time charts flickering with numbers, and dials telling editors where readers are spending every second of their time. If you have got this far in the review, then I and Tim Wu are doing well \u2014 around 55\u202fpercent of readers, on average, will have stopped after 15 seconds.There is little sign of this trend slowing, only accelerating. Facebook and Google represent the largest and most successful advertising-funded businesses in history. They are busy developing technologies that track not only our attention but also every aspect of our online behavior and, in Facebook\u2019s case, synthesizing it with what is known as our \u201csocial graph.\u201d That graph is the circle of colleagues, acquaintances, families and friends we connect with online and determines as a result what type of advertising and even what type of news or other content we see. We are largely unaware of how the hidden tracking technologies operate and are complicit in how much we surrender.From his historical perspective, Wu can see that often a moment such as this one, in which our eyeballs are so thoroughly monopolized, is followed by resistance. But his concern is that we have not individually or collectively paid enough attention to the commercialization of every part of our lives: \u201cOur society has been woefully negligent about what in other contexts we would call the rules of zoning, the regulation of commercial activity where we live, figuratively and literally. It is a question that goes to the heart of how we value what used to be called our private lives.\u201dClearly not a fan of the selfie stick or the culture of \u201cmicrofame,\u201d Wu sees a tendency to self-aggrandize online, turning us all into miniature attention merchants. As the man who coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and a skilled thinker about the importance of an open web, Wu is nevertheless largely disappointed about where the internet has taken us. In a chapter titled \u201cThe Web Hits Bottom\u201d he describes in some detail the business model of the new-media company BuzzFeed and the quest for \u201cvirality.\u201d Wu is steadfastly skeptical, seeing \u201clittle to admire\u201d online. Though he briefly describes \u201cbright spots\u201d like Wikipedia and Reddit and name-checks online legacy media that he grudgingly admits have improved their offerings, he sees them as being \u201cengulfed by the vast areas of darkness, the lands of the cajoling listicles and the celebrity nonstories, engineered for no purpose but to keep a public mindlessly clicking and sharing away.\u201dWhat his thesis doesn\u2019t allow for is the possibility that despite his skepticism, we may have become rather deft in developing our own spam filters and that while the \u201copen web\u201d has in fact delivered a lot of cats falling over, it has also given us access to more knowledge than ever before and more engaging forms of information. It has done this in part because of the possibility of advertising revenue, not despite it. As for his dismissiveness about our \u201cselfie\u201d culture, he never considers the opportunities that the internet has opened up for women, minorities and those outside the mainstream media\u2019s boundaries of acceptability to take control of their own image.For Someone uniquely skilled at advocating a stronger regulatory climate, Wu\u2019s ultimate point is surprisingly low-tech: \u201cIf we desire a future that avoids the enslavement of the propaganda state as well as the narcosis of the consumer and celebrity culture, we must first acknowledge the preciousness of our attention and resolve not to part with it as cheaply or unthinkingly as we so often have.\u201d It might be an idealistic aspiration, but it is a timely one.What Wu achieved with his first book, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d was to demystify the recent history of the ownership and governance of our communications systems, from telecom companies to the web, while identifying how open systems over time became compromised and closed. In \u201cThe Attention Merchants\u201d he applies the same thesis of a business cycle to explain the development of the advertising market and the ways in which it has adapted to avoid our natural inclination to ignore it. Despite the book\u2019s occasional finger-wagging, Wu dramatizes this push and pull to great effect.When Vance Packard wrote \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders,\u201d the revelatory 1957 book about advertising\u2019s hidden psychological manipulations, he did so just as the mass media stood at a turning point. He did not stop the march of commercial television, but he provided a powerful critical framework through which to think about it. Wu has written a \u201cHidden Persuaders\u201d for the 21st century, just as we stand squarely on the threshold of a post-broadcast world where the algorithmic nano-targeting of electronic media knows our desires and impulses before we know them ourselves.Emily Bell is the director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.Advertisement"}

The next day, you will quit the race.To fill your queasy stomach during your third 112-mile bike ride, you will discover the best way to eat a sausage-and-egg sandwich: shove it in your mouth and let it slowly dissolve.After 500 miles on a bike, 10 in the water and more than 100 on foot, it will make perfect sense to grab a branch and a broomstick in a desperate bid to propel yourself \u2014 like a giant mutant insect \u2014 the last 31 miles. It will not be enough. You will collapse on the road.Seasick, miles into the swim, you will vomit. Twice.Neck cramps will attack so fiercely on the bike that your head will slump. You will go cross-eyed and nearly crash.The trees will keep moving. You will swear bugs are crawling over your face, even when they are not. The cracks in the road will form smiley faces. None of this is real \u2014 but it is 3 a.m., and you have dozens of miles still to run.The sores from chafing are so bad you will think nothing of tugging open your shorts and squirting in ointment in full view of strangers. There is no modesty here; they seem to understand.Actually, no. They don\u2019t really understand. They are not competing in this race. And nobody not competing in this race understands.All that misery and more menaced the competitors who had decided, for their own unfathomable reasons, that a single Ironman race was not enough. They had entered an endurance event called the Virginia Quintuple Anvil Triathlon: five Ironman-length races, totaling 703 miles of swimming, biking and running, over five days.All the legs were done in confined loops (30 laps in a section of the lake, 101 laps of a more-than-five-mile course for the bike and 75 laps of a nearly two-mile course for the run) at Lake Anna State Park, earning the course the nickname \u201cthe squirrel cage.\u201dThe competitors \u2014 several of whom have formed a tight, familylike circle, having seen one another often at these kinds of races \u2014 were a mishmash of the superfit and the merely fit, military veterans (including a couple of former commandos), driven professionals and simple thrill-seekers who found plenty.Most were middle-aged, most had grown children who would not miss them much in the long hours of training, and most had supportive spouses and family members \u2014 in some cases triathletes themselves.Some of those family members came to watch their loved ones destroy their bodies, if not their minds, for nearly a week because \u2026 because \u2026 why? \u201cIf you have to ask,\u201d more than a few racers replied, \u201cyou will never know.\u201dYou may have heard that idea expressed at, say, the regular old Ironman triathlon, which is normally considered the Mount Everest of the sport: a 2.4-mile swim, then a 112-mile bike ride and then a marathon (26.2 miles) in the heat of Hawaii. If you could finish it, you were, well, an Ironman (or woman).Then people began flocking to the challenge. Ironman grew. Races popped up on every continent except Antarctica. Even half-Ironman versions proliferated.The first Ironman was in Hawaii in 1978, with 15 competitors. Today, there are 140 races to choose from, drawing 260,000 competitors.But once you have swum 2.4 miles, biked 112 miles and run 26.2 miles in a day, why stop there?As early as 1984, a double Ironman race was held in Alabama. And then a triple. And then a quintuple. And then a deca (10 Ironmans in 10 days) and a double deca, and you see where this is going.Wayne Kurtz, who is considered the godfather of the so-called ultratriathletes, and seven others did 30 Ironman-length races in 30 days in Italy in 2013. He wrote about it in a book, \u201cStronger Than Iron.\u201d\u201cWith this kind of test,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthese athletes were not racing for money or fame but purely to discover what is possible in terms of endurance limits.\u201dHow did it go?\u201cI was hit by a car three times,\u201d Kurtz said in an interview. \u201cIt was a zoo. We\u2019re lucky nobody died.\u201dThat triple deca is considered the outer limit of physical performance. (One athlete recently claimed to have done 50 Ironmans in 50 days, but with some of that mileage done on an elliptical machine, traditionalists have scoffed.)One of the more popular races is the Quintuple Anvil, which grew to 16 competitors this year from seven in 2013, its inaugural year. Double and triple versions are held at the same time. (By the time you consider a quadruple, you might as well just do a quintuple. That is the mentality here.)\u201cAnvil\u201d is a tongue-in-cheek spin on \u201cIronman,\u201d which is run by a large corporation fiercely protective of its trademark and not keen on letting other races use it. (An Ironman lawyer told the Anvil organizers a couple of years ago not to use \u201cIronman\u201d in their materials.)Competitors may choose one of two ways to mete out their self-flagellation: do one Ironman-length triathlon a day for five days, abiding by a 17-hour cutoff, or do all of it continuously \u2014 a 12-mile swim, followed by a 560-mile bike ride and a 131-mile run \u2014 stretched out over five and a half days, broken up however you wish.The one-by-five variant means you can get a longish night\u2019s sleep, but you have to get up for a 7 a.m. start every day \u2014 a fitness nut\u2019s \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201dThe continuous version usually involves a fair amount of sleep deprivation, in particular to get the long bike and run legs done. This is the fitness nut\u2019s \u201cWalking Dead\u201d: By the end, the mind is shot from exhaustion, and the legs and feet have taken so much punishment that hardly anybody is doing much running.My own triathlon experience has been limited to a few \u201csprint\u201d races of short distances, some Olympic-distance races (a swim of just under a mile, a 24-mile ride and a 6.2-mile run) and one half-Ironman (1.2-mile swim, 56-mile ride, 13.1-mile run).The half-Ironman, done in the tropical heat of Panama, left me staggering at the end and had me pretty sure that I had found my limit \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t happy to see me. Just beyond the finish line, there was a nice ice bath, which I felt like moving into permanently.When I told this to Shanda Hill, who ended up one of the top finishers at the Anvil, she smiled and, with the evangelical fervor common among the racers, started pushing me to at least do an Ironman-length race.\u201cIt\u2019s all mental,\u201d Hill, 34, said, \u201cand I am living proof.\u201dBy that, she meant that she had not devoted long hours to swimming, biking or running. But she did spend a lot of time in the gym and was also fit from a youth of championship BMX racing, a pursuit that ended several years ago when she was hit by a sport utility vehicle while riding a bike home.She began running after that, moved up to ultramarathons and, before long, was doing her first Ironman, in 2014. Then came a double race, and by her logic, if you are going to move up to a triple, you might as well just do the quintuple.This was her fifth triathlon over all, and like many of the other athletes, she would insist endurance triathlons had at least as much to do with the limits of the mind as with those of the body.Lisa Wei-Haas, who did a double, said: \u201cShorter triathlons are about pain. Endurance triathlons are about suffering. How much suffering can you take?\u201dEverybody here found the answer. But not everybody finished. Not everybody got to bang that real anvil five times, as competitors do after crossing the finish line and parading, Olympic-style, with the flag of their country and their national anthem blaring from a tinny speaker.Facedown on a cot, near midnight in the middle of the race, Will Turner had a massage therapist kneading his muscles, trying to coax some life into them.He was, at 58, an Ironman veteran who only last year moved up to multiple-distance races by doing a double Ironman-length race.He believes in big dreams, he said, and he dedicated his entry to his late mother. This race, the continuous Quintuple Anvil, would also be a test toward a bigger goal: 60 Ironman-length races, one every six days, when he turned 60.The test was not going well.\u201cI have been hanging out in the pain cave,\u201d he said.Like other racers, Turner had a group of people attending to him, although as a resident of nearby Richmond, he had more than anybody else.He also had a table full of food and drinks.At the beginning of the race, the tables and their goods were neatly arranged \u2014 water, electrolyte and muscle-recovery drinks, crackers, soups, cereal, cookies, doughnuts \u2014 under large party tents.By the middle of the race, the tents resembled a MASH unit, littered with discarded gauze, wrappers, bottles and the other detritus from trying to keep a body in one piece.The food game also intensified: pizzas, fast-food burgers, hot dogs \u2014 real food loaded with calories and carbohydrates to sustain long periods of exercise.\u201cMay I have a pumpkin bread?\u201d Turner asked as he eased to his feet and prepared to run while a friend fished out his request from the table.\u201cThis is the most I will ever be pampered in my life,\u201d Turner said with a tight smile he would wear even in some of the more painful moments ahead.Someone grabbed a pole resembling a baker\u2019s rolling pin and massaged his calf muscles.The race rules allow for such assistance, but the competitors must keep track of the rest periods eating away at their time.Limited medical assistance is permitted, too.A doctor and a nurse dispense ibuprofen, pop blisters when necessary and even give shots of lidocaine to ailing tendons (a small dose that is meant to get a faltering competitor moving and does not last long).Competitors are tested before the race for performance-enhancing drug use and, if a course record is set, afterward, too.Steve Kirby, the race director at U.S.A. Ultra Triathlon, which oversees the Anvil and other endurance triathlons, acknowledged the testing protocols were not as stringent as those of Ironman and other more famous races, but Anvil is a lower-key, lower-rent event, he said.\u201cI know we go waayyyy beyond the other races in the amount of medical care we provide to keep the racers going,\u201d Kirby said in an email. \u201cMost of the others, they would be pulled from the race and patched up and sent home. We are a different breed ;-).\u201dMost of the finishers are patched up and sent home, too \u2014 with festering blisters, stress fractures, warped tendons and other injuries.Dr. Martin Hoffman, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at University of California, Davis, who is an ultramarathon competitor and researcher, said such short-term damage was well known. Less understood are the long-term consequences.Ultra-endurance athletes appear to have an increased rate of cardiac arrhythmias, or unusual heartbeats, most likely because of scarring of the heart known as fibrosis. But what, if any, danger that poses has been hard to pin down, Hoffman said.\u201cExactly why the fibrosis occurs probably isn\u2019t understood, but seems to be an adaptive response to this sort of exercise,\u201d he said.These ultratriathletes, however, tend not to dwell on the wear and tear of their bodies, at least once the race is done.\u201cI know this is not good for my body,\u201d said Jay Lonsway, a urologist who completed the quintuple. \u201cBut it is good for my soul.\u201dIt is clearly not an undertaking for the uninitiated.To qualify, a competitor must have finished at least a double Ironman-length race, yet here was Jerome Libecki, 46, doing his first-ever triathlon. He had sort of slipped into the race \u2014 although he had done other endurance events, he needed a friend to persuade Kirby to let him in.His triathlon inexperience showed: About 300 miles into the bike leg, after a friend took a harder look at his bike, he realized he needed to shift into a higher gear.\u201cI was just pedaling,\u201d Libecki said.A few competitors privately resented his presence, an errant entrant in a race that wants to be taken seriously. But most cheered Libecki on, astonished at his grit and determination.By the \u201crun\u201d \u2014 for him and many others, it eventually slowed to a walk \u2014 Libecki was the one who hobbled on like the giant insect with makeshift crutches.\u201cThis is the last thing I figured would happen,\u201d he said at 3 a.m., panting and sweating. But still he vowed to go on.Not long after, his friend Frank Fumich, who competed in the race last year, chronicled Libecki\u2019s effort on Facebook.\u201cHe literally went until he HAD to stop and lay down in the middle of the road, unable to go another step,\u201d he wrote above a picture of Libecki flat on his back with his improvised walking sticks arrayed like a cross, \u201cas close to symbolizing what might have happened if he didn\u2019t stop. I just couldn\u2019t encourage him to continue anymore.\u201dBut even in the grip of exhaustion, there was a thirst for competition. Libecki and Turner, in their stooped gaits, still eyed each other as they passed, if in a last-man-standing kind of way.People race to win, after all. And as if the physical demands of such a contest are not enough, some resort to psychological warfare. They misinform one another about whether they intend to nap, or they press on when they see a rival catching a snooze. They burst into a sprint when they see another competitor walking, to draw him or her further into exhaustion. Some methodically plot when to give their all and when to hold back.Dolph Hoch IV, 52, a former military sniper, won the one-per-day quintuple division in 74 hours 54 minutes 17 seconds, beating five other competitors (including two who quit).Unlike the other racers, Hoch conserved enough energy to complete his Day 4 (14:25:04) and Day 5 (14:46:31) races faster than he had done Day 1 (14:59:21).\u201cThe first day, I was getting lapped on the bike,\u201d he said after the race, his thighs now \u201cscreaming.\u201d \u201cFifth day, I had the fastest split. They had no idea I was saving my spin.\u201d(In my book, he also won best food trick, as the one who let the sausage sandwich dissolve in his mouth to his delight, if that is the word.)The most grinding competition, however, was between David Jepson and Johan Desmet.It was not quite a \u201cRocky\u201d-like spectacle, but with Jepson, 40, looking to be falling apart at times, it did take on that feeling. At a rest stop, he threw down his bike helmet in frustration over cramps that had left him unable to hold his head up and nearly led to a crash.But with reassuring words from his wife, Jepson somehow regained his footing on the run despite a multitude of maladies: a \u201cgolf-ball-sized\u201d blood blister on his foot he eventually popped, a shin splint, ankle tendons so sore they needed to be stabilized by duct tape, and bruising and chafing on the bottoms of his feet that made every step searing. Running was not much of an option anymore.\u201cI got a good lead, no point in killing it,\u201d he said, watching as Desmet trotted past.\u201cI\u2019m over this,\u201d Jepson added. \u201cI like double Ironmans because you can actually race them to the end.\u201dDesmet, 49, who is Belgian and a marathon runner, kept up an efficient gait for a good amount of the run and rarely complained about his ordeal despite the blisters and sores on his feet. One of them, a race nurse concluded, was from the bite of an insect that had gotten inside his shoe.\u201cYou\u2019re not drinking enough,\u201d interrupted his wife, Helene, who served as his only crew member, handing him water during a late-evening break.\u201cYou always say that,\u201d he said, taking a sip.Helene was ready for the race to be over. And so was he. After six years of ultra-racing, he was planning to pursue other adventures.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty selfish sport, with the training and racing,\u201d Desmet said later. \u201cShe\u2019s been putting up with this for close to seven years.\u201dIn the end, Jepson won the continuous division with a time of 104:47:39.Desmet, still on the course, realized the best he could do was second place.\u201cI am going to be first loser,\u201d he cracked.The day after their agony ended, the competitors milled about a winery near the park for the awards ceremony. Turner beamed.Although he had not finished by the cutoff time, he, like other competitors, seemed buoyed by the experience and waxed philosophical over the whole endeavor: how we as a species need to challenge ourselves, how we do not know our limits until we search for them.Steve Hendricks, who had coughed up blood and had the nightmare and hallucination of the Pok\u00e9mon character, drew gasps when he told the gathering he had broken a rib on the third day. He fell off his bike while fumbling with a cookie and his odometer, and the lingering effects made finishing the race impossible.Hill, who had tried to talk me into doing an Ironman, was the top female finisher in the continuous division (117:46:42) and kept up a smiling demeanor almost the entire time, to the bafflement of everyone else.\u201cI never laughed so hard at any race in my life,\u201d she told the gathering.If Turner had regrets, he kept them to himself. He had dedicated this effort to his mother, who had recently died. Near the end of the race, he scrawled her name on his arm. And he relished the outpouring of affection from his supporters, who showed up in response to \u201cWill needs help\u201d texts.\u201cWhen you are humbled by a race, you realize what the purpose is here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn managing to dig so deep, you discover who you are.\u201dIn front of him was a table full of Anvil Quintuple bumper stickers. But he would not be buying one. He felt a tinge of disappointment.\u201cBut that\u2019s my ego talking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ego wants a perfect race.

But to those who study gender and politics, certain issues were clear, and they will frame the campaigns of women who may run in the future.It has been a political science truism that female candidates cannot win unless voters see them as qualified for office; men have more leeway.\u201cDonald Trump never held elective office,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman who could get away with that.\u201dPolitical scientists saw a double bind: political experience, branded in this election as being part of a clueless or corrupt elite, worked against the woman running for office, while political inexperience helped the man. (Exit polls showed that 18 percent of those who voted for Mr. Trump did not think he was qualified to be president).As a female candidate, \u201cyou have to prove your qualifications beyond the shadow of a doubt,\u201d said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which has been studying women\u2019s political races for 20 years. \u201cHow are you supposed to prove your qualifications while still being an outsider? I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that question.\u201dScholars also noticed that while past polls suggested that voters had dropped their resistance to seeing a woman as commander in chief, exit polls suggested a more nuanced reality.\u201cWe knew that in 2008 one reason voters were reluctant to support Clinton is if they had worries about terrorism, so she became secretary of state,\u201d said Mirya R. Holman, an assistant professor of political science at Tulane. \u201cBut it turns out foreign policy experience does not mean we trust you to protect us against terrorism.\u201d She noted that in exit polls, 60 percent of voters who said foreign policy mattered most to them voted for Mrs. Clinton, while only 39 percent of those who rated terrorism first voted for her.Issues aside, the well-documented insults to women that dogged the campaign are likely to make some women reluctant to run. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried all along that regardless of the outcome we would have created a situation where women would believe the terrain they have to navigate was rife with sexism,\u201d said Jennifer L. Lawless, professor of government at American University. \u201cGenerally when women run for Congress and other levels of office they do just as well as men. But nobody knows that, and after this campaign, nobody\u2019s going to believe it.\u201dSenator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said that when she talked to women about running for office, \u201cThe No. 1 issue is we don\u2019t like the negative campaigning. I say, \u2018Is the issue you are fighting for important enough for you to withstand that?\u2019 \u201dSenator Gillibrand is one of many Democratic women mentioned as potential presidential candidates, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Janet Napolitano, former governor of Arizona; Senator-elect Kamala Harris of California and Senator-elect Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.On the Republican side, potential candidates include Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina; Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico; Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington and Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.Senator Gillibrand said she was not surprised by the way gender surfaced in this campaign. During her first run for the Senate, her opponent initially dismissed her as nothing more than a pretty face, and then circulated an unflattering picture of her \u201cwith my hair blowing all over, and then they put a green wash over it so I looked like a crazy unhinged witch.\u201dSome worry that children will draw a sobering lesson. \u201cOur daughters and sons are watching what\u2019s happening in this election,\u201d Professor Holman said. \u201cFor many this would be their first political memory. That sends a message about what\u2019s acceptable in politics, who\u2019s acceptable and who\u2019s a winner or loser.\u201dYet this campaign could also act as a spur, much as the hearings into Anita Hill\u2019s accusations against Clarence Thomas did for an earlier generation of women.\u201cThis was much less a function of dissuading me than educating me,\u201d said Stacey Y. Abrams, a Democratic state representative and minority leader of the Georgia General Assembly who is widely reported to be initiating a bid for governor. Mrs. Clinton did win the popular vote, she noted. \u201cShe did not win over certain segments of certain communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of can a woman win? You have to decide where it worked, where it didn\u2019t and anticipate that for the next one.\u201dKelly Dittmar, assistant professor of political science at Rutgers, Camden, said, \u201cThis could have a mobilizing effect on women, who see unfairness, misogyny or the underrepresentation of women in political leadership.\u201dSo much in this campaign blew up conventional political wisdom that politicians and those who study them are still regrouping. Experience was a liability. Demeaning or bullying behavior, which memorably doomed Rick Lazio when he ran against Mrs. Clinton for the Senate in 2000, did not disqualify Mr. Trump.Some voters were alienated in the presidential election when Mrs. Clinton explicitly positioned herself as a woman who championed issues like families, children and equal pay; others were inspired. If parties court blue-collar voters more intensively next time around, would that hurt women vying to run?This campaign may have signaled that an ambitious woman still prompts resentment and anger among some voters. But ambition is hard to extinguish, no matter how rugged the terrain.Advertisement"}

The misinformation spread through the echo chamber of the web and social media is the symptom \u2014 not the source \u2014 of a much deeper and systemic problem.The problem is that we aren\u2019t ever taught how to think clearly. Most people are unaware of our hard-wired cognitive biases. We aren\u2019t trained how to spot logical fallacies in our own arguments and the arguments of others. It takes time and persistence to overcome these obstacles, and most people just don\u2019t have the luxury or the interest to put in the effort.If we want a better democracy with more informed citizens, then we need to find a better way to provide people with the cognitive tools needed to better detect misinformation and lies.

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs, Bank to the Elite, Makes Pitch to the Masses", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs, long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks \u2014 debt happens.On Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals \u2014 even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range \u2014 out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan.\u201cDebt happens. It\u2019s how you get out that counts,\u201d the ads say.Dustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman\u2019s new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank\u2019s aim was to \u201cdestigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.\u201dThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple. Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans \u201ccan be a better option,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research.Mr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut.Through the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals.Goldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its \u201cvampire squid\u201d reputation.But these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman\u2019s longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets.\u201cThe real driver\u201d of the new Marcus lending push is \u201cthe way the capital rules are,\u201d Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. \u201cWe are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it\u2019s easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,\u201d Mr. Blankfein added.The last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley, which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter\u2019s steadier fee-driven revenues.Although the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010.Marcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman\u2019s head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. \u201cWe were looking for something different, something new\u201d that wouldn\u2019t compete with Goldman\u2019s existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said.Goldman\u2019s growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from great to merely good,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk.It is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. \u201cDigital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,\u201d Mr. Scherr said.Lending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. \u201cThe thing to worry about, when you\u2019re refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,\u201d she said.The small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future.\u201cI think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThen three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Russian TV, Clinton-Trump Race Merits Wall-to-Wall Coverage", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Given the blanket coverage on Russia\u2019s main state-run new channels on Tuesday, it often seemed that the United States presidential election was actually happening here.The blanket coverage had led to more than a little grumbling that the Kremlin-managed news media was devoting more time and energy to the American elections than it paid to a national parliamentary vote in Russia less than two months ago.Another commentator, Lidiya Sergeeva, joked on Facebook that election coverage was so intense in Russia that there would probably be voters out looking for polling stations here on Tuesday to vote for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has generally received the kinder treatment. Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, is regarded as an old adversary who would be bad for Russia. But generally speaking, the coverage seemed intended to present the candidates and the process in the worst possible light.\u201cEverything turned out to stink so hideously that what the United States calls \u2018democracy\u2019 prompts nothing but disgust,\u201d Dmitry Kiselyov, the anchor on the main weekly news show said during election coverage on Sunday night that lasted more than 30 minutes.On the streets of Moscow, Russian voters seemed to have been exposed to enough of the candidates to have an opinion, although many appeared indifferent to the eventual outcome.\u201cMr. Trump has made a huge fortune, but he lacks serious political experience,\u201d said Olga Zakharova, 33, a manager.\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything good from Clinton, either. She is a hostage of the political system, which is fundamentally predisposed against Russia,\u201d Ms. Zakharova said, standing in front of a crowded subway station during the evening rush hour.\u201cWhoever wins, it won\u2019t have much effect on Russia,\u201d she concluded.President Vladimir V. Putin said before the vote that he saw his country\u2019s outsize role in the American presidential campaign as a sign of its growing might.He shrugged off accusations that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee, leaking emails that put party officials in a bad light. Denying any role by Russia, he said several times that American voters and the news media should concentrate on the information and not on how it was exposed.There was another spat with Washington on Tuesday over election monitoring, with Russia complaining that its diplomats had been harassed and prevented from observing the vote independently.In response, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying American diplomats would no longer be welcomed at polling stations in Russia.Despite the omnipresent news media coverage, some people on the streets still had to think a minute about the main contenders for the White House.\u201cYesterday on the radio I heard that some woman is running, what is her name, Clinton?\u201d said Daniil Protasov, a student at a dental school. \u201cI know Trump, he is against migrants and homosexuals and Clinton is all about hatred of Russia.\u201dThe chattering classes, who would like a more open system in Russia, were dismayed that the tenor of the campaign gave the Kremlin the opportunity to paint Western democracy as a chaotic mess, contrasting it with the orderliness of the Russian political system. Never mind that the Kremlin has been accused by the White House of intervening in the American campaign, doing its best to create the appearance of chaos.Still, various people heading home through the early dark, cold winter Tuesday evening found little to engage them.\u201cI don\u2019t sympathize with either Trump or Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Yelena Arakcheeva, 55, a manager in the communal services industry. \u201cI am more interested in Russian politics, but it seems that for our media the U.S. election is more important.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For example, today I don\u2019t have a brain tumor! My children can be obnoxious, but they\u2019re not (as far as I know) plotting ways to trigger my life insurance policy! There\u2019s always tomorrow, of course, but right now things look good. I\u2019m the Queen of Low Expectations, and proud of it.Many of us seem to want much, much more, and the distance between reality and our expectations is making us miserable. So we live in a state of perpetual disappointment, ping-ponging between wild self-blame (\u201cEveryone loves being home with their infant, except me!\u201d) and virulent finger-pointing (\u201cIf my parents just gave me a million for my emu farm, I wouldn\u2019t be living in their basement\u201d).

Selling all her textbooks the first semester of college so that she could fund the little extras, and ignoring plummeting grades? Yes.

So she set about changing her life.There is all the usual advice about prioritizing debt and scissoring credit cards, but even for those of us who are not compulsive spenders, there are some helpful tidbits. For example, I never realized there are so many places online to sell the useless junk I\u2019ve accumulated. I have never straightened my own hair, so why do I own three hair straighteners? A crock pot just arrived, for all those tasty dinners I\u2019ll come home to after a hard day at the office, although I don\u2019t go to an office and in fact barely leave my house.

Greutman made me capable of saying goodbye to my dreams of being a domestic goddess with straight hair and a concert career ahead of her. Facebook\u2019s buy-sell page is my best friend \u2014 and that has added to my peace of mind.While I could do without the barrage of F-bombs on every page, the counterintuitive approach to happiness makes sense to me.

{"Headline": "Not Your Grandmother\u2019s Wisconsin", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byMilwaukee \u2014 I love telling people I\u2019m from Wisconsin. Maybe it\u2019s my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal elite, out of touch with Real America. I like fulfilling all the Wisconsin stereotypes. I love cheese and cheese curds, of course. I love our sports teams out of a vague sense of homerism. And my accent (all hard A\u2019s) comes out in full force after ah coupl\u2019ah beers.Mostly I love my grandma, who has called Wisconsin home for 88 years. Her parents immigrated to Wisconsin from Germany, and she started public school without knowing a word of English. She forgot most of the German her parents taught her years ago, but taught me the words to the \u201cLiechtensteiner Polka\u201d that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a Friday night fish fry.Up until Nov. 8, I still believed my state\u2019s moral baseline bent toward empathy. The Wisconsin I thought I knew, where I lived for 21 years, was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable. The state did elect Scott Walker as governor in 2010, and the Republican-led legislature gutted public-sector unions, setting off huge protests in the Capitol. But I didn\u2019t think that state would vote for Donald J. Trump, turning its 10 electoral votes to a Republican for the first time since 1984. (I mean, come on, we even voted for Dukakis.)As much as Mr. Trump won the election in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton lost it. Her campaign, which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can buy, did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin and Michigan, and instead treated those states as a given.Paul Soglin is the mayor of Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, in cerulean Dane County. He supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the Sanders campaign during the primary. But once Mrs. Clinton locked up the nomination, it was radio silence from the Clinton campaign.\u201cSince I first held elected office in the early \u201970s, virtually every presidential election, I\u2019ve been contacted, either by the candidate or by a staffer,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this to say I\u2019m important. But the point is, not only wasn\u2019t she in the state, but I never got a call, a contact, anything after the primary.\u201dPresident Obama, by contrast, made two campaign stops in Madison during the 2012 election, including a huge rally with Bruce Springsteen on the Monday before Election Day.Mr. Soglin\u2019s frustration with the Clinton campaign was apparent.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the strategy. I\u2019ve never seen an explanation for it, other than assuming that they wanted not just a victory, but a smashing victory \u2014 actually, the kind that Donald Trump had,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton did not visit Wisconsin once after the Democratic National Convention in July. Neither did President Obama or Michelle Obama. Mr. Sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, but that was not enough to gin up voters\u2019 enthusiasm.Like most of the country, my friends and family in Wisconsin were shocked that Mr. Trump won the state, and the election. My mom says she\u2019s still in denial; my dad has progressed comfortably to anger. My grandma, though, has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit. \u201cAfter listening to Donald Trump speeches about hate, I was convinced it\u2019s O.K. to hate,\u201d she emailed me. \u201cTherefore, I hate Donald Trump.\u201dThroughout the general election, the Clinton campaign\u2019s surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate Republican voters in Midwestern suburbs.Charlie Sykes is a longtime radio host in Milwaukee, who became a voice on the right for the #NeverTrump movement. After 23 years on the air, he will retire from his radio show this year. Along with being a vocal opponent of the Trump campaign, he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for right-wing media.He expressed frustration with his listenership, who, he said, had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them. While he read news from The Washington Post, Politico and National Review throughout the election, his audience seemed to glean most of its news from Fox News, talk radio and their Facebook feeds.He opened the phone lines, and the first call was Steve from Waukesha, who said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe any of it.\u201dMr. Sykes sighed. \u201cYou can\u2019t break through that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would think.\u201dHe says he is disappointed, but not surprised, to see conservative media falling in line and supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks.\u201cThis is the monster we\u2019ve created,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered. Every one of them has got a strut. Alex Jones now has a pipeline to the White House. I mean, think about this!\u201dMr. Sykes spent half of 2016 arguing that Wisconsin conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what Mr. Trump was offering his party.\u201cWisconsin conservatism has been distinctive, I think, in being aggressive but substantive, and very, very policy-oriented, and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the electorate,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump has certainly been aggressive if not very policy-oriented, and he has proved that you can run an atavistic, substance-free campaign and still win \u2014 even in the mild-mannered Midwest.The Wisconsinites I know don\u2019t like to argue about politics in general, and certainly not at the Thanksgiving table. We are creatures of habit; we don\u2019t like to make ourselves or others uncomfortable; we loathe confrontation. But this year seems to bring with it a moral imperative to have uncomfortable conversations about the very real stakes of this election. This year we may need to break the habit, worry less about being nice and talk more about what it means to be decent.An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Michael S. Rogers as the head of the National Security Administration, not the National Security Agency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Girls Can Be Anything, Just Not President", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed Contributor\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Betsy Ebeling, Hillary Clinton\u2019s best friend since childhood, recently told me of Mrs. Clinton, whom she met in the sixth grade. \u201cShe works hard, she is loyal, she listens.\u201dAnd yet, watching her concession speech on Wednesday morning, I suddenly understood.Mrs. Clinton did what good girls \u2014 women \u2014 have to: She played by the rules.She put her head down and worked hard, devoted her life to service, waited her turn, and never got angry (or at least never showed it). She made mistakes along the way, certainly \u2014 but she had the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the qualifications, the stamina, and she didn\u2019t lash out when those things were questioned. Mrs. Clinton took the high road, again and again: deflecting interruption after interruption, maintaining her momentum in the face of a man hovering over her, not responding when he called her \u201cnasty\u201d in front of millions of viewers.\u201cTo the little girls out there,\u201d she continued, \u201cnever doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.\u201dEvery opportunity except becoming president.As the saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201d The idea, of course, is that until that highest ceiling is cracked, until there is a female president, we will never change the reality that for most Americans, leadership is synonymous with maleness. I spent the first half of this election season defending myself for wanting to see a woman in office \u2014 in part because she was a woman. Yes, I believed she was the most qualified candidate. No, I didn\u2019t like all of her policies. But did it matter to me that she was female? Yes, it did.Clearly not all women agreed that it was important to elect a woman. In fact, 53 percent of white women like me voted against Mrs. Clinton, opting instead for a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault, and has been endorsed by the K.K.K. And yet, for those of us who did support her, part of the grief around Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss is symbolism.To many of us, Mrs. Clinton was representative of every woman who\u2019s been talked over or overlooked for a job, had her qualifications questioned, or been called a \u201cbitch.\u201d She was those times I was told I needed to be \u201cnice,\u201d and she stood for those women who were told they didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d like engineers (or in her case, presidential).She was representative of those things in a country where the average person finds it easier to pair words like \u201cpresident\u201d and \u201cexecutive\u201d with male names and words like \u201cassistant\u201d and \u201caide\u201d with female names. She represented female power in spite of the reality that a woman\u2019s likability is inverse to her leadership status \u2014 that is, we like her less the more she rises \u2014 while the opposite is true for men.She was running for president knowing all too well that a woman has to be twice as qualified to be perceived as once as good; and that her mistakes will be scrutinized more harshly and remembered longer than those of her male peers.It\u2019s safe to say that President Obama shattered that misperception in 2008, as thousands of young minority children finally saw somebody who looked like them staring back at them from the Oval Office.The fact is, seeing women in power matters.I spent much of Tuesday morning scrolling through my Facebook feed, noting stories of friends who had brought their children \u2014 and in particular, their daughters \u2014 to the polls to cast their votes for the first female president. Twelve hours later, my feed was like a memorial page, parents trying to find the words to explain what had happened. Her loss is not as simple as gender, but as one little girl put it through tears, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anybody like a girl president?\u201dOf course, on Wednesday after her defeat, Mrs. Clinton got up, put on her pantsuit, and kept on plugging. She didn\u2019t sulk, or throw a fit, complain, or blame anybody else. She was gracious, humble, and professional. And no doubt she\u2019ll keep fighting. Because that\u2019s what women do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "News Outlets Wonder Where the Predictions Went Wrong", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byMediatorThe country\u2019s major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong?After projecting a relatively easy victory for Hillary Clinton with all the certainty of a calculus solution, news outlets like The New York Times, The Huffington Post and the major networks scrambled to provide candid answers.With a new administration about to take shape in Washington, news executives tried to take stock of their mistakes and fix them on the fly, lest the fast-moving story leave them behind again.Though several national polls came close to capturing the final result in the popular vote \u2014 which Mrs. Clinton appears likely to win when the counting is done \u2014 all the number-crunching of state polls pointed to resounding success for Mrs. Clinton in the Electoral College.The news media\u2019s self-reflection on Wednesday brought to mind the awkward position Fox News found itself in four years ago, when it was criticized for creating an insular information bubble that led some viewers to believe Mitt Romney would defeat President Obama.That raised questions about Fox News\u2019s objectivity. Now it is mainstream news outlets, which Fox News so often portrays as liberally biased, that are facing a wave of skepticism. In some cases, the questions come from people at Fox News.\u201cA lot of media outlets made a decision sometime after the convention that Donald Trump was beyond the pale and they no longer had to observe the normal rules of journalism and objectivity,\u201d Chris Wallace, a Fox News anchor, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cI thought The New York Times was one of the worst offenders,\u201d but, he added, \u201cwe were all guilty \u2014 myself included \u2014 of kind of writing him off.\u201dThe weeks of soul-searching that are bound to follow were well underway on Wednesday.\u201cWhenever the news media gets surprised by a big story, there follows a round of questioning,\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, wrote in a note to his staff. \u201cWhat could we have done better? How did we and other news organizations underestimate the support for such an unusual, even divisive candidate?\u201dMr. Baquet praised his political team and other Times journalists for \u201cagility and creativity,\u201d citing articles about Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record in Libya.But in an interview in his office, he said, \u201cIf I have a mea culpa for journalists and journalism, it\u2019s that we\u2019ve got to do a much better job of being on the road, out in the country, talking to different kinds of people than the people we talk to \u2014 especially if you happen to be a New York-based news organization \u2014 and remind ourselves that New York is not the real world.\u201dThe NBC anchor Tom Brokaw echoed that sentiment, lamenting that for all its efforts at advancing diversity, the news media was still \u201cpretty confined\u201d to \u201cthe Eastern Seaboard.\u201dThe sense of failure was not universal, with some news executives saying that journalists by and large did their job in presenting the news and leaving it to voters to decide.\u201cYou can\u2019t say that this campaign was undercovered or that this result is because of some failure to report on these candidates,\u201d said David Rhodes, the president of CBS News. \u201cI think it\u2019s presumptuous of anybody \u2014 media or anybody else \u2014 to suggest that the reason for the result is some information failure.\u201dThat said, there was a widespread feeling that the coastal and Beltway sensibilities of many mainstream reporters left them unable to relate to the sense of anger and resentment of the core Trump voter, which led them to miss Mr. Trump\u2019s groundswell of support, some of which appeared to have been lost by polling, too.And it left them blind to the fact that the political rules to which they adhered no longer seemed to apply.Experience told them that Mr. Trump\u2019s misstatements, flaws and gaffes would prove disqualifying, which at times led them to present their journalism with a knowingness that only served to convince a large subset of voters that reporters, at best, didn\u2019t get them.At NBC News on Wednesday, sleep-deprived executives discussed how to redouble efforts to capture issues close to voters, at a time when institutions like the news media are not trusted by many Americans.\u201cWe cannot go in there with a sense that we think we know better,\u201d said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. \u201cI think that\u2019s often what happens in journalism: Some go in with a sense, from the experience they\u2019ve had, that their reporting can anticipate things. We\u2019ve got to go in with a total open mind.\u201dJournalists are also operating in a new media world \u2014 of Twitter, Facebook and the alt-right players who operate on the platforms \u2014 in which they are no longer the center of gravity.\u201cI think the larger point, and the more profound dilemma, is this new media landscape,\u201d said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker.Data journalism outlets like The Upshot have provided news organizations with compelling content offering a different presentation of journalism that shows readers the great breadth of data that can illuminate public opinion. It also has the benefit of inducing them to click early and often.On The Times\u2019s home page, a standing Upshot feature regularly told readers that Mrs. Clinton was the odds-on favorite to win the Electoral College \u2014 at times on the order of more than 90 percent \u2014 when there were stand-alone head-to-head national polls that showed a harder-fought race and, in some cases, even a lead for Mr. Trump.Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, said the model clearly indicated that Mrs. Clinton was the favorite based on polling data from several important states, including Wisconsin and Michigan.Ms. Cox said the mistake lay elsewhere; there was a \u201cfailure of communication,\u201d she said, in telling readers what the numbers actually meant \u2014 that probabilities are just that, probabilities, not guarantees.The Times did try \u2014 for example, it translated the probability of Mrs. Clinton losing into the probability of missing certain field goals in football \u2014 but Ms. Cox said there was a way to make the meaning of the numbers clearer. \u201cI think you could argue that there is room to improve how we communicate probability and uncertainty,\u201d she said.\u201cWe explained over and over again how much uncertainty there was in this year\u2019s race,\u201d said David Firestone, the managing editor of FiveThirtyEight. \u201cWe were telling people up to the very end, \u2018This is not a sure thing.\u2019\u201dMr. Firestone added that low turnout among Democrats was probably a result of voters\u2019 apathy toward Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy, and not of certainty that she would win.While he acknowledged that some of the modeling was out of step with reality, he disputed the notion that Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory spelled doom for data-driven journalism.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge demand among readers for this stuff, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to go away because Donald Trump won by a few electoral votes,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Sydney Ember, John Koblin, Michael Grynbaum and Alexandra Alter.Advertisement"}

But they left early, Ms. Baldacci said, because \u201cit was getting late, and I didn\u2019t want my mother to find out I had gone to the movies with a boy she didn\u2019t know about.\u201dMr. Militana, who said he \u201cenjoyed both our time at the theater and our kiss,\u201d was crushed a week later when Ms. Baldacci, feeling too pressured to continue their secret relationship, sent him another instant message, this one saying she could no longer see him.\u201cHe was really bummed and wanted another date, but I said no,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew I had strict parents, and I also explained that we went to different high schools, and that the whole thing was just too complicated.\u201d\u201cIt was a lot of drama, but, hey, I was just 16,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cLike any other 16-year-old, I was quick to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t right for me.\u2019\u201dThey kept in touch through Facebook when she was a student at the College of Charleston in Charleston, S.C., (she later transferred to Boston College) and he was at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y.\u201cWe spoke online maybe once or twice a year to let each other know what was going on in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that was about it.\u201dShe learned that he had become a senior operations analyst at Credit Suisse in New York, where he stayed for three years before leaving the financial industry for medical school.And he followed her career path in television, from local stations in Boston and Manchester, N.H., to the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, where she was a news and political editor from 2011 to 2014 before heading to Washington to join Mr. Blitzer\u2019s staff.In January 2015, Ms. Baldacci was still enjoying her professional life in Washington, but her personal life was another matter.\u201cI was dating a guy for a short while who just disappeared on me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very important relationship, but he just disappeared. No return phone calls, nothing. It was strange.\u201dLater that month, she received a different kind of return call. She picked up the phone, and it was Mr. Militana, reappearing from her past.\u201cI was expecting a call, but not that one,\u201d she said.He had called from Danville, Va., four hours south of Washington, while studying for a medical degree at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine in Blacksburg, Va. Her antennas were raised when he said that after graduation, he might embark on a medical rotation in Washington, and wanted to ask her thoughts on living there.\u201cIt sounded kind of odd, and I got the feeling that he was really calling just to see what I was up to,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he was trying to find out if I was dating anyone.\u201dMr. Militana, who admitted having \u201ca bit of an ulterior motive\u201d when dialing her number, was soon hearing about the man who had vanished. When she asked him for a man\u2019s perspective, the soon-to-be-doctor doled out advice that he hoped would benefit her \u2014 and him.\u201cI told her that there was no reason to keep trying to call that guy back,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Look, if he calls you again, great. If not, it\u2019s his loss.\u2019\u201d\u201cI still had feelings for Marlena,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t want to encourage her any more than I had to in terms of going after another guy.\u201dThey were soon reminiscing about their \u201cdriving school adventure,\u201d as Ms. Baldacci called it, and began chatting daily. Two weeks later, he invited her to spend a weekend at his home in Danville to cheer for a friend who would be competing in a rowing event there.\u201cI thought about it for a little while and was like, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d Ms. Baldacci said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was making this long trip to visit a perfect stranger. Despite the fact that I had not seen Ryan since high school, I still felt that I really knew him, and that he really knew me.\u201dShe took a Friday off from work and drove to see him, all the while \u201cfeeling a bit nervous about the whole thing,\u201d she said. But he put her at ease the moment they locked eyes again.\u201cHe was so much more handsome than I had remembered,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was also polite and respectful, and he even prepared homemade lemon pasta for me, which was very thoughtful.\u201d\u201cThe whole time I was there, he made me feel as comfortable as I had felt the first day we met,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like we were connecting all over again.\u201dThat weekend, they shared a second kiss.\u201cWow,\u201d Ms. Baldacci said. \u201cThat second one was even better than the first. It was an amazingly different kind of kiss, and it got me thinking that he must have had a lot of practice since the last time I saw him.\u201dAlthough thrilled, Mr. Militana knew he still had unfinished business.\u201cI wanted Marlena back in my life, to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw how wonderfully we got along that weekend, and how our personalities meshed so well, I knew I wanted to marry her.\u201dThree weeks later, he visited her in Washington and brought along a lifetime plan.\u201cWe had a really serious talk, and he told me how much he wanted our relationship to work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very sweet, very romantic talk. And I told him I felt the same way.\u201dThey dated long-distance for 15 months before Mr. Militana became Dr. Militana, receiving a medical degree in June. Later that month, they moved to Chicago, where he had begun his anesthesiology residency. \u201cMarlena has made a huge sacrifice for me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had a great life in Washington, and now we\u2019re in Chicago, where the only support system we have is each other.\u201dHeidi Nichols-Baldacci, the bride\u2019s mother, who is a registered nurse at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said she was completely unaware of her daughter\u2019s first go-round with Dr. Militana. \u201cAnd I have no idea how it even happened, because I was strict,\u201d she said. \u201cMarlena didn\u2019t listen to the rules that time, but it was a good thing.\u201dThat sentiment was echoed by the groom\u2019s father, Dr. Charles Militana, who is an anesthesiologist in New York and an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine.\u201cMarlena has brought out a contentedness in Ryan that I hadn\u2019t seen in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seems to enhance his positive qualities.\u201dThey were married Oct. 15 by the Rev. Anita Lofgren Chung, a retired Lutheran minister, during a brief ceremony at the Langham Hotel in Boston. About 130 guests gathered inside the Esplanade, a room overlooking Post Office Square, a park where the couple had posed for their wedding photos while basking in the sunshine of a crisp fall morning.Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D played on a keyboard as the bride walked down the aisle. And as the sun began to set beyond a giant glass wall of the Esplanade, crystal lanterns on both sides of the aisle shined a guiding light upon the bride\u2019s path to her waiting groom.\u201cYou met while you were taking driving lessons, not the most romantic place,\u201d the Rev. Lofgren Chung said. \u201cBut when you learn to drive a car, you have to learn a lot of rules. In marriage there are also rules: faithfulness, respect for each other, love and friendship.\u201dOn their latest adventure, they\u2019ll abide by those rules in Chicago, where Ms. Baldacci recently made a post-wedding trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles. \u201cBaldacci Militana looks real good, especially on my new driver\u2019s license,\u201d she said.Beth Jones contributed reporting from Boston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 U.S. Soldiers and 30 Afghans Killed in Kunduz Battle", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byKUNDUZ, Afghanistan \u2014 Two American soldiers and more than 30 Afghans were killed Thursday in the midst of heavy fighting around the northern provincial capital of Kunduz, officials and local residents said.The soldiers who died brought the number of Americans killed in combat in Afghanistan this month to five, compared with only four known combat deaths in the previous nine months. Two American soldiers were also wounded in Thursday\u2019s fighting, the military said.The governor of Kunduz, Asadullah Omarkhel, said 30 civilians had been killed and 46 wounded in airstrikes, which he attributed to Afghan forces, and he also said four Afghan Special Forces soldiers were killed. Local residents and other officials in Kunduz District, which includes the city of Kunduz and its outlying areas, attributed the airstrikes to the American military.A New York Times reporter counted 22 bodies brought into the city on the way to the Kunduz hospital, 14 of them children, four women, two older men and two men of fighting age. They were accompanied by a large group of protesters from the village that was hit, Boz Qandahari.The village, on the outskirts of the city, is in a Taliban-dominated area.Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, a spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, said American soldiers were in Kunduz District as advisers to an Afghan military operation. He said he could not comment on whether the American deaths were related to the reported civilian casualties, as family members and local officials claimed.\u201cFriendly forces were receiving direct fire and defended themselves,\u201d General Cleveland said. \u201cWe have no evidence at this point of any civilian casualties, but we take all allegations very seriously.\u201d He added, \u201cAlthough this was an Afghan operation advised by U.S. forces, U.S. aircraft were used to defend all of the friendly forces.\u201d An investigation is underway, he said.Gen. John W. Nicholson, the American commander in Afghanistan, expressed condolences to the families of the two American soldiers, who have not yet been publicly identified. \u201cToday\u2019s loss is heartbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite today\u2019s tragic event, we are steadfast in our commitment to help our Afghan partners defend their nation.\u201dWhile the reduced numbers of American soldiers, currently about 10,000, are ostensibly in Afghanistan on a \u201ctrain, advise and assist\u201d mission, President Obama has eased the guidelines on when the American military can actively take part in combat operations.An Afghan military source, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the news media, said that in the joint American and Afghan Special Operations mission, the troops had encountered heavy resistance and been surrounded by insurgents, and had therefore been forced to call in airstrikes.A statement from the Afghan police in the area put the number of dead Taliban fighters at 14, including a commander named Qari Mutaqi. The police also confirmed that there had been some civilian casualties but did not say how many.Governor Omarkhel, contradicting some details from American and local officials, said that \u201cAmericans were not involved in this operation\u201d and that the air support had come from Afghan Army helicopters. \u201cCivilians were killed and wounded in airstrikes and fighting between Taliban and Afghan Special Forces.\u201dThe spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, Gen. Dawlat Waziri, also said that any airstrikes had been conducted by Afghan forces. \u201cOur forces on the ground had air support, which was provided by Afghan choppers \u2014 several airstrikes were carried out by our choppers,\u201d General Waziri said. \u201cWe are aware of the reports of the civilian casualties in this operation, and M.O.D. appointed a delegation to investigate these reports. We have a group of American advisers in each operation with us, but in this operation no U.S. airstrike was carried out. All airstrikes were carried out by our own choppers.\u201dThe Taliban posted a statement on their Facebook page claiming to have killed 15 American soldiers and saying the airstrike response had killed dozens of civilians.The office of President Ashraf Ghani issued a statement blaming the Taliban for the apparent civilian casualties. \u201cThe enemies of Afghanistan used civilians and their houses as a shield in fighting with Afghan forces in Boz Qandahari area of Kunduz city, and as a result a number of civilians were killed and wounded, including women and children,\u201d the statement said.Among the injured was Mohammad Reza, whose house was bombed about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, giving him a minor head wound. He said that when he and other villagers emerged to collect the dead about 5:30 a.m. Thursday, they were struck again by helicopter gunships and jet planes.\u201cWe left the dead bodies and escaped from the area,\u201d he said, speaking near a group of bodies brought to the governor\u2019s office in Kunduz later in the day. \u201cI lost my four nephews, my father and my brother in the bombing. My wife, my brother\u2019s wife, my mother and my son were injured in the airstrike on my house.\u201dAn article on Nov. 4 about the death of two American soldiers and more than 30 Afghans in heavy fighting in Kunduz misstated, in some editions, the month that Taliban insurgents nearly overran Kunduz for a second time.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementNovember 15, 2016Brian C. KaltStephen B. PresserThe United States Constitution gives the president complete discretion in exercising the pardon power, as for example, President Gerald Ford did for President Richard Nixon, in order to spare the nation the divisive ordeal of seeing a chief executive who had, after all, twice been voted into office by the American people, further disgraced and punished.  There is a similarly powerful argument that a person, such as Hillary Clinton, who may have won the popular vote for president by an electorate well aware of her purported misdeeds connected with her use of a personal server for government emails when she was secretary of state, should not be subjected to prosecution for conduct that most of her fellow Americans seem to have condoned. This was conduct that at least one of her predecessors as secretary of state also, though to a more limited extent, engaged in.\u200bThere are two other powerful reasons for sparing a now fractious American people the protracted agony of a criminal proceeding of this nature.  One is that F.B.I. Director James Comey has already determined that the server issue did not meet the tests of criminal prosecution, and the other is that a jury, which is likely to include persons sympathetic to Hillary Clinton, would not be likely to convict in any event.  Ironically, pardoning Clinton, because it would, after all, taint her with the possibility of having behaved in a criminal manner, would be something that would also make her opponents feel vindicated, much as Nixon\u2019s detractors have maintained that if he hadn\u2019t engaged in criminal conduct, there would be no need for Ford to have pardoned him. A pardon on the server issue would be a prudent one.Should President Obama pardon Clinton for any federal crimes she may have committed?"}
{"Headline": "Snapchat\u2019s Parent Files for a Stock Offering", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017: that of Snapchat, the popular messaging service.The social network\u2019s parent, Snap Inc., has filed confidentially to go public, with an eye toward being valued at more than $30 billion, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday. That would make Snap the third-most-valuable technology company at the time of its market debut, after Alibaba and Facebook.The company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as March, though the final timing for an offering has not been determined.The confidential filing, made with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the presidential election last week, comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings. There have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than $50 million in the United States so far this year, down 41 percent from 2015, according to data from Renaissance Capital.A Snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like Google\u2019s in 2004. Still, like Google, Facebook and other tech companies, Snap\u2019s recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives, including its co-founder Evan Spiegel, to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded.Yet Snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors, as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging service\u2019s signature features. In August, Facebook\u2019s Instagram rolled out its version of the Snapchat Stories photo and video service.Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011, Snapchat has become a darling of the tech world, as it has grown from a simple disappearing-messages service into a digital video phenomenon. Its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generation\u2019s equivalent to television.It has built up its popular Stories service, in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers. And it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses, which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs, silly faces \u2014 or Taco Bell tacos, paid for by sponsors.Such has been the popularity of Snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service. Even the White House has set up a Snapchat account, and President Obama has given an interview on the company\u2019s in-house political show.Analysts have estimated that Snap, which began its advertising business less than two years ago, could reach $1 billion in sales next year, up from more than $350 million this year.Snap\u2019s financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed \u2014 if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares.Unlike some private companies, Snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets, so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware.This sets Snap apart from offerings from Square and Box. Both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders. When Square went public last November, some investors received an additional 10.3 million shares, which came at the expense of other investors.Similarly, when Box went public in 2014, some of the company\u2019s earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares.\u201cSnapchat will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the market,\u201d said Doug Bontemps, Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s managing director of corporate finance. \u201cBut Snapchat is unique. It\u2019s growing quickly, is doing some interesting things with glasses and has gotten a lot of attention. There aren\u2019t a lot of that ilk.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of days in which companies must publicly disclose their offering documents before pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors. It is 15 days, not 21.Advertisement"}

He had to muddle through the first wave of this.The false \u201cdeath panel\u201d allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end-of-life care decisions.As Dan Pfeiffer, who was the president\u2019s chief communications strategist at the time, so grimly put it to me last week, \u201cThe faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth.\u201dThings have advanced since then.

{"Headline": "Russia Prepares to Block LinkedIn After Court Ruling", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byLinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft, is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that it had breached the country\u2019s data protection rules, a sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating in the country.The case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government\u2019s hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election.Russia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes. The case began in August, before Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal.The country\u2019s push to gain greater control over its internet users is one of a number of attempts by governments worldwide to dictate how people use digital services.From China\u2019s blocking of whole swaths of the internet to Europe\u2019s efforts to regulate what can and cannot be viewed online, different regions and countries are in a battle with companies and other governments to decide how the internet will expand.Officials said the rules were aimed at protecting people\u2019s online privacy from hackers, but critics have claimed the legislation could allow Russian authorities to force companies \u2014 both local and international \u2014 to hand over sensitive information about their users.Many of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech companies, like Facebook and Twitter, also do not store data locally within Russia, but Roskomnadzor, the country\u2019s telecommunications watchdog, targeted LinkedIn for its failure to comply with the new data rules.It was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted in particular, rather than any other major social networking site. Analysts have suggested that the Russian authorities focused on the company, an also-ran in the country\u2019s social networking market, as a warning to larger tech companies.The Moscow court decision, upholding a previous ruling against LinkedIn, means the company will now be blocked from operating across the country.The ban could take effect as early as Monday, with internet service providers in Russia blocking access to LinkedIn\u2019s web address. The company, which has fewer than five million Russian users among its 467 million global users, could still appeal the court\u2019s decision.\u201cThe Russian court\u2019s decision has the potential to deny access to LinkedIn for the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,\u201d Anoek Eckhardt, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request.\u201dA number of other American tech companies like Facebook and Twitter have made efforts to expand their footprints within the country, though they have had to balance people\u2019s use of these social networks with the government\u2019s often heavy-handed efforts to gain control of digital information.Despite criticism of Russia\u2019s data protection rules, other countries, including Germany, have passed similar legislation that forces tech companies to store people\u2019s digital information on local servers.The efforts have been aimed at safeguarding individuals\u2019 personal data, though companies have been quick to voice their skepticism over such practices.In Russia, companies like Google have also faced other challenges from local incumbents like Yandex, the country\u2019s largest search engine, which have often outmuscled international rivals in their home market.Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Suspect Is Killed in Attack at Ohio State University That Injured 11", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byA student at Ohio State University intentionally rammed a car into pedestrians on a busy campus sidewalk on Monday morning and then began slashing passers-by with a butcher knife, the authorities said, injuring 11 students and faculty and staff members, and setting off panic at one of the nation\u2019s largest public universities.A university police officer fatally shot the suspect within about a minute of the attack, but the sprawling campus in Columbus, Ohio, remained on lockdown for about an hour and a half as people ran for cover and barricaded themselves in academic buildings and dorms.Investigators were looking into whether the attack was an act of terrorism and were seeking information on the student, Abdul Artan, a permanent United States resident from Somalia who was studying logistics management at Ohio State.The F.B.I. was investigating comments on Facebook indicating that he may have felt Muslims were being persecuted, an investigator said.\u201cI was kind of scared with everything going on in the media. I\u2019m a Muslim, it\u2019s not what media portrays me to be,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIf people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to think, what\u2019s going to happen. But I don\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s the media that put that picture in their heads.\u201dThe attack began at 9:50 a.m. Monday, when \u201cthis car suddenly appeared on the sidewalk,\u201d said Angshuman Kapil, a graduate student. \u201cIt was in high speed, and it just hit whoever came in front of him.\u201d The car stopped only when it rammed a concrete block, he said.The driver leapt out, the authorities said, and began attacking people with a knife. A campus police officer, Alan Horujko, 28, shot Mr. Artan after he failed to follow orders to drop his weapon, and officials credited the officer with helping to save lives. All of the wounded were expected to survive, university officials said.Six people were hit by the car, and five had stab wounds or lacerations, doctors said. They were being treated at three hospitals.No evidence has emerged that Mr. Artan had any connection or allegiance to radical ideology. Though no terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the attack, the Islamic State was updating its online audiences on the rampage on Monday.Both the car-ramming and the knife attacks are now established forms of aggression inspired by the Islamic State. An attacker in Nice, France, used a delivery truck to kill dozens of pedestrians in July, and chats between an attacker in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, and his Islamic State handler indicate he was initially told to use a car to carry out his assault that same month, before he settled on using an ax because he did not have a driving permit.The authorities in Ohio said that it was too soon to know what had motivated Mr. Artan, but that it was clear the attack had been deliberate. Mr. Artan\u2019s Columbus home was surrounded by squad cars, crime scene tape and a bomb squad truck on Monday afternoon, and police officials said they were waiting for a search warrant.\u201cThis was done on purpose,\u201d said Chief Craig Stone of the Ohio State University police. \u201cTo go over the curb and strike pedestrians and then get out and start striking with the knife \u2014 that was on purpose.\u201dThe attack, initially reported as an \u201cactive shooter\u201d by the university, stunned students who were returning to class after Thanksgiving break, leading to a 90-minute shelter-in-place warning and an admonition from campus officials to \u201cRun Hide Fight.\u201dHaylee Gardiner, a sophomore, said she was on her way to a chemistry lab when the attack occurred.\u201cI saw a bunch of people running, and when they were running, they were screaming and yelling,\u201d said Ms. Gardiner, who scrambled to a residence hall for shelter. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, I heard four or five gunshots.\u201dSean Cody, 23, from Akron, Ohio, was running late for his philosophy class, and after hearing a loud boom, he sprinted into a building to alert fellow students.\u201cThen there was a bang, a dust cloud, then shouting and screaming, and people just booking it in every direction,\u201d Mr. Cody said. \u201cThen, 30 seconds, a minute later, there were gunshots.\u201dDuring the chaos, students huddled in locked rooms, and some took to Twitter, posting photos from inside barricaded classrooms.Ohio State administrators released little information about Mr. Artan, and parts of his background remained unclear. He was admitted to the United States in June 2014 as the child of a refugee, federal officials said, and was believed to be in his late teens or early 20s. He graduated cum laude from Columbus State Community College with an associate of arts degree, officials there said. He was on the Columbus State dean\u2019s list in 2015.As Ohio State officials took stock of the attack and made plans for classes to resume on Tuesday, they said they were thankful the injuries were not more severe and were optimistic that students would come together even if investigators discovered a link to terrorism.\u201cOur campus community is extremely tolerant,\u201d Michael V. Drake, the university president, said in an interview. \u201cThe concept of branding a whole community for the act of a few leads to an intolerance that can make the world a more difficult place for all of us.\u201dThe episode was reported near Watts Hall, a building at the heart of the campus that houses materials science and engineering programs. Heavily armed SWAT teams swarmed the campus, and at one point could be seen making their way up a stairwell of a nearby parking garage.Monday\u2019s violence followed a machete attack in February at a Mediterranean restaurant in Columbus, which also ended with the police killing the suspect. The restaurant\u2019s owner told reporters that he believed he had been targeted because of his Israeli heritage.The attack on Monday was the latest mass-casualty episode over the last decade on an American college campus. Shootings at Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois University and Oikos University in California, among others, have led colleges nationwide to plan how to respond to an attack. Monday\u2019s instruction to \u201cRun Hide Fight\u201d came from a training program used by Ohio State and other groups for reacting to active shootings.\u201cWe prepare for situations like this,\u201d Dr. Drake said, \u201cbut always hope never to have one.\u201dMuslim leaders in Ohio praised the police for their response and urged the public not to make assumptions about the attacker\u2019s motives.\u201cWe as yet know nothing about the motivation of the attacker, but we do know of his Somali heritage, and that will be enough for some people to falsely link this tragic incident to the faith of Islam and to the Somali and Muslim communities,\u201d said Roula Allouch, national board chairwoman of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cWe must not jump to conclusions. It is important to let the investigators do their jobs.\u201dGov. John Kasich also praised the police response, saying it showed \u201chow much practice, how much training, how much expertise, how much coordination\u201d existed among local law enforcement agencies.\u201cWe are a strong, tough, resilient community,\u201d he said.Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus said that Monday was \u201cone of those days you\u2019re grateful for good training and great people across the board,\u201d and urged unity in the days ahead.Reporting was contributed by Travis Hoewischer, Alan Blinder, Jess Bidgood, Camilla Schick, Michael Huson, Rukmini Callimachi and Julia Preston.Advertisement"}

During a Facebook Live interview last Thursday, she talked about Trump, Putin and women\u2019s activism with Anna North, a member of the editorial board. Nadya also took questions from readers. Excerpts of that interview follow.Anna North: What inspired you to make the video, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d?I\u2019m the person who spent sixteen years in quite close relationship with Vladimir Putin. I would say \u201cintimate\u201d relationship. So I know what does it mean to live under rule of person who is a so-called \u201cstrong leader\u201d or \u201cstrong hand.\u201d Donald Trump refers a lot to that kind of politician, and he praises guys like Putin or Bashar Assad. I don\u2019t think that actually some Americans realize what consequences could be for their country because of this so-called \u201cstrong leader.\u201dI spent two years in jail just because I was singing against Putin, and I don\u2019t really want Lady Gaga or Katy Perry who support Hillary Clinton right now to end up in jail just because they are doing that. And Trump said openly in the debate that he wants to put Hillary Clinton in jail.It was the end of April when we wrote this song. I came up with this idea of portraying dystopian future, and Ricky \u2013 the producer who I worked with on the song \u2013 he expressed some worries: \u201cYeah but in your idea, you will be raped in jail, but we don\u2019t have any evidence that Trump actually sexually assaulted women.\u201dSo when tape came out, Ricky called me and he was like, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dAnna North: In the tape you mentioned, recorded in 2005, Donald Trump talks about grabbing women by the pussy. As a member of a group with \u201cpussy\u201d in the name, how do you feel about him using the word in that way?I feel like when you\u2019re talking about pussy, it\u2019s all about context. As a proud owner of pussy, I really want this word to happen just in the best possible context ever, and in the best possible situations ever. You should treat pussy with love, but not in the way how Donald Trump made it. I think it was terrible, it was misogynistic, it\u2019s not appropriate. He definitely should be disqualified from this election process just because of that tape. Because it\u2019s the most horrible thing I\u2019ve ever heard from a person who wants to be the president.Lauren Ventura: How do you feel about women\u2019s rights in Russia?I just got news that patriarchal Russian Orthodox Church came up with the idea of banning abortions. And it\u2019s frightening for me because it\u2019s going on all around the world. So if you will take a look at what\u2019s going on in United States, Donald Trump wants to ban abortions.Sadly I think there\u2019s a big chance that abortions could actually be banned in Russia. Because we really have this neo-conservative turn in our politics. And Putin who is actually just trying to make himself and his friends richer and richer, he doesn\u2019t care about ideology, he doesn\u2019t have any. He\u2019s trying to fake an ideology, and when people trying to fake an ideology, they pick for themselves conservative and ultra-right ideology.Anna North: Do you think Donald Trump is trying to fake an ideology?Definitely. He\u2019s interested in money and in his own fame. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s why he\u2019s telling you \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d because he doesn\u2019t have any prospects for the future, he doesn\u2019t have any plans. The same thing with Putin: When Putin annexed Crimea, he told people, \u201cYou will return to Soviet Union.\u201d And for a lot of people it sounded great, but in fact it was just a phrase, because in fact he doesn\u2019t care about those people.Roxy Richards: What do you think of our two-party system in the US? Do you think votes for a third party are wasted?I think for now, if I would have American passport I would definitely vote for Hillary. But in general, I think that\u2019s not a healthy situation. I would vote for Hillary right now because it seems like political system of United States are going through huge crisis right now because of Donald Trump. If you have a vote you should do everything you can just to stop him. And it means, in this situation, to vote for Hillary Clinton. But I was and I am strong Bernie Sanders supporter. And I believe that after Hillary becomes president, all those Bernie supporters \u2013 including me \u2013 will not shut up, and they will not just wait for the next presidential election because you could change a lot of things on your local level.Stephen Shepard: What do you think about WikiLeaks?I support it in general. I think the initial goal of WikiLeaks is really great. I believe that information should be free, and people have the right to have access to information. Though I couldn\u2019t really support what\u2019s going on with WikiLeaks right now, because it seems like clearly they support Donald Trump and they help Putin in this instance.David Cook: Are you concerned about Hillary calling for a no-fly zone over Syria and the potential of war with Russia and the US?I\u2019m concerned about the situation in Syria in general. I couldn\u2019t really support Hillary in her active actions in war zones. I\u2019m not a big supporter of that, and I don\u2019t support Putin when he does his actions in Syria. Instead of that, I really would like American, European countries and Russia to accept more refugees. I think it will help more than war actions. I support Hillary in that instance, because her take on that is much better than Donald Trump\u2019s take on that. But I think even Hillary\u2019s numbers on that is not enough.Natasha Tavares: What writers and artists inspire you?I think first of all I have to mention Bikini Kill and their song \u201cRebel Girl.\u201d When I heard this song, actually made us start Pussy Riot, because Pussy Riot is kind of just a cosplay version of Riot Grrrl. And we were like how could we call a \u201cgirl,\u201d and we could go \u201cpussy.\u201d It\u2019s not always the best way to call \u201cgirl\u201d but we wanted to empower this word, like how it happened with \u201cqueer,\u201d so that\u2019s why we called ourself Pussy Riot.Solina Jean-Louis: What advice would you give to young feminists in the United States and around the world?Advertisement"}

The price the family was asking was high \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than Mr. Bondar could afford as a freelance photographer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he took the money he had made from a book on Chernobyl and acquired the archive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI looked through the negatives and realized I held in my hands a huge piece of history that was mostly unknown to ordinary people, even citizens of the former U.S.S.R.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had so much propaganda from the World War II period, but here I saw an intimate look by Faminsky. He was purely interested in the people from both sides of the World War II barricades.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost of the best-known Soviet images from the war were used as propaganda, to glorify the victories of the Red Army. Often they were staged. Mr. Faminsky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images are for the most part unvarnished and do not glorify war, Mr. Bondar, 33, said, but focused on the human cost and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe real life of ordinary soldiers and people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Faminsky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family had a two-page autobiography that he dictated shortly before he died. He said that he was born in Moscow in 1914 and that his parents both served in the Red Army from 1918 until the end of the civil war. He started photographing and working in a darkroom as a teenager, joined the army in 1941 and photographed for the Soviet secret police in the city of Kemerovo. After becoming a staff photographer at the Military Medical Museum of the Red Army in Moscow, he was soon sent to the Belorussian front to document first aid and the medical treatment of wounded solders. He photographed often on the front lines, including in Crimea and throughout Poland. He often focused on medical care for soldiers and injured civilians.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I shoot during the wartime I came back to the nearest hospital to develop all my negatives and sent it to Moscow as soon as possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Faminsky wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometime I was sent back to Moscow and from there went to other locations on the frontlines of WWII.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn May 1945, he photographed the Red Army\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final assault on Berlin and sent prints to the Military Medical Museum of the Red Army. But he meticulously organized and kept the negatives, rarely sharing them with anyone. Mr. Bondar says that people on all sides of the war would benefit from seeing Mr. Faminsky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGermans should see his photos of the end of the war in Berlin, but Russians and Ukrainians need to see it, too, because we never studied anything from our past that we did wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bondar, who grew up mostly in Ukraine and now lives in Moscow with his Russian wife, the photographer Oksana Yushko.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGermans learn about the Nazis and the Holocaust in school, but we only look at what we did the best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Mr. Bondar has started scanning many of Mr. Faminsky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negatives from the end of the war in Berlin but has yet to sort through much of the work from Crimea. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can hardly imagine today that Berlin looked like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories are so short and we forget the value of peace so fast.  Maybe these photos will help remind people of that before the next war starts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Up in the Sky, Help to Keep Africans From Starving", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byFixesAndrew Mude, a Kenyan economist, has a way of explaining satellites. When he\u2019s talking to pastoralists in his country\u2019s north \u2014 people who roam the earth with a dozen head of cattle and very little else \u2014 he talks about the stars that don\u2019t act like other stars. \u201cThey\u2019re actually taking pictures of the ground,\u201d Mude says. Herders, a stargazing people, understand.Mude has figured out a way those fake stars can help. They can make it easier to assure rural Africans that they can survive a drought.Because of climate change, life has become harder each year for pastoralists. What used to be every-five-year droughts now come every other year. Each time, they leave the land more parched, with less water and grass for forage. And pastoralists have nothing to fall back on when their animals die.Wherever land cannot grow crops \u2014 it is too cold, too dry, too mountainous \u2014 people keep animals. More than 100 million of the world\u2019s poorest live this way. Among the 50 million pastoralists in sub-Saharan Africa, the average income is $2 per day and dropping.What can help them?Historically, poor herders could never insure their livestock. The transaction costs were absurd. No agent could afford to take an all-terrain vehicle across vast expanses of roadless, arid lands to find a nomadic pastoralist and certify that a $140 cow had died.Mude\u2019s program began in one Kenyan county in 2010. Today, about 16,000 families are insured; most are in Kenya, and some are in southern Ethiopia.Insurance may also help even pastoralists who are not insured. When forage dries up, a whole region is hit at once. So insurance providers inject needed cash from outside reinsurers, and the resulting economic activity can lift everyone.Commercial insurers sell the livestock insurance. But the government is trying to spread this approach by beginning to shoulder some of the cost of premiums. Kenya expects to cover 80,000 households by 2019 in the Kenya Livestock Insurance Program. But that\u2019s a tiny percentage of households that need it, and the program will cover only five cows per household.Mude said that numerous governments in Africa and parts of Asia have contacted him, eager to try the idea. So it\u2019s worth looking at how Mude and his collaborators overcame some of the toughest problems \u2014 and what still needs to be solved.What\u2019s harder is helping them understand that they should buy an invisible product that is likely to produce no financial benefit \u2014 and they should do it season after season.\u2022Shariah and insurance. Many pastoralists in the Horn of Africa are Muslim. But Shariah, or Islamic law, objects to the selling of risk, which can be considered the foundation of insurance.The company insures against every kind of loss, but livestock insurance is close to Bashir\u2019s heart. He was born in Wajir \u2014 he doesn\u2019t know exactly when \u2014 in a pastoral family. His father still lives there and owns 150 head of (insured) cattle. Bashir himself still owns cattle and goats as investments.\u2022Commercial profitability? Not soon.Insurance relies on the laws of large numbers. There is probably no bigger challenge in the insurance business than finding large numbers of customers among impoverished, uneducated, nomadic pastoralists.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to find them to verify the animal loss,\u201d said Bashir. \u201cWe don\u2019t even need to know if animal died. But we do have to sell them the policy and find them for payout.\u201d Using agents to do that didn\u2019t work very well, he said; Takaful sold only about 120 policies per season.Then the company did something different: It provided village shopkeepers in pastoralist areas with training and low-end Android smartphones with which to do most of the work. \u201cYou press a picture of a cow when you want to insure a cow. It asks for the number, and the back end calculates the premium,\u201d Bashir said.\u201cThen we started selling 2,000 to 3,000 policies,\u201d he said. Using familiar, respected storekeepers who won\u2019t be going anywhere as Takaful\u2019s agents increased confidence.Richard Kyuma, coordinator of Kenya\u2019s government program, said the program\u2019s purpose was to set the stage for unsubsidized private insurance. \u201cWe\u2019re identifying a very small number of people and covering very few animals,\u201d said Kyuma. \u201cWe want to tell people this can work, and can be used as a way of mitigating against drought. Then we will pull out slowly, and in two or three years we will have weaned them totally to commercial insurers.\u201dThis seems unrealistic. Many farmers will never buy insurance if they must pay. And without widespread acceptance, this insurance has no chance of becoming commercially viable. \u201cBreak-even depends on insuring a million animals and above,\u201d said Bashir. \u201cWe\u2019re at slightly over a tenth of that \u2014 so not even near it.\u201d\u2022An imperfect index. Satellites can tell you how much vegetation is on the ground, but they can\u2019t identify the type. Some of it is stuff animals don\u2019t eat. Mude is trying to solve that problem by crowdsourcing \u2014 asking herders to send photos of vegetation.The bigger problem is that satellite data on forage cover is only a proxy for animal death. Mude has spent years looking at actual animal death, comparing it with ground cover data to see what correlates. Nevertheless, forage data will never be a perfect proxy; in insurance-speak, that\u2019s called a high basis risk. \u201cThere can be rain in one area and none a kilometer away,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cIf it\u2019s uncorrelated, it\u2019s a lottery ticket, not an insurance policy. Andrew and I for half a dozen years have had the conversation: how do we make sure we\u2019re selling insurance and not lottery tickets?\u201dThis is a problem for the government program, Kyuma said. \u201cThere are areas where some locals are saying you should be paying, but the model is saying \u2018no, it\u2019s not the time to pay,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf people are stressed and yet this product is not responding, then we can be in a terrible fix.\u201d He said the government was working with the World Bank to improve the model\u2019s ability to predict animal death.If livestock insurance spreads to new regions of the world, each will have to begin from scratch to gather data. That means even more basis risk, at least initially. \u201cTrying to meet demand for scale without reducing the rigor of careful design \u2014 this is a particular challenge for us,\u201d said Mude.But even a flawed model has created real improvements for policy holders. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do away with drought risk, but it still works,\u201d said Barrett \u2014 to keep children betternourished and alive, to improve the well-being of families. \u201cYou can demonstrate real benefits.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The altered shape is visible only once the box is opened.The effect of the alterations on the signature shape of the 400-gram bar, which is sold across Europe, was less noticeable, a company spokeswoman said.Most consumers are unaware of the changes because the product usually looks and is priced the same \u2014 there is simply less of it \u2014 but the newer, gappier Toblerone bar felt treasonous to the brand\u2019s loyal consumers.\u201cThe key part of a Toblerone is the Alpine shape of peaks,\u201d Fiona Prince said on Facebook.The change to the 400-gram bar was made early this year, and the 150-gram version appeared in British discount stores last month.Gemma Pryor, the head of external affairs for Britain at Mondelez International, said the company had to choose between changing the shape of the bar and raising prices \u2014 a significant issue in Britain, where the economy is facing uncertainty and the value of the pound has weakened after voters backed leaving the European Union in a June referendum.\u201cWe need to make sure it remains on shelves and it\u2019s still affordable,\u201d Ms. Pryor said, adding that, \u201cit would be disingenuous to make the link between this and \u2018Brexit.\u2019 \u201dThe triangular milk chocolate bar, sold in a yellow package with red letters, has been around since 1908.

{"Headline": "How the University of Alabama Became a National Player", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byPlight of the Public UIt\u2019s only fitting that the admissions tour for the University of Alabama starts in Bryant-Denny Stadium. On game days, the campus\u2019s iconic quad \u2014 a painterly expanse of lawn, majestic trees and bell tower \u2014 becomes a crimson and white tent city of numbered tailgating plots, some with electricity.Coach Nick Saban is so revered that as rain threatened this year\u2019s sorority rush, prayers went out to \u201cLord Saban\u201d for sunshine, which brings us to the second thing Bama is famous for: Greek life. Banners flew along Colonial Drive after the August rush. One, for Alpha Omicron Pi, descended over four white pillars boasting, with a pun on the house\u2019s floral symbol, of recruiting success: \u201cWe Rose Higher Than the Rest.\u201dHow then, you might ask, did Brianna Zavilowitz, a Staten Islander with 2120 SATs and a 4.0 grade-point average, daughter of a retired N.Y.P.D. detective and an air traffic controller, with zero interest in pledging and middling enthusiasm for football, wind up in Tuscaloosa for college?This was not the capricious choice of a freckle-faced teenager, which she is. Rather, the reason she turned down the University of California, Berkeley, and canceled her Columbia University interview (\u201cI figured I didn\u2019t want to waste his time\u201d) reveals the new competitive ethos in public higher education: Think big and recruit.Ms. Zavilowitz first noticed the university on Facebook. A few clicks and Bama was omnipresent. Pop-ups, emails and literature piqued her interest. She visited, took the bus tour, was tickled by the Southern hospitality. Her mother appreciated detailed parent information suggesting \u201ca well-oiled machine.\u201d There was more: a full-tuition scholarship. \u201cMy mom kept telling me not to look at the money,\u201d said Ms. Zavilowitz, chatting in red Alabama footies. \u201cBut it definitely helped.\u201d Roll, Tide, roll.With state funding now just 12.5 percent of the university\u2019s budget, campus leaders have mapped an offensive strategy to grow in size, prestige and, most important, revenue. The endgame is to become a national player known for more than championship football. Berkeley, the University of Michigan and University of Virginia are the schools \u201cwe compare ourselves against,\u201d said Kevin W. Whitaker, Alabama\u2019s interim provost,Alabama has invested heavily to lure students like Ms. Zavilowitz, who does not qualify for federal financial aid. The university is spending $100.6 million in merit aid, up from $8.3 million a decade ago and more than twice what it allocates to students with financial need. It also has hired an army of recruiters to put Bama on college lists of full-paying students who, a few years ago, might not have looked its way.Each year, about 18 percent of freshmen leave their home state for college in another. They tend to be the best prepared academically and most able to pay, said Thomas G. Mortenson, senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education, who tracks this data. Achieving students are likely to be bound for successful lives, enhancing their alma mater\u2019s status and, the hope is, filling its coffers with donations. Schools want them.Merit aid given to achievers has a magnetic effect. \u201cIf we recruit five students from a high school, we will get 10 students the next year and they may not all be scholarship students,\u201d said Stuart R. Bell, president of the University of Alabama.Instead of layoffs and cuts, some public universities facing budget challenges are following this blueprint for survival: higher charges to students, and more of them. Nowadays, the real money comes from tuition and fees. The average for four-year public colleges rose 81 percent in constant dollars between 2000 and 2014. At Alabama, tuition and fees have about doubled in the last decade, to $10,470 for residents and to $26,950 for nonresidents.Even when it awards full-tuition scholarships, the university makes money \u2014 on dorm rooms and meal plans, books, football tickets, hoodies and school spirit items like the giant Bama banner Ms. Zavilowitz and her roommates bought for the blank wall in the suite\u2019s common area. All told, these extras and essentials brought in $173 million last year \u2014 on top of $633 million in tuition and fees, up from $135 million in 2005.\u201cI hate very much to use this analogy, but it\u2019s like running a business,\u201d Dr. Whitaker said.The impact of this strategy is visible on campus, where pristine brick Greek Revival buildings seem like toy models slipped from boxes and set on green plots amid curvilinear streets of fresh black asphalt. In the past decade, the university has added 64 buildings, including an engineering research quad with labs for testing combustion engines and large-scale structures (a \u201cshake table\u201d simulates earthquakes).\u201cThe university must have campus facilities that are competitive to meet student enrollment goals,\u201d according to the 2014-15 financial statement. Gleaming new labs await researchers, and there are plans to expand graduate programs and hire 300 to 400 new faculty members in the next five years. Around Tuscaloosa are cranes, fenced-off construction zones and new apartments (8,270 additional beds since 2012). The parking lots are license-plate bingo heaven.Ambition has its costs. As colleges adopt enrollment management strategies like aggressive recruiting and merit aid, the traditional role of public colleges is changing, said Stephen Burd, senior policy analyst at the think tank New America. This is leaving state residents and lower-income students with \u201cno four-year schools where they can go in an affordable way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is less aid for low-income students and there are fewer seats\u201d as colleges favor those who already have an advantage.Alabamians are now just 43 percent of the student body. On a campus bus tour crowded with out-of-state students and parents, a senior in a red dress, black heels and pearls (a guide uniform) offered that fact as a selling point.\u2022\u201cWhat happens when states stop funding higher education altogether?\u201d he asked. Politicians have made college affordability a talking point, but education experts like Mr. Mortenson doubt that election-year proposals will reverse the trend, at least any time soon.Overall enrollments have been dropping since 2010. That has all but the nation\u2019s top schools battling for students. Alabama may be a standout example, but across the country university flagships and even regional campuses once focused on serving nearby counties are extending their reach. Arizona State University, Oregon State University and Utah State University have amped up online programs (Starbucks reimburses employee tuition for A.S.U. Online degrees), expanded their campuses, are building or buying satellite campuses and, in the process, significantly raising enrollments.When states suffer budget woes, others feast. \u201cStress in California,\u201d said Kent Hopkins, vice president of enrollment management at A.S.U., \u201cis definitely an advantage as we talk to California students and their parents.\u201d Enrollments from California are up 46 percent in six years. It might be ugly, but once-staid public universities \u201care doing what private colleges have done for a long time,\u201d said Kevin W. Crockett, president of enrollment management at Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a higher education consulting firm. They are asking, \u201cWhat is the appropriate price point for students to cross state lines?\u201dMiami University of Ohio got on board for fall 2010, announcing a scholarship \u201cguarantee\u201d with an ACT of 26 and a 3.7 G.P.A. The university had fallen \u201cseveral hundred\u201d short of the freshman goal, said Susan K. Schaurer, assistant vice president for enrollment management and director of admission. \u201cOur mantra had been to accomplish, but do so humbly and quietly,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are thrust into an incredibly competitive higher education landscape, you have to shift that thinking.\u201dOver the next 18 months, Miami hired two national recruiters and bought contact information from the College Board and ACT for students around the country instead of tapping the usual feeder schools. With its classical arches, tranquil courtyards and liberal arts curriculum, it is often mistaken for a private college, which it is capitalizing on, reaching out to families \u201cseeking that private school experience,\u201d Ms. Schaurer said. Applications are up 62 percent since 2010; two-thirds now come from out of state. Last year, for example, 41 students applied from Greenwich High School in Connecticut and 33 from Mira Costa High School in California.With its success in drawing more students, Miami has walked back on merit aid; there are still scholarships, but the guarantee is gone and, as of this fall, the qualifying ACT score is higher. These days, Ms. Schaurer said, \u201ca student with a 26 ACT is really below average.\u201d Miami now has seven recruiters.The University of South Carolina has 20. Since it hired someone to recruit in Massachusetts, applicants from that state have jumped, from 335 in 2010 to 881 last year, and enrollments have nearly tripled, from 57 to 156; Massachusetts now ranks eighth as a source of out-of-staters to the Columbia, S.C., campus. Over all, applications from out-of-state students are now double those of residents.Recruiters are shaking up college conversations, said Paul C. Kaser, a counselor at the Bergen County Academies, a public magnet school in New Jersey where nearly half the seniors are National Merit Scholars, finalists, semifinalists or commended students, and parents and students meet counselors with Excel spreadsheets in hand. \u201cThere might be an old stereotype of public universities not caring and just looking at numbers,\u201d he said, but their recruiters \u201ccome to our school to be on panels, to host luncheons.\u201d They respond to emails within hours. As a result, students are now at universities that \u201cwere not even on our radar five years ago.\u201d When he first mentioned Alabama four years ago, he recalled, \u201cthe parents said, \u2018Alabama!?\u2019 I said, \u2018Hear me out.\u2019\u201dOne student starts a pipeline. Five graduates of the Academies are now there.The University of Alabama has 45 recruiters \u2014 36 outside of Alabama, including Dee McGraw-Hickey, a Tuscaloosa native living on Long Island. Last spring, she tweeted as her recruits committed. In August, she held a send-off lunch at her home with sweet tea, lemonade and a game of corn hole in the backyard. Her schedule includes 80 events between September and Thanksgiving. She loves to mention merit aid at them because so many from her region \u2014 New York City, Long Island and Connecticut \u2014 qualify, giving Alabama a competitive edge.\u201cEverybody wants the kids from the Northeast and California,\u201d according to Mr. Burd of New America. \u201cThey are wealthy and they tend to be good students.\u201dIn the past six years, in Ms. McGraw-Hickey\u2019s region, applications to Alabama rose from 193 to 903. At Alabama, recruiting assignments go all the way to the top. Dr. Bell, the president, routinely travels to meet parents and students, recently telling a young man in Dallas not to visit campus without stopping by. \u201cHe came to my office on Friday with his dad,\u201d Dr. Bell said.Raising alumni money for academics, much as the Crimson Tide Foundation has cultivated athletic boosters, is on Dr. Bell\u2019s wish list. \u201cThat is an area we are going to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a culture shift.\u201dIt\u2019s one that more are making.While most public universities have sat back as privates landed eye-popping donations, that\u2019s changing. As dusk settled over New York City, the Empire State Building was lit up in green and gold, the colors of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va. Uptown, over miniature Virginia ham sandwiches, the college thanked 400 local donors who helped to raise $52 million. A new $1 billion campaign has as a goal to secure donations from 40 percent of its alumni. This year, donor dollars covered 12.8 percent of William & Mary\u2019s budget; 11.8 percent came from the state. In 1980, state money provided nearly 43 percent of the budget.It is no accident that states with among the largest drops in state allocations since 2008 \u2014 Arizona (down 56 percent), South Carolina (down 37 percent) and Alabama (down 36 percent), according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \u2014 have entrepreneurial public campuses trained on growth. Those same states also had the greatest net gain in students: More entered the state to attend their four-year public institutions than left to study elsewhere, according to fall 2014 data, the most recent available.New Jersey has long struggled to draw students. It had the second largest net loss in students, after Illinois. Rutgers officials noticed. An honors college, another popular recruiting tool, opened at the New Brunswick campus last year in a new building with stained glass windows, carpeted dorm rooms and light-filled social spaces, including a coffee bar with fireplace. Campus recruiting goals are modest \u2014 7 percent more out-of-state students and 2 percent more international students for next fall \u2014 but officials certainly want to keep the likes of Daniel Ferioli from Hillsdale, N.J., with a 2300 SAT and 3.98 G.P.A., from leaving.\u201cWe have been losing top academic talent to other states,\u201d said Matt Matsuda, academic dean for the honors college. Halting that \u201cis something that from the president\u2019s office on down has been a priority.\u201d Mr. Ferioli turned down Georgetown for Rutgers, reasoning that with plans for an M.B.A. from Harvard or Wharton the honors college offered a similar path at a better price. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth paying all that money for Georgetown if I would end up in the same place.\u201dJillian Mazon, too, had weighed college options carefully. When we met before classes began in August, she was still getting used to the South (\u201cEveryone calls you ma\u2019am\u201d) and the serious sorority rush (35 parties in seven days; she\u2019s in Delta Gamma). It was 96 degrees, and unbearably humid for a Burlington, Conn., native. She showed me her dorm room. Over the desk was a map of Connecticut made by one of her six best friends; arrows radiated from a heart with the distance to each one\u2019s college. She has gone the farthest: 1,135.6 miles.An organized person whose closet is arranged by color, Ms. Mazon started her college list in eighth grade and toured 26 campuses. Her mother liked Duke, but she was certain after two visits that Vanderbilt was her top choice \u2014 until the full-tuition scholarship and admission to the honors college came from Alabama. She didn\u2019t apply elsewhere. \u201cI would never want to be $70,000 a year in debt,\u201d said Ms. Mazon, who plans a career in finance.For Ms. Mazon, whose mother is a teacher and whose father heads maintenance at an assisted living complex, graduating nearly debt-free put Alabama alongside prestigious privates in her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am at a disadvantage,\u201d Ms. Mazon said, leaning against a crimson padded bench, green toenails slipped into flip-flops. \u201cHow many Alabama alumni are out there compared to Harvard? My freshman class is 8,000 kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThat network is so extensive, it is insane.\u201d\u2022To critics who say public universities are shirking their public service role, Dr. Bell counters that enrolling out-of-state students seeds the Alabama economy with talent. It\u2019s not uncommon for students to settle in the state of their alma mater \u2014 \u201cone of the biggest drivers of growth in our state,\u201d he said.But Natasha Levitin, daughter of computer programmers, is looking forward to \u201cgoing home\u201d for a job as an analyst at Wells Fargo in New York City after graduation this spring. \u201cI was just looking for the school that was the best bang for the buck,\u201d she said.When she matriculated, she had not grasped the culture of the campus. \u201cI had never seen a Confederate flag until I came down here,\u201d she said. Then there was the dominance of Greek life. She had known a sorority was not for her. But neither was she prepared for the protests and national attention after the student newspaper reported the exclusion of black women from sororities, partly because of pressure from the Machine, a secret society that controls Greek life, to block pledges based on skin color.\u201cSeeing it happen my freshman year that black girls are not allowed in sororities because they are black \u2014 it was embarrassing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all over the news.\u201d Suddenly, she had to defend her choice of Alabama to friends on social media.The campus is now 11 percent African-American. It was 15 percent in 2000. The state is 27 percent black.When I asked Ms. McGraw-Hickey how diversity concerns figured in her recruiting, she said it rarely comes up. \u201cI feel like to me the campus is diverse in so many ways,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cYou see so many students from all over the country, from different religions, different racial backgrounds.\u201dHow a school with deep Southern history builds a modern national identity is an open question. To students from the urban North, the oft-evoked appeal to Bama \u201cpride\u201d and \u201ctradition\u201d may seem more like stubborn adherence to parochial views than something rich to rally behind. More than just ACT scores and G.P.A.\u2019s, growth in stature is also about extending cultural boundaries.Diluting ties to home states and communities, and filling classrooms with students from around the nation, can free ingrained perspectives.On the other hand, it may transform these entrepreneurial public players \u2014 the pathway to better fortune for generations of state residents \u2014 into yet another national brand for those with resources. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you can travel around the country and you see the same suburban stores everywhere you go, the same chains,\u201d said Mr. Burd of New America. \u201cYou don\u2019t diversify by only bringing in the most privileged people. You just get people who have pretty much the same values.\u201dMr. Mortenson understands the pressures for revenue. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what kind of future are we building for the country?\u201dLaura Pappano is writer-in-residence at Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.Advertisement"}

She\u2019s voting in her 16th presidential election.(Stevenson. Kennedy. Johnson. Humphrey. McGovern. Carter, twice. Mondale. Dukakis. Clinton, twice. Gore. Kerry. Obama, twice. You may spot a trend.)Born in 1911, Mrs. Orbach emigrated from Poland shortly after World War II. She became an American citizen by 1955, and voted in her first presidential election here the following year.The idea of having and using her voice, without facing persecution, was novel.\u201cIn Poland, it was a whole different system,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially for Jewish people, who weren\u2019t treated like everybody; they were always beneath.\u201dWhen she stepped behind the curtain to vote in the 1956 race, things felt different.\u201cI was one with the people: I was different, I was Jewish, but I pushed the button,\u201d she said. \u201cI had my idea, and I was treated nice no matter what. You had your privacy and you were allowed to think what you wanted to think.\u201dSo exercise your right \u2014 it\u2019s one that many people in this world do not have.Here\u2019s what else is happening:In a campaign season marked by bluster and upheaval, Election Day weather is shaping up to be wonderfully serene.Crisp in the morning, with a warm autumnal sun to accompany afternoon voters to the ballot box.What do you think?

{"Headline": "Jewish Voters, Prized in Swing State Florida, Tell What Drives Them", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byDELRAY BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Some pro-Clinton videos circulating in this part of South Florida do not feature Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Instead, the praise comes from Shimon Peres, Henry Kissinger and the son of Yitzhak Rabin.Republicans are sending around cards showing a glowering Hillary Clinton, an Iranian flag and missiles, and saying: \u201cThe Obama/Clinton Iran Deal Puts Israel at Risk and Makes Us Less Safe.\u201dThen there is the Facebook ad and robocall campaign puckishly titled \u201cWWJD.\u201d It answered the question many Jews here were wondering: What would Joe (as in Lieberman) do?Both campaigns see a path to victory in Florida, the largest swing state, if they can engage the right demographic groups, from the Cuban refugees in Miami to the rural whites in the panhandle. But one of the most prized groups of voters in the Sunshine State is its hundreds of thousands of Jews, whose interest in the race often goes beyond the usual questions of Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment or Donald J. Trump\u2019s temperament.In interviews, Jewish voters here have said their votes were motivated by the same issues that matter to much of the rest of the electorate, such as immigration, the makeup of the Supreme Court and, perhaps more so this year, the character of the candidates.But layered on top of that are specific concerns over support for Israel; the nuclear arms agreement with Iran, which is unpopular with Jewish conservatives; and unease over anti-Semitism that has surfaced among segments of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\u201cTrump has become their champion,\u201d said Rabbi Mark Winer, the president of the Florida Democratic Party Caucus of American Jews. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s disqualifying in itself.\u201dAt an early-voting site on Friday in Delray Beach, where an almost hourlong line had formed on a sidewalk, Al Drelich showed up in his red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. He gave his spare hat to a Trump volunteer, and stayed around to talk up Mr. Trump and to debate the many Clinton supporters.He bristled at the criticism he had heard about Trump supporters, saying they were wrongly maligned as racist. Plus, he seemed to be saying, Jews should know better than to blame anti-Semitism on Mr. Trump.\u201cThat will be there forever. It will never change,\u201d Mr. Drelich, a retired mortgage underwriter in his 80s, said. \u201cWe survived, and we will survive. But Trump is better for Israel than Hillary.\u201dClinton supporters argued that her support for Israel was clear. Beyond that, they said, she is simply more qualified to be president.\u201cShe\u2019s a decent, educated, well-prepared human being, who respects people\u2019s rights and who conducts herself like a lady,\u201d said Ken Sommers, 73, a retired dentist from Long Island.Benna Golub, 69, a retired special education teacher, conceded that she had to think hard before picking Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders in the primary. But there was no wavering, she said, when she voted for Mrs. Clinton again in the general election: \u201cShe\u2019s more stable, more experienced, more capable.\u201dEarly-voting turnout in South Florida has been higher than it was in 2012, and Democrats are hoping that Jewish support can counterbalance the Republicans who have been flooding voting sites elsewhere in the state. More than six million Floridians had voted as of Sunday morning, according to state statistics, with Democrats holding a slight edge. (Whom these voters chose will not be known until Tuesday.)For decades, Jews brought their politics with them from the Northeast as they filled up South Florida\u2019s many condominiums and subdivisions for middle-class retirees. Mrs. Clinton is widely expected to carry a majority of the Jewish voters in Florida, just as President Obama and other Democratic nominees have done.Republican Jewish activists believe they have a good chance of helping Senator Marco Rubio win his race for re-election against Patrick Murphy, a Democratic congressman from South Florida. But Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, which has been divisive even among Jewish Republicans, has tempered those ambitions for the presidential campaign.\u201cThere was hope that the Iran arms deal would provide an avenue, but that\u2019s frankly drowned out by the concern about Trump,\u201d said Kenneth D. Wald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, who studies Jewish political behavior. \u201cThe level of alarm about Trump is very high.\u201dWhile Palm Beach County is one of the centers of Jewish life in the United States, it is also notorious in the history of American, and American Jewish, politics. Its confusing \u201cbutterfly\u201d presidential ballot in 2000 helped lead to the defeat of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who would have been the country\u2019s first Jewish vice president. Thousands of voters in the area mistakenly voted for Pat Buchanan, the ultraconservative candidate deeply disliked by many Jews. The Supreme Court ultimately ended a statewide recount of votes, giving the election to George W. Bush.Mr. Lieberman later became an independent and a free agent of sorts, endorsing Senator John McCain, a Republican, over Mr. Obama in 2008 and speaking at that year\u2019s Republican National Convention. That, Jewish Democratic leaders believe, made it all the more potent when he announced this summer that he was backing Mrs. Clinton, citing their years in the Senate together and saying she would be good for bipartisanship.Whether Mr. Lieberman\u2019s endorsement, and the numerous Facebook ads and robocalls touting it, has influenced anyone is not clear. It certainly has not moved Eddie Rosianu, 88, who said he had been a steadfast supporter of the Republican Party since he arrived in the United States from Romania by way of Israel.\u201cEisenhower brought me here, and gave me a good future, a good family,\u201d said Mr. Rosianu, a jewelry manufacturer whose business was on 47th Street in Manhattan for nearly 40 years.His vote for Mr. Trump was based on more than party loyalty. \u201cHe has charisma,\u201d he said. He also recalled a yearslong process to get him into the country, but now, echoing Mr. Trump, he said immigrants were entering more easily and with less scrutiny today. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who they are,\u201d he said.And as it is November, Jeff Goldings, a 50-year-old freelance writer and editor who had come to the Palm Beach County Democratic Party\u2019s office to volunteer with his mother, expressed a simple feeling many Floridians, Jewish or gentile, have been feeling of late.He complained about the commercials on television and radio that \u201cbombard you every day,\u201d the constant phone calls and canvassers knocking on doors, trying to eke out every swing state voter they can.\u201cYou can\u2019t escape it \u2014 it\u2019s everywhere, on every medium,\u201d Mr. Goldings said. \u201cI think people need a break.\u201dJonathan Mahler contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: More Than 100 Million Trees Are Dead. What Now?", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.California\u2019s trees are dying at an alarming rate.Those numbers have startled California officials and scientists while adding urgency to a long-simmering debate over what should be done about it.The tree deaths have been concentrated in the southern and central Sierra Nevada, but experts warn of increasing deaths in forests all the way up to the Oregon border.But some ecologists say the emphasis on fire danger and its attendant demand for increased logging are misplaced.Do everything necessary to eliminate risks to humans, these experts argue, but otherwise leave dead trees alone to decompose or go up in flames and create new habitats. Far from being disasters, wildfires can be an adrenaline shot for biodiversity, they say.The tree die-off may ultimately signal a transformation of California\u2019s forest ecosystems as a result of climate change, many scientists say.

Alcatraz, they said, would be developed as a cultural and education center.The government refused but took an approach of noninterference.A rotating group of American Indians stayed in the former prison buildings, without fresh water or phone service, for 19 months before being removed by federal marshals on June 11, 1971.The takeover generated wide news media attention and awakened many Americans for the first time to the plight of Native Americans.In the decade that followed, American Indian activists occupied dozens of other locations, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

But there was one bit of good news: Maggie and her baby are doing fine. As Dr. Carson explained, the distress was caused from her placenta separating from her womb, and she would be fine after a little rest. Cue the car-crushing.We, along with Maggie and Sasha, visit their fresh graves in this episode, and there is even a brief moment of poignancy until Gregory blunders in to remind us all, in the broadest possible strokes, that he is garbage.Vaguely racist? Check. He seems to confuse Sasha with another black Hilltopper before Jesus corrects him. Narcissistic and selfish? Check. He doesn\u2019t care about the pregnant Maggie\u2019s recovery, only that she and Sasha leave as quickly as possible. Because he also happens to be a coward \u2014 we watch him groveling later. He\u2019s sexist, too, essentially propositioning Sasha before trying to deny it.All that\u2019s left for a Yahtzee is betrayal, and wouldn\u2019t you know? He tries to give up Sasha and Maggie to the Saviors, only he ends up giving away his Scotch instead.Until everything went sideways last season, Maggie seemed set to take over for Deanna as the prime minister of Alexandria. But I\u2019m intrigued by the possibilities of her assuming control of a different colony instead. At the very least, one would think it increased the chances of a broader anti-Negan coalition forming soon.But first, a brief intermission for roller skating and puppy love. Events had forced Enid and Carl to put their budding relationship on the back burner until Sunday\u2019s leisurely road trip. Was it silly and a little too convenient that they happened to stumble upon a couple pairs of skates that happened to fit, allowing them to frolic down the highway? Yes. But it was also the sort of simple sight of people being people that I wish this frequently miserablist show would provide more often. A glimpse of humanity that, however brief, reminds us what everyone is fighting for.The idyll ended with their arrival at the Hilltop, where they shared a kiss before going their own ways. Enid reunited with Maggie and Sasha, who sent Jesus off to find Negan. Carl continued his own mission to so the same.He ended up stowing away in the same Savior truck as Jesus, an unplanned but fortuitous development. Based on Carl\u2019s dart-throwing earlier in the episode, he could use the extra set of eyes.\u2022 I\u2019m intrigued by the rift that\u2019s been forming between Carl and Rick, particularly as the younger Grimes prepares to enter Negan\u2019s orbit. We already know Carl won\u2019t kill Negan, at least not yet \u2014 Negan\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon. Carl would be the ultimate lever in Negan\u2019s ongoing subjugation of Rick, but he already has one captive in Daryl. So might he take another tack? Negan seemed to take a shine to Carl in the premiere; could he embrace him instead? Wouldn\u2019t that be the ultimate way to kneecap Rick? To turn his own son against him?\u2022 What happened to those guys Maggie ordered to close the gate? Did they just run away? Or what?\u2022 What did you think? Is Maggie out of the woods? Does Gregory have a few more duplicitous moves left? How many Camaros have you crushed in a jealous rage? (That apparently wasn\u2019t Maggie\u2019s first flattened car.)

The episodes didn\u2019t simply follow the Robertsons around in their daily lives; the producers would often sketch out the parameters of a situation and have the family live it.

Trump? Think again.Those incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media\u2019s outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States.\u201cThey should have done this way earlier,\u201d said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook\u2019s fastest-growing markets. \u201cWe already saw the warning signs of this years ago.\u201d\u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook\u2019s global reach \u2014 roughly a quarter of the world\u2019s population now has an account \u2014 is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say.Some governments are pushing back, sometimes with undemocratic consequences. Ms. Merkel has said she is considering plans to force social networks to make public how they rank news online. Some African countries have banned the use of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter before elections. Indonesia\u2019s government has closed sites that it says promote fake news, though experts say some portals were also targeted for political reasons.Facebook said on Thursday that the social network was a place for people to stay informed and that what people saw in their news feed was overwhelmingly authentic. The Silicon Valley company previously denied that it failed to deal with misinformation and said it continues to monitor the social network so that it meets existing standards.\u201cI think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way \u2014 I think is a pretty crazy idea,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told a tech conference days after the American presidential election. \u201cVoters make decisions based on their lived experience.\u201dFacebook\u2019s power is often stronger overseas than it is in the United States. In many developing countries with populations new to both democracy and social media, experts said, fake stories can be more widely believed. And in some of these countries, Facebook even offers free smartphone data connections to basic public online services, some news sites and Facebook itself \u2014 but limits access to broader sources that could help debunk fake news.One such place is the Philippines, where a spokesman for its populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared on Facebook an image of a corpse of a young girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer. Fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from Brazil. Despite the debunking, proponents of Mr. Duterte\u2019s bloody crackdown on reported drug dealers and addicts still cite the image in his defense, according to political analysts.\u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t led to empowerment of the average citizen, but empowerment of professional propagandists, fringe elements and conspiracy theorists,\u201d said Mr. Heydarian, the Philippines political analyst. \u201cVoices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of the public discourse.\u201dWhen Joko Widodo, Indonesia\u2019s president, was running for office in 2014, he was accused through social media of being a Chinese Christian and a communist \u2014 severe criticism in the deeply Islamic country. The Indonesian politician released his marriage certificate to prove he wasn\u2019t Chinese and made a pilgrimage to Mecca just before voting.\u201cThe fake news had a very big impact in our campaign,\u201d said Tubagus Ramadhan, who helped Mr. Widodo run his social media campaign during the election.While Facebook has won plaudits for allowing people in disaster zones to tell friends and families they are safe, it has also been a conduit for dangerous rumors in those situations. At the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, a false message widely distributed in Sierra Leone on Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the social network, said bathing in hot water with salt would cure and prevent the spread of the virus.Even in long-established democracies like Germany, Spain and Italy, false news reports and hate speech on social media have whipped up grass-roots populist movements, which have often targeted the recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees, to garner wider electoral support.Now, many European politicians are questioning what role social media has had in deciding what voters can and cannot see. They also have forced social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google to sign up for voluntary \u2014 so far \u2014 standards to police hate speech online.In Germany, Ms. Merkel\u2019s push to require American social network companies to publish how they rank news is intended to give voters greater control over what they read online.\u201cAlgorithms must be more transparent,\u201d Ms. Merkel has said, \u201cso that interested citizens are also aware of what actually happens with their own media behavior and that of others.\u201dOther politicians, often in more recently established democracies, are going a step further.In some African countries, including Chad and Uganda, officials cite uncorroborated security threats and fears that false results could be shared online as reasons for shutting down social media ahead of elections.Christian Echle, director of the Sub-Sahara Africa media program at Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, a German political foundation, said such actions were heavy-handed and that social media had played a role in helping voters \u2014 many located far from urban centers \u2014 to gain access to much-needed information and interact with political candidates.But, he added, a growing amount of news shared through social media was either false or biased, making it difficult for people in these often fledgling democracies to know which news outlets to trust.\u201cThere\u2019s a big, big threat \u2014 that social media will deepen existing gaps in these societies,\u201d said Mr. Echle, who is based in Johannesburg. \u201cPeople are still learning how to use social media, so many can easily fall for hoaxes.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mark Scott from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Wildfires Rage, Israel Suggests Arson and Asks for Foreign Help", "Date": "2016-11-24", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Parts of the port city of Haifa in northern Israel were ablaze on Thursday as wildfires raged through the country for a third day, devouring forests, damaging homes and prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.Asked how long Haifa was likely to be battling the blazes, Mayor Yona Yahav told reporters, \u201cThis is a question that has to be referred to God.\u201dIsraeli officials said the fires had been fanned by unusually strong winds and made worse by a dry atmosphere, but they also said they suspected that many of them had been caused by arson and negligence. Dozens of people have been slightly affected by smoke inhalation, but no serious injuries or fatalities have been reported.Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s public security minister, told Army Radio that the professional assessment was that almost half the fires were the result of arson.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the fires to \u201cnatural and unnatural\u201d causes and said that \u201cany fire caused by arson or incitement to arson is terrorism in every sense of the word, and we will treat it as such.\u201dMr. Netanyahu spoke on Thursday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who promised to send two huge firefighting aircraft.Firefighting planes and teams from Cyprus and Greece had already arrived, and the Israeli police and Foreign Ministry said that more help was on the way from Croatia, Italy and Turkey. The Palestinian Authority also sent some fire engines to tackle the fires.Israel has since added firefighting planes, but they do not have the capacity of larger aircraft like those that Russia was expected to send, nor can they operate at night.The police and emergency services have been going door to door evacuating homes, schools, two prisons, neighborhoods and, in some cases, whole communities.Noy Parati, a student at the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, described scenes of panic, with people pushing one another out of the way to evacuate. \u201cAs soon as they tell me where to go, I will leave,\u201d Ms. Parati told Israeli television, adding, \u201cEveryone is trying to escape.\u201dYael Hamer, a resident of the Romema neighborhood of Haifa, said people were leaving on foot and by car. \u201cMy house was filled with smoke,\u201d she told reporters by phone from her car, with the sirens of fire engines and ambulances audible in the background. \u201cAnd the smell,\u201d she added, \u201cit was impossible to stay there.\u201dLocal authorities in Haifa said they had set up gathering points and temporary shelters in community centers, in an auditorium and in a stadium. The police reported heavy traffic on highways around the city, and the train service to and from the city was suspended. By nightfall, about a quarter of Haifa\u2019s population of 280,000 had been instructed to evacuate.The Israeli military said that it had deployed two search-and-rescue battalions from its Home Front Command to assist evacuation efforts, and that it had called up reservists to help fight the fires.Several homes have been destroyed in recent days in the town of Zikhron Yaaqov, south of Haifa, and in Nataf, a village in the hills outside Jerusalem. Flames have also threatened Talmon, a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. And on Thursday night the police reported a fire near Shuafat, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem.The first major fire began in the forest surrounding Neve Shalom, known in Arabic as Wahat al-Salam, or Oasis of Peace, a small cooperative community about halfway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem where Israeli Jews and Arabs live together.Despite the suspicion of arson in many cases, the Israeli authorities were cautious in assigning blame. But some Israeli news organizations were labeling the wave of fires an \u201carson intifada,\u201d alluding to a Palestinian uprising.By Thursday night, Mr. Erdan said, the fires had been brought under control, though there were fears that the weather conditions could whip up the flames again.Ayman Odeh, another Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, noted that several Arab cities in northern Israel, such as Umm el-Fahm, had also been affected by the fires.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, on YouTube, Pledges to Create Jobs", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump on Monday released a two-and-a-half-minute infomercial-style video, turning to social media to deliver a direct-to-camera message in which he vowed to create jobs, renegotiate trade agreements, end restrictions on energy production and impose bans on lobbying.Mr. Trump offered what he called an update on his transition, which he said was going \u201cvery smoothly, efficiently and effectively.\u201d Reading from a script and looking into a camera, he steered clear of his most inflammatory campaign promises to deport immigrants and track Muslims and his pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWhether it\u2019s producing steel, building cars or curing disease, I want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here, in our great homeland: America \u2014 creating wealth and jobs for American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the video.Mr. Trump gave a brief middle-of-the-night speech after Hillary Clinton called him on Nov. 9. And he sat for an interview with The Wall Street Journal and an appearance, surrounded by his family, on CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last week. Since then, he has mostly been behind closed doors as he assembles a cabinet and White House team.In the video, Mr. Trump described his plans to \u201cmake America great again\u201d on Day 1, but his message seemed aimed less at the supporters who chanted that slogan at rallies and more at the Americans who remain skeptical about it.The president-elect appeared to try to emphasize his appeal to those voters at the end of the video, and he promised to provide more updates as he worked together with everyone to reach his goals.\u201cAnd I mean everyone,\u201d he emphasized.The video underscored the extent to which Mr. Trump intends to try to navigate around the traditional newspaper and television media outlets as he seeks to communicate his message to the public.Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump was using technology to communicate with the public in a format that Mr. Bush\u2019s staff would never have dreamed of doing 15 years ago, because the news media would have dismissed it as propaganda. President Obama has become adept at doing the same thing in recent years, through videos posted on Facebook and other media.Mr. Fleischer said, \u201cHe\u2019s just doing more of what President Obama successfully did, and what I\u2019m fascinated about is, what does this mean for the future?\u201dMr. Trump is also scheduled to meet with editors and reporters at The New York Times on Tuesday.But his decision to deliver a highly scripted video message suggests that he, like Mr. Obama, is eager to embrace new media opportunities. By Monday, Mr. Trump\u2019s @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account, which he enjoys using, had 15.7 million followers. Once in the White House, he will inherit @POTUS, with its 12.1 million online followers.Mr. Trump also spent Monday at his office in Trump Tower, interviewing a stream of potential Republican cabinet candidates. They included Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas; former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts; and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a Democrat.Perhaps the most interesting thing about Mr. Trump\u2019s video was what he did not say in it.On immigration, he avoided any mention of his plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico or his desire to deport immigrants here illegally, whether or not they have a criminal record. He made no mention of ending President Obama\u2019s program that grants work permits to immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children.Instead, Mr. Trump simply promised to direct the Labor Department to investigate visa abuses.The tough-talking president-elect, who has often railed against Mr. Obama and \u201cthe generals\u201d for what he often called their \u201cstupid\u201d conduct of foreign policy, said nothing in the video about fighting terrorism, confronting Russian aggression or pressuring NATO allies to pay more for their common defense.Instead, he said he would ask his top military officials for a comprehensive plan to guard America\u2019s vital infrastructure from \u201ccyberattacks, and all other form of attacks.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s other promises in the video recapped points that he made repeatedly during the campaign, offering a series of executive actions that he says he will order on his first full day in the Oval Office.Some, like his pledge to \u201cissue our notification of intent to withdraw from the trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d trade deal, will be well within his power as president to accomplish. But his additional promise to \u201cnegotiate fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores\u201d will be in the eyes of the beholder, and may not produce the results he expects.Others appear to be overblown political hyperbole, like his promise in the video to \u201ccancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy \u2014 including shale energy and clean coal \u2014 creating many millions of high-paying jobs.\u201dHe did not specify in the short video what restrictions he will lift or how that would result in \u201cmany millions\u201d of jobs. Even supporters of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which Mr. Trump has said he will greenlight once in office, do not believe it would create millions of jobs if it was built.Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Trump\u2019s more inclusive tone in the video was the latest example of a pattern he set during the campaign of dialing back his impulse for fiery speech when he felt it was in his interest.\u201cHe has said this about himself, that he knows how to be really boring when he wants to be,\u201d Mr. Fleischer said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s so self-aware about the fact that there are these two Trumps, and we\u2019re seeing more of the other one since he won.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Adolescents as Likely to Die From Suicide as From Traffic Accidents", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is now just as likely for middle school students to die from suicide as from traffic accidents.The number is an extreme data point in an accumulating body of evidence that young adolescents are suffering from a range of health problems associated with the country\u2019s rapidly changing culture. The pervasiveness of social networking means that entire schools can witness someone\u2019s shame, instead of a gaggle of girls on a school bus. And with continual access to such networks, those pressures do not end when a child comes home in the afternoon.\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that the question of suicidal thoughts and behavior in this age group has certainly come up far more frequently in the last decade than it had in the previous decade,\u201d said Dr. Marsha Levy-Warren, a clinical psychologist in New York who works with adolescents. \u201cCultural norms have changed tremendously from 20 years ago.\u201d\u201cThis graph is really surprising,\u201d said Sally Curtin, an expert at the National Center for Health Statistics who analyzed the data. \u201cWe think of traffic accidents as so commonplace.\u201dThe crossing-over point was reached in part because suicide had spiked, but also because fatal traffic accidents had declined.In 1999, the death rate for children ages 10 to 14 from traffic accidents \u2014 about 4.5 deaths per 100,000 \u2014 was quadruple the rate for suicide. But by 2014, the death rate from car crashes had been cut in half, part of a broader trend across the entire population. The suicide rate, however, had nearly doubled, with most of the increase happening since 2007. In 2014, the suicide death rate was 2.1 per 100,000.Far more boys than girls killed themselves in 2014 \u2014 275 boys to 150 girls \u2014 in line with adults in the general population. American men kill themselves at far higher rates than women. But the increase for girls was much sharper \u2014 a tripling, compared with a rise of about a third for boys.\u201cSocial media is girl town,\u201d said Rachel Simmons, the author of \u201cOdd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls.\u201d \u201cThey are all over it in ways that boys are not.\u201dStatistically, girls dominate visual platforms like Facebook and Instagram where they receive instant validation from their peers, she said. It also is a way to quantify popularity, and take things that used to be private and intangible and make them public and tangible, Ms. Simmons added.\u201cIt used to be that you didn\u2019t know how many friends someone had, or what they were doing after school,\u201d she said. \u201cSocial media assigns numbers to those things. For the most vulnerable girls, that can be very destabilizing.\u201dThe public aspect can be particularly painful, Dr. Levy-Warren said. Social media exponentially amplifies humiliation, and an unformed, vulnerable child who is humiliated is at much higher risk of suicide than she would otherwise have been.\u201cIf something gets said that\u2019s hurtful or humiliating, it\u2019s not just the kid who said it who knows, it\u2019s the entire school or class,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the past, if you made a misstep, it was a limited number of people who would know about it.\u201dWhat is more, they live in a culture of fast answers and immediate change. That compounds the pressure.\u201cFor a young girl who starts to develop breasts, hips, body hair \u2014 it\u2019s a long haul before you land,\u201d Dr. Levy-Warren said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know how you\u2019re going to look for a number of years, and a lot of kids don\u2019t know how to wait anymore. It\u2019s just so painful.\u201dShe added, \u201cThere\u2019s this collision of emotional need, social circumstances and a sense of needing an immediate answer.\u201dDepression is being diagnosed more often these days, and adolescents are taking more medication than ever before, but Dr. Levy-Warren cautioned that it was not clear whether that is because more people are actually depressed, or because it is simply being identified more than before.Jan Hoffman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No, Birth Control Coverage Won\u2019t Go Away", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byGender Politics\u201cMy phone was ringing off the hook,\u201d said Andrea Miller, the president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, who said her organization heard from some anxious women, concerned that their birth control options might become quickly and severely limited.A lot could change in the new administration. But, even with major policy changes, contraceptive access is likely to remain broad.Reproductive health care is one policy area where Donald J. Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the House and Senate could have a big impact. The Affordable Care Act increased access to women\u2019s health, and related regulation required health insurers to cover all approved forms of birth control without charging women any co-payments.The most vulnerable regulation is the requirement that health insurers cover contraception for all women without a co-payment. That rule, which has small exceptions for certain religiously affiliated employers, means that contraceptive coverage is now a standard part of health insurance. The absence of a co-payment also means that women can get costlier methods of contraception \u2014 like the IUD \u2014 without paying a lot of money for the device or for doctors\u2019 visits.A growing number of websites and apps enable women to obtain birth control without visiting a doctor. Answer these four questions to find out which one best fits your situation.That regulation could be changed without involving Congress. But it would take some time. Regulations can\u2019t be rescinded willy-nilly, and the Trump administration would need to go through a formal notice and comment period before finalizing a new rule. Mr. Trump has given no clear indication that such a policy change is a priority for him. But even if it is, and the process starts right after his inauguration, it will take months and will not affect current health plans. That means that contraception without co-payments won\u2019t go away for at least a year, maybe longer.\u201cIt is not going to be a snap-your-fingers change,\u201d said Alina Salganicoff, vice president for women\u2019s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Without the Obamacare rule in place, coverage could get patchier, and more women might have to pay for a portion of their care or face more limited choices of covered birth control methods. IUDs are relatively expensive devices, and often require a few office visits for counseling and insertion. Insurers tended to charge women more to get them than they did for comparatively less expensive birth control pills. Even some pills could get quite expensive. Co-payments for birth control, before Obamacare, varied widely.

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Is in Denial", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byCHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters were probably heartened in September, when, according to an article shared nearly a million times on Facebook, the candidate received an endorsement from Pope Francis. Their opinions on Hillary Clinton may have soured even further after reading a Denver Guardian article that also spread widely on Facebook, which reported days before the election that an F.B.I. agent suspected of involvement in leaking Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails was found dead in an apparent murder-suicide.The pope, a vociferous advocate for refugees, never endorsed anyone. The Denver Guardian doesn\u2019t exist. Yet thanks to Facebook, both of these articles were seen by potentially millions of people. Although corrections also circulated on the social network, they barely registered compared with the reach of the original fabrications.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief, believes that it is \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d that \u201cfake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of content, influenced the election in any way.\u201d In holding fast to the claim that his company has little effect on how people make up their minds, Mr. Zuckerberg is doing real damage to American democracy \u2014 and to the world.He is also contradicting Facebook\u2019s own research.All of this renders preposterous Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s claim that Facebook, a major conduit for information in our society, has \u201cno influence.\u201dI\u2019ve seen this firsthand. While many of my Facebook friends in the United States lean Democratic, I do have friends who voted for Mr. Trump. But I had to go hunting for their posts because Facebook\u2019s algorithm almost never showed them to me; for whatever reason the algorithm wrongly assumed that I wasn\u2019t interested in their views.Content geared toward these algorithmically fueled bubbles is financially rewarding. That\u2019s why YouTube has a similar feature in which it recommends videos based on what a visitor has already watched.Of course, fake news alone doesn\u2019t explain the outcome of this election. People vote the way they do for a variety of reasons, but their information diet is a crucial part of the picture.After the election, Mr. Zuckerberg claimed that the fake news was a problem on \u201cboth sides\u201d of the race. There are, of course, viral fake anti-Trump memes, but reporters have found that the spread of false news is far more common on the right than it is on the left.The Macedonian teenagers found this, too. They had experimented with left-leaning or pro-Bernie Sanders content, but gave up when they found it wasn\u2019t as reliable a source of income as pro-Trump content. But even if Mr. Zuckerberg were right and fake news were equally popular on both sides, it would still be a profound problem.Only Facebook has the data that can exactly reveal how fake news, hoaxes and misinformation spread, how much there is of it, who creates and who reads it, and how much influence it may have. Unfortunately, Facebook exercises complete control over access to this data by independent researchers. It\u2019s as if tobacco companies controlled access to all medical and hospital records.These are not easy problems to solve, but there is a lot Facebook could do. When the company decided it wanted to reduce spam, it established a policy that limited its spread. If Facebook had the same kind of zeal about fake news, it could minimize its spread, too.If anything, Facebook has been moving in the wrong direction. It recently fired its (already too few) editors responsible for weeding out fake news from its trending topics section. Unsurprisingly, the section was then flooded with even more spurious articles.In addition to doing more to weed out lies and false propaganda, Facebook could tweak its algorithm so that it does less to reinforce users\u2019 existing beliefs, and more to present factual information. This may seem difficult, but perhaps the Silicon Valley billionaires who helped create this problem should take it on before setting out to colonize Mars.Facebook should also allow truly independent researchers to collaborate with its data team to understand and mitigate these problems. A more balanced newsfeed might lead to less \u201cengagement,\u201d but Facebook, with a market capitalization of more than $300 billion and no competitor in sight, can afford this.Facebook may want to claim that it is remaining neutral, but that is a false and dangerous stance. The company\u2019s business model, algorithms and policies entrench echo chambers and fuel the spread of misinformation.Letting this stand is not neutrality; it amplifies the dangerous currents roiling the world. When Facebook is discussed in tomorrow\u2019s history books, it will probably not be about its quarterly earnings reports and stock options.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philanthropy in Silicon Valley: Big Bets on Big Ideas", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byGiving Special SectionSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The founders of Silicon Valley\u2019s technology companies, many of whom have amassed huge fortunes at a young age, tend to look at their philanthropic giving much as they do their companies: They study a problem, explore a number of ways to attack it and eventually invest heavily to scale up the ideas they think will be winners.The couple eventually made substantial donations to programs identified by GiveWell, including nearly $30 million to the Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes mosquito nets to reduce malaria infections among children in Africa, and more than $47 million to GiveDirectly, a program that gives cash directly to extremely poor people in Kenya and Uganda.More recently, Ms. Tuna and Mr. Moskovitz have chosen to fund projects intended to mitigate potential global catastrophes, like an epidemic of a deadly disease, biological warfare and the threats posed by advanced artificial intelligence.Those risks receive little attention from other philanthropists, Ms. Tuna said, which is one reason Good Ventures decided to focus on them.\u201cWe think internally about worldview diversification,\u201d she said.Many of the projects funded by Good Ventures will not succeed, but she and her husband are comfortable with that. \u201cI actually expect that most of our work will fail to have an impact, and that is part of doing high-risk philanthropy well,\u201d Ms. Tuna said.This methodical approach is characteristic of tech-industry philanthropists, said Emmett D. Carson, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which has advised about 2,000 donors in the region on their giving.\u201cThey talk to people themselves. They read the material themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are willing to make very big bets on very big ideas, provided that they learn something.\u201dAmir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University, said that in analyzing the philanthropic approaches of big donors, it helped to consider how they made their money. \u201cWealthy folks tend to use their experience and say, \u2018How can I apply that to solve the world\u2019s problems?\u2019\u201d he said.Data on different donation styles is scarce, but some general trends are apparent, according to those who study philanthropy.\u201cTech people tend to be interested in more early-stage start-ups,\u201d said William Foster, head of consulting at the Bridgespan Group, which works with nonprofits and philanthropists on high-impact social change projects. These philanthropists typically support disruptive new ideas, get more directly involved in their giving and show a willingness to move quickly to another approach when one fails.The couple, who made the pledge after years of conversations with scientists and other philanthropists, did not donate the money to a leading medical institution or university. Instead, they said they intended to invest the funds in efforts to build basic tools to help the whole scientific community make breakthroughs in research.Some of the $3 billion will be spent advocating for more public and private money to attack disease. As they have done with their education initiatives, the couple is also likely to take ownership stakes in for-profit companies that are doing promising work.The Omidyar organization\u2019s efforts to bring financial services to underserved populations, for example, include all three types of contributions. Early on, Omidyar financed BRAC, a nonprofit that makes microloans in Africa, Asia and Haiti. It has also invested in for-profit companies like Prosper, a peer-to-peer lender, and MicroEnsure, which provides insurance to low-income people in emerging markets.\u201cWe have a motto here: Problem first, tool second,\u201d said Matt Bannick, a former eBay executive who is managing partner of the Omidyar Network. The approach appeals to Silicon Valley\u2019s pragmatism and has since been widely adopted by the region\u2019s philanthropists.The Omidyar Network, which focuses on early-stage projects, also takes board seats and provides networking opportunities and training to the organizations it finances. \u201cHalf of the organizations report that our nonmonetary assistance to them was as valuable as our monetary assistance,\u201d Mr. Bannick said.Measuring the precise impact of any particular gift or investment is more difficult. You can count the number of solar lanterns distributed or the number of mosquito nets handed out, but how do you measure the impact of those on a child\u2019s life?\u201cThere are a lot of people who have tried to figure out whether you can boil down impact to a number,\u201d Mr. Bannick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dStill, principles like focusing on underfunded yet highly effective charities can be helpful for any donor, no matter how small.\u201cThe biggest piece of advice I would give any donor is to be proactive,\u201d Ms. Tuna said. \u201cFind the best charity for your values. The charities that are the most aggressive and best at marketing aren\u2019t necessarily the ones doing the most good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All you need is to broach the one subject that everyone views as Trouble.Fair enough, but what should be in such a plan? As the parent of adolescents, I want more than bromides. I want to know what other parents are actually doing that works.For the last six weeks, I\u2019ve circulated (on social media!) 20 questions covering topics like homework, passwords, bedtime and punishments. I received responses from more than 60 families, and though the survey was unscientific, the answers have already changed how we manage tech at my house.Other popular restrictions include: \u201cWriting an expected behavior contract.\u201d \u201cNo use of the internet on school days (except schoolwork).\u201d \u201cScreen time limited to 30 to 60 minutes per day during the week, unlimited on Saturday mornings.\u201dAnother is a partial ban on group texting. \u201cI was able to help my son feel better about not having this by allowing him to view group texts on the family iPad,\u201d one parent said. \u201cIt helped him see how little value the group chatter has.\u201dPhones during friend visits are another issue: \u201cNothing more disappointing than seeing my children\u2019s friends bring their devices to my home and have them focus on the devices to the exclusion of hanging out with my children.\u201dMy own favorite way to limit tech use: \u201cPoor reception \u2014 the phones don\u2019t always work.\u201dAsked to give other parents advice on when to give their children a phone, the consensus answer was: Wait as long as possible. Once you provide it, it\u2019s very difficult to take back.Among the comments by the Yeses were, \u201cOnly if they are in common areas of the house\u201d or \u201cOnly with the door open (so we can monitor).\u201d Another added, \u201cDepends if they are working on a project together, which is difficult to enforce.\u201dThe Nos said that homework is done independently, and that if kids need help, they should find a parent, or the parents contact a teacher.Wider use of computers for homework also drew mixed reactions. Some parents are quite strict, limiting all technology \u201coutside of a computer for spelling or Google docs.\u201d \u201cOnly homework-related sites and no social media.\u201d \u201cOnly certain educational sites are allowed. Wikipedia is completely discouraged. I strongly believe that actual books should be read for research purposes as opposed to \u2018Googling\u2019 everything.\u201dOthers are more lax: \u201cYou have to let them use the tools they will need in their lifetime. Otherwise, let\u2019s give them coal and a slate slab, like Lincoln.\u201dAn overwhelming majority ban phones from bedrooms at bedtime. \u201cTech needs a bedtime, too, in our house, 30 mins before lights out.\u201d \u201cNo technology one hour before bedtime.\u201d \u201cAt 9 p.m. she brings her phone downstairs, where it stays until 7 a.m.\u201d \u201cDevices are supposed to be parked outside the kids\u2019 bedrooms before they turn in for the night.\u201dSome parents make exceptions on weekends or as kids get older. A few have no restrictions at all, though one otherwise tech-friendly mom said: \u201cNo earbuds! Our carbon monoxide detector went off one night and he did not wake up because he was sleeping with earbuds in.\u201dAt least one dad goes to the opposite extreme, turning off the Wi-Fi in the house at an appointed time each night. \u201cSame rules, better enforcement,\u201d he said.Also popular is to require phones to be charged outside the bedroom. \u201cEveryone in our house puts phones on a charging station in our kitchen before going to bed.\u201d \u201cDevices are charged in the kitchen. (I cook a lot and I can keep an eye on them, especially when the children are punished and still try to sneak off with them.)\u201d \u201cAt bedtime, devices go in the bathroom for charging.\u201dOne mother has no specific place, only not in the child\u2019s room: \u201cMy husband and I simply ask where the phones are charging during our \u2018audits of responsibility.\u2019 If the children try to work around the rule, they know the device will be placed in \u2018jail.\u2019\u201dRegardless of the sites, most parents insist on knowing passwords and logins. \u201cMy rules, until he was 18, were that I get all the passwords to all accounts. I did spot check from time to time.\u201d \u201cI have ALL usernames and passwords, and if they change, she has to update my list. If I try to log on and cannot, I get the phone until it pleases me to give it back.\u201dDo parents actually monitor their children\u2019s online behavior? Some do. \u201cI read texts frequently.\u201d \u201cWe are \u2018friends\u2019 or \u2018following\u2019 all of his social media accounts, so we see every post.\u201d \u201cI have asked to read texts when daughter was hiding device as I came into the room.\u201d \u201cI do random audits. We talk about digital citizenship and positive words.\u201dBut others prefer to give their children freedom. \u201cWhen they each began texting, I read random texts. And I asked about the ones I read. (\u2018I see you and friend are chatting about the Jets,\u2019 or \u2018I see you and friend are chatting about another child in class.\u2019) That way they know I can read any text at any time, even though I don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re almost all very boring.\u201d\u201cYes when younger.\u201d \u201cYes, she responds to it.\u201d \u201cYES!!

Last spring I implemented a 3 week digital cleanse. He was angry each day for 3 days but also became more pleasant.\u201dAnother common way to get children to adhere to restrictions is to have them pay for overages. \u201cWe pay the fee but have her pay overages.\u201d \u201cWe also cut data off.\u201d \u201cShe now babysits family friends to earn more and has to learn basic budgeting.\u201dFirst, tech-free dining. \u201cNo devices for all meals.\u201d \u201cNo phones at the table, and that\u2019s not just at our house. Siblings, nieces, nephews and my mom\u2019s home have the same rule. No one gripes about it, they just do it.\u201d \u201cNo devices at meals. No earbuds in the car.\u201dSecond, consider positive alternatives. \u201cDoing things that make phones a burden. Playing a fast-moving game, hiking, attending concerts or performances.\u201d \u201cWe watch movies together, have a fire in the yard or swim when it\u2019s warm and have game night, only board games allowed. They used to complain, but have found favorite games and look forward to it now.\u201d\u201cDo something constructive together. Make sure everyone (even mommy and daddy) get their hands dirty. We often will cook together and make some of the worst meals ever, but it\u2019s O.K. because we did it together.\u201dFinally, when all else fails, many rely on the old parental standbys: threats, bribes and public humiliation. Threats: \u201cRandomly I scream, \u2018Take that phone out of your hand!\u2019 It limits their use for the next five minutes.\u201dBribes: \u201cParent-child date night. (Parents alternate taking one child out for a treat; fourth week is parents night out.)\u201dPublic humiliation: \u201cIf a device is picked up during family time, we get to open texts, and my husband and I do dramatic text reading.\u201dNow that\u2019s a technique even the parents of River City might embrace.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "After almost being killed in New Jersey, a Guatemalan immigrant returned to his hometown to help provide jobs and training so people won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to leave.There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a predictable narrative about immigration that assumes people would rather live in the United States than wherever they came from and that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look back unless we send them back. We rarely hear about the immigrants who choose to go home voluntarily. Eduardo Jimenez is one such person. Hailing from Cajol\u00c3\u00a1 in Guatemala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Western Highlands, he led an undocumented existence in the United States for a decade, much of that time in Morristown, N.J. After he was shot during an altercation outside a bar, he decided to go home alive, rather than in a coffin, like some of his countrymen. His patron saint came in the unlikely form of Caryn Maxim, an older, white New Jersey native who opened her home for his recovery and then opened her savings account to get Grupo Cajol\u00c3\u00a1, an organization Eduardo set up to help his village, off the ground. As the media director of the online magazine Newest Americans, I learned about Eduardo and Caryn from the Rutgers University Law School, which planned a trip to Guatemala last spring so students could witness the hardships that drive immigrants to risk their lives to get to the United States. Grupo Cajol\u00c3\u00a1 piqued my interest as an example of how immigration doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just redefine demographics in the United States, but also transforms the towns and cities where people come from. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a back and forth, with people, commerce, sweat equity, money and ideas moving in both directions. In Eduardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, after years of sending money home, he chose to utilize the skills and knowledge he learned in the United States to ease the pressure for people to leave his village in the first place.In Cajol\u00c3\u00a1, the signs of this two-way pipeline were glaring: New homes with ornate balconies sprang up like Technicolor sand castles on dusty farmland. Women vastly outnumbered men because more than half of the working-age men had left for the United States. The town survives on remittances from those absent men, with interest paid through single-parent homes and children who know their fathers only through Skype. Eduardo determined that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be that way.His greatest takeaway from his time in the United States was that if he could develop opportunities for women, he could reverse his community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortunes. I was humbled by Caryn Maxim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to provide funding and business acumen to ensure that Eduardo \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and his social experiment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would succeed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReverse Migration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the video above about Grupo Cajol\u00c3\u00a1, aims to balance the scales and approach immigration at its point of origin, rather than its destination in the United States. The current rise in anti-immigrant sentiment pushes for punitive measures. Eduardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story asks whether investment at the source wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more prudent."}
{"Headline": "Auto Safety Regulators Seek a Driver Mode to Block Apps", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byApple iPhones and other hand-held devices have long had an airplane mode that shuts off wireless communications to prevent interference with the vast electronics systems that control modern aircraft.Now federal auto safety regulators want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain apps and features to keep a driver\u2019s attention on the road.The initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines that will be issued Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They arrive amid a spike in traffic fatalities in the last two years and increasing concerns about the distractions posed by smartphones and the many apps that Americans are using while behind the wheel.\u201cYour smartphone becomes so many different things that it\u2019s not just a communication device,\u201d Anthony Foxx, secretary of the Transportation Department, said in an interview. \u201cDistraction is still a problem. Too many people are dying and being injured on our roadways.\u201dThe guidelines call on electronics manufacturers like Apple and Samsung to design future operating systems that limit the functionality and simplify interfaces while a vehicle is in motion and to develop technology to identify when the devices are being used by a driver while driving. That would ensure the limits are placed on drivers and not other vehicle occupants.The new guidelines from N.H.T.S.A. are the agency\u2019s first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving. The agency cannot force electronics companies to comply, but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and carmakers adopted them, for the most part.The airplane mode has been around about as long as smartphones. The Federal Aviation Administration had required turning off electronics before takeoff, but that rule was relaxed to allow the use of smartphones in flight as long as they had their communications shut off. That led to airplane mode, which the iPhone had in 2007.\u201cUnfortunately, there are varying degrees of recognition in the tech community that when you\u2019re building an app or a smartphone, or contemplating usage, there\u2019s a strong possibility that someone could be trying to use that in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Mr. Foxx said.In the first six months of 2016, highway deaths increased 10.4 percent, to 17,775, according to preliminary data compiled by N.H.T.S.A. At that rate, more than 100 people die every day in traffic accidents. In 2015, traffic fatalities rose 7.1 percent; it was the largest annual percentage increase in traffic deaths in 50 years.Part of the increase in road deaths can be explained by the improving economy, higher employment numbers and low gasoline prices, all of which are causing Americans to drive more than they did just a few years ago, during the depths of the recession.In an interview in October, Mark Rosekind, the N.H.T.S.A. administrator, said the increase in miles traveled was not enough by itself to explain this spike in crashes, injuries and deaths. Indeed, fatalities are occurring more frequently even when the increased travel is factored in.Mr. Rosekind and other safety experts think one factor is distracted driving. In their view, distractions and the allure of smartphones, other devices and in-car electronics have multiplied greatly since the dangers of distracted driving entered the national consciousness years ago.At that time, the main phone-related distracting activities were texting and talking on the phone. Now a wide range of apps and games also tempt drivers to reach for their phones.Niantic, the maker of Pok\u00e9mon Go, recently modified the game to prevent it from operating while moving at speeds of more than about 10 miles per hour, a spokeswoman for the company said. She declined to give further details on the modifications because Niantic did not want users to find ways to get around them, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t think Pok\u00e9mon Go is something any driver should be using at any speed,\u201d Mr. Foxx said.Makers of smartphones have added some technology that can be used to reduce the distraction of electronics. Apple\u2019s iPhones have a do not disturb feature that can block incoming calls and texts, and a silent mode that eliminates the chimes and other audio cues that signal the arrival of a new message or posting on Facebook.Many carmakers now include Apple\u2019s CarPlay software in their newest models. When an iPhone is connected to the vehicle via CarPlay, the software limits the apps drivers can use to Apple Maps, the music service Pandora and others that are used while traveling. Drivers can have the system read new texts aloud and dictate responses.There are apps and other products that can be used to block incoming communications in cars. One called DriveSafe Mode lets parents monitor if a child\u2019s phone is used for texting or email while in a vehicle.The guidelines encourage smartphone makers to ensure their devices pair up with in-car electronics so drivers can use their steering-wheel buttons and in-dash screen to control apps.A driver mode would present a simplified interface and detect when the device is being used by a driver. In this mode, a smartphone would block any video or distracting graphics; eliminate scrolling text; and prohibit keypad use for texting or email. Any social media content or content from web pages like news reports should be blocked as well, the guidelines say.Advertisement"}

Although there was no immediate evidence that Mr. Artan had declared allegiance to any terrorist group or claimed allegiance to one, the vast majority of attacks claimed this way by the Islamic State have eventually been shown to at least have been inspired by the group\u2019s propaganda.In the same post, he wrote, \u201cEvery single Muslim who disapproves of my actions is a sleeper cell, waiting for a signal. I am warning you Oh America.\u201dMr. Artan was admitted to the United States in 2014 as the child of a refugee, his mother, and before that he lived for seven years in Pakistan, federal law enforcement officials said. Catholic Charities of Dallas said Tuesday that investigators had contacted the group because it had supplied \u201cshelter, clothing and other basic humanitarian services for a short time in 2014\u201d to a person who might have been a family member of the attacker.In Columbus, Mr. Artan lived with his mother, several siblings and possibly other family members crowded into a townhouse apartment in the southwest part of the city. Leaders of local mosques and Somali community groups said they did not know him or his family. On Tuesday, the police and federal agents could be seen entering and leaving the apartment, and questioning other residents of the complex.\u201cThey just seemed like a normal family,\u201d said Joe Brickner, a neighbor. \u201cThey always parked right here, that\u2019s the only thing weird about them,\u201d he said, pointing to a fire hydrant, \u201clike they didn\u2019t understand no rules.\u201dMr. Artan, who was in his first semester studying management at Ohio State, earned an associate degree with honors this year at Columbus State Community College. Ohio State said he was 18, but investigators say there are conflicting records, and he might have been older. The university police said they had never encountered Mr. Artan before Monday, and local court records show no cases involving him.\u201cHe didn\u2019t talk a lot, but when he did, it was about his beliefs,\u201d and was at times \u201ca little preachy,\u201d said Myranda Thompson, a Columbus State student who was Mr. Artan\u2019s partner for a project in a sociology class. \u201cYou could tell he had a passion for his religion. I remember him being upset having to pray around here in the cafeteria,\u201d and a concern about how others would see it.Even so, \u201cHe was always smiling and seemed happy,\u201d and she had no sense that he might snap, she said. \u201cGoing to a bigger college like O.S.U., there were more people to pick on him; he may have had a breaking point.\u201dOther Somalis and Muslims said this week that Mr. Artan\u2019s complaints about a place to pray, or an adverse reaction, rang hollow.\u201cIt\u2019s a nonsense excuse,\u201d said Mahamud Kassin, a math teacher in Columbus who graduated from Ohio State in 2014. \u201cEvery library has a place you can worship.\u201dJibril Mohamed, a lecturer in Somali language and culture at Ohio State, and adviser to the Somali Students Association, said he had never encountered Mr. Artan, but he spoke with a student who was taking an accounting class with him.\u201cHe said he was a quiet, intelligent young man, he was the kind of guy who knows his content before class, he asks the right questions,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden for him to attack people and lose his life, it makes no sense.\u201dOver three decades, millions of people have fled Somalia, a country racked by civil wars and terrorism. The Columbus area has the second-largest Somali population in the United States, after the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, estimated by the Somali Community Association of Ohio at 38,000 people.\u201cWe have not had any serious incidents up until now, so this is frightening,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said. \u201cMany of the young Somali people on campus are really scared.\u201dNabeel Alauddin, a president of the university\u2019s Muslim Students\u2019 Association, said the attack worried him \u201cbecause it is getting to be increasingly challenging to be an American Muslim.\u201dBut as a Buckeye, he said, he was angry because \u201cthis really was an attack on student safety.\u201dOn Tuesday afternoon, three victims remained hospitalized, and one who was released recounted the attack at a news conference. William Clark, an emeritus professor of materials science and engineering, said he was among several people standing outside Watts Hall, which had been evacuated because of a fire alarm.They were about to re-enter the building, when \u201cI suddenly heard a shout and then this tremendous crash,\u201d he said, as a silver car drove onto the sidewalk, and slammed into a concrete and brick planter. \u201cIt clipped the back of my right leg, and basically flipped me up in the air and I landed on concrete.\u201dOfficials have said that Mr. Artan got out of the car and began slashing people with a butcher knife, and ignored commands by Alan Horujko, a university police officer, to drop the knife. The officer fatally shot him.\u201cI never heard the assailant say anything,\u201d Professor Clark said. The entire episode seemed to last just \u201c15 to 30 seconds,\u201d he said, but he and others, unsure if it was over, went inside and took shelter in a basement laboratory.He did not realize he had two deep lacerations above his right ankle until a student pointed out that he had left \u201cfootprints of blood all the way down the hall.\u201dThe attack put the sprawling campus on lockdown for about an hour and a half, as people barricaded themselves in academic buildings and dorms.The claim of responsibility \u201cdoesn\u2019t prove that there is a connection to the Islamic State, but it increases the probability that there was one,\u201d said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.In its propaganda, the Islamic State has stressed that supporters do not need to plan complex attacks, explicitly calling on them to commit violence with cars, knives or whatever else is at hand.Hours after the attack, Telegram channels run by Islamic State supporters referred to the assailant as \u201cbrother\u201d and used an Arabic hashtag that translates to #OhioAttack.The statement on Amaq, the Islamic State\u2019s news agency, said the attacker had acted \u201cin response to calls to target the citizens of the international coalition.\u201dMitch Smith reported from Columbus; Rukmini Callimachi from Erbil, Iraq; and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York. Reporting was contributed by Travis Hoewischer, Sheridan L. Hendrix and Owen J. Daugherty from Columbus, and Adam Goldman from Washington.videoAdvertisement"}

To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees.\u201dThe footwear company New Balance also encountered a postelection backlash after its vice president for communications, Matt LeBretton, said after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory that \u201cwe feel things are going to move in the right direction.\u201dThe reporter also tweeted that the remarks were made within the context of global trade, noting that New Balance has publicly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

{"Headline": "Facebook Runs Up Against German Hate Speech Laws", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 Yorai Feinberg was going about his daily routine this month when his social media feeds and cellphone began lighting up.It was the 78th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, the 1938 Nazi pogrom against Jews, and the Berlin restaurant owned by Mr. Feinberg, a 35-year-old Israeli, had been included without his knowledge on a map of the city that a far-right group had published on Facebook.The social media post listed the names \u2014 and addresses \u2014 of local Jewish institutions and Israeli-owned businesses under the banner \u201cJews Among Us,\u201d in bright yellow Gothic script. Mr. Feinberg soon received anonymous phone calls telling him, \u201cI hate Jews.\u201dA standoff quickly developed between Facebook, the social media giant, and German authorities over what many here said was its inadequate response to the publication of the map. But Germany\u2019s rules on what may be said or published \u2014 among the world\u2019s toughest, with long prison terms for denying the Holocaust and inciting hatred against minorities \u2014 ensured that the post was eventually deleted.The incident is one of several examples \u2014 including threats of regulation and attempts to prosecute Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 of how Germany has become an important test case globally for how the social network polices what may be published online, and how it should respond to inappropriate and illegal content.Such steps in Germany are part of a growing push around the world to regulate what users are allowed to post online.Mr. Feinberg did not report the incident to Facebook, convinced after previous anti-Semitic attacks that the social network would not act, he said.\u201cI have reported things to Facebook at least 20 times,\u201d he explained over coffee at his restaurant in a residential neighborhood in western Berlin. \u201cAnd 100 percent of the time, they have refused to take it down. Facebook doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201dOthers identified in the map did complain. At first, Facebook did not remove the map, saying it complied with the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards,\u201d or guidelines for what it deems within the bounds of free speech.But within 48 hours, after an outcry on social media, in local newspapers and from German lawmakers, Facebook relented. It deleted the far-right group\u2019s entire page, including the post that had listed the Jewish institutions and businesses across Berlin.\u201cWe recognize that this is a work in progress,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s director of policy in Europe, said in an interview. \u201cIt was hate speech, and it should have been taken down.\u201dIn Germany, more than almost anywhere else in the West, lawmakers, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, are demanding that Facebook go further to police what is said on the social network \u2014 a platform that now has 1.8 billion users worldwide. The country\u2019s lawmakers also want other American tech giants to meet similar standards.The often-heated dispute has raised concerns over maintaining freedom of speech while protecting vulnerable minorities in a country where the legacy of World War II and decades under Communism still resonate.Mr. Zuckerberg has denied that such reports swayed American voters. But lawmakers in the United States, Germany and beyond are pressing Facebook to clamp down on hate speech, fake news and other misinformation shared online, or face new laws, fines or other legal actions.\u201cFacebook has a certain responsibility to uphold the laws,\u201d said Heiko Maas, the German justice minister. In October, Mr. Maas suggested the company could be held criminally liable for users\u2019 illegal hate speech postings if it does not swiftly remove them.Facebook rejects claims that it has not responded to the rise in hate speech in Germany and elsewhere, saying it continually updates its community standards to weed out inappropriate posts and comments.It says such material represents a small fraction of the millions of posts daily, and argues there is a fine balance between protecting freedom of expression and stamping out internet hate speech.\u201cWe\u2019ve done more than any other service at trying to get on top of hate speech on our platform,\u201d Mr. Allan said.Tussles with German lawmakers are nothing new for Facebook.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Their arrival, according to company executives and lawmakers, incited an online backlash from Germans opposed to the swell of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries. The number of hateful posts on Facebook increased sharply.In response, Facebook updated its global community standards, which also apply in the United States, to give greater protection to minority groups, primarily to calm German concerns.Facebook also agreed to work with the government, local charities and other companies to fight online hate speech, and recently started a billboard and television campaign in Germany to answer local fears over how it deals with hate speech and privacy.Despite these steps, German officials are demanding further action.Ms. Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in general elections next year, warned lawmakers last week that hate speech and fake news sites were influencing public opinion, raising the possibility of new regulations.For Chan-Jo Jun, a lawyer in W\u00fcrzburg, an hour\u2019s drive from Frankfurt, new laws governing Facebook cannot come soon enough.While his complaint may be dismissed, Mr. Jun says the roughly 450 hate speech cases that he has collected, more than half of them aimed at refugees, show that Facebook is not complying with German law. Despite its global size, he insists, the company cannot skirt its local responsibilities.\u201cI know Facebook wants to be seen as a global giant,\u201d Mr. Jun said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way around it. They have to comply with German law.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Facebook\u2019s head of public policy in Europe. He is Richard Allan, not Richard Allen. This correction was delayed because the error was pointed out to editors only recently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixation on Fake News Overshadows Waning Trust in Real Reporting", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byEssaySomething is deeply wrong when the pope\u2019s voice, reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as \u201ca fantasy news site\u201d to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate, and then be amplified, unchallenged, through a million individual shares.The attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies, because they are indefensible, easy to identify and extraordinarily viral. Fake news is created by the kinds of people who, when asked, might call their work satire, or admit that they\u2019re in it for the money or for the thrill of deception. Theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned, and that Facebook is equipped, and maybe willing, to deal with.For many people, and especially opponents of President-elect Donald J. Trump, the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief, the discovery of the error that explains everything. But as the attention has spread widely \u2014 even President Obama talked passionately about it on Thursday \u2014 it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation, but also as a way to correct the course. It misunderstands a new media world in which every story, and source, is at risk of being discredited, not by argument but by sheer force.False news stories posted on fly-by-night websites were prevalent in this election. So, too, were widely shared political videos \u2014 some styled as newscasts \u2014 containing outright falsehoods, newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions, and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods.During the months I spent talking to partisan Facebook page operators for a magazine article this year, it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication, it contained much, much more of something else.I recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story, posted on a pro-Trump website and promoted on a pro-Trump Facebook page \u2014 and, incidentally, copied from another pro-Trump site by overseas contractors. It tried to cast suspicion on Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier, who had spoken out against Donald J. Trump.The overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying; the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new, sinister one; its insinuating mention of \u201cMuslim martyrs,\u201d in proximity to mentions of Mr. Khan\u2019s son, and its misleading and strategic mention of Shariah law, amounted to a repulsive smear. It was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them.This was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election, clearly designed to function well within Facebook\u2019s economy of sharing. And it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of \u201cfake news.\u201dStories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up \u201cfake news\u201d as a broad media offensive position, especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, and by the candidate himself. As the campaign progressed, criticism of Mr. Trump was instantly projected back at his opponent, or at the critics themselves. \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet.\u201dThis tactic was used on the language of social justice, which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically, in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained. Anti-racists were cast as the real racists. Progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms. This was not a new tactic, but it was newly effective. It didn\u2019t matter that its targets knew that it was a bad-faith maneuver, a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason. The referees called foul, but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds. Or maybe they could, but realized that nobody could make them listen.\u201cFake news\u201d as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold. The fake news narrative, as widely understood and deployed, has already begun to encompass not just falsified, fabricated stories, but a wider swath of traditional media on Facebook and elsewhere. Fox News? Fake news. Mr. Trump\u2019s misleading claims about Ford keeping jobs in America? Fake news. The entirety of hyperpartisan Facebook? Fake news. This wide formulation of \u201cfake news\u201d will be applied back to the traditional news media, which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true, even when they are.Facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem, the clearly fabricated posts. Facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one, to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform. But the worst identified defenders make their money outside Facebook anyway.Another narrow response from Facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces. Facebook tried this, to a very limited extent, with Trending Topics. Members of the company\u2019s editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories, accompanied by links they deemed credible. This initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear. But it is easy to imagine a system in which a story, upon reaching some high threshold of shares, or a source, upon reaching some cumulative audience, could be audited and declared unreliable. This could resemble Facebook\u2019s short-lived experiment to tag satire articles as such.A number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope, for example. But where would that leave the rest of the media? Answered and rebutted, and barely better positioned against everything else that remained. It would be a still-dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact, the main difference being that it would have all been declared, implicitly, not fake.Facebook is a place where people construct and project identities to friends, family and peers. It is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities. It is a system built on ranking and vetting and voting, and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely possible, and where conflict is resolved with isolation. (Not that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy alternatives: For Twitter, it has been a source of constant crisis.)Fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the Facebook economy \u2014 more closely, perhaps, than most of the organizations that are identifying them. Their removal will be an improvement. The outrage at their mere existence, and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the world, will have been justified.But the outrage is at risk of being misdirected, and will be followed by the realization that the colloquial \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 the newslike media, amateur and professional, for which truth is defined first in personal and political terms, and which must only meet the bar of not being obviously, inarguably, demonstrably false \u2014 will continue growing apace, gaining authority by sheer force, not despite Facebook but because of it. The company that created the system that resulted in hoax news stories should try to eliminate them, and with any luck it will. But the system stands to remain intact.Media companies have spent years looking to Facebook, waiting for the company to present a solution to their mounting business concerns despite, or perhaps because of, its being credited with causing those concerns. Some have come to the realization that this was mistaken, even absurd. Those who expect the operator of the dominant media ecosystem of our time, in response to getting caught promoting lies, to suddenly return authority to the companies it has superseded are in for a similar surprise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Photojournalism is in a constant struggle to remain relevant and financially viable, with shrinking budgets and new storytelling practices driving leading institutions to undertake major changes.World Press Photo, the industry standard-bearer, said last week that it would initiate a new \u00e2\u0080\u009ccreative documentary photography\u00e2\u0080\u009d contest. The news has sparked heated online debate among photojournalists over the future of the profession and the ethics of blurring truth with fiction. \u201cPurists\u201d argue that photojournalism must not be tainted by staged or contrived photography. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCreatives\u00e2\u0080\u009d argue in favor of more conceptual ways of telling stories.LagosPhoto, an annual monthlong festival currently hosting its seventh edition in Nigeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest city, has long championed the kind of creative approach now being embraced by World Press Photo.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we are far ahead of the curve in that sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Azu Nwagbogu who founded LagosPhoto in 2010 and has promoted conceptual photography over documentary work as a way to explore the subjective notion of truth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in photojournalism, but Africa has become a playground for photographers coming to tell the \u00e2\u0080\u0098truth\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about the continent and they get stuck on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098hopeless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 narrative. We can sculpt so much more than this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very essence of creative expression on the continent lies in rituals and how, when these rituals encounter an audience, it becomes a performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nwagbogu said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven a ritual for one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self becomes participatory. Abubakar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practice of returning to the same places to photograph the same people over and over again has become a ritual of its own.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn its seven years, LagosPhoto has played an outsize role in increasing photographic literacy in Africa by bringing together some of the best visual artists working on the continent and by hosting weeks of exhibitions, panel discussions and workshops aimed at filling an institutional education gap.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is needed now is access to markets overseas, real mentoring and a long commitment to improving the education infrastructure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gary Knight, a former chairman of the World Press Photo contest and an ambassador for Canon, and participates as a teacher in Project Miraisha, an initiative that over the past two years has worked with 2,000 aspiring African photographers. Mr. Knight ran a workshop this year at LagosPhoto.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrying to do that at a national level is very difficult to imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing it through a festival like the LagosPhoto is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I think \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the best way to make that happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor Jacques Nkinzingabo, a 22-year-old Rwandan photographer who attended the festival for the first time this year, the experience provided a welcome boost.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helped me improve my skills, and you really learn the value of your work and how to tell our own stories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Nkinzingabo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of my dreams now is to go back to Lagos and have my own exhibition there.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe heavy focus on conceptual photography at LagosPhoto has provided creative inspiration for a new generation of African photographers just as the broader photojournalism industry grapples with how to accommodate new narrative forms.The LagosPhoto Festival is terrific, Mr. Knight said, because it exposes African photographers \u201cto intelligent and critical thinking, which they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get at institutions of higher education that teach photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201cI wish it had room for more work in documentary and journalism genre,\u201d he said, \u201cand I hope they will make a little space for that simply because civil society needs it, if for no other reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "While on a trip in the outback, he came across a scene that seemed straight out of a movie: three skin-and-bones horses running alongside a beat-up car, kicking up clouds of dirt as they barreled through the parched landscape. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a wake-up call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remembered.The region, known as the Murray-Darling Basin, depends on the health of two rivers, the Murray and the Darling. They sustained an important Aboriginal population for millennia. When settlers displaced the original occupants, the waters were used to irrigate the land and build a thriving agricultural industry. Today, however, the wealth has dried up.Droughts and cotton farms run by multinational corporations have adversely affected the region, using up large amounts of water and requiring a skeleton-staff work force. Moreover, both rivers run through several states, making for complicated allocation negotiations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the time it gets to the South, downstream, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barely anything left,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Abbott said.His concern for the region and its people are at the heart of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Land Where the Crow Flies Backwards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is the title of a Dougie Young song that inspired him. Mr. Abbott went on the road for weeks with a large-format camera, a choice that slowed him down and let him record scenes in great detail. Although he did not anticipate that dust, grime and light leaks would mark his negatives, he learned to appreciate these imperfections as a part of the image: traces left by the environment itself on the sheet of film.As a result, the photographs have a bleak, eerie quality, reminding us that the outback remains, for the most part, a mystery. The region inspired work such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cWake in Fright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a book by Kenneth Cook and, later, a movie by Ted Kotcheff in which a teacher loses his mind in the remote mining town of Bundanyabba. Mr. Abbott admits being deeply inspired by the film. Many of the scenes he captured and the characters in his work could have easily made their way into the movie\u2019s plot. He met several eccentric single men, like Mario, who built a castle above a mine where he can escape the 120-plus Fahrenheit heat and which has since become a minor tourist attraction.By confronting us with their likeness, Mr. Abbott is probing our humanity. Will we deride these individuals for their zany ways, laud them for their enterprising spirit or wish to learn more before passing judgment?Behind each unsettling stare or the ominous reach of bare branches are telling stories. Mr. Abbott unravels them one by one. Asked about the portrait of a vacationing couple with fly nets over their head, he explains how terrible the fly situation was: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so dry around there that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go into your eyes to suck out the moisture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The image of trees with their roots exposed next to a murky stream prompts him to remark on the vicious cycle created by carps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resilience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese fish, which thrive in degrading environment, further contribute to its deterioration by increasing turbidity, uprooting plants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including trees \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and playing a part in eroding the riverbanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said before pointing out pictures of hunting shack interiors to show how the ecosystem has changed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the past decades, hunters have bragged on the walls about their kills,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re life-size time capsule revealing the history of the place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The markings show that for years people caught cod and yellowbelly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 golden perch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 daily. No longer is this the case.The most disturbing photo shows more than a dozen feral dog carcasses hanging by the side of the road. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have gone wild and roam the land looking for sheep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can kill up to 10 in one night. The farmers, in hopes of alerting the public to the issue, pay hunters to shoot the dogs in the middle of the night and hang them in plain view.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe changes happening in the Murray-Darling Basin strike at the heart of Australian culture; that alone, the photographer said, is a reason to dedicate his time and talent to the outback\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dusty roads.Mr. Abbott, a new member of the Australian photo collective Oculi, has been working on this project for two years and plans to continue. It hits close to home in many ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked around the world, from South Sudan to Pakistan, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to the conclusion that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a unique position to work in my own country on issues that affect my peers and I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next to impossible to have the rest of the world take interest in what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on here. And even within Australia there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apathy, especially when it comes to Aboriginal people and the legacy of colonialism. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complex and nuanced matter, for which you cannot create a bite-size, quickly digestible account.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Undocumented in Trump\u2019s America", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionOn election night, while I was making my way through a crowd gathered outside the Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, a white man wearing a Mets cap patted my back and said through the noise: \u201cGet ready to be deported.\u201d Rattled, I made it inside the green room and waited to go on the air.\u201cWhat does it feel like to be the country\u2019s most famous illegal?\u201d the Fox anchor Lou Dobbs once asked me. We were off the air at the time, luckily, so I didn\u2019t have to answer on live television. In general, it feels daunting. Since Mr. Trump was elected president of the United States, it has felt terrifying.This is a time of palpable and overwhelming fear for immigrants, our families and friends. To many of us, it seems that the message from the roughly 60 million American voters who chose Mr. Trump \u2014 especially white voters who live in predominantly white towns that are getting less white because of immigration \u2014 is something like this: We don\u2019t want you here.I\u2019ve been getting a flood of texts, emails and direct messages on Twitter and Facebook from undocumented Americans like me. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d the messages ask. \u201cShould we make plans to leave?\u201d A young woman I had met four years ago couldn\u2019t stop crying on the phone. Her mother is from El Salvador and her father is from Guatemala. She is in 11th grade and she told me her parents might leave and entrust her care to relatives. She is a citizen, born in this country, but her parents are both undocumented.The pain and vulnerability underlying these conversations are a direct contrast to the vulgarity of the public messages I get on social media, particularly on Twitter. \u201cChristmas came early this year. It will be even earlier next year when @joseiswriting becomes Deportee # 1,\u201d reads one message. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until @joseiswriting gets deported. It\u2019ll be such a great day,\u201d reads another.In my mind, the day Mr. Trump made his speech proclaiming victory in the presidential election, 11/9, was the culmination of the hate, and ignorance that Americans have inflicted on one another since the attacks of 9/11. Along with Muslims, immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, have carried the brunt of this hate.It\u2019s not clear what Mr. Trump will do in office. He has vowed to deport two million to three million \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d but that is not a precise definition of anything. Whatever enforcement his administration does pursue, it will be an expansion of what President Obama has already done. By June of this year, the Obama administration had deported more than 2.4 million immigrants \u2014 more than any other president.My first meeting with an immigration lawyer was right after the Sept. 11 attacks. I was accompanied by Rich Fischer, the superintendent of my high school. The lawyer said the only solution for me was to return to the Philippines, accept the 10-year ban on re-entry and apply to come back. I was convinced that I had to go back to Manila. Rich felt differently. \u201cYou\u2019re already here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re staying.\u201dI told that story to Esmeralda, a 22-year-old from Mexico I recently met at Rio Hondo College, a community college just outside Los Angeles, which is home to the largest undocumented population in the country. Esmeralda came to the United States at age 6. She told me she was scared, especially because she is one of about 700,000 undocumented young people who registered in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers short-term protection from deportation as well as the right to work. Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal it.To apply for the program, undocumented youths had to give their names, birth dates and addresses to the very government that Mr. Trump will be in charge of.\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d I told Esmeralda, thinking of Rich Fischer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough, but you\u2019re not going anywhere. We are not going anywhere.\u201dThough there are a lot of questions about what President Trump will do when it comes to immigration, I have a few questions directed at my fellow Americans.How many more Rich Fischers are out there, allies who will stand up for undocumented immigrants?How many local school districts will declare themselves sanctuaries for immigrant families? How many college presidents, administrators and teachers \u2014 from schools like Harvard and Stanford to community colleges such as Rio Hondo \u2014 will declare their schools safe spaces for undocumented students?How many other mayors will declare their cities sanctuary cities?How many churches, synagogues and mosques will give shelter to us?How will employers protect their undocumented workers?What will you do when they start rounding us up?Advertisement"}

At Utah\u2019s mean elevation of 6,100 feet, you get about 20 percent less oxygen in a breath of air compared with inhaling the same volume of air at sea level. Such hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, results in lower production of serotonin by the brain, which can lead to depression. And yet, Utah has sometimes been called the \u201chappiest\u201d state, and ranks high in measures of overall well-being.Hypoxia also causes increased production of dopamine, which is associated with pleasure.

My parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Poland. I was born during the Depression in Borough Park, Brooklyn. I attended neighborhood schools where there were different ethnic groups, and took the subway to a very diverse public high school. I went to Brooklyn College, which was free.Along with public education, economic mobility and opportunity promoted assimilation. The G.I. Bill after World War II expanded educational opportunities. Unions were strong, and work was secure and plentiful. Today wage stagnation and economic inequality mitigate against assimilation, and immigrants are often wrongly blamed for the hardships of working-class people. A return to economic mobility for all will lead to more assimilation for immigrants and make America more democratic.MARCIA BOKHARTFORD\u2b25Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "Breitbart, Reveling in Trump\u2019s Election, Gains a Voice in His White House", "Date": "2016-11-13", "News": "Supported byThere is talk of Breitbart bureaus opening in Paris, Berlin and Cairo, spots where the populist right is on the rise. A bigger newsroom is coming in Washington, the better to cover a president-elect whose candidacy it embraced.Mainstream news outlets are soul-searching in the wake of being shocked by Donald J. Trump\u2019s election last week. But the team at Breitbart News, the right-wing opinion and news website that some critics have denounced as a hate site, is elated \u2014 and eager to expand on a victory that it views as a profound validation of its cause.\u201cSo much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names,\u201d Alexander Marlow, the site\u2019s editor in chief, said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cAnd then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy, and savor.\u201dBreitbart not only championed Mr. Trump; its chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, helped run his campaign. On Sunday, Mr. Trump named Mr. Bannon as his chief White House strategist and senior counselor, further closing the distance between Breitbart\u2019s newsroom and the president-elect.Those who consider Mr. Trump, who has vilified the news media, a threat to the free press view Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment as more cause for alarm. Critics say Breitbart now has the potential to play an unprecedented role in a modern presidency, as a weaponized media adjunct for the White House.\u201cIt will be as close as we are ever going to have \u2014 hopefully \u2014 to a state-run media enterprise,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who quit the site this year, saying it had turned into a de facto \u201csuper PAC\u201d for Mr. Trump.Breitbart has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and it served as a clearinghouse for attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s adversaries, spreading unsubstantiated rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and undermining its own reporter, Michelle Fields, after she accused Corey Lewandowski, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, of assaulting her.The site frequently boasts about knowing the pulse of its readers. News articles with evocative headlines, like \u201cParis Streets Turned into WARZONE by Violent Migrants,\u201d are frequently followed by comments from readers about \u201cthe enemy within,\u201d migrant \u201cscum\u201d and the \u201cJewish-controlled media.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s writers often vilify the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing what they say is a wave of \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201dBut the site\u2019s influence on social media, where more and more Americans now consume information, has been palpable. On election night, Breitbart\u2019s Facebook page received the fourth-highest number of user interactions on the entire platform \u2014 beating Fox News, CNN and The New York Times.Mr. Marlow, the editor, praised Mr. Bannon on Sunday, saying, \u201cSteve understands the voters, the American people, better than just about anyone.\u201d But he rejected the premise that Breitbart could become an American version of Pravda.\u201cOur loyalty is not going to be to Donald Trump; our loyalty is to our readers and to our values,\u201d Mr. Marlow, 30, said. \u201cThat\u2019s regardless of what role Steve has.\u201d\u201cIf Trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in, we\u2019re all good,\u201d Mr. Marlow added. \u201cBut if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls, we\u2019re going to be highly critical. We\u2019re not going to think twice about it.\u201dFor now, Breitbart is supporting the president-elect. Its post-Election Day coverage has been, if anything, emboldened: \u201cMeltdown Continues: Wave of Fake \u2018Hate Crimes\u2019 Sweeps Social Media,\u201d read a headline on its home page on Sunday, attempting to cast doubt on a wave of reports of intimidation and harassment by Trump supporters. \u201cAnti-Democracy Crybabies March by Thousands Nationwide,\u201d read another.The site\u2019s expansion of political coverage comes at a time when other news outlets in Washington are concerned about staying relevant with readers \u2014 and girding for tensions with a president-elect who denounces reporters as dishonest, or worse.A spokesman for the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which coordinates press coverage of the White House, declined to comment on Mr. Bannon\u2019s appointment.Andrew Breitbart, the site\u2019s founder, who died in 2012, \u201cused to talk about the Democrat-media complex,\u201d recalled Ben Shapiro, Breitbart\u2019s former editor at large.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more Republican-media complex than Breitbart and the Trump team,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fascinated to see if there are any points of departure, any points of criticism at all.\u201dOutlets like Fox News, which has a large Republican audience, insist that Breitbart is no competitor, saying that an online-only outlet with few known personalities can hardly compete with television networks that reach tens of millions of homes.Breitbart receives far fewer unique web visitors than Fox News\u2019s digital sites, according to statistics from comScore. Still, its Facebook audience has more than doubled in the last year, and it frequently sets the agenda for social media users with their own mass followings. The site has spotlighted nationalist views and conspiracies once relegated to the right-wing fringe.Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s chief executive, declined on Sunday to provide revenue figures for the site. Nor would he comment on whether Mr. Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs banker, retains a financial stake. (Mr. Solov is a part owner, along with Andrew Breitbart\u2019s estate and the family of Robert Mercer, a wealthy Trump donor.)Speaking by telephone from Hearst Castle in California, which he was visiting for a postelection vacation, Mr. Solov said that his teams had been flooded with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from reporters and even some aspiring journalists with no experience, \u201cwho feel motivated and energized.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve built a community, and I really emphasize that,\u201d Mr. Solov said. \u201cPeople come to us because they feel they belong to something.\u201dMr. Marlow, the editor, said the site\u2019s international expansion was tied to upcoming elections in France and Germany. He said that Breitbart planned to support the candidacy of Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front party.\u201cThere\u2019s an underserved readership\u201d in Europe, Mr. Marlow said, before referring to the recent \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. \u201cIt\u2019s the same readers who had been ignored in Britain and had been ignored in the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}
