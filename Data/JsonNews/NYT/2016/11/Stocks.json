{"Headline": "Future of Big Mergers Under Trump? Like Much Else, It\u2019s Unclear", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byBut after an initial period of turmoil, deal advisers say that it is unclear whether a Trump administration \u2014 led by an avowedly pro-business real estate mogul \u2014 would really make life difficult for mega-mergers.At the moment, AT&T\u2019s planned takeover of Time Warner, the biggest merger of the year and one that is poised to reshape the world of media and telecommunications, appears to be the most likely candidate for hazing. The president-elect was among the first politicians to criticize the deal, vowing to block it if he became president.Mr. Trump said it was \u201can example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting.\u201d He also opposed a similar union between Comcast and NBCUniversal in 2013, which he called \u201cpoison.\u201dTougher antitrust enforcement on the telecommunications and cable industry would be popular among consumers, who consistently rate it among the worst for customer satisfaction.The particular focus on giant media corporations, which he railed against during his campaign, could be a personal priority and one his base of voters would support.But antitrust specialists and Republican strategists say a Trump administration may not fulfill his campaign promises.The key to the chances of AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner will be the appointments Mr. Trump makes to the Justice Department, which is expected to review the merger, and the Federal Communications Commission, which may also examine it. Those are rarefied worlds that require specific legal and economic expertise.\u201cHe\u2019s going to fill them, but I don\u2019t think Republicans are going to fill these spots with people who are instinctively negative on M.&A. transactions,\u201d David N. Shine, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings, said of the vacancies.The deal makers who helped develop the AT&T offer for Time Warner are likely to bet that even if Mr. Trump impels the Justice Department to file a lawsuit to block the deal, any court that hears the case will apply traditional antitrust standards to clear the transaction. The two companies have argued that theirs is a \u201cvertical\u201d merger with little overlap, unlike a traditional \u201chorizontal\u201d merger that removes a competitor from the industry.All the same, AT&T sought to find common ground with Mr. Trump. John J. Stephens, chief financial officer of AT&T, said at an industry conference on Wednesday that the company agreed with Mr. Trump on matters of building infrastructure and creating jobs.\u201cWe\u2019ve been the leading investor in this country for more than five years running, and our Time Warner transaction is all about innovation and economic development, consumer choice and investment in infrastructure with regard to providing a great 5G mobile broadband experience,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. \u201cSo we look forward with optimism to working with the leadership and providing benefits to consumers and to our shareholders.\u201dTime Warner declined to comment.Aside from AT&T, the outlook for mergers is less clear. In the short term, potential market gyrations could delay merger talks, although major stock market indexes rose modestly on Wednesday. Time Warner shares, however, fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday, to $86.60.But longer term, conditions could fall into place for more sustained deal activity. While Mr. Trump took aim at two big media mergers, he is generally considered to be more favorable toward business. And he will be pressured by Republican leaders and his transition team, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to appoint officials who believe in free markets and might be more receptive to mergers than a Democratic administration.Some industries may benefit. The stocks of drug companies like Pfizer rose as the potential for tough regulations and prohibitions on mergers appeared to subside. But shares in hospital operators, like HCA Holdings and Community Health Systems, fell on investor concerns that efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act could jeopardize their new government subsidies.Shares of Sprint and T-Mobile USA rose as the possibility of another attempt to merge the two appeared more plausible under a Trump administration.Some deal makers even speculated that if Mr. Trump fulfills a campaign promise to clamp down on global trade, it will force American companies to find growth at home \u2014 and that could include buying competitors.\u201cOnce the markets get their land legs back, I think people are going to realize there are real M.&A. opportunities next year,\u201d Mr. Shine of Paul Hastings said.Emily Steel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Trump Undo Investor Protections? Meet the Brokers of Madison County", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyNEW WOODSTOCK, N.Y. \u2014 No, not that Woodstock, the one of peace, love and extremely good vibes.On the manure-scented main strip of this Woodstock, in Madison County\u2019s horse country about 25 miles southeast of Syracuse, lies the answer to a question that has bedeviled me for months: How did this rural county become the place with the highest percentage of stockbrokers in the entire United States with at least one black mark on their disciplinary records?Yes, you read that right. Not Long Island with its penny-stock boiler rooms. Not Florida, either, with its high concentration of retirees and the people who prey on them for a living.The three professors who published it early this year collected the disciplinary records of every stockbroker in the country from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industry\u2019s self-regulator. They found that about 7 percent of the brokers had at least one black mark, yet 44 percent of those who lost their jobs because of misconduct found work elsewhere in the industry within a year. The researchers\u2019 conclusion? Some firms \u201cspecialize\u201d in misconduct, as they put it.But buried in the paper was this gem: In Suffolk County on Long Island, 17.3 percent of brokers had at least one type of the misconduct that the researchers were counting on their records. In Palm Beach County, Fla., it was 18.1 percent. But in Madison County, a whopping 32 percent of brokers had a black mark.Was it something in the air? To find out, I collected the records for all the brokers whose registrations placed them in Madison County and read every one. At least 30 who had black marks worked for firms called Ridgeway & Conger, Adirondack Trading Group or Clayton Lowell & Conger. All of them have the same owner.That building, which she owns with her husband, Richard, has two storefronts. When I stopped by on Wednesday, it still had the signs from the now-defunct firms over the windows. I peeked in the window of one store and saw a messy assemblage of abandoned desks. Large binders were lying askew on the window ledge with labels like \u201cMuni\u2019s Book 1 June 2015.\u201dI knocked on the door of the other storefront, and behind the door were two large, barking dogs and a few young men hunched over computers. I asked for the Garbers, and one of the young men led me through a dark back room, up steps, past a warren of empty rooms and into the office of Mr. Garber.After asking for various forms of identification and calling my editor to confirm my identity, he explained the firms\u2019 hiring process, for he had worked at the firms, too. They had found their brokers through mass mailings and recruiters and hired just one of every six or seven people who responded, he explained.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to consider people who had multiple marks for the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority had opportunities to work someplace else. We were not a dead end.\u201dMs. Garber is now registered as a broker with National Securities Corporation, where she is not in charge of anyone. \u201cCan I in my wildest dreams think that I would have allowed someone like that to act in a supervisory capacity? Absolutely not,\u201d said Robert Fagenson, the chief executive of the firm\u2019s holding company. \u201cShe has not done anything during her tenure here that we have found untoward.\u201dIn an interview this week, Mr. Baldwin objected strongly to being mentioned in the same breath as the Garbers. \u201cWe\u2019re the opposite of a Ridgeway,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are aggressive, advertised nationally. Our people are here by referral.\u201dThe population of Madison County-registered brokers when the professors did their study was 131, so it represents a relatively small sample size. Some counties have thousands of brokers. And now that Ridgeway is out of business (because of a lack of profitability, according to the Garbers), the county would no longer top any new list of places where brokers with a checkered past have any kind of affiliation.Twitter: @ronlieberDoris Burke contributed research.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Might Be Paying Too Much for Your Chicken", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byBeef prices at grocery stores are lower. So, too, are pork prices. But chicken? Steady as she goes.A glut of corn and soybeans has led to lower prices for a variety of meats. But chicken in grocery stores has bucked the trend, leaving prices up for shoppers and buoying the fortunes of major chicken producers.Why the prices have diverged remains largely a mystery. But much of the scrutiny is focused on the Georgia Dock, a chicken pricing index that is obscure outside the food industry but widely used by grocery stores in America when buying chicken from producers.This week, the market price of a 2\u00bd- to 3\u00bd-pound chicken on the Georgia Dock was $1.10 a pound \u2014 down 5 percent from 18 months ago. During the same period, an index widely used by restaurants and food service companies has fallen considerably. The Urner Barry index, as it is called, priced the same size chicken at 72 cents a pound \u2014 down 33 percent from 18 months ago.In October, the federal Department of Agriculture began compiling a price for such birds. That price this week was 71 cents a pound, nearly matching the price set by Urner Barry.As a result, the prices reported by the Georgia Dock have started to raise questions among investors, some of whom have bet against the price of poultry company stocks. They contend that the way the index is compiled has kept the retail price of chicken artificially high.\u201cIt\u2019s a calculation that\u2019s not very representative of what chicken is really selling at,\u201d said Will Sawyer, an investment analyst who follows the meat industry at Rabobank.How chickens are priced has been a contentious topic for the last three decades as the industry has consolidated. Only a handful of companies now sell most of the country\u2019s poultry.The issue heated up again recently. Last month, Maplevale Farms, a food service company in upstate New York, filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that the big chicken processors were using a data company, Agri Stats, in a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to set prices high. \u201cAgri Stats reports are so detailed that a reasonably informed producer can discern the identity of competitors\u2019 individual broiler complexes,\u201d Maplevale asserted.The chicken producers have denied the accusations and said they would fight the lawsuit.The Georgia Dock, put together by the Georgia Agriculture Department since 1966, is used by many supermarket meat buyers as a starting point for negotiations with chicken producers. The index today is based on data from 10 of the 11 companies that process poultry in the state.But critics say the index does not do enough to verify the data it receives. They also say the two largest producers in the state, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride and Tyson Foods, hold too much sway over the index. The prices supplied by the largest producers are weighted more heavily by the index than the prices from other producers.The Agriculture Department had long included the Georgia Dock in a weekly report on poultry production and prices. But in the spring, it began asking questions about how the index was compiled, according to emails between federal and state officials. The documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information request, were provided independently to The New York Times and authenticated by the agency.In the summer, the department told Mr. Schronce that to remain on the weekly report, the Georgia Dock needed to start verifying the prices producers were giving them, among other changes.But in a later email sent to Gary Black, Georgia\u2019s agriculture commissioner, the Georgia department conceded that it could not verify the numbers it had been using to compile the Georgia Dock. And it said the department \u201cis in agreement with the poultry industry that there is no desire to review invoices for verification of data reported.\u201dIn August, the United States Department of Agriculture dropped the Georgia Dock from its weekly report and now provides only a link to its website.Julie McPeake, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Agriculture Department, said on Thursday that after meeting with U.S.D.A. officials, the state is \u201ccurrently vetting a new model to serve as a trend analysis of demand.\u201dIn an email, Ms. McPeake said the industry expressed \u201cquite a bit of concern\u201d about the speed with which changes in the Georgia Dock were going to take place and \u201cthe decision was made to examine the process further.\u201d\u201cGiven that poultry is our No. 1 industry, with a $25.5 billion economic contribution and responsible for 103,000 jobs, it is important that any changes we make to the index is fully researched to ensure we are best serving our industry partners,\u201d she said.Tyson, the country\u2019s largest poultry producer, declined to make anyone available to talk about the Georgia Dock. Cameron Bruett, a spokesman for JBS, the large Brazilian meat business that controls Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, declined to answer questions about the index, sending a statement instead in which he noted its importance.\u201cGiven the scale and obvious importance of the poultry industry in the state of Georgia, the poultry market data provided by the Georgia Department of Agriculture has long served as a critical price discovery tool for producers, processors, distributors and retailers in Georgia and nationwide,\u201d Mr. Bruett wrote.The U.S.D.A. and Urner Barry, unlike the Georgia Dock, collect information on prices from buyers, sellers, distributors and other middlemen trading chicken on the spot market.Terence Wells, a market reporter at Urner Barry who monitors the chicken and turkey markets, said that he and his team speak to all the large chicken producers each day. \u201cWe then speak to a number of other players in the market, distributors and retail buying groups, traders and brokers, buyers and sellers,\u201d he said.The Agriculture Department uses a similar \u201cdouble verification\u201d system to compile its index of chicken prices. \u201cIts real purpose is to show exactly what the product is worth each given week,\u201d said Jason V. Karwal, who oversees the U.S.D.A.\u2019s livestock, poultry and grain market news division.The Urner Barry and U.S.D.A. figures have helped lower the cost of chicken for restaurants, which have also been helped by lower beef and pork prices. Restaurant companies like McDonald\u2019s and Buffalo Wild Wings have noted the lower costs of meat, which have helped offset rising wages and slumping sales. Restaurant prices, however, have largely stayed the same.The Georgia Dock prices have come in handy to the big poultry producers.In 2014, avian flu hit and many countries around the world banned American chicken, causing the price of dark meat cuts like thighs, which are favored overseas, to plummet. That temporarily hurt the industry.But in the bigger long-term trend since the financial crisis, people are eating more at home and looking for cheaper meat. The average American ate 90 pounds of chicken in 2015, according to the National Chicken Council, compared with 84.9 pounds in 2008.Much of that chicken is being bought by supermarkets. For example, about 35 percent of the production from Sanderson Farms, the third-largest poultry producer, is sold to supermarket chains. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, the second-largest, declined to say what portion of its production is destined for grocery stores, but it has told Wall Street analysts the amount is about half.Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer at Sanderson Farms, said the higher demand from consumers may account for the strength of the Georgia Dock compared with the other indexes. All but one of the grocery stores that buy from Sanderson use the Georgia Dock to negotiate prices, he said.\u201cThe retail grocery store remains the strongest market for chicken,\u201d Mr. Cockrell said. He added, \u201cWe were profitable in the fourth quarter of last year, for instance, only because we were making money from the chicken we were selling to the retail market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Generation of Hedge Fund Stars: Data-Crunching Computers", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byEvery five minutes a satellite captures images of China\u2019s biggest cities from space. Thousands of miles away in California, a computer looks at the shadows of the buildings in the images and draws a conclusion: China\u2019s real estate boom is slowing.Traders at BlackRock, the money management giant, then use the data to help choose whether to buy or sell the stocks of Chinese developers. \u201cThe machine is able to deal with some of the very complex decisions,\u201d said Jeff Shen, co-chief investment officer at Scientific Active Equity, BlackRock\u2019s quantitative trading, or quant, arm in San Francisco.The future star of the hedge fund industry is not the next William A. Ackman, Carl C. Icahn or George Soros. Rather, it is a computer like the one at Scientific Active Equity, which sifts through data like satellite images from China every day.Math whizzes have long dominated the hedge fund universe, but until recently, only a handful of well-known firms like Renaissance Technologies, the D. E. Shaw Group and AQR Capital Management used mathematical models and computers to plot out trading techniques. And other than the occasional blowup, as when Long-Term Capital Management went bust in spectacular fashion in 1998 after its models failed to factor in the possibility of a Russian government debt default, the world of quantitative trading has remained out of the limelight.Now, as the financial world faces dismal returns and investor criticism over high fees, hedge fund managers are turning to computers to make decisions that used to be left to humans about which stocks to buy and sell, for example. Celebrity investors like Mr. Ackman are slowly being replaced by teams of Ph.D. holders who develop mathematical equations for trading and systems to scrape huge sets of data for patterns.For instance, the billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who runs the Tudor Investment Corporation, needed to make changes after investors pulled more than $2 billion from his firm, which now manages $10.6 billion. So he cut staff and brought in mathematicians and scientists to build up an analytical team. Other hedge funds have made similar moves.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a kind of bifurcation among hedge funds, with some moving towards more quant-driven or automated style, while others are turning towards a more \u2018long-only\u2019 model, where they are judged on longer-term investment performance,\u201d said Craig Coben, global head of equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Big institutional investors are also diverting more money to the hedge fund firms that use computer-driven hedge fund strategies.While the hedge fund industry in recent months has suffered the biggest quarterly outflow since the financial crisis, investors continue to allocate money to hedge funds that use computer-driven strategies. Investors have put $7.9 billion into quantitative hedge funds this year, and the universe of hedge funds devoted to these strategies has more than doubled, to $900 billion from $408 billion seven years ago, according to Hedge Fund Research.More broadly, money flowing out of the hedge fund industry as a whole comes at a time when performance has been disappointing. The Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, the broadest gauge of hedge fund performance, has lagged the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year, gaining 3.56 percent through the end of October compared with the index\u2019s 4 percent gain over the same period, accounting for reinvested dividends.\u201cFrankly, we expect to see assets move from human managers to machine managers,\u201d Tony James, chief operating officer of Blackstone, told investors earlier this year. The Blackstone Alternative Asset Management arm, which manages $70 billion in hedge fund investments, is a big investor in quant-related hedge fund firms and has put billions of dollars toward these firms in recent years. The division now has $10 billion invested in quant-dedicated hedge fund firms, according to one person with direct knowledge of the firm; it has not publicly released the number.Some industry observers warn that hedge funds building out new quant arms may simply be trying to capture investor money that is flowing into the strategy. But veterans in the quant world see the trend as an indication that the industry is finally catching up to other industries in which technology has disrupted businesses.\u201cThe portfolio investment industry has been relatively late to adopting technology,\u201d said Philippe Jordan, the president of Capital Fund Management, a 25-year-old quant hedge fund firm that manages $6.9 billion. \u201cFinance is deeply conservative in nature,\u201d he added.Capital Fund Management has 160 employees, including 40 scientists, most of whom hold Ph.D.s in physics; 75 employees are focused on information technology, 20 of which are in data management. Like other types of hedge funds, the firm has a research department. The only difference is that at Capital Fund Management, the analysts who conduct research approach the work more like academics, and ideas are peer-reviewed.With more investor money going toward firms that build models to trade on, there is some concern that these models will begin to look similar, potentially resulting in overcrowding. That could be a problem if there is a sudden event that drives everyone to start selling at the same time, something that happened during the \u201cquant crunch\u201d in the summer of 2007.

Mr. Trudeau\u2019s open approach to immigration and refugees is the inverse of Mr. Trump\u2019s. And Canada will be in a difficult position if it imposes carbon taxes only to find that Mr. Trump undoes all American efforts to mitigate climate change.One of the few positive developments for Canada is Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s decision to block the Keystone XL pipeline.\u2014 IAN AUSTENBan Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said it was \u201cworth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the country\u2019s greatest strengths.\u201dAs if to remind the United States of its role as a guarantor of world stability, he noted that it is \u201can essential actor across the international agenda.\u201dMr. Trump has demanded that the NATO allies of the United States foot more of the bill for their collective defense. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, noted that the alliance comes with legal obligations.\u2014 RICK GLADSTONE and JAMES KANTERLater, however, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, warned that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, and the election of Mr. Trump, should raise alarms. \u201cThe events of the last months and days should be treated as a warning sign for all who believe in liberal democracy,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cWe cannot be dependent anymore on the U.S., we have to take charge of our own destiny.

Under the agreement, Iran has given up large chunks of its nuclear program in exchange for some sanctions relief.The head of Iran\u2019s atomic energy program told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency on Wednesday that the country would \u201ctry to continue to implement the nuclear agreement.\u201dIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that the presidential debates had illustrated \u201cthe crisis America is in.\u201d Some analysts said the election of Mr. Trump was the result of an \u201cawakening,\u201d Iran\u2019s ideological label for some of the Arab Spring revolts.\u201cPresident-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel, and I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The United States is Israel\u2019s most important ally.The Israeli government, which has often had a tense relationship with the Obama administration, has studiously avoided taking sides, but at the same time, Jerusalem has moved to improve relations with India and Russia, and is in talks to develop economic ties with China.\u2014 ISABEL KERSHNERAcross the Middle East, where the United States has a long history of often divisive involvement, many seemed to have no idea how to react to the election of Mr. Trump.Syrians, too, said they had little inkling what the vote would mean for the civil war in their country, although many in the opposition had expressed hope that a victory for Hillary Clinton would mean more robust support for the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad.Many have expressed worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about Islam and Muslims would translate into aggressive policies in the region, as well as making it harder for displaced Syrians to seek refuge.\u2014 BEN HUBBARD, ANNE BARNARD and HWAIDA SAADPrime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had been planning to meet Mrs. Clinton in Washington in February, tried to calm his country, as the yen surged and stocks stumbled. \u201cHand in hand with Trump, we will try to work together,\u201d he said.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump singled out Japan. He claimed that Tokyo was not paying its fair share to support United States military bases, calling into question the American commitment to defend Japan in case of attack.A rising China could put a check on Mr. Trump\u2019s stated ambitions in Asia. \u201cMaybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,\u201d said Shin Kawashima, professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. \u201cBut if he carries out such a policy, China will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against Trump\u2019s policies. It is a little difficult for Trump to just change all the old policies.\u201dPresident Park Geun-hye of South Korea instructed her government to coordinate closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team to ensure that her country and the United States would maintain sanctions and pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program.\u201cNorth Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond\u201d to provocations, said Jeong Joon-hee, a government spokesman.Mr. Trump unsettled South Koreans when he said that he might withdraw American troops from their country unless Seoul paid more for their presence. He also indicated that he might let Japan and South Korea protect themselves with nuclear weapons and that he might negotiate directly with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Mr. Trump\u2019s surprisingly strong performance caught analysts off guard, but it was welcome news for those in South Korea who believe that their country must build its own nuclear weapons to defend against North Korea.\u2014 CHOE SANG-HUNPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia was one of the first leaders to offer effusive praise for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe world has watched this year\u2019s presidential election with fascination,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt almost every turn, media commentators have been proved wrong and the results anticipated by experts have been overturned. Donald Trump was considered a distant outsider when his candidacy was first announced. He beat the establishment consensus by winning the Republican nomination, and did so again with his remarkable victory today. Mr. Trump\u2019s success shows that politicians should never take voters for granted.\u201d\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are alike. We both swear.\u201d\u2014 SEWELL CHAN and RICHARD C. PADDOCKFor India, a central question is whether Washington will reduce its military presence.\u201cIf that is called into question, India will no longer be able to rely on the U.S. to be there as a security provider,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, a fellow at the Brookings Institution India Center. The result could be more assertive attitudes from China, Japan and Korea.Manjeet Kripalani, the executive director of Gateway House, a Mumbai-based think tank, likened Mr. Trump to Putin of Russia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and Mr. Modi. (A former journalist, Ms. Kripalani worked for Steve Forbes\u2019s 1996 presidential campaign.)As far as any change in the relationship between India and the United States is concerned, she predicted, \u201cYou will find the Trump administration being realistic about Pakistan, being realistic about India and realistic about China.\u201d\u2014 ELLEN BARRY and NIDA NAJARPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reassured his people that \u201cAmericans understand that they have no stronger ally, no better friend, than Australia.\u201dMr. Turnbull said the American role in the Pacific region had underpinned stability, economic growth and a rules-based order, a term he and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop have used when discussing the resolution of disputes with China over territorial and fishing rights in the South China Sea.\u201cI have great confidence that all of our engagement will continue to be strong and intimate, filled with the trust and confidence that has characterized it for so many years,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.\u2014 MICHELLE INNISAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Electronics, Pushed by Investors, Will Consider Restructuring", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Under pressure from investors, Samsung Electronics said on Tuesday it might restructure its vast operations as a way to unlock shareholder value.The family-controlled South Korean electronics giant said it would consider creating a holding company and listing its operations on international exchanges. Samsung will begin a review of its options that will take at least six months, it said.A Samsung move to restructure could ease some of those concerns, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a research and brokerage firm.\u201cPost restructure, we expect to see more alignments between the de facto \u2018owners\u2019 of Samsung group and the rest of the shareholders, and thus, expect more shareholder friendly measures\u201d like dividends and buybacks, wrote the analyst Mark Newman.Samsung also said it would increase its dividend by more than one-third from this year\u2019s level and buy back more shares.Although Elliott is a small shareholder, the call gained traction with other shareholders after Samsung suffered setbacks. The biggest was the recall and cancellation of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last month. The phone won strong reviews for its design and was considered a step forward in its competition with Apple\u2019s popular iPhone. But some of the units burst into flame, and Samsung canceled the phone after a bungled recall process.Still, Elliott had argued that the electronics company\u2019s problems went beyond defective phones. In a letter this autumn, it said that the opaque and densely linked holding structure of Samsung\u2019s many companies meant the true value of the company\u2019s electronics operations had not been fully reflected in its share price.Samsung Electronics is part of the larger Samsung empire, a constellation of companies controlled by the family of its chairman, Lee Kun-hee. Jay Y. Lee, Mr. Lee\u2019s son and vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was expected to be a key part of any restructuring. Last month he was approved as a director of the company, which was widely seen as increasing his influence there.The push by Elliott comes after it lost an effort last year to halt the merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, a move designed to consolidate power in the hands of the younger Mr. Lee.Although that effort won the backing of international investors, it also earned Elliott the moniker \u201cvulture capitalist\u201d within South Korea, where large family-run companies, known as chaebol, often fiercely resist outside intervention.This time, however, things could be different. The company has taken a softer tone, and in the announcement on Tuesday, Samsung seemed to have addressed most of the points in Elliott\u2019s letter, though it stopped short of committing to a full-on restructuring. Instead it said that it had \u201cretained external advisers to conduct a thorough review of the optimal corporate structure,\u201d which would take six months.In its letter, Elliott argued that the company should divide itself into two publicly traded companies: a holding company that serves as the Lee family\u2019s main ownership vehicle, and a separate company that would hold the electronics business.videoAdvertisement"}

If the title sounds odd to American readers, that\u2019s because in the U.S., the stone was a sorcerer\u2019s.Book and movie titles differ often in adaptation \u2014 and not always because producers think sorcery is more enticing than philosophy.Other cases are simply random.While it would have been a stretch for the movie \u201cBlade Runner\u201d to be called \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\u201d the film\u2019s title doesn\u2019t appear in the Philip K.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Changes to the Tax Codes May Encourage Dynastic Wealth", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersIf Donald J. Trump follows through on his campaign promises, a host of taxes that affect only the very richest Americans may be eliminated, along with almost all tax incentives to be philanthropic. As a result, wealthy families may find it much easier to amass dynastic levels of wealth.At the top of the list is the estate tax. Currently, the rules are straightforward: A married couple is exempt for the first $10.9 million in their estate, and they pay a 40 percent tax on the amount above that.With that agreement, more than 99 percent of Americans were exempted from the estate tax.Last year, for example, the Internal Revenue Service processed just 4,918 federal estate tax returns (though it collected about $17 billion in taxes).Working on a policy to appease such a small number of people could be seen in two ways: a waste of political capital or an end to a tax that Republicans have historically decried as unfair and Democrats have held up as a guard against generational wealth.But Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal is not as straightforward as simple repeal. His plan also said, \u201cCapital gains held until death and valued over $10 million will be subject to tax to exempt small businesses and family farms.\u201d In other words, the tax on capital gains above $10 million would have to paid only when, or if, the assets were sold.For some accountants, the proposal brought back memories of 2010, when the estate tax briefly expired and assets in a wealthy person\u2019s estate were subject to capital gains tax on the appreciated value. This proved to be a headache. Few people keep sufficiently detailed records to find the original purchase price on stocks or to account for improvements to properties over decades.Yet the Trump plan, as some attorneys and accountants have read it, would allow the wealthiest heirs to never pay capital gains taxes if they did not sell what they inherited. This would be difficult for those with a modest inheritance because they generally sell and spend what they get. But it might not be for people with a large inheritance, like Mr. Trump\u2019s children, who would receive a portfolio of income-producing real estate and golf courses, which they could borrow against and never sell.\u201cMost people who have substantial wealth have that wealth in capital assets that tend to grow in value,\u201d said Marc J. Bloostein, partner in the private client group at Ropes & Gray. \u201cIt comes down to whether you\u2019re going to sell those assets. Someone who inherits the family compound, that\u2019s great. Someone who inherits a business on the auction block, you have to pay the taxes.\u201dAs for deductions for charitable contributions, Mr. Trump addressed that in two areas of his platform. As part of his proposal on the estate tax, he said, \u201cTo prevent abuse, contributions of appreciated assets into a private charity established by the decedent or the decedent\u2019s relatives will be disallowed.\u201d In the section on the income tax, he said all itemized deductions would be capped at $200,000 for a couple.While most people use itemized deductions for state income taxes paid and mortgage interest, those deductions for wealthier people who live in states without income tax and have no mortgages on their homes come from charitable contributions. And those contributions are often in the millions, or tens of millions, of dollars.Capping the deduction at $200,000, and disallowing a deduction, it seems, for putting appreciated assets into a private family foundation would greatly limit the financial incentive for the wealthy to be charitable, financial advisers said.Of course, many advisers will say that tax incentives are not the only reason people give to charity. But tax incentives factor in at some level, and are generally credited with making Americans the most philanthropic people in the world.\u201cI\u2019m upset by the possibly that I will be limited in my deductions to help more needy people,\u201d said Todd M. Morgan, chairman and chief executive of Bel Air Investment Advisors, who is in favor of repealing the estate tax. \u201cI\u2019ll still do it, but it\u2019s unfortunate. If it doesn\u2019t get watered down, that part of the tax law will be negative for the needy people.\u201dTwo taxes that in recent years have been coupled with the estate tax could also go away: the gift tax and the generation-skipping tax. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal does not address them explicitly. But tax advisers said they believe he could repeal them as well. If that happened, the economic impact could be greater than the end of the estate tax.The gift and generation-skipping taxes have existed to keep wealthy individuals from avoiding an income tax. If, for example, a wealthy individual were to give assets to children or grandchildren who are in lower income tax brackets, they would pay a lower tax on them, reducing the amount of money the United States Treasury would bring in.\u201cThe estate tax isn\u2019t going to affect people in rural areas who came out in droves to vote for him,\u201d said Sarah T. Connolly, a partner at the law firm Nixon Peabody. \u201cOn the other hand, he\u2019s promised all kinds of tax reform.\u201dWhile the Republicans will have control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump may still struggle to repeal the estate tax.Richard Behrendt, director of estate planning at Annex Wealth Management and a former I.R.S. inspector, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be as easy as it might appear on the surface.\u201dSuch partnerships are typically used to hold family assets, like a private company. The I.R.S. has allowed discounts of around 30 percent for the shares in those entities since the pool of willing buyers is presumably small. (If the partners consist of relatives, the theory goes, an outsider would buy into a share only at a steep discount.)But these entities have been under scrutiny for abuse, as some wealthy people have filled them with assets that can easily be valued, like marketable securities, but still take a large discount.Now, advisers said this week that they believe the meeting scheduled to close this loophole will do nothing, if it even takes place.All of these tax changes are on top of the broader ones aimed at reworking corporate taxes \u2014 which would benefit some business owners, too \u2014 lowering personal income tax rates and eliminating the 3.8 percent investment income tax that was used to pay for the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump said he wants to repeal.From a candidate whose message has been described as populist, his tax proposals seem to run counter to that. They would allow for the creation of generational wealth to rival that of the last Gilded Age, after which the modern estate tax was enacted in 1916.Not everyone sees Mr. Trump\u2019s tax proposals as contrary to his campaign message. Joe Duran, founder and chief executive of United Capital, a wealth management firm, said the president-elect\u2019s tax proposals are wholly consistent with his campaign.\u201cUsually, populist votes are about bigger government,\u201d Mr. Duran said. \u201cThis is about less taxes, less government, less regulation. That\u2019s what the overwhelming number of people were voting for.\u201dStill, the tax proposals could mean giving up revenue that could help fund many of the projects, like infrastructure, that Mr. Trump has promised will create jobs.And Mr. Duran said he is also convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax proposals, if approved, will contribute to the further concentration of wealth. \u201cDynastic wealth is here to stay,\u201d he said, \u201cand people don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Seeks to Jump-Start College Savings by Giving Cash to Kindergartners\u2019 Parents", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byStarting next fall, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio will create college savings accounts for thousands of New York City kindergartners, in a three-year pilot program intended to increase the number of low-income children who go on to attend college.The program will begin in New York next fall in one of the city\u2019s 32 community school districts. Julie Menin, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, who conceived of the program in her previous job as the commissioner of consumer affairs, said the district chosen would be announced in December.Children enrolled in traditional public and charter school will receive accounts. The program will be overseen by a newly created nonprofit, NYC Kids Rise, whose board is to include Ms. Menin, Schools Chancellor Carmen Fari\u00f1a and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s deputy mayor for strategic policy initiatives, Richard Buery.Ms. Menin said that soon after taking office in 2014, she met with the treasurer of San Francisco, Jos\u00e9 Cisneros, who told her about that city\u2019s program.\u201cI became more and more excited about the possibility that we could do this here in New York City,\u201d she said, \u201cand I felt that it fit in perfectly with the mission of the de Blasio administration in terms of increasing access and inclusion for low-income New Yorkers.\u201dThe initial $100 contributions will be deposited into an omnibus 529 account, so that undocumented immigrants, who do not have the Social Security or individual taxpayer identification numbers needed to set up individual accounts, can participate. At the same time, families will also be encouraged to start their own individual 529 accounts for saving.Actual college savings, if families do not add money to the funds, will be slight: With only the $100 initial contribution and $200 in matching funds, assuming a 4.5 percent annual return, the child\u2019s account would be worth about $475 after 12 years.William Elliott, an associate professor and director of the Center on Assets, Education and Inclusion at the University of Kansas, said child savings accounts had many potential financial benefits.\u201cIf you have savings early on, you\u2019re more likely to be connected to financial institutions later in life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to buy stocks, invest in real estate, buy a home, do the things that build assets.\u201dMore than 800,000 New Yorkers do not even have bank accounts, Ms. Menin said. She said she hoped that the program would have a ripple effect in connecting families with financial institutions.Mr. Gray said he and his wife were attracted to the idea of increasing financial literacy among low-income families and encouraging saving.\u201cI love the idea of democratizing the benefits of long-term investing,\u201d he said.Ms. Menin said she hoped eventually to expand the program to the rest of the city, which she estimated would cost $15 million annually.Mr. Gray said he was open to making additional donations but would first see how many families opened up their own 529 accounts and saved enough to get the $200 in matching funds.\u201cIf we get a lot of takeup,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have a lot of families saving money, investing, opening up these 529 accounts, that to me and to us would be a sign of real success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Stock Markets, Initially Shaken, Went Up After Trump\u2019s Victory", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Supported byAfter a sharp sell-off overnight in Asia, markets staged a recovery on Wednesday as investors shook off the shock of a Donald J. Trump presidency and began to focus on whether his mix of policies could spur a still-fragile global economic recovery.Futures for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index initially plunged 5 percent but recouped nearly all their losses when stocks started trading in the United States. The major market indicators ended the day up more than 1 percent.By their nature, markets are wired to look beyond the moment and into the future. In that regard, the bounce-back in stocks reflects the bet being made by many investors that Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to increase government spending, cut taxes and ease financial regulations will outweigh his anti-trade rhetoric.To that end, stocks that would benefit from more robust economic growth, like banks and companies tied to infrastructure and transportation, were in demand on Wednesday. Shares of Bank of America closed up 5.7 percent. The equipment rental company United Rentals ended up 17 percent.More broadly, however, market experts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory should be viewed as a loud signal from Main Street that the time had come for fiscal policy in the form of increased government spending to replace central bank activism as a means to stimulate economic growth.\u201cThis was a political uprising,\u201d said Jurrien Timmer, a market strategist at the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments in Boston. \u201cMonetary policy has been part of the problem, in that the wealth effect has not accrued equally. If the baton is passed toward fiscal policy, that would mean higher inflation and lead to a rotation toward cyclical stocks such as financials.\u201dFor quite some time now, economists have been warning that the reliance of governments in the United States and elsewhere on central banks to energize economies via zero interest-rate policies and buying back securities was creating an uneven recovery by bolstering the housing markets in New York, London and San Francisco while real economies lagged.As Donald J. Trump began to solidify his path to the presidency on Tuesday night, international markets fell sharply. Wall Street was expected to react similarly, but was up on Wednesday.Increased government spending on highways, bridges and roads may well provide a lift to the broader economy, and tax cuts and looser regulations will be cheered by the financial markets.But there are downsides to these approaches, including increased deficits and levels of debt.Moreover, market analysts wonder how Mr. Trump will balance these policies, which are mostly positive for financial markets, with his promises to increase trade barriers on goods from Mexico and China.Mr. Trump\u2019s antitrade position has prompted fears that he would precipitate a trade war at a time when global trade is already suffering because of increased protectionist measures in countries around the world.\u201cThis is not Brexit,\u201d said Jeffrey Kleintop, an investment specialist at Schwab Investments, referring to the rally in stocks and bonds that soon followed Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. \u201cThat will be a long process of negotiated change. The worry is that Mr. Trump would follow through on his promise to raise tariffs on China and Mexico.\u201dIn that vein, emerging market currencies and stock markets bucked the market\u2019s buoyant mood. The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar and the Chinese renminbi continued a recent trend of weakness, suggesting, some traders said, that China might be pushing the currency lower to give exports an extra lift before Mr. Trump takes office.More than most days, investors flocked to exchange traded funds during the market\u2019s opening hours, with E.T.F.s at one point accounting for 45 percent of total stock market trades, according to officials at BlackRock. Among the more popular was iShares biotechnology fund, which soared 9 percent on the hope of fewer regulations for pharmaceutical companies under Mr. Trump.On Wednesday, the benchmark S.&P. 500-stock index closed up 1.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index also ended up 1.1 percent, while the narrower Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4 percent. Trading volume was the heaviest since the market turmoil of late June after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.For now, the market\u2019s willingness to cast a positive eye on a Trump victory seems tied to the prospect of more government spending.In the weeks leading up to the election, a noticeable trend has been the slow but persistent increase in the interest rates of government bonds, many of which have been in negative territory for some time as investors sought safety in these securities.The sell-off in Treasury securities on Wednesday was drastic, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, on the benchmark 10-year note past 2 percent for the first time since January. The yield, which touched a low of 1.37 percent in July, ended Wednesday at 2.07 percent.Analysts have said that these moves reflect a growing willingness of politicians around the world to loosen their fiscal belts to fight long-term stagnation. Any move toward a meaningful pickup in infrastructure investing would require more government borrowing and thus put upward pressure on today\u2019s low interest rates.\u201cThe question of lack of demand should be our preoccupation in thinking about macroeconomic policy going forward,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cAnd it has a natural solution \u2014 issuing debt to support whatever investments the government sees as best.\u201dGovernments around the world that are sitting on large piles of cash, like Germany, are facing similar pressures to take advantage of low rates to borrow and spend to stimulate a more vigorous level of growth.While such policies would also increase debt levels, economists who support Mr. Summers\u2019s policy prescription argue that a trade-off of higher growth is worthwhile, given how low borrowing costs are right now.Global investors initially reacted as if the world had caught fire. They yanked their money from the marketplace in an unrestrained bout of selling reminiscent of the outbreak of war.They even sold the United States dollar, which nearly always functions as a refuge in times of chaos. Yet hours later, the dollar rallied, oil prices recovered and even the Mexican peso came off its lows.Times reporters provided real-time analysis of Donald J. Trump\u2019s stunning upset in the presidential election on Tuesday.Neil Gough, Peter S. Goodman and Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shenzhen Connect Offers Chinese Stocks. Will the World Buy?", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global investors in two weeks will get direct access for the first time to the stock market in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, giving them a chance to bet on a tech-heavy clutch of private companies on an exchange sometimes called China\u2019s Nasdaq.But many investors will be skeptical, and the tale of Baofeng Group explains why.A largely unknown tech firm that designs online video players, Baofeng conducted a modest debut on the Shenzhen exchange in March 2015. Over the next three months, its stock rose 4,200 percent.The company went public at the height of China\u2019s share market frenzy, as speculative investment in stocks became the national hobby. Vast fortunes were minted \u2014 Baofeng\u2019s chief executive became a billionaire almost overnight.Then, just as quickly, investors\u2019 hopes were dashed. Chinese stocks imploded in June of that year. The government\u2019s attempt to stem the losses with trading suspensions, bans on selling and a campaign of state-directed buying only added to the concerns of private investors.Many fled the market and still remain on the sidelines more than a year later. As a result, shares of Baofeng \u2014 while up nearly 10 times from the day they began trading \u2014 are still down more than half from their year-ago peak.\u201cEvery stock went down largely,\u201d Wang Jing, an investor relations representative at Baofeng, said of the crash in an interview this month. \u201cThis has also had a big impact on the company.\u201dThe move is the latest test of China\u2019s readiness to allow a more open financial system. Despite China\u2019s status as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the United States, the country\u2019s financial markets are still comparatively immature.The leadership in Beijing worries that easing its grip too fast could lead to destabilizing flows of funds in and out of the country. Programs like the Stock Connect are aimed at opening the door wider \u2014 but also at retaining state control over the pace of liberalization.Analysts welcomed the move but questioned whether it would lift markets or lure much new investment. The main Shanghai share index has entered a bull market, having rallied more than 20 percent from its lows in January, but trading volumes remain a shadow of what they were during the boom.Part of the reason is that China\u2019s economic prospects have lost some of their luster, as growth has eased to its slowest pace in a quarter-century. At the same time, a weakening renminbi, the Chinese currency, has also reduced the attractiveness of investing in domestic shares.\u201cFrom the macro point of view there\u2019s obviously a big hill to climb as far as potential renminbi depreciation and the economic outlook,\u201d said Charles Salvador, director of investment solutions at Z-Ben Advisors, a consulting firm based in Shanghai. \u201cHowever, I still find this to be a turning point in the overall scheme of things.\u201dIf Shanghai is China\u2019s answer to the New York Stock Exchange, the traditional home to big, blue-chip industrial and financial companies, then Shenzhen is the country\u2019s answer to the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Nicole Yuen, vice chairwoman and head of equities for greater China at Credit Suisse, said that around two-thirds of Shanghai\u2019s stocks were state-owned companies, while in Shenzhen, the ratio was only about a quarter of stocks.\u201cThe significance of Shenzhen Connect is it brings to the international market a whole new horizon of stocks that are much more representative of the future of China,\u201d Ms. Yuen said this month, \u201cas opposed to the Shanghai Connect, which is very much more a representation of the previous China, so to speak.\u201dBefore the Shenzhen Connect, the only access foreign investors had to shares listed in the southern city was through the 14-year-old qualified foreign institutional investor program, known as Qfii, which is open only to large foreign funds or other big investors and entails a time-consuming approval process to invest or repatriate profits.The new link will open the door to smaller and more active investors, like hedge funds, and give them quicker access to over 800 new stocks \u2014 many of them entrepreneurial tech firms.Appetite for domestic shares \u201c has improved slightly from a very low level,\u201d said Jian Shi Cortesi, an investment manager for Chinese equities based in Zurich at GAM, an asset management firm.Still, Ms. Cortesi added, \u201cShenzhen Connect is not likely to bring large inflows from foreign investors to push up A-share prices.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Analysts, particularly in the financial markets, worry that an attempt to appease the pro-Brexit wing of her governing Conservative Party by focusing on restricting immigration could leave Britain without tariff-free access to the European Union.Other factors are also complicating things for Mr. O\u2019Connor and his team, who manage 4.7 billion pounds, or about $5.75 billion, across multiple types of assets: stocks, bonds and other investments.With interest rates at or near historic lows, central banks like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have few options left, when it comes to monetary policy, to try to support economies across the region.And years of those near-zero rates combined with quantitative easing \u2014 when central banks effectively print money to buy bonds, hoping to push other investors into riskier assets and bolster economic growth \u2014 have also left bond yields at multidecade lows.For traditional investors, driven by a rule of thumb that 60 percent of an investment portfolio should be in stocks and the remainder largely in bonds to offset those risks, such guidelines no longer seem to apply.Government bonds, Mr. O\u2019Connor said, \u201cdon\u2019t have the role that they once had.\u201dSo where do investors put their money?In his view, with the relative safety of Western economies in question, emerging markets have appeal.\u201cThe political risk in emerging markets is diminishing quietly, while it\u2019s picking up in the major markets,\u201d he said.Stocks in developing countries and emerging markets, he continued, have \u201ca really important role in portfolios.\u201d\u201cI think a world where we get a bit more macro momentum, a world where you have slightly higher inflation, a world where commodities continue to steady or grind higher is quite a constructive one for emerging markets.\u201dFlipping through a PowerPoint presentation, Mr. O\u2019Connor pointed to indicators suggesting it was now a good time to increase investments in emerging markets, given the differences in growth rates among developed and emerging markets, and the relative returns for equities in developing countries.\u201cIt\u2019s time to rebuild some exposure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Richard Rorty\u2019s 1998 Book Suggested Election 2016 Was Coming", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIt\u2019s worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs:[M]embers of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers \u2014 themselves desperately afraid of being downsized \u2014 are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else.At that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for \u2014 someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots. \u2026One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. \u2026 All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.Donald J. Trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman. But the essence of Mr. Rorty\u2019s argument holds up surprisingly well. Where others saw positive trends \u2014 say, a full-throated dawn chorus praising the nation\u2019s diversity \u2014 Mr. Rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine.His basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country, for all its flaws, was both perfectible and worth perfecting. Hope was part of its core philosophy. But during the 1960s, shame \u2014 over Vietnam, over the serial humiliation of African-Americans \u2014 transformed a good portion of the left, at least the academic left, into a disaffected gang of spectators, rather than agitators for change. A formalized despair became its philosophy. The system was beyond reform. The best one could do was focus on its victims.The result was disastrous. The alliance between the unions and intellectuals, so vital to passing legislation in the Progressive Era, broke down. In universities, cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice. By 1997, when Mr. Rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d few of his academic colleagues, he insisted, were talking about reducing poverty at all.\u201cNobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies, homeless studies, or trailer-park studies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause the unemployed, the homeless, and the residents of trailer parks are not \u2018other\u2019 in the relevant sense.\u201dDoes this overlooked category sound familiar?Mr. Rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities. But it just so happened that at the very moment \u201csocially accepted sadism\u201d \u2014 good phrase, that \u2014 was diminishing, economic instability and inequality were increasing, thanks to globalization.\u201cThis world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great American capitalists of the year 1900.\u201dAgain: Ring any bells?This group included intellectuals, by the way, who, he wrote, are \u201courselves quite well insulated, at least in the short run, from the effects of globalization.\u201dWhich left the white working-class guy and gal up for grabs \u2014 open to right-wing populists, maybe even strongmen. In Mr. Rorty\u2019s view, no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white working-class anxiety. This was a problem. \u201cOutside the academy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cAmericans still want to feel patriotic. They still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place.\u201dSounds an awful lot like Make America Great Again.At the time, Mr. Rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape. But it wasn\u2019t that different, ultimately. Today\u2019s just has more mature trees.In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d he wrote about the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement; today, he\u2019d probably have cautioned against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In \u201cAchieving Our Country,\u201d Mr. Rorty railed against the \u201cscurrilous demagogue\u201d Pat Buchanan, who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the Mexican border; today Mr. Rorty would have railed against Mr. Trump and his proposed wall.\u201cWhy could not the left,\u201d he asked, \u201cchannel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed?\u201dIs his analysis a bit oversimple? Yes. Even within universities, there have always been optimistic champions of America, those who ever-passionately believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work ever-diligently on formulating concrete, actionable policies that would make the country more just.By focusing only on his own environment, academia, Mr. Rorty\u2019s arguments also seem strangely parochial. During the 1960s, the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty, but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it: Robert F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia; Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society.But it wasn\u2019t enough, obviously. \u201cUnder Presidents Carter and Clinton,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote, \u201cthe Democratic Party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution.\u201d Mr. Clinton was particularly guilty of this charge, passing Nafta, appointing Robert Rubin as his Treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation. Mr. Obama pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And he was one of those fancy elites.Which brings us to Hillary Clinton. She may have had a plan to relieve the misery of the working class, but she didn\u2019t speak about it much. (Bernie Sanders did. And lost.) She was in favor of the Partnership until she was against it. In a paid speech to a Brazilian bank, she spoke of a \u201chemispheric common market\u201d for energy. And though her slogan was \u201cStronger Together,\u201d her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating difference, in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her.Here, Mr. Rorty\u2019s most inflammatory words are most relevant, and also most uncomfortable: \u201cThe cultural Left has a vision of an America in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized groups.\u201d Mrs. Clinton tried this strategy. It didn\u2019t win her the Electoral College. \u201cThis Left wants to preserve otherness rather than ignore it,\u201d he also wrote. That didn\u2019t work either.People are furiously arguing about what played a key role in this election \u2014 whether it was white working-class despair, a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change. It seems reasonable to think that all three played a part.What\u2019s so striking about \u201cAchieving Our Country\u201d is that it blends these theories into a common argument: The left, both cultural and political, eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity politics, leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored.\u201cIt is as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time,\u201d Mr. Rorty wrote. \u201cAs if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money, or vice versa.\u201dYou may quarrel with his argument; you may say that he was projecting onto the larger world what was happening within his own cloistered, ivied walls.

{"Headline": "In Brazil, Inward-Looking Investors Eye Opportunities Outside", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionTurim Family Office and Investment Management, a Brazilian wealth management firm led by Gustavo Marini, had a front-row seat. The office is within walking distance to the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, the site of the Olympic rowing events in August, and to some of the Rio Olympics\u2019 hobnobbing hospitality suites like Club France \u2014 where the swimmer Ryan Lochte\u2019s infamous adventure began.Now all is quiet on the lagoon, and Latin America\u2019s largest economy remains mired in its worst recession in decades. So what can an investor in Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy, do?Cariocas can often seem insular. That attitude is evident among the wealthy and business classes here, where old money predominates. When new Brazilian entrepreneurs start companies, they usually move to S\u00e3o Paulo rather than to here.Yet Turim and its founding partner, Mr. Marini, who is 57 and a Carioca, seek to chart a different course. He and his partners increasingly say they need to be proactive to diversify their portfolio better even if Brazil\u2019s economy eventually recovers \u2014 and they are cautiously optimistic that it will.The firm\u2019s partners visited India in September, and they have traveled to Silicon Valley three times this year. Despite widespread concerns over \u201cBrexit,\u201d they are keeping one partner, Nelson Isaac Abrah\u00e3o Jr., in London to lead overseas investments.Turim, founded in 1999, had about $1.38 billion (4.50 billion Reais) in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2015, according to an annual filing with Brazil\u2019s securities regulator, the C.V.M.Brazil\u2019s family offices, which manage assets for very rich families, hold immense wealth, but they have an aversion to risk that has long puzzled foreign institutional investors. During an interview at his firm, Mr. Marini said at least four times, \u201cWe are very conservative investors.\u201dStill, Turim is among the largest and most respected family offices. One private equity firm manager called it \u201cthe most sophisticated.\u201dTurim\u2019s bullishness on India, even though the country is a tiny part of its portfolio, is noteworthy. The business classes in India and Brazil still know very little about each other and do very little business together. But Turim is impressed with the economic management of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. \u201cHe is doing a good job with economic reforms,\u201d said Mr. Marini, who visited the country with Mr. Abrah\u00e3o.The firm made its first small investment there in public equities. Turim also plans to invest in the country\u2019s private equity market. Over all, India \u201cis a huge opportunity,\u201d Mr. Marini said.In 2015, the firm made its maiden investment in Silicon Valley, in the NEA 15 fund run by the venture capital firm NEA.In London, Mr. Abrah\u00e3o is monitoring the continuing fallout from the Brexit vote. He said that the business intelligence concentrated in London would most likely continue unabated, which would help the firm make decisions on investments in Asia from that office. \u201cLondon will still be a gateway to Asia,\u201d Mr. Abrah\u00e3o said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think any other city in Europe is equal.\u201dTurim invested overseas in its early days, but no more than about 30 percent of its total assets. That started to increase in 2011 as Brazil\u2019s economy showed signs of problems, and reached 60 percent by the second half of last year.The firm is not a stranger to global transactions. It invested in deals to acquire Heinz in 2013 and Kraft in 2015, led by the global investment firm 3G Capital, whose founders include the Cariocas Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Herrmann Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira.Until now, the firm has allocated much of its capital to Brazilian treasuries, which have payouts that are indexed to inflation plus interest rates. Brazil has long had some of the highest interest rates among emerging economies, giving family offices an easy way to make money.But in October, the country\u2019s central bank lowered its benchmark Selic rate to 14 percent, from 14.25 percent, the first decrease since 2012. That may be a sign of things to come. \u201cWe think interest rates will continue to fall,\u201d Mr. Marini said.That will create new investment opportunities in Brazil. \u201cWe are increasing our exposure to public equities in Brazil,\u201d he said, adding that infrastructure was likely to rebound and become attractive.Mr. Marini said he and his partners also saw signs of a Brazilian rebound. They think the current crisis will force the country to finally confront needed economic reforms, and they like the economic team of the new government.\u201cI think we currently have the right conditions for these reforms to pass,\u201d Mr. Marini said, which would mean \u201ca real opportunity for Brazil.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing in Creativity, and in the Greater Good", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersLORRIE MEYERCORD wants her portfolio to be made up entirely of investments that aim to do social good while earning a return. But in addition to established categories like the environment, clean energy and organizations benefiting women and girls, she invested in arts and creativity. And she hopes others will follow her lead.This month, she invested $1 million in housing for artists in Dearborn, Mich., and Memphis. The two projects, developed by Artspace, offer subsidized apartments to people who work in creative fields, meet an income requirement and pass a screening process by a committee of artists and creative professionals.\u201cI\u2019ve always loved the arts,\u201d said Ms. Meyercord, 40, whose wealth comes from an investment in a technology start-up she declined to identify. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically find ways to invest in arts.\u201dMaking such an investment was not easy. Ms. Meyercord, who lives in Hawaii, made hers through Upstart Co-Lab, a nonprofit organization founded last year to connect investors with people working in creative spaces. The organization aims to bring more capital to artists who are working on important social issues. (The money is not, however, for artists making art objects.)\u201cThere are artists working on all the important social issues,\u201d said Laura Callanan, the founding partner of Upstart Co-Lab. \u201cSome of those artists are starting social purpose businesses and, like any entrepreneur, they need capital. One of our goals is to unleash more capital for creativity.\u201dClimate change and shareholder activism are popular categories, said Lisa Woll, the foundation\u2019s chief executive. Interest in fostering community investing \u2014 like moving money into credit unions and smaller banks that support the local community \u2014 has doubled in that period, she said.But arts investments have yet to register, she said, given that the area is too small for large professional investors to get involved. In this respect, it is ideal for high-net-worth individuals.To make the Artspace investment work and to encourage others to invest, Ms. Meyercord also made grants to organizations that eased the process along.She provided $200,000 to the Calvert Foundation, which organized the $2.5 million investment in Artspace, so it could charge a lower interest rate. She also gave $100,000 to Upstart Co-Lab for operational support.\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of easy products to invest in on an entry level,\u201d Ms. Meyercord said.She said she liked that she would be giving artists a place to live and to help their creativity. But she does not expect a large return. \u201cThis feels like it falls into that category of not a huge yield but solid,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a huge, huge yield in terms of my own sense of impact and fulfillment.\u201dThe Calvert Foundation has set returns for its Community Investment Note ranging from 1 to 4 percent, depending on the length of the investment. The note has made $1.5 billion in impact investments in affordable housing, education and small business over the last 20 years, with a 100 percent return of principal and interest.Jennifer Pryce, president and chief executive of the Calvert Foundation, said that when Calvert was approached by Upstart Co-Lab, it analyzed its own $300 million portfolio and found that it already had $20 million in investments going to creative endeavors.\u201cWe had never looked at our investment portfolio in terms of groups directing their investment to arts or creative place making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was revealing to me that this has been part of my portfolio implicitly for years. These were groups we had lent to and been repaid.\u201dCalvert allowed Ms. Meyercord to direct her purchase of its Community Investment Note to Artspace, which made the investment easier for her. (The foundation had done similarly targeted investments for women and Latino groups, Ms. Pryce said.)Artspace has a track record of paying back its loans. Started in Minneapolis in the late 1970s, the organization has $600 million in real estate in 27 cities, said Colin Hamilton, senior vice president of national advancement at Artspace. Its aim is to provide affordable housing to artists and, with it, the security to practice their craft.Denguhlanga Julia Kapilango, a graphic design artist, recently moved into an apartment in the Dearborn Artspace. She said that going before the arts committee was intense but that she had enjoyed living among other artists for the last few months. Her apartment there is also larger than, and a third the cost of, the one she had in midtown Detroit.\u201cI\u2019m interested in using my graphic arts ability to help small businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve done is with an art conference centered around public literacy.\u201dYet Artspace points to one of the limitations of arts impact funding. Channeling investments into real estate is the easiest route. (In fact, 80 percent of the investments, across all sectors, made by the Community Investment Note were in real estate.)John W. MacIntosh, a partner at SeaChange Capital Partners, a nonprofit group offering investment banking advisory services to nonprofit organizations, has made many investments in arts organizations like Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the Healing Arts Initiative. He said real estate investments work well for impact investors because many arts organizations have buildings and a need to upgrade or maintain them.\u201cArts organizations need to raise capital dollars, but they also need to raise the right type of capital,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do it wrong, you\u2019ll end up with an albatross around your neck. You\u2019ll have the wrong kind of debt or too much debt.\u201dMr. MacIntosh said his firm managed two credit funds, one with money from foundations and the other with money from a group of high-net-worth investors.The firm has made impact investments across a range of sectors as well as grants to help organizations merge. He said that arts and culture organizations often are overlooked but that they need investment money, just as groups that work with the poor need it.\u201cIt\u2019s completely natural that we\u2019d be as excited about the arts as human services,\u201d he said.Ms. Callanan, whose background includes stints at McKinsey & Company and the Rockefeller Foundation, said she wanted to draw attention to people who identify as artists starting businesses to bring about change.\u201cThe founding partners of Etsy, Kickstarter and Airbnb \u2014 they all have artists on the team,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wonder if they can do it. We have proof.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go to the poet directly. It\u2019s going to the poet opening a business, whether it\u2019s a cafe with poetry or a print shop where people can go and make their 3-D printing prototypes or a slate of video games or a fashion business.\u201dAnother limit, though, is the size of the investment. Ms. Callanan said she would like the sector to be more open to smaller investors, the way the Community Investment Note accepts investments from $20 on up. Ms. Pryce said Calvert had not started exploring an expansion of the program to lower investment amounts.Ms. Meyercord said that she wanted to bring other investors along.\u201cMy hope is to let people see what\u2019s happening out there in terms of investments and to be inspired,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people invest their money and give it off to someone else, and they hope to get a lot back. They\u2019re not expecting to be totally inspired by what they\u2019re investing in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Banks Cheer Trump. So, After a Pause, Do Big Ones.", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWashington lobbyists, financial and policy analysts and Wall Street insiders are all trying to figure out what the Trump administration will mean for the banking industry.But Rusty Cloutier never doubted that Mr. Trump would be good for the small bank he runs in Lafayette, La.Mr. Cloutier sees in the new administration a chance not just for regulatory relief, but for a reordering of priorities away from the wealthy interests of the big cities and toward the rural and blue-collar communities where he operates.\u201cMy customers are very hard-working people,\u201d said Mr. Cloutier, the president of MidSouth Bank. \u201cThey work in the oil fields and they hear they are racist, and they just got tired of it being slammed in their face.\u201dHe added, \u201cTell your editors that they need to run a headline that says \u2018Main Street Won.\u2019\u201dAnd yet, in the weeks since Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election, Wall Street has been winning, too.The stocks of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years \u2014 a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise.The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo\u2019s share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in September.For now, banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the president-elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the industry, including the fees banks can charge, whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold.Banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a Trump administration\u2019s fiscal stimulus program revives inflation. Higher rates would increase the value of some of the banks\u2019 holdings and would widen banks\u2019 margins on loans.But like nearly all of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy positions, his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail. Mr. Trump\u2019s feelings on banks, perhaps more so than other industries, are difficult to sort out.On one hand, he has called for dismantling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits. On the other, he has railed against Wall Street elites for keeping down small-town America.How, then, will Mr. Trump justify policies that bolster bank profits, while also delivering on his promises of economic populism?Community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot. They say Mr. Trump can limit regulations \u2014 particularly on banks with less than $10 billion in assets \u2014 while still being tough on the Wall Street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public.Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural America Mr. Trump championed in his campaign.Several community bankers said they also wanted the Trump administration to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by installing a five-person bipartisan oversight board, rather than a single director.Among community bankers, support for Mr. Trump has been pervasive and consistent.Roughly 84 percent of community bankers supported Mr. Trump, according to a poll that the industry\u2019s trade group conducted after the political conventions this summer.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any Trump signs in my yard,\u201d said Tim Zimmerman, president of Standard Bank, which operates in communities outside Pittsburgh. \u201cBut I want the bank to do well and to be able to help people in the community. And I can\u2019t do that if things go the way they are going.\u201dIn reality, the nation\u2019s roughly 5,800 community banks represent a relatively small part of America\u2019s banking activity. About half of the nation\u2019s deposits are held by just a handful of mega-banks, where there was deep support for Hillary Clinton.Many on Wall Street helped bankroll Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in the hope that she would protect the forces that drive their global profits, like free trade. Many executives at large banks feared that Mr. Trump was a loose cannon who could destabilize the economy.The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, went so far as to publicly voice support for Mrs. Clinton. He made a cameo in a pro-Trump ad \u2014 along with Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and the investor George Soros \u2014 that painted the Democrats as puppets of the global financial elite. Critics called the ad anti-Semitic because it focused on Jewish figures.But as the stock market soared, the big banks began talking about the upside of a Trump presidency. Two days after the election, Mr. Blankfein said at the DealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times that he believed Mr. Trump\u2019s policies would be \u201cmarket supportive.\u201dUnprepared for a Trump victory, executives inside the big banks began drawing up lists of regulations or rules that the new administration and the Republican-controlled Congress might change for their benefit.They are not arguing for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, which large banks have spent hundreds of millions of dollars complying with.Nor do they want a less powerful consumer protection agency, which some credit with helping big banks by cracking down on players on the industry\u2019s margins, like payday lenders.At the top of their wish list: rolling back the so-called Durbin Amendment, which limits the fees banks can charge on debit cards, and tweaking the Volcker Rule so that large banks can engage in more types of trading activity to help their clients.As banking lobbyists seek inroads with the new administration over regulation, Democrats are trying to pressure the industry to denounce other actions by Mr. Trump, including his selection of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist. The former executive chairman of the Breitbart News Network, Mr. Bannon has been criticized for inflaming racist and xenophobic views.In a letter last week, Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking member of House Financial Services Committee, and other Democrats said the banking industry had a \u201cmoral obligation to speak out against this appointment as contrary to the values of this country and to the values of your industry.\u201dThe banking groups are declining to weigh in. Some say their input is not relevant because Mr. Bannon is not likely to have a direct role in regulating the financial industry.\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think he is a racist,\u201d Scott McComb, chief executive of Heartland Bank, which operates across Central Ohio, said of the president-elect. \u201cI think it is propaganda that is made to make him look bad.\u201dMr. McComb said while Mr. Trump said things during the campaign \u201cthat are not becoming of a president,\u201d he expected that Mr. Trump would act with more decorum in the White House.\u201cHe conducted himself like a New York City developer,\u201d during the campaign, Mr. McComb said. \u201cThat is how a New York City developer acts.\u201dMr. Cloutier, the Louisiana banker, said even if Mr. Trump appointed someone like Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman executive, to a top economic post, the president-elect would not forget his promises to working-class America \u2014 and by extension small banks.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be taking care of the sugar daddies who look down on the hardworking people of America,\u201d Mr. Cloutier said. \u201cBut if he don\u2019t deliver on that, he won\u2019t be around four years from now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Today\u2019s Giver, \u2018Robo-Advisers\u2019 Streamline Philanthropy", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byGiving Special SectionCharitable planning and giving is going \u201crobo.\u201dNew services are emerging that not only make giving automatic, but help you screen and select charities online that match your objectives. These \u201crobo-donors\u201d are also helping those who are tech-attuned to target their donations.Scott Yak, 27, a software developer with Google in New York City, came across a relatively new digital charity adviser called AgoraforGood.com, which screens more than one million nonprofits.Instead of just offering reports analyzing specific charities, Agora for Good creates customized, mutual-fund-like portfolios of nonprofits. The charities are grouped together based on 17 United Nations global development goals. Users can then assemble portfolios based on their specific objectives.\u201cI thought the fund concept was good,\u201d Mr. Yak said. \u201cI saw some charities that I never heard of and liked them. They were going in a direction I cared about.\u201dServices like Agora for Good join a new wave of online platforms that automate and streamline the donation process. They do much of the work for those looking to give by screening thousands of charities for the ones that align with a user\u2019s concerns and charitable mission. They are more data-driven and analytic as well, providing benchmarks for gauging how well the platform helped a user meet his or her goals.Other services are transaction-oriented such as AmazonSmile, which donates 0.5 percent of eligible purchases to a preferred charity. Other services that directly channel donations include Bright Funds, Google Wallet and PayPal.Angela Campbell, 32, chief executive of Agora for Good, said she started her venture to \u201cbring data and sophistication to online giving platforms.\u201dStarted in 2015, the service partners with donor groups that have cumulatively given more than $160 million per year to nonprofits. Ms. Campbell\u2019s goal is to channel more than $1 billion a year \u201cto address global poverty.\u201d To date, her service has handled more than one million transactions.Agora for Good, Ms. Campbell says, is targeting donors who seek a more tech-savvy, effective way of interacting with their philanthropy \u2014 many of whom are millennials \u2014 without middlemen like philanthropic advisers. There is a payment processing fee associated with the service of 1 percent to 5 percent; it is retained by Agora.There are also transaction fees such as 25 cents for donations from a bank account, and up to 3.25 percent for donations made via credit card.\u201cThe digital platform makes giving easier and more focused on progress,\u201d said Ms. Campbell, who, before joining Agora, had advised donors on investing more than $300 million in global development projects. She plans to enhance Agora for Good to make it friendlier for mobile devices and \u201cprovide push notifications on the charity\u2019s achievements to remind you to make regular donations.\u201dDespite the technological advances, though, how do users discern which nonprofit is going to best serve their specific charitable interests? Which is the most effective group trying to end the malarial scourge, for example? What are the strongest groups in the environmental or social justice arena?There is no lack of online information to rate charities based on their spending, mission and transparency. Some online services even group charities by their objective \u2014 such as environmental, international development and religious missions. But it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of charities and rankings available.All this information can be tough to review if you do not know exactly what to look for to gauge a charity\u2019s effectiveness. If you need more hand-holding, you could consider a donor-advised fund. While it is much less automated, you can work with a major mutual fund company to pool your donations in cause-oriented mutual funds.Fidelity Charitable, for example, offers a \u201cGiving Account\u201d that makes Fidelity the administrator for your donations to specific charities. You can donate cash, stocks or other assets to the account and write off from 30 percent to 50 percent in deductions from your taxable income.As with other donor-advised services, Fidelity levies annual fees based on a percentage of assets under management: 0.06 percent for administration and up to 1.23 percent for investment management. Any money not donated is invested and can grow over time. The Vanguard Group offers a similar service, along with other major mutual fund managers.Whether millennials or older generations will adopt the digital charity screeners remains to be seen. Millions of donors still give on impulse \u2014 in reaction to a natural disaster, for example.For a giver, streamlining charitable planning does take time and thought, although the technology is not perfect at screening millions of nonprofits for overall effectiveness, which is often hard to measure.\u201cThere\u2019s a data challenge,\u201d said Evan Paul, vice president of products for GuideStar. \u201cThere are no standard metrics or common math for evaluating charities.\u201dSimplifying and automating the charitable process is a game changer for those who want to give but do not want to or cannot devote much time to sorting through their objectives and vetting individual charities. It may speed their donations to the right charities with considerably less frustration.\u201cI\u2019m able to align my actions with my values,\u201d Mr. Yak said of his current philanthropic strategy. \u201cIt makes my life more meaningful over all.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that offers a \u201cGiving Account.\u201d It is Fidelity Charitable, not Fidelity Investments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Sent a Strong Signal on Trump ... Then Changed Their Minds", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe stock market\u2019s turbulent response to the election of Donald J. Trump \u2014 first down, then up \u2014 presents an interesting quandary: Was the election result good or bad for investors?Right now, it appears that they have made peace with the prospect of a Trump presidency. The S.&P. 500 \u2014 a broad-based index of stocks \u2014 closed last week 1.5 percent higher than its election-eve level. But this is a striking reversal from the initial judgment. Throughout the campaign, stocks rose whenever campaign developments made it less likely that Mr. Trump would be elected.If this was right, then a surprise Trump win should have led stocks to fall, and fall sharply. Just how sharply depends how much markets had already priced in the possibility of a Trump win, and our best guess was that it would lead stocks to fall by 8 to 10 percent.As predicted, traders in overnight markets responded savagely, and stocks plummeted. When the decline in S.&P. 500 futures hit 5 percent, it triggered the circuit breakers at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Foreign stock indexes were also cratering. While markets had yet to fall by as much as we had predicted, they appeared to be on their way.But then an unexpected second act began. The futures market reopened, and traders \u2014 who by now had had some time to digest the reality of a Trump presidency \u2014 reversed course. Over the next four hours, stock futures recovered around two-thirds of their earlier losses. By the time major markets in the United States opened the next morning for regular trading, stocks were almost back to pre-election levels. Stocks rose again on each of the following two days.What explains this roller-coaster?Some commentators have suggested that markets rallied in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s relatively conventional victory speech. His emphasis on infrastructure spending, in particular, might have boosted near-term growth expectations. But the speech began just before 3 a.m., three hours after the market turnaround. The speech was simply a rehashing of Mr. Trump\u2019s previously announced policies. A major infrastructure push might be good for stocks, but it\u2019s hard to believe that what was said at 3 a.m. changed the odds of its implementation. Moreover, the size of the stimulus \u2014 which would most likely be partly countered by a Fed tightening \u2014 is not large enough to explain a major market movement.Perhaps markets were responding to some other source of good news about the economy? I\u2019ve scoured news feeds from election night for other events that might have moved markets, and can\u2019t find anything.When conventional explanations fail, it\u2019s time to look for something more unorthodox.Mr. Zitzewitz thinks what happened is analogous to polling error. Overnight futures markets are populated by a relatively small number of traders who are attempting to predict how the broader market will respond the next day. Just as polling errors arise when pollsters survey more Democrats or Republicans than there are in the broader population, overnight markets can send faulty signals when they reflect more bears or bulls than the broader market.In his telling, the market turnaround really gathered steam when the European financial markets opened for regular trading at around 2 a.m. (Eastern time). And it continued with greater force as more of the world\u2019s traders awoke to discover that Mr. Trump had won and stocks were cheap.It\u2019s a story suggesting that it\u2019s worth listening to the signals from overnight markets, because they get it right on average. But it also suggests interpreting signals with greater caution than we showed, because they\u2019re an imperfect gauge of broader market sentiment.My own view is that last week\u2019s stock market gyrations reflect a more fundamental market failure.Call it a failure of imagination. Investors simply failed to imagine how they might feel when they woke up to President-elect Trump.Savvy investors are meant to be forward-looking and hungry for profits. There were huge potential profits \u2014 the opportunity to buy stocks when they were cheap \u2014 available for any investor who had the forethought on election eve to imagine that their colleagues would wake up and interpret what they already knew about Mr. Trump in a more broader or optimistic light.This failure to fully imagine the implications of the new world is not rational, but it\u2019s very human. I know that my thoughts in the days after Mr. Trump\u2019s win are different than those that dominated my election-eve conversations.What should I make of our forecast that stocks would fall if Mr. Trump were elected? One answer is that we were right, and that \u2014 at least until midnight \u2014 markets did fall sharply. A more humble answer is that we got this call totally wrong. It\u2019s not that we mis-measured what markets were telling us \u2014 I\u2019m confident we got that part right. It\u2019s that markets can change their minds, and we still lack a method for predicting that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philippines to Declare Marine Sanctuary in South China Sea", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Philippine officials said Monday that President Rodrigo Duterte planned to declare a marine sanctuary and no-fishing zone at a lagoon within Scarborough Shoal, a reef China seized in 2012.Mr. Duterte\u2019s communications secretary, Martin Andandar, quoted Mr. Xi as having called for a \u201cfavorable environment\u201d at Scarborough Shoal, which both countries claim. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a faxed request for comment on Monday.Experts said Monday that it would be difficult to assess the feasibility of Mr. Duterte\u2019s plan without further details, and that a crucial question was whether China would be involved in the implementation or enforcement of the proposed sanctuary.He added that the Philippines probably did not have enough ships to enforce such a ban, and that the lagoon sanctuary would offer only marginal fisheries protection in the absence of a corresponding fishing ban along the shoal\u2019s outer flanks.Scientists have long called for the creation of marine conservation areas in disputed parts of the South China Sea, arguing that the areas would help defuse tension over competing territorial claims while protecting ecologically sensitive spawning grounds from commercial fishing fleets.Leaders from China and Southeast Asian nations have mostly ignored the suggestion.Scarborough Shoal, known in the Philippines as Panatag Shoal and in China as Huangyan Island, is at the center of both the ecological and political dramas.Although Chinese Coast Guard ships have granted Philippine fishermen access to the shoal in recent weeks as part of a reconciliation between the countries, the shoal is still widely seen as a potential target of the island-building campaign. Scientists say that is especially worrying because the shoal plays an important role as a site where countless fish and coral species can breed, helping to maintain the sea\u2019s extraordinary biodiversity.Mr. Wu, the Chinese government adviser, said in an interview last month that the Chinese government had decided that no fishermen from the Philippines or China should be allowed into the Scarborough lagoon because both sides had inflicted \u201chuge\u201d damage on it by fishing with dynamite. He added that a Chinese-administered \u201cenvironmental protection park\u201d in the lagoon would represent an effort at bilateral cooperation, but he included an important caveat.\u201cA precondition for that is that the Philippines will respect China\u2019s sovereignty and jurisdiction in Scarborough Shoal,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Mr. Storey said that a multilateral management plan of the Scarborough lagoon had a chance to succeed and would be a logical extension of the reconciliation between China and the Philippines. But he said China would almost certainly not respect a unilateral fishing ban by the Philippines, much in the way that Vietnam has long ignored a unilateral fishing ban that China sporadically enforces in another part of the South China Sea.The Philippine proposal is \u201ca unilateral initiative,\u201d Mr. Storey said, \u201cand unilateral initiatives in the South China Sea have a history of going nowhere.\u201dFelipe Villamor contributed reporting from Manila.

{"Headline": "One Crucial Investing Question: Are Your Goals Different Now?", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyIf a majority of your retirement savings is in stocks, however, you don\u2019t care what the reason is. For many people, the temptation is to get out of the markets. And among some people whom Mr. Trump targeted with barbs and insults, there is palpable concern about much more than investments.So stop. Breathe. People often regret big financial decisions they make in haste. And consider the following:So we may be due for a fall, one way or another, though a research note from Goldman Sachs on Wednesday noted that some valuations similar to today\u2019s have previously led to 5 percent annualized returns in the next five years. Markets will do what they will do. But if you have been invested in stocks for a while now, you are most likely still a winner.Once upon a time \u2014 like, say, last week \u2014 you had an investing plan that was based on goals that may come years or decades from now. Perhaps you\u2019re hoping to buy your first home. Maybe you\u2019re trying to save enough to send a couple of children to college. You hope to retire by age 67.Has any of that changed? If it hasn\u2019t yet, then it\u2019s not clear why your investments should.Still, a bet on stocks has always been a bet on capitalism. American investors tend to have at least half of their stock investments in United States companies, and many global companies sell plenty of goods and services to people in the United States.I can\u2019t and won\u2019t time the markets, and most professionals who try will fail if they make those bets repeatedly over long periods of time. My long-term bet remains on America and global stocks for now, with a healthy portion in international and emerging markets.Retirees have a particular challenge here. Recent ones who are healthy, however, probably ought to plan on another 20 to 30 years of life, especially if there are two people in the household. That time horizon suggests the need for at least some stocks. Older retirees need to consider just how much their budgets could suffer if, say, a trade war sends stocks down 10 or 20 percent in a year or two. Perhaps it makes sense to park a couple of years\u2019 worth of basic expense money in cash just to be safe.But history suggests that you will earn less in bonds than you would if you had invested in stocks. If that\u2019s the result, then you\u2019ll need to save even more money, work longer or live on less in retirement (or some combination of the three). That may be palatable if you\u2019ve reached the limit of the anxiety you can tolerate.Or you can invest in a business of your own, which is a big, concentrated bet and a risky one, too. Owning rental real estate is another possibility, since whoever does get to live here will need a place to reside.In the cloud of strong feelings that forms when we feel threatened, it is tempting to turn our backs on the system that allowed these perils to emerge. Doing just that is a real option for the small number of people who are able to emigrate or live mostly off the land.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Off-Season", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byOff-Season\u201cYou live on Martha\u2019s Vineyard year round?\u201dIt\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked many times since I moved here from New York some 20 years ago. Sometimes I sense envy behind the question, sometimes pity. Do I live in bucolic bliss? Have I found solace in nature, a simplified, Thoreau-like existence? Or perhaps my inquisitors imagine me in one of those paintings of a lonely lighthouse, furious waves breaching the rocks, while the lighthouse keeper stoically rides the storm. Or perhaps they see a marooned Tom Hanks with only a volleyball face for a friend.The choice to live year-round on an island seven miles off Cape Cod is an unconventional one. But of course, life here in the off-season has the routines we all juggle: Take the kids to school, walk the dog, shop for dinner. A musician by trade, I\u2019ve managed to carve out a living on Martha\u2019s Vineyard as a bandleader, and my wife runs an after-school dance program.Years ago, we purchased the Old Martha\u2019s Vineyard Co-op Dairy in Edgartown. \u201cHeck of a wreck,\u201d the ad read; 30-plus years of neglect had left the rambling old farm building and its Ma \u2019n\u2019 Pa-style additions in disrepair: toppled chimney, leaky roof, caving walls, rotted windows. But we managed to renovate the property to include summer rental cottages and have raised two children here.People are sometimes surprised to learn that Martha\u2019s Vineyard is approximately four times the size of Manhattan, with six towns and four distinct villages within them. Oak Bluffs, Edgartown and Vineyard Haven are referred to as \u201cdown island,\u201d and Chilmark, West Tisbury and Aquinnah are \u201cup island.\u201d The \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d do not refer to north and south but to the westerly latitude/longitude coordinates. (When whaling ships sailed the globe, heading \u201cup,\u201d in nautical terms, actually took you west.) Down island is more densely populated, and Edgartown, particularly, retains the flavor of the whaling industry, with its sea captains\u2019 homes and bustling mercantile feel. Up island is more bucolic, with spectacular beaches, farms and wooded trails.Vineyard life follows a seasonal rhythm all its own. In summer, the year-round population of 15,500 swells to 115,000, creating a hectic pace. Only a quick wave was offered as I passed an old friend last August, his gesture conveying a familiar sentiment: Too busy to talk; we\u2019ll catch up in the fall when things settle down. The Steamship Authority\u2019s ferries unload a steady stream of cars brimming with white coolers and colorful beach supplies. Traffic on the two-lane roads slows to a crawl.Winter dulls the landscape as green meadows turn beige and amber, and the ubiquitous twisted scrub oaks, leafless, appear stark and naked, hunched over like weathered old witches clutching broomstick and cane. Edgartown\u2019s overflowing flower boxes are empty, cedar beach houses shuttered.The ferry is our lifeline to the mainland, to goods, supplies, mail, just about everything. Off-season it runs from 6 a.m. till 8:30 p.m., 9:45 on weekends. But when the winds kick up past 50 miles per hour, the ferries shut down. News of canceled boats quickly disseminates at coffee shops and checkout lines. Bar talk of a pending storm prompts the question: \u201cThink they\u2019ll be canceling boats tomorrow?\u201dEach year as the season comes to an end I keep a close eye on the weather, watchful for a fair day to haul my boat out of the water. One early December morning, the sun created a crisp, presolstice light; blues were a bit bluer, and what greenery remained seemed greener. It had been such a mild fall that I\u2019d left the boat in the water longer than usual, but winter was approaching, and I knew that hauling even my 20-footer and its 200-pound mooring and chain would only become harder.From Edgartown I steered my pickup toward Oak Bluffs via Beach Road, empty boat trailer in tow, my golden retriever, Bella, riding shotgun. Beach Road is a narrow, five-mile-long strip across the dunes. State Beach was on my right, the 745-acre tidal pond named Sengekontacket on my left. (The Wampanoag name means \u201cat the bursting forth of the tidal stream.\u201d)The Beach Road and its two bridges deliver a different view from day to day, hour to hour. In summer, the bridge\u2019s rail is lined with bathers poised for a 15-foot jump into the channel between tidal pond and sea. In the fall, fishermen cast in the moving waters of the channel below for striped bass or bluefish; others rake for clams in the adjacent shallow pond. In the heart of the winter, the half-frozen sea is gray, sluggish waves too heavy to crest, whitecaps crashing against the pilings and jetties.No Starbucks to compete with here. In fact, you won\u2019t find many chain stores; islanders have successfully fought them off. McDonald\u2019s tried to brandish its golden arches back in 1978, but that Goliath was chased away.Beyond Alley\u2019s, I took a right on Music Street, then a left onto Middle Road, where I twisted and turned under the gnarled tree canopy that filtered the crisp winter light. There is a farm stand on that road with amazing cheese, bread and yogurt drinks. A tin can acts as cash register; the honor system prevails here.I continued past the Chilmark Store, closed for the winter, where locals and Hollywood\u2019s best provision their August beach excursions. A mile up the road I backed my trailer down the ramp to Quitsa Pond\u2019s town landing, where I\u2019ve moored my boat for two decades.After a quick kayak trip to my boat\u2019s mooring, I cranked the engine and was off, cruising through the meandering tidal ponds to Menemsha, where I would top off the boat\u2019s gas tank. Menemsha, still an active fishing hamlet, has a New England coastal feel from days long past. One glance in the right direction and time warps back to the 1940s. Weatherworn cedar-shingle shacks, perched on the exposed strip of Dutcher\u2019s Dock, house the gear and tackle of what remains of Menemsha\u2019s once-bustling fishing fleet. Summer\u2019s wooden sailboats and small yachts flee for warmer climates in the fall; in winter, Menemsha is still home port to a dozen weathered lobster boats and a small fleet of draggers and scallop boats.I finished my lunch and headed back down island with the afternoon sun in my rearview mirror. I set my boat in its winter resting place next to an old twisted pear tree in our backyard, its bent branches a reminder of winter winds to come.I\u2019ve become accustomed to the seasonal pace on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Though I can\u2019t claim to have achieved bucolic bliss, I have enjoyed solace in nature. When winter storms rage, I am sometimes reminded of that stalwart light keeper, but in my 20 years here I\u2019ve never felt marooned. Like the ebb and flow of the tidal ponds, my final cruise marks the flow from fall to winter. And winter\u2019s low tide anticipates the flood tide of spring, with the promise of summer on its heels.An article last Sunday about Martha\u2019s Vineyard misstated part of the name of a road on the island. It is Edgartown-West Tisbury Road \u2014 not Edgartown-Airport Road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Helped Create Trump, and That\u2019s Bad for It", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the election of Donald J. Trump, technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency.Facebook and Google, for example, have both carried fake, frequently incendiary, articles that were highly shared by their users; Twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well, while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far-right hate groups organize and recruit, frequently targeting women and minorities on the site.The leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldn\u2019t try to police political debates. Facebook explains that it can\u2019t be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization.Nice try. These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels. They see America as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The American auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia. Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, said on Twitter that \u201cDetroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity. That is what is to be avoided.\u201dHere is the explanation from Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn\u2019s founder and a Clinton supporter, for Detroit\u2019s failures: \u201cThe overriding problem was this: The auto industry got too comfortable,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cThe Start-Up of You\u201d (the title alone speaks volumes). \u201cThe moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular.\u201d He also attacked any notion of continuity: \u201cInstead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst, they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism.\u201dMr. Hoffman goes further, arguing that it\u2019s not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world. People must harness them, as well.\u201cThe conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Information is limited. Resources are tight. Competition is fierce. The world is changing. And the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking. This means you need to be adapting all the time. And if you fail to adapt, no one \u2014 not your employer, not the government \u2014 is going to catch you when you fall.\u201dIt\u2019s an exhausting, Darwinian life he is describing \u2014 endlessly adapting to a changing, pitiless world. And it\u2019s precisely the opposite kind of life that Mr. Trump was espousing. His voters wish to return to the inefficient, enthusiastically nepotistic (you might call it family-based) factory life of the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 when America was great. Mr. Trump promised to bring his supporters\u2019 jobs back; the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy.It\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy. But at least he wasn\u2019t publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working Uber driver.There is one final irony. Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals. In the election, the biggest beneficiary of disruption was Mr. Trump, who defied all rules around decency, responsibility, truthfulness, consistency and even social custom, like releasing tax returns. And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied. Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalism also threatens the global consensus that is so important to the expansion of the tech giants. Yesterday, Russian authorities blocked LinkedIn over a data storage law.How do you like your disruption now?Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Images in \u2018Billy Lynn\u2019? Razor Sharp. Your Eyes? Bewildered.", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOn the other hand, when Steve Martin mugs as the owner of a pro football team, his face contains a level of detail normally preferred by dermatologists.These are the trade-offs of working at a high frame rate, the speed at which a film is shot and, in some cases, projected. The rate has a strong effect on an image\u2019s sharpness. Mr. Lee shot \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d at 120 frames per second, far faster than 24, the standard for about 90 years. Few theaters are presenting it at that rate, so most viewers are out of luck \u2014 or perhaps better off, depending on your views on frame rates.For some directors, like Peter Jackson \u2014 who shot \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d at 48 frames per second, to largely negative reaction \u2014 and James Cameron, higher frame rates are the future of movies, an opportunity to correct the motion blur that afflicts fast-paced action sequences shot at the standard rate.High frame rates aren\u2019t new; they\u2019re used in video games and on television. And that\u2019s the problem: Viewers, accustomed to the softer texture of movies, see the extreme sharpness of high-frame-rate cinema and feel intuitively that they\u2019ve stumbled into a theatrical broadcast or a football game.There were other experiments with frame rates in the celluloid era. The Todd-AO process of the 1950s ran at 30 frames per second. Cinerama used three simultaneous projectors and ran at 26 frames per second. In both cases, the higher rates were needed to accommodate outsize screens that made flicker and blur more visible.Tim J. Smith, an academic who studies visual cognition at Birkbeck, University of London, said there is no scientific reason 24 frames per second should be more appealing to viewers. \u201cWhat we\u2019re coming into the cinema with is the same audiovisual sensory system we have before we go into the cinema,\u201d he said. In theory, he said, the move to a higher frame rate should \u201clead to more natural, more effortless processing by the viewer\u2019s visual system.\u201dAcculturation may be the main reason moviegoers find the sharpness off-putting. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that people are sensitive to it,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing a crispness to the image, which is unfamiliar in the cinema context. Their main frame of reference seems to be TV or video, and kind of implied by that association is \u2018cheapness\u2019 or \u2018documentary\u2019 or \u2018immediacy.\u2019 Is it good to have that? It\u2019s hard to know.\u201dFor Mr. Trumbull, who demonstrated high-frame rates for Mr. Lee but did not take part in the production of \u201cBilly Lynn,\u201d the increased film speed of his Showscan process was a natural outgrowth of the move toward bigger screens and bigger spectacles in the 1950s and 1960s, but a faster rate was never taken up as the industry moved toward multiplexes and tiny auditoriums. He was effusive about Mr. Lee and his willingness to experiment \u2014 a \u201cwonderful, brave and courageous effort,\u201d he said.But after watching the movie at the New York Film Festival, he wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cI was really upset when I was at the premiere of \u2018Billy Lynn\u2019 that it was in a very narrow, small-screen theater,\u201d he said. He felt that it was projected with too much illumination, that it needed dark time between frames. (We don\u2019t perceive them as such, but movies are successions of still images \u2014 and on most projectors, each flash is interspersed with moments of darkness.) \u201cBilly Lynn\u201d has almost no darkness.In response, Ben Gervais, the film\u2019s technical supervisor, said, \u201cWe found that there was no real advantage in terms of the way that the movie felt\u201d with added dark time.Mr. Trumbull also said that it was crucial to present the film on a screen that filled a wider frame of vision, like Imax, to show the benefits of high-frame rates and to keep cinematic texture. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t draw conclusions about high frame rates as a result of \u2018Billy Lynn\u2019 being incorrectly presented,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be really tragic.\u201d Mr. Trumbull has a competing high-frame rate format, Magi, which is different from Showscan. But he said Magi has solved what he sees as the problems of \u201cBilly Lynn.\u201dIt may also be necessary, he added, for filmmakers to alter their approaches to suit the format. He recalled his own experience working on the visual effects of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d for which the camera motion was slowed so that the visuals would look smooth on a giant screen. \u201cThat\u2019s what kind of led to the style of the movie,\u201d he said.Like Mr. Trumbull, Mr. Goodhill said that it was possible to retain the cinematic texture while gaining the clarity of the higher frame rate. MaxiVision48 \u2014 lavishly praised in 1999 by Roger Ebert, among others \u2014 looked \u201cboth new and traditional at the same time,\u201d he recalled. But he emphasized that he doesn\u2019t necessarily regard that texture as the right one. \u201cThat\u2019s up for the individual artist to decide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Victory Bodes Well for Investors \u2014 for Now", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseAs the presidential election approached, they were falling all over themselves to predict a Hillary Clinton victory and, afterward, a modest stock market rally. The prospect of a win by Donald J. Trump was so remote as to be deemed a \u201cblack swan,\u201d an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial markets.Among the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump victory were analysts at Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Keith Parker, head of cross-asset strategy research at Barclays, forecast a drop of 11 to 13 percent in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further, warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2,000 points.With benefit of hindsight, what\u2019s extraordinary is how few professional investors saw it coming. Mr. Trump was derided as the candidate of \u201cuncertainty,\u201d which markets typically abhor, and many of his stated policies are vague, incoherent or inconsistent. But there was nothing uncertain about his overall pro-growth, pro-business and America-first tendencies, now backed by the firepower of a Republican House and Senate.He is, after all, a real estate developer.\u201cWe see tremendous opportunity for economic growth,\u201d said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of chief executives that was often at odds with Mr. Trump during the campaign, especially over trade and immigration. Now that the results are in, though, Mr. Engler sees a silver lining. \u201cThe Republicans understand,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they\u2019re on the spot to produce results.\u201dSimon Lack, founder of SL Advisors, an investment advisory firm and operator of a mutual fund that focuses on energy, carried the theme further. \u201cTrump\u2019s win is unambiguously positive\u201d for many sectors of the economy, \u201cespecially energy infrastructure,\u201d he said.The doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions to presidential elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve done extensive research that suggests presidential elections don\u2019t affect markets,\u201d said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. \u201cThe reality is that the market is influenced to the greatest extent by economic factors and monetary policy.\u201d\u201cIn almost all technical and macro aspects, this is still a bull market,\u201d Mr. Stack said, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election does not change that.Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election, said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Traders Almanac, because elections, whatever their outcome, eliminate a measure of uncertainty. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a Republican or Democrat,\u201d he said. Returns tend to be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes, as happened this week. And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed, on average, by a first-year performance of 14 percent.There are more specific reasons as well that investors applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s victory:Economists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Mr. Obama\u2019s stimulus plan saved 2.1 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009, bolstering the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2.1 percent.Construction company stocks rallied on Wednesday. Shares in Caterpillar, which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction, jumped more than 8 percent.Whatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates \u2014 not to mention worsening income inequality \u2014 tax cuts are another form of economic stimulus.\u201cTax modernization is our top priority,\u201d said Mr. Engler of the Business Roundtable, arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that if you want to grow gross domestic product by 1 percent, get tax legislation done. The House Republican plan is a great blueprint. One percent growth over 10 years would be $3 trillion.\u201dNeedless to say, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and Wall Street nemesis who Mr. Trump mocked as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d will not have a starring role in a Trump administration.Some of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely to be banks, drug companies and oil and gas pipelines. On Wednesday, shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, the biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent, and the pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose 4.5 percent.Whether the \u201cTrump rally\u201d persists is another question. In their rush to buy stocks this week, investors seemed all too willing to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s hostile stands on immigration and free trade, as well as his seeming indifference to the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. All of those have the capacity to damp growth or even tip the economy into recession.Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, was, like many others, surprised by the strong market rally. \u201cIf we get a large stimulus on top of a full-employment economy,\u201d he said, \u201cit may give you some juice in the near term, but longer term, it\u2019s going to hurt\u201d by driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investments.\u201cI was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense at 5 percent.\u201dMr. Parker of Barclays said he expected a sell-off initially, but also called for a recovery by year-end once investors absorbed signals from key economic policy makers. \u201cWhat we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours,\u201d he said, pointing to Mr. Trump\u2019s early-morning victory speech, which made no mention of trade or immigration, as one catalyst.Like many, Mr. Parker now sees more gains for stocks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy, if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up. \u201cThe backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stranded $2 Trillion Overseas Stash Gets Closer to Coming Home", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe next president may have a rare opportunity to close tax loopholes that have let American corporations stash more than $2 trillion in untaxed profits outside the United States.This enormous hoard of stranded cash has barely been an issue in the contentious election campaign of 2016, and precise predictions of deals that could be made in Washington are foolhardy until the nation goes to the polls.But this much is clear: There is a growing political consensus that the time has come for change in the tax rules to encourage repatriation of the vast troves of corporate earnings held outside the country. Companies, ordinary American taxpayers and thousands of investors have substantial and sometimes conflicting stakes in the outcome.\u201cEveryone agrees that something is going to be done about this,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now a law professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe question, of course, is exactly what.\u201dUnder current rules, by declaring that foreign profits are permanently or indefinitely reinvested abroad, American companies can defer taxation on that money. How much money, exactly, is subject to interpretation, but careful estimates extend from about $2.4 trillion to roughly $3 trillion.One reason is that the sums that could be made available for use by the government have become staggeringly large. Like the gravity of an outsized planet, the concentration of so much money creates a nearly irresistible force: Something needs to be done about it.An approach called deemed repatriation \u2014 in which untaxed foreign corporate profits are subject to immediate taxation \u2014 would provide a gigantic infusion to the Treasury and give corporations a significant incentive to move money home. Leading plans in Congress include this approach, Mr. Kleinbard said.Reforming the tax code is anything but simple, however. The details are crucial, and there are plenty of them, giving corporate lobbyists ample opportunity to shape eventual changes in a manner that favors the big companies.Consider the implications of that sum for a moment.On paper, if not in reality, corporations are required to pay a federal tax rate of 35 percent. If all of that money had been taxed at that rate, it would amount to $910 billion in taxes.In fact, Goldman Sachs research indicates that companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index paid a median federal effective tax rate of 28 percent, on average, over the last decade, while companies with high foreign earnings paid about 22 percent.But let\u2019s stick with the statutory 35 percent rate for a moment. My calculations show that at that rate, the lost corporate tax revenue would amount to almost two-thirds of all the money ($1.39 trillion) paid by Americans in personal income tax in 2014, according to Treasury data. And the lost tax revenue is more than 2.5 times the income tax paid annually by American corporations. Even if corporations were given a big break \u2014 which is highly likely under any tax code revision \u2014 the impact of any tax payments on those profits would still be large.Stock investors would also enjoy a windfall under earnings repatriation plans, but the lower the corporate tax rate, the greater the benefit. It\u2019s easy to see why.For one thing, studies show that in 2004 when the American Jobs Creation Act granted a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d in which companies were allowed to bring money home at a 5.25 percent tax rate, they used very little of their repatriated money to create jobs or develop new businesses or technologies. Most of the cash simply flowed to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.That\u2019s why the details of a tax deal are so important. A tax holiday could encourage companies to stockpile earnings overseas again and defer American taxes, while enriching investors. If $1 trillion were repatriated and companies funneled nearly all of it to their shareholders, the windfall would be very large indeed: It could come close to the $975 billion in buybacks and dividends for all S.&P. 500 stocks for the 12 months through June, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.For these reasons, in a recent report for clients, Goldman Sachs suggested that investors consider buying shares of companies with the biggest untaxed foreign earnings: Microsoft, General Electric, Apple and Pfizer, which also top the list of untaxed earnings giants compiled by Audit Analytics, an accounting research firm.There is a surprising degree of bipartisan consensus that the American tax system needs to be fixed and that the stranded earnings should be brought home. Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in line to be the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, have favored tax changes that would encourage corporate repatriation. Mr. Schumer and Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, agreed on the framework of such a plan, and President Obama did as well.A gigantic pot of money is sitting overseas. It will be up to the next president and Congress \u2014 and their counterparts abroad \u2014 to decide exactly what to do about it.Gretchen Morgenson, whose Fair Game column normally appears on this page, is away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Markets Are Really Telling Us About a Trump Presidency", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsOops.So what are the markets really telling us about global investors\u2019 perceptions of what the future holds during the Trump administration?The message that comes through after a careful reading of the data is this: Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises cut in the direction of higher economic growth and corporate profits. He envisions lower taxes on business, fewer regulations of all sorts and a burst of infrastructure spending. That may or may not help the overall economy, but it would definitely enhance the bottom lines of major companies, justifying the buoyant optimism evident in the stock market.And if Mr. Trump follows through on his promises to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, it would undermine the economic model of companies that rely on immigrants, including those in the agriculture and service industries.Essentially, markets are signaling that investors think the Trump administration will follow through more completely on the plans that are positives for growth profits and will be more cautious on those policies that are negatives. One way to interpret moves over the months and years ahead is as a continuing set of wagers over which set of policies the Trump administration will pursue with most vigor.In his election night victory speech, for example, Mr. Trump mentioned his intention to \u201crebuild highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d and to put millions to work doing it, but did not mention trade agreements or deportation. And the names that have floated around of potential Trump administration officials include many businesspeople and politicians who are historically more about cutting taxes and regulation than about resetting trade deals.Even if we knew exactly how all of the policies Mr. Trump campaigned on were going to be implemented, it\u2019s hard to know what the net result would be for corporate profits and interest rates.It would most likely vary widely among industries. Lighter environment regulations would be great for the energy sector. Major banks stand to become more profitable, given his transition team\u2019s promise to \u201cdismantle\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act. Trade-dependent companies, of course, have more to lose from a trade war.Markets are already pricing in exactly those dynamics. Since Tuesday, shares of the mega-bank JPMorgan Chase are up more than 8 percent. Shares of Apple are down about 2 percent.And it is even more clear when you look to international currencies. Most notably, the Mexican peso is down a whopping 12 percent against the dollar since Tuesday\u2019s close, which reflects fears that the looming renegotiation of trade relations between the two countries will damage Mexico\u2019s growth rate (though the drop in the currency will be a short-term boon to Mexican exporters).But when all the positive and negative effects of the Trump agenda are tallied up, the net result is that investors, today at least, are betting the positives will prove more substantial.That doesn\u2019t mean that the relatively sunny prediction implied by the first couple of days of trading activity will necessarily prove correct over time. Markets are particularly bad at pricing in seismic events that are hard to predict with confidence.For example, in 2007, a global credit crisis began in August, and there were signals everywhere that it could ultimately prove disruptive to the global financial system. Yet the stock market actually peaked two months later. The deepest recession in modern times began in December of that year, and stocks ultimately plummeted.In other words, if the Trump administration is going to be economically disastrous, the markets would not necessarily reflect that today.And after so much inaccurate prognostication about what the near-term market effects of a Trump victory would be, having some modesty about our ability to predict how his policies will play out in the years ahead is very much in order.Advertisement"}

But as incoming results made a victory by Mr. Trump look increasingly probable, a furious reversal took place.The steep drop across global markets as a Trump victory became more likely suggested that investors believe that the global risk premium \u2014 the compensation investors demand for all the varied risks around future economic and financial conditions \u2014 had risen. It suggests that if Mr. Trump prevails there could be global financial ripple effects.Asian stock markets plummeted, as did futures on major stock indexes covering the United States and Europe, including a 4.8 percent drop in Japan\u2019s Nikkei index as of 11 p.m. Eastern. United States Treasury bonds, typically a safe haven, rallied, pushing long-term interest rates sharply lower. The dollar was down 1.4 percent against other major currencies as of late evening, by which point Mr. Trump\u2019s victory appeared probable in The Upshot\u2019s election model.There was a particularly steep sell-off in the Mexican peso, which had the steepest drop against the dollar since the country\u2019s 1994-1995 currency crisis. The Mexican currency has consistently dropped when Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects improved in recent weeks, suggesting global investors believe that a Trump administration \u2014 with its threats of renegotiating trade agreements \u2014 would spell bad news for the country\u2019s economic outlook.The price of gold shot upward. Gold is often a defensive play by investors whose fears about the economy are building. Surging higher than $1,330 an ounce, gold had the biggest upward movement since the unexpected Brexit vote in Britain in June.The swings across global markets suggest that investors believe a Trump presidency will be a deeply uncertain time for the global economy, and even that some of the fundamental underpinnings of global commerce could come into question.Analysts have suggested that there are companies that could win in a Trump administration, benefiting from promises of lower corporate taxes and lighter regulation. But on the flip side, trade wars, a hard-line stance against international outsourcing and restrictions on immigration could prove bad for the bottom line for many United States companies.Markets hate uncertainty, and few people are certain of what a Trump administration would do.That said, market reactions can be volatile and overreact to the fundamentals of a situation. In June, when British voters elected to leave the European Union, global stock markets immediately sold off before stabilizing, and are now higher than before the vote.But in the case of Brexit, there is still evidence that the economic consequences will be long-lasting, with Britain\u2019s currency sharply below its levels before the vote, to around $1.25 compared with more than $1.50 on the eve of the vote.Advertisement"}

Investors followed their lead, loading up on long-term government bonds while growth was stagnant and political risk abounded. These investors now seem to be on board with Donald J. Trump\u2019s promise to stimulate the economy.They are also betting on the price of commodities important to the building business like copper, in anticipation of a pickup in government spending. Bank stocks have been bolstered by the belief that the industry will face less regulatory pressure. Higher interest rates would also help their lending margins.This is not without its risks. If bond yields \u2014 which move up as prices go down \u2014 shoot up too sharply, investors in the stock market could get jittery and turn tail, leaving chaos in their wake.

{"Headline": "ISIS Used Chemical Arms at Least 52 Times in Syria and Iraq, Report Says", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Islamic State has used chemical weapons, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq since it swept to power in 2014, according to a new independent analysis.More than one-third of those chemical attacks have come in and around Mosul, the Islamic State stronghold in northern Iraq, according to the assessment by the IHS Conflict Monitor, a London-based intelligence collection and analysis service.The IHS conclusions, which are based on local news reports, social media and Islamic State propaganda, mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict. American and Iraqi military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both Mosul and Raqqa, the Islamic State capital in Syria.\u201cThe coalition is concerned about ISIL\u2019s use of chemical weapons,\u201d Col. John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Iraq, said in an email on Monday, using another name for the Islamic State. \u201cISIL has used them in Iraq and Syria in the past, and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons.\u201dColonel Dorrian said that the Islamic State\u2019s ability to use chemical weapons is \u201crudimentary,\u201d and that American, Iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks \u2014 typically rockets, mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents. The effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land.The IHS assessment is to be made public on Tuesday. The New York Times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks. The analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack.In an effort to blunt the Islamic State\u2019s ability to make the weapons, the American-led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured. In September, for instance, allied warplanes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern Iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility.As Iraqi forces now advance into Mosul, analysts warned that the Islamic State could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control. Iraqi forces have reclaimed about one-third of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city.\u201cAs the Islamic State loses ground around Mosul, there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralize advancing enemy forces.\u201d said Columb Strack, a senior analyst and the head of the IHS Conflict Monitor. \u201cAnd to potentially make an example of \u2014 and take revenge on \u2014 civilian dissidents within the city.\u201dAt least 19 of the 52 chemical attacks have taken place in and around Mosul, according to the IHS data, but the assessment noted a decline in attacks before the Iraqi-led offensive against the city.\u201cMosul was at the center of the Islamic State\u2019s chemical weapons production,\u201d Mr. Strack said. \u201cBut most of the equipment and experts were probably evacuated to Syria in the weeks and months leading up to the Mosul offensive, along with convoys of other senior members and their families.\u201dThe Islamic State is not the only actor in Syria to carry out chemical weapons\u2019 strikes: The Syrian government has conducted many more such attacks.Beginning last year, American officials confirmed the first instances of the Islamic State using sulfur mustard, a chemical warfare agent, and the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in attacks by the group in Syria and Iraq. Laboratory tests, which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims, showed the presence of a partly degraded form of distilled sulfur mustard, an internationally banned substance that burns a victim\u2019s skin, breathing passages and eyes.Chemical warfare agents, broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention, are indiscriminate. They are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment, which many of the Islamic State\u2019s foes in Iraq and Syria lack. The chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons, even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets, shrapnel or explosives.It was unclear how the Islamic State had obtained sulfur mustard, a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application. Both the former Hussein government in Iraq and the current government in Syria at one point possessed chemical warfare programs.Chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from Sunni militant groups in Iraq for about a decade. But it is not known how the Islamic State would have obtained sulfur mustard, the officials said.Abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by Iraq during its war against Iran in the 1980s were used in roadside bombs against American forces during the occupation that followed the 2003 American invasion of Iraq. But American officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former Iraqi inventory.The attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery systems, suggesting that the Islamic State had access to, and was experimenting with, different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals.One theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent themselves, American officials say. Another theory is that the Islamic State acquired sulfur mustard from undeclared stocks in Syria, either through capture or by purchasing it from corrupt officials, although this theory is not widely held by American analysts.C.

{"Headline": "For Hedge Fund Investors, Calm Uncertainty Over Trump\u2019s Direction", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byWilbur Ross, the contrarian billionaire investor, stood in a sea of red caps early Wednesday morning at the New York Hilton Midtown hotel in Manhattan as Donald J. Trump took the stage.Mr. Ross, who played a role in raising money from Wall Street executives for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, was celebrating the New York billionaire\u2019s surprising election victory over Hillary Clinton.\u201cI got home in the wee hours of the morning,\u201d Mr. Ross, 78, said.But there was not much time for sleep as Mr. Ross, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, was busy juggling interviews with various news outlets later that morning to discuss the president-elect\u2019s legislative plans for the early days of the new administration.Carl C. Icahn, another Wall Street titan and Trump supporter, chose to leave the same party early. Mr. Icahn, 80, told Bloomberg News he went home to set up around $1 billion in stock trades as market futures indicated a sharp sell-off would happen when the markets opened. Last year, Mr. Trump named Mr. Icahn a possible candidate for Treasury secretary, but the billionaire investor has said he is not interested.Across Wall Street, Mr. Trump\u2019s victory took many by surprise. Despite being a local businessman, he was not a Wall Street favorite, raising far less money from bankers and hedge fund managers than did Mrs. Clinton, a former senator from New York and secretary of state under President Obama.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial index plunged as much as 800 points overnight as it became more apparent that Mr. Trump would win. Earlier on Election Day, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, put out an investor note that said the Dow Jones index could plunge as much as 2,000 points if Mr. Trump were elected.But predictions of rattled equity markets proved short-lived. Stocks traded modestly higher in the United States on Wednesday.Still, there is a high degree of uncertainty on Wall Street about what Mr. Trump will do as president and whom he will appoint in his administration \u2014 especially in top Treasury jobs and other financial regulatory posts.Mr. Ross, who could be hoping for a job in a Trump administration, said he expected a tax overhaul to be high on the agenda, given that it was a priority of the Republican-controlled Congress as well.\u201cThe tax one will go very smoothly,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt is important he get some things accomplished very quickly.\u201dEven in the big-bet world of hedge funds, few investors were willing to wager on an outcome in a presidential election. With Britain\u2019s surprise vote in June to exit the European Union still fresh in many minds, managers sold off some of their riskier positions and sat tight. Until Monday, American stock markets had fallen for nine consecutive days, and Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge \u2014 the Vix \u2014 blew out, in an ominous sign to traders.But market reaction on Wednesday after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was decidedly calmer. \u201cThis ain\u2019t Brexit,\u201d Ben Hunt of Salient Partners said, adding that the markets were already reacting positively to the news overnight. \u201cThere is a positive narrative around Trump taking place. You\u2019re not even seeing that initial fear stage that you had with Brexit.\u201dJason Ader, another Wall Street investor who usually votes Republican, said he would have preferred \u201cmore gridlock\u201d \u2014 as opposed to Republicans controlling both houses on Capitol Hill. He opted to stay at home and watch the election returns with his young children and called the result surprising.It is the uncertainty that Mr. Trump\u2019s election will mean for markets that worried Sahm Adrangi, a hedge fund manager from Canada.\u201cHe\u2019s never really been a specific sort of guy, so I just don\u2019t really know,\u201d Mr. Adrangi said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unclear.\u201dBut, he added, Mr. Trump did not win votes because of any specific policy position. \u201cHe got voted in on his personality,\u201d Mr. Adrangi said.Even some Democrats on Wall Street could find a silver lining in the long election campaign coming to an end.James S. Chanos, the well-known investor who makes bearish bets on stocks, once again hosted a party for guests to watch election returns at his Upper East Side home. Mr. Chanos, who was a big supporter of Mr. Obama, largely stood on the sidelines in this year\u2019s presidential campaign, but he did support candidates running for other offices.Speaking a day after the election, Mr. Chanos quipped: \u201cWell, the good news is \u2014 thinking about all the money I won\u2019t be spending on political contributions going forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Election Means for the Markets", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceWhat will happen to financial markets after the election? More so than usual, we have a decent idea.Market swings over the course of the election suggest that people and institutions with money on the line view a world with Mrs. Clinton as president offering a less volatile economic and financial environment than one with Donald J. Trump in charge.It\u2019s a risky game to try to tie swings in financial markets to political news. Markets often rise and fall for reasons that have nothing to do with the day\u2019s biggest headlines. And if Monday\u2019s rally were a one-time occurrence, it would be safer to attribute it to random chance than to the market\u2019s collective judgment of the future under the two potential presidents.But in this election cycle, there has been a clear pattern in which the odds shifted in the race and different financial indicators moved in a consistent direction. Good news for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has coincided with higher stock prices, a rally in the Mexican peso and a decline in expected stock market volatility. Good news for Mr. Trump has coincided with the reverse swings. (The impact on the value of the dollar and Treasury bonds has been more ambiguous.)That movement was evident when audio emerged of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women and Mrs. Clinton had strong debate performances. It went in the opposite direction when Mr. Comey indicated on Oct. 28 that investigators were examining newly obtained emails tied to Mrs. Clinton.Stock market analysts agree on the direction of the likely movements in the event of a Trump win, if not their magnitude. In a research note Monday, Evercore I.S.I. interpreted the evidence as signaling that a Trump win would create a drop of 5 to 6 percent in stocks, with a 2 percent gain if Mrs. Clinton wins. Citigroup analysts see a drop of 3 to 5 percent.\u201cA Democratic sweep could cause investors and corporate leaders to worry about higher taxes and regulation,\u201d wrote Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cA Trump win could have an even greater impact due to uncertainty about how campaign promises translate into policies,\u201d particularly around the risk of trade wars.Even if estimates like those correctly predict the near-term market reaction to the election, their ability to correctly judge the long-term consequences of a political shift for the economy and the business environment isn\u2019t particularly good. Complex feedback loops among political decisions, public policy and the economy aren\u2019t always evident in the immediate aftermath of elections or referendums.The June 23 vote by British voters to leave the European Union is a prime example. In the days just after the vote, the British stock market fell sharply, as did the country\u2019s currency. In the weeks that followed, the stock market largely rebounded, as there was no evident damage to British companies\u2019 profitability and the cheaper pound made shares of those companies a bargain. British stocks are now higher than they were the day of the vote, as measured by the FTSE 100 index. The pound has fallen further.Similarly, a Trump win would set in motion shifts that market analysts can only guess at. Even if the stock market dropped as analysts are forecasting, that might make the Federal Reserve less likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting, and low rates tend to strengthen asset prices.And investors would surely start to game out which companies stood to gain the most from Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of a lower corporate income tax rate and lighter regulation \u2014 and which could suffer from less availability of immigrant labor.Fundamentally, the tone from economic and market analysts is that they don\u2019t know exactly how Mr. Trump would govern. Nor do they know the composition of the new Congress and how it would deal with a Clinton or Trump administration.\u201cThe impact of an initial Trump shock to financial conditions would depend on whether the shock was persistent or not, which in turn is likely to depend importantly on which Trump shows up,\u201d wrote Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI, casting a President Trump as either \u201cthe angry populist of the campaign trail or the hard-nosed but ultimately pragmatic New York deal-maker.\u201d (Mr. Guha views a pragmatic Trump as the more probable outcome.)A victory by Mrs. Clinton would most likely signal continuity with President Obama\u2019s policies and fewer radical shifts. But there, too, the details would ultimately shape the fate of markets, and some of those are unknowable, like whether she would find willing partners to enact pieces of her agenda or would face steadfast resistance from Congress.In other words, think of the market reaction on Wednesday as a response to one mystery being solved (who won) while another one is created (how that person will lead).Advertisement"}

For many entrepreneurs, that means diversifying their personal and professional portfolios to address new exposure from their expansion abroad. Wade Balliet, chief investment advisor at Bank of the West Wealth Management (BNP Paribas Group), says that limiting exposure in your personal portfolio often means investing outside the country to which you're moving. For example, if you move your business to Paris, you might think about putting more of your money outside of Europe in order to achieve greater global diversification. \"In that case, we [make sure] their European exposure is not increasing, but maybe reducing to some extent because of their new business venture, and then managing around that with the other international capabilities: Asia, Japan and the emerging markets, for example.\"We have the ability to tactically overweight and underweight investment exposure to a country or a set of countries.\"Scaling your business and portfolio globally gets complicated. That's why keeping a singular view of all aspects of your finances is essential.\"The key is, somebody has to see the global view of the portfolio,\" says Balliet. \"Two or three managers looking independently may be well and good on their own, but what about the overall risk of those three managers when melded together?\"For an entrepreneur, a bank with a global presence can help solve many of these problems. Companies frequently contract with more partners than they need to, according to Thurston.\"To meet specific in-country needs, many multinational companies will approach a number of different banks. However, this can result in cumbersome banking arrangements and inconsistent handling of the clients' needs,\" he says. \"Instead of having six different banks to handle needs in six different countries, the client's needs could be met more effectively with a single international network, such as BNP Paribas Wealth Management, where we strive to deliver the international network locally as a single client relationship.

Trump\u2019s election victory was overwhelmingly positive. But that doesn\u2019t mean a Trump presidency will be good for the economy.Stock markets often serve as an economic scoreboard: Increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory. But these inferences are too facile, because some increases connote good news, while others do not.Reading market movements \u2014 such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early postelection days, as well as the subsequent ups and downs \u2014 requires a Rosetta stone. Constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy.Buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits. The share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be.That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and stock markets, when they work, excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the market\u2019s overall prediction. If traders feel stock prices are low relative to future profits, they will bid up prices; if they feel prices are high, they will sell and drive down prices. In this way, the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market.An increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits. The movement in stock prices has a direct effect: Shareholders are immediately wealthier. Anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the all-too-familiar feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire. This does not benefit all people in the economy \u2014 some shares are held by citizens of other countries, and the shares held in this country are not equitably held \u2014 but at the least, a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry.But rising stock prices can spell good news for other reasons: Even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future. This is because when companies prosper, consumers frequently also do well. This notion can be somewhat counterintuitive. After all, we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more money, they do so at our expense, that is, by overcharging us.In a well-functioning market, though, the interests of companies and consumers are aligned. Businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their products: Higher profits mean happier customers. The economy as a whole is doing well.By way of example, suppose Apple unveils a new iPhone that buoys its stock price. Traders are bullish about the iPhone\u2019s robust sales. They are focused on the fact that these sales add to Apple\u2019s coffers. But each sale, assuming consumers are choosing wisely, is also presumably producing joy for consumers.This example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy. Sometimes companies can profit without improving consumers\u2019 lives, or possibly even by worsening them.For example, part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a Trump administration would slash regulations. That may be good for some companies\u2019 bottom lines, but is that good for everyone else? It depends. Do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for consumers? Or do they also hinder products that are bad for consumers?Take the case of Wells Fargo, which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in customers\u2019 names without their knowledge. These accounts were profitable for Wells Fargo, but surely not good for consumers.The extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory watchdog: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Trump\u2019s election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed. But if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like Wells Fargo\u2019s can flourish, that\u2019s hardly cause for celebration. And it\u2019s not good news for the economy.In short, whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for nonshareholders depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at consumers\u2019 expense.There is a final factor to consider: The capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited.In 1997, Michael Rashes, then a doctoral student in economics at Harvard and now a principal at Bracebridge Capital, noticed something funny about stock prices. On Oct. 1, WorldCom made a bid for MCI Communications. Shares listed under the symbol MCI went up that day. In itself, that wasn\u2019t surprising: Good news raises prices.The problem, as Mr. Rashes noted, was that the ticker symbol MCI belonged to Massmutual Corporate Investors. This fund had nothing to do with MCI Communications, which traded under the ticker symbol MCIC. His paper was published in The Journal of Finance in 2001, under the title \u201cMassively Confused Investors Making Conspicuously Ignorant Choices (MCI-MCIC)\u201d.This was not a freak event: Traders are highly fallible. On Oct. 4, 2013, for example, after Twitter announced its initial public offering, the stock price of the Boston-based consumer electronics chain Tweeter, which had filed for bankruptcy in 2007, rose to 15 cents a share from the previous day\u2019s close of less than 1 cent. Trading was eventually halted.A large body of research now emphasizes a basic fact: Despite the rise of computers and artificial intelligence, markets are, at their root, made up of human traders. Yes, the crowd is often smarter than the individual. But smarter does not mean perfect. Many of the biases of individual traders become broader market biases. In fact, some new biases are introduced when traders feed off one another and compound their mistakes.On election night, the votes at the ballot box mattered. In the financial markets, another kind of vote counting took place. Just as the presidential election tells us only who voters believe is good for the country, the market can tell us only what traders believe is good for a company\u2019s bottom line.It is an all-too-familiar adage that democracy is the weakest form of government, except for all the others. Similarly, stock markets are the weakest way to predict the future, except for all the others.An earlier version of this article misstated the rise in shares listed under the symbol MCI related to investor confusion over a similar stock symbol (MCIC). The shares in MCI rose 2.35 percent on Oct. 1, 1997, not 18.56 percent.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While the agency discovered the extent of the fraudulent accounts at Wells Fargo, it was not the first to uncover the activity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How T. Boone Pickens Sits Tight in the Riskiest of Businesses", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionDALLAS \u2014 \u201cDo you enjoy risk?\u201d I asked T. Boone Pickens Jr.On one level, this was the silliest of questions. Mr. Pickens, after all, is a man who abruptly quit his corporate job at 25, with $1,500 in the bank, to start his own company, which he called Mesa Petroleum. He spent the next four decades poking holes in the ground, searching for oil and natural gas \u2014 without question one of the activities with the highest risk in all of business.In the 1980s, he famously made a series of audacious takeover attempts aimed at companies \u2014 Gulf Oil, Phillips, Unocal \u2014 that were 10, 20, 30 times the size of Mesa. For years he covered his company\u2019s general overhead budget by playing the commodities market.In the 1990s, he bet big, and bet wrong, on the price of natural gas. That, and a lengthy bout with depression, which was undiagnosed for years, caused him to lose his company in 1996 at the age of 67.Rather than retire, Mr. Pickens decided to start a hedge fund to trade commodities, primarily natural gas futures. In the of 1997, he raised $37 million \u2014 $8 million of which was his money. By early 1999, however, the fund had lost more than 90 percent, and was under $3 million.But by the end of 2000, with his depression lifted and his faith in his own judgment restored, the fund was up to $252 million, a gain of more than 9,000 percent. By 2008, he was worth $3 billion, according to Forbes.So yes, it\u2019s pretty obvious that T. Boone Pickens enjoys risk. But as it turns out, that\u2019s not the whole answer.I\u2019ve known Mr. Pickens for more than three decades, ever since I was working for Texas Monthly and wrote about his first takeover attempt in 1982. Over the years, we\u2019ve stayed in touch, and I\u2019ve written about him or quoted him any number of times, including in several of my old \u201cTalking Business\u201d columns for The New York Times.But even though I\u2019ve always known about his adventures as a commodities trader, I realized recently that I had never talked to him about risk \u2014 about how he thinks about it, and why his tolerance for it is so high. And whether ordinary investors can learn something from the way he invests, just as they do when they pay attention to Warren Buffett.Thus it was that on a recent morning in Dallas, I found myself in a large conference room in the offices of Mr. Pickens\u2019s investment firm, BP Capital. One wall was dominated by a large screen \u2014 as big as anything you\u2019d see on Wall Street, blinking instantaneous prices for crude oil, natural gas, some energy-related stocks (BP Capital also now manages an energy stock fund) and a handful of other things Mr. Pickens likes to keep track of. CNBC and Fox News were on but muted.Mr. Pickens\u2019s wealth has dropped to $500 million, in no small part because he had chosen to give much of it away. At 88, his most serious physical problem is his hearing. As he sat down, he pulled out a small amplification device and placed it on the table. Even so, he often had to ask the others in the room \u2014 there were five of us \u2014 to repeat things.Which is not the same as saying he didn\u2019t ultimately understand what was being said. He has always had a voracious appetite for information, and he is the unquestioned decision-maker at BP Capital. His team\u2019s role, in no small part, is to help supply the information he needs to make decisions.All year long, Mr. Pickens\u2019s funds \u2014 there are now a half-dozen, managing around $1 billion \u2014 had been \u201clong\u201d on oil, meaning that they had been betting that the price, which is currently in the mid-$40 range, was going to rise. Less than two years ago, the price of oil was as high as $120 a barrel.As the price dropped, big, expensive exploration projects had been canceled, and the number of wells being drilled had dropped sharply. Pickens\u2019s thesis was that this drop in supply was bound to make demand tight \u2014 which, in turn, would cause the price of oil to rise. He had put on his long position eight months early, and was completely unruffled by the market\u2019s daily ups and downs.Which is one thing that you quickly learn about him as an investor. As he puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re not traders.\u201dIf he has looked at all the available information, studied the fundamentals and believes his thesis is still right, he\u2019ll stick with it even if the price isn\u2019t going in his direction. If he believes strongly enough, he\u2019ll use the drop in price as a buying opportunity. That is one of those attributes that separates great investors \u2014 Mr. Buffett does the same thing \u2014 from the rest of us.And then there is the information itself. I saw Mr. Pickens speak a few months ago in Texas and was thunderstruck at how much information about the current state of the oil and gas industry he had at his fingertips. In the conference room at BP Capital, I got a strong sense of how that information is accumulated and used.They talked about when the weather was supposed to turn cold, which generally pushes natural gas prices higher, and why Exxon Mobil\u2019s stock had been rising lately. They dissected a few of the big exploration projects that had been canceled. One member of the Pickens team put up some charts showing vehicle miles driven against the price of gasoline. \u201cDoes a 10 percent rise in price impact demand?\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, the answer has been no.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re seeing supply coming down,\u201d someone else said. \u201cThat was predictable,\u201d replied Mr. Pickens, \u201cbecause there aren\u2019t any rigs.\u201dAnd then there were the Saudis and the other oil-producing nations. An important part of Pickens\u2019s investing thesis is that OPEC, led by the Saudis, was going to have to lower production to get the price higher. Over and over again, they reviewed the logic: The oil-producing countries needed higher oil prices to fund their societies; they just couldn\u2019t keep letting oil drop. Saudi debt had gone from $40 billion to $280 billion, someone said. \u201cIt\u2019s killing them,\u201d Mr. Pickens said.\u201cWhat we do is check, check, check,\u201d he told me when the meeting had ended. \u201cYou are always checking to see if you have screwed up on your conclusions. The market doesn\u2019t believe the Saudis will cut oil production to get the price up, and I can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t done it so far. We\u2019ll see by the end of the year.\u201dIn the meantime, he had no intention of changing his position.\u201cBoone is an educated risk-taker,\u201d said Michael Ross, who until 2010 was Mr. Pickens\u2019s primary futures trader. \u201cHe takes a position and if it goes against him, he\u2019ll start asking questions. And if he still thinks he\u2019s right, he\u2019ll double up. He bets on himself. When you have conviction, you can withstand risk.\u201dGathering information, holding firm even if the market is going against you, these are things that the rest of us can do if we put our minds to it. But it\u2019s the size of the risk Mr. Pickens takes \u2014 the willingness to bet it all if he thinks he\u2019s right \u2014 that most investors will never be able to do. Risk has been a part of Mr. Pickens\u2019s business life for so long, it barely causes him to blink.Thus came his answer to my original question. \u201cDo you enjoy risk?\u201dHe thought for a minute and then chuckled. \u201cI guess so,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Tony Roth, the chief investment officer at the Wilmington Trust Corporation, has begun to include models for how much a client can lose in the firm\u2019s new investment pitches.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is put a new emphasis on risk, which is what we call \u2018drawdown exposure,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not volatility. It\u2019s, if we have an event, how much could you lose?\u201dHe said many clients had been cautious for several years, when markets performed well and they missed out. Now they want to take on more risk to increase their returns, yet they fear having another loss as in 2008.\u201cClients are saying, \u2018We have goals and we may need to take more risk \u2014 what does that mean to me?\u2019\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cIf you tell me I could lose 25 percent to 50 percent of my portfolio, that means something to me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there,\u201d she added. \u201cBut there are also a lot of things going well \u2014 technology, biopharmaceuticals, people\u2019s quality of life. Even with all these good things happening, that\u2019s not where the conversation is going.\u201dOf course, it is easy to be pessimistic after a year of noisy election campaigns, Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote to leave the European Union, a slowdown in China, saber-rattling and suspected digital snooping by Russia, and the slowing of Brazil\u2019s economic engine by political problems and the Zika virus.\u201cThe hard part is getting past that emotion,\u201d said Judith B. Ward, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price. \u201cClients, when they call us, they just want reassurance to stay the course. One of the things we focus on a lot is to have that long-term perspective to weather some of the storms that we might see.\u201dToday, Mr. Sonnenfeldt is the chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club he founded 18 years ago that has 447 members with an average wealth of $100 million. In that role, he likes to poll his fellow millionaires and billionaires on what concerns them and what actions they take to address those worries.Right now, he said, members are taking money out of the public markets and investing more in private equity deals, which are far less liquid but offer higher returns for people who can afford to be patient. They have minimized their personal debt, gotten out of hedge funds and invested in hard assets, like real estate.\u201cIt\u2019s back to basics on the whole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s less overseas adventures and more back to basics with American businesses that sell real products and services. Real estate is our No. 1 overall allocation.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a general wariness about markets because there are different measures by which you can determine if the market is overpriced,\u201d he added. His group think \u201cthe equity markets are being propped up by people who have few options and who can\u2019t invest in private deals.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeldt\u2019s group is not alone in taking an approach that weighs the downside as much as, if not more than, the upside.Mr. Roth sees that a lot. But it has left him torn on using \u201cdrawdown exposure\u201d as a rating.On the one hand, it is a useful tool for clients, he said. But on the other he worries that he is playing into an echo chamber of woe.\u201cI want to make sure it\u2019s valuable and not just pandering to the fears of our clients,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure that the metrics that we\u2019re using back-test really well.\u201dAnd he is clear in saying that he is not discarding modern portfolio theory and all of the analytical tools the investment profession has to estimate potential rewardds. He is simply trying to add something that might make sense in the current age of anxiety.\u201cWe\u2019re running a parallel risk framework to add to the traditional risk framework,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a better understanding for clients.\u201dMs. Patterson said one of her aims was to put what is happening today into a context of the last several years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that suddenly occurred in 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sense that one is losing control has been an undercurrent for some time.\u201dIt is the long view, of course, that advisers advocate. Whatever may happen between now and Inauguration Day or even later in 2017 is a blip \u2014 however painful \u2014 on people\u2019s long-term investment plans.The risk is that so much negative news from so many places in the world has a self-sustaining effect. The doom, real or perceived, resonates more loudly than rational calls for making a plan and sticking to it.Individual investors \u201care \u00fcbercareful,\u201d said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, an asset management firm. \u201cThat\u2019s risky. You have to take some risk, or you don\u2019t meet your goals.\u201dThat much fear can be paralyzing. To break that, Mr. Perkin said, he suggested that people do something simple: dollar-cost averaging, which means buying a certain amount of an investment in pieces in case its value goes down.Of course, that investment\u2019s value can also go up and an investor would have been better off putting all the money in at once. But when fear is such a large force, this simple strategy is a way to \u201cremove the regret factor,\u201d he said.Taken a different way, Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm, applies a hyperrational view to the present: Even if it is bad now, it will not be bad forever.\u201cPeople have completely lost sight of what is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re 30 years old, you\u2019re not retiring for another 35 years or more. Time is on your side. People rarely understand the value of time.\u201d\u201cPeople are always scared that there is going to be a bear market, but they don\u2019t think of what causes one,\u201d he said. \u201cIs the central bank removing liquidity? Are earnings going into bearish territory? Is everyone bullish? We don\u2019t have any of those things.\u201dFor Mr. Sonnenfeldt, doing nothing is the worst response. People have to make investment decisions, as he has been doing with clean energy.\u201cThe biggest shift is that in a low-interest-rate environment, investing in passive assets is fraught with peril,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do a 60-40 split and produce much income. And there is no safety in safety, because people have bid up the prices in the so-called safe assets.\u201dThe solution from Tiger members? Invest in businesses that make things people will buy no matter what happens. It\u2019s simple \u2014 if you can get past your fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Stock Rally: Calamity Averted With a Little Charm", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe stock market is easily rattled, but it can also be easily seduced.President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s long-term relationship with Wall Street is just getting started, but he has already demonstrated that he can not only shake up but also mollify the market. It soared to a record on Thursday, as Mr. Trump was preparing to meet with President Obama in the White House.Consider that through Election Day, the stock market heavily favored Hillary Clinton for president and that as recently as Monday, the market rose sharply on news that the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had found nothing in the latest batch of Clinton emails to warrant prosecution. The market\u2019s pro-Clinton bias was glaring on Tuesday night, as evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s strong performance trickled in and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chances dimmed.Shocked by the prospect of a Trump presidency, traders sold off Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index futures contracts as fast as they could, and the market cratered. Within just four hours, by 12:08 a.m., those futures contracts plummeted almost 6 percent \u2014 a disorderly rout that seemed to predict a calamitous day on Wall Street.Then Mr. Trump proceeded to charm the market, which remained in his thrall through Friday.Prices rose as Mr. Trump read smoothly from a teleprompter, uttering familiar bromides. When he is president, economic growth will double, he proclaimed. America\u2019s interests will come first, but other countries will be treated fairly.Then came one of the central points of his still nascent economic program, one that came naturally to a businessman who grew up in the New York City construction industry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201c And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201dWords like these have been more than enough to buoy the American stock market. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose to record territory and climbed further on Friday. But the Trump rally started earlier, in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. By the time that trading day ended in New York, the futures market had risen nearly 7 percent, an extraordinary ride.There are plausible explanations for this performance. One is that strategists set the bar so low for Mr. Trump that the mere appearance of normality has been enough to keep the bears at bay. Until Mr. Trump\u2019s actions and intentions are clearer, many strategists have simply decided to wait and see.\u201cI\u2019ve found that making an immediate response to news invariably leads to a bad decision,\u201d said Laszlo Birinyi, an veteran independent market strategist, who was cautiously bullish on stocks before the election, and remains so. \u201cI haven\u2019t made any changes so far.\u201dThere are more emphatic reasons for the market\u2019s complaisance. Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for Northern Trust, said he viewed the election results mainly as \u201ca Republican sweep of the White House and Congress\u201d rather than a Trump victory.\u201cOur view is that we will have unified government for the first time in six years,\u201d he said, and with less gridlock in Washington, \u201cthat means that we will have some pro-growth policies being implemented.\u201d Less financial regulation and less health care regulation and perhaps an end to Obamacare are the \u201cplump targets out there,\u201d he said, adding that he expected to see tax cuts.In a similar vein, a survey of 114 global fund managers on Wednesday by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research found that most of these professional investors thought Mr. Trump would probably soon reach an agreement to repatriate some of the American corporate money stashed overseas and increase spending on those infrastructure projects. Most said they didn\u2019t expect to reduce risk in their portfolios by raising cash. The single most attractive option for the group was to invest in the S.&P. 500.Mr. McDonald said he expected that new programs and tax cuts would effectively be a fiscal stimulus that should increase the gross domestic product by about half a percentage point, making American stocks more appealing. Bonds, by contrast, are likely to be hurt by an increase in inflation, he said. Bond yields have already risen, and prices, which move in the opposite direction, have fallen.There is also some historical backing for a bullish view on the election\u2019s stock market impact. Since 1901, stocks have flourished when one party has controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, data from the Bespoke Investment Group indicates. When Republicans have ruled, the Dow has gained 8 percent a year, on average, compared with 6.2 percent for all political configurations. (When Democrats have held the White House and Congress, stocks have gained 7.9 percent a year.)Yet the Trump rally has already spawned concern that things have gone too far. \u201cThese gyrations and inconsistent behavior attest to a manic market on medication,\u201d said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, in a note to clients.Even if the market\u2019s infatuation with Mr. Trump lingers, to predict rosy days ahead, you have to make a number of assumptions, and some of them may be a stretch. Make your own list.Here are a few suggestions, just to get started: Mr. Trump will always be a calm and soothing presence and will not lead the country into major crises; he will smoothly conclude legislative deals with conservative congressional Republicans for whom policies like deficit spending are anathema; his avowed \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies will not severely damage emerging market nations or start debilitating trade wars or otherwise destabilize the global economy; he will appoint effective Federal Reserve Board members; and his plans to deregulate industry and dismantle the Obama legacy will benefit the economy and the markets.That and more could all happen, but these are early days. We will simply have to watch the Trump presidency unfold.Advertisement"}

Trump promoted during his campaign are raising questions even before he has taken office.Mr. Trump\u2019s companies, however, do business with entities controlled by foreign governments and people with ties to them.It would be tough to challenge him in court. The way to address violations of the clause would be through impeachment, not a lawsuit, according to Richard W. Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Alternately, Congress could pass a resolution directed at the president-elect before going that far.The meeting has raised questions about how far Mr. Trump would be willing to use the power of the presidency to advance his business interests.Reports of Mr. Trump mixing business with his official duties as president-elect have prompted ethics experts to say that his actions threatened to compromise the integrity of the office.Norman Eisen, who served as the \u201cethics czar\u201d in the White House under President Obama, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s discussions of wind farms was \u201can extraordinary transgression of the core idea of public service.\u201dAmid all the uncertainty, at least one question received a solid answer this week.Trump Foundation money has been used to settle lawsuits arising from Mr. Trump\u2019s business and personal activities before.\"We demanded written assurance that the Trump University settlement would not be paid for by any charitable entity,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general.Being made partner at a big law firm used to be seen as a brass ring of prestige, wealth and security.There is more supply than demand for legal services so some big law firms are demoting partners \u2014 taking away their share in annual profits.Some are setting retirement dates or reducing them to salaried status and cutting them out of the yearly profit distribution.According to James D. Cotterman, a principal at Altman Weil, a legal consulting firm, \u201cwith law firms having to add 5 percent to 15 percent in new business each year just to stay even\u201d all law firms are going to have to slim down \u201cin some form.\u201d\u201cI came in with pretty low expectations, but the vending machine is pretty cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Howard Ruff, Quirky Conservative Economist and Author, Dies at 85", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byHoward Ruff, an idiosyncratic economist, best-selling author and political conservative best known for being bullish on gold and silver and gloomy about the economy, died on Nov. 12 in Lehi, Utah. He was 85.The cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, his assistant, Joann Allen, said.Mr. Ruff, a college dropout, had a roller-coaster career, starting out as a stockbroker. For a time he also supported himself as a singer. (One gig was at a synagogue, as what he described as the only practicing Mormon cantor in San Francisco.)Rather than defeating him, however, the setback led to an epiphany, he said: It inspired him to plunge into business-cycle research and forge a career as a faddish investment adviser, which made him a millionaire for a second time. But that enterprise, too, went belly up.\u201cSome people say that I couldn\u2019t succeed at anything, so I became a prophet of doom,\u201d he told Time magazine in 1979.That turned out to be another successful calling. In 1975 he started publishing a newsletter called Ruff Times, which mixed financial counsel (predicting inflation and recommending investment in gold) with conservative commentary. It drew more than 175,000 subscribers.He began a syndicated weekly television program called \u201cRuff House\u201d; organized forums that offered, for a fee, more or less conventional investment advice; and established companies that distributed natural vitamins and coins, as well as other for-profit and self-promotional ventures.Again he prospered, as reflected by a 20,000-square-foot home in Utah with an indoor pool.Mr. Ruff drew his widest attention in 1979 with his book \u201cHow to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years.\u201d It recommended survivalist strategies, like stocking a year\u2019s supply of food, and directed readers to other books including \u201cSafe Places East of the Mississippi\u201d and \u201cEating Weeds for Fun and Freedom.\u201d The book sold millions of copies and was a New York Times best seller for more than a year.Until about 1981, his followers reaped large capital gains by investing in precious metals. But by several measures his portfolios later underperformed market indexes and even Treasury bills, and some of his apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass, as inflation subsided and interest rates declined during the Reagan administration, and when the economy rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cHoward was a pioneer in the financial world when brokers encouraged investors to buy blue-chip stocks and bonds and charged high fixed commissions,\u201d Mark Skousen, the editor of Forecasts & Strategies, an investment newsletter, said in an email on Tuesday. \u201cRuff argued that Wall Street was hazardous to your wealth, especially investing in bonds that were big losers during the inflationary \u201970s.\u201dMr. Ruff became bullish on the bond and stock markets in the early 1980s, changing the name of his newsletter to Howard Ruff\u2019s Financial Success Report. But it reverted to Ruff Times in the mid-80s, and in 2008 he updated his book on the coming bad years, warning that whoever won the presidency in 2008 would be doomed by rising oil and gas prices and spiraling monetary inflation to become \u201cthe Hoover of the 2000s.\u201dAmong his other books were \u201cFamine and Survival in America\u201d (1974) and \u201cHow to Prosper in the Age of Obamanomics: A Ruff Plan for Hard Times Ahead\u201d (2009).Unlike some of his doomsaying colleagues, though, Mr. Ruff maintained a following through an engaging wit and a general willingness to admit mistakes.Urging investors to be mavericks, he compared the breed to \u201ca bovine that\u2019s left the herd,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd I feel the majority of the herd is going to be turned into hamburger.\u201dIn recommending readiness for economic collapse, he reminded his disciples, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t raining when Noah built the ark.\u201dHe co-founded a conservative lobbying group called Free the Eagle, and in 2000 he fought, unsuccessfully, to prevent Hillary Clinton, who had transplanted herself from Arkansas and Washington, from winning a Senate seat from New York.His Ruffpac political action committee prepared a television commercial that benignly featured babies and puppies playing in Central Park. It asked rhetorically what they had in common, responding: \u201cThey have all lived in New York longer than Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201dHoward Joseph Ruff was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Berkeley, Calif., the son of the former Rena Maxberry, a seamstress, and Wilson Ruff, who killed himself when Howard was 6 months old.\u201cI grew up broke,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe were too poor to afford a father.\u201dHe had wanted to be a singer since the age of 9, but, at his mother\u2019s insistence, instead of accepting a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he served a two-year mission in the eastern United States for the Mormon Church. He later majored in music education at Brigham Young University in Utah with a minor in economics.But by his senior year, he told The New York Times in 1979, \u201cI ran out of money and got out of college before it did me any personal harm, like ending up teaching high school music courses.\u201dInstead, after joining the Air Force, he toured with its symphony as a baritone soloist and also performed with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.Mr. Ruff released an album, \u201cHoward Ruff Sings,\u201d in 1982 on his own label, Target Records, featuring songs like \u201cI Walked Today Where Jesus Walked,\u201d \u201cIf I Were a Rich Man,\u201d \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d and \u201cMy Way.\u201d\u201cI did it for the shock value,\u201d Mr. Ruff said. \u201cI also did it to change my image. I have always been painted as a cardboard figure of doom.\u201dMr. Ruff is survived by his wife, the former Kay Felt; 13 of their 14 children (some of whom were adopted) \u2014 Larry, Eric, David, Megan and Timothy Ruff, Anthony Ramon, David Steinberg, Pamela Patterson, Sharon Slater, Patty Simpson, Liza Spencer, Debbie Rasmussen and Terri Lynn Bond \u2014 79 grandchildren; and 48 great-grandchildren.By 2002, Mr. Ruff\u2019s fortunes had slipped again. The circulation of Ruff Times had plummeted to 3,000, according to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance, and he had long sold his 10-acre Utah estate and moved to smaller quarters.\u201cHe was a self-made millionaire. Twice. He lost it all. Twice,\u201d his family said in a statement. \u201cHe often said he learned more from his failures than from his successes.\u201dBut he retained admirers. The journalist and financial analyst Mark Hulbert wrote on MarketWatch.com in 2013, \u201cIt would be easy to miss the lasting contribution Howard Ruff made to the investment advisory business.\u2019\u2019Mr. Ruff, he wrote, had brought \u201cinto the mainstream the notion that we don\u2019t need to rely on a Wall Street broker or analyst for advice on what to do with our money.\u201dHe added, \u201cRuff gave voice to the millions of middle-class investors who felt that the country\u2019s financial system was rigged against them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not Just the White House. Change Is in the Air on Wall St., Too", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe markets are always fickle, but since the presidential election, the tastes of traders in stocks, bonds and commodities have conspicuously changed.In the first hours of Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, stock futures plunged, only to reverse themselves and surge upward. Bonds at first strengthened and then fell sharply in price as yields leapt higher. Specific sectors reversed themselves, too. Financial stocks, which were earthbound, began levitating. Utility stocks, which were in high demand, fell out of favor.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen changes like these in ages,\u201d said Dave Mazza, head of exchange traded funds and mutual fund research for State Street Global Advisors.The question now is whether the markets\u2019 preferences will change abruptly again.Some rollback toward pre-Trump market preferences can be expected, of course. \u201cSome of what we saw initially was just animal spirits and momentum,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management. \u201cThe market often overreacts and then corrects itself, and that has been happening.\u201dYet it is possible that the election could be remembered as a pivotal moment in the markets, and in politics \u2014 and not just because a new Republican-controlled government is likely to enact some very different policies. It is at least arguable that the election has given the markets the impetus, and the excuse, to solidify deeper trends that were already underway.\u201cThe election shock has accelerated some changes that were already beginning to be evident \u2014 in a much smaller way,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cI think that some of those trends are likely to stick.\u201dThere is no denying that the election\u2019s outcome took the markets by surprise. The overwhelming assumption in financial circles, and in the polls, was that Hillary Clinton would win and that Mr. Trump would lose. The further expectation was that in the unlikely event of a Trump victory, there would be a major stock market decline. But that occurred for only several hours, and then there was a powerful stock market rally, which has slowed but not stopped.That\u2019s only part of the story. A revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place. Recent stars have faded, in the market\u2019s transitory judgment. New investments are in vogue.Traders have been voting with their dollars. Using State Street sector exchange-traded funds as a proxy for the broader market, Mr. Mazza reported unusually high inflows into the sector E.T.F.s for financial services, health care and industrials, and lesser inflows into materials and energy stocks. Traders stampeded away from utilities, technology and consumer staples shares. They were neutral or slightly negative about consumer discretionary and real estate shares.Take financial stocks and utilities. Until recently, investors shunned banks while celebrating utilities for their steady-Eddie dividend payouts.That shifted radically. In the five days after the election, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America gained at least 13 percent. Four leading utilities \u2014 Exelon, FirstEnergy, NextEra Energy and Entergy \u2014 lost at least 4 percent. Before the election, utility shares were ahead of financials for the year. Five days later, they were trailing.The nearly $5 billion inflow into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, for example, was the biggest of any week since the E.T.F.\u2019s inception in 1998, Mr. Mazza said. Such cash flows generally correlate with market price trends. The biggest weekly outflow was $3.5 billion, and it occurred in the week of Jan. 28, 2008, during the financial crisis. Investors found bank stocks as scary as they now find them attractive.Utilities, on the other hand, moved on election week to the avoidance list, with net outflows of $455 million in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, Mr. Mazza said.While traders may have shifted gears hastily, there is at least a rational basis for their movements.The problem lies in the assumptions behind these market shifts. Predictions about politics are risky. Those based on underlying economics may be a bit more reliable.For example, the bond market shift appears at least partly based on a judgment that inflation will rise because of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, inchoate though they may be. He has called for tax cuts and spending increases in the nation\u2019s infrastructure and military. That could be inflationary if they widen a budget deficit. But conservatives in Congress may not go along with an increase in deficit spending. It\u2019s not clear what the Trump administration will try to accomplish. All of these assumptions may not be borne out in fact.Similarly, technology shares have fallen sharply, at least partly out of concern for the possibly negative effects of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, said Larry Puglia, a portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price. It is possible, he said, that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to immigration will make it more difficult for highly skilled foreigners to receive visas for work at American tech companies, or that his trade policies will make the logistics of global tech manufacturing more cumbersome and expensive.People \u201cshouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions,\u201d Mr. Puglia said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d He said he had made few changes to his investment portfolios, preferring to wait and see.On the other hand, some sea changes may be underway in the economy, Mr. Paulsen said. The election could be giving traders an excuse to act on them. Recent data indicates that economic growth has been accelerating. The election aside, he said, it makes sense that bond yields will rise under these circumstances and that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term interest rates. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, says a rate increase is \u201crelatively likely\u201d to occur soon, perhaps at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in December.Rising interest rates generally help bank stocks and hurt utilities, whose dividends no longer seem as appealing. Furthermore, rising rates support a stronger dollar, justifying a decline in the price of gold, which has been out of favor since the election.In addition, the labor market has been improving for a long time, the American economy is in better shape than it was a year or two ago, and it\u2019s reasonable for investors to be more aggressive, Mr. Paulsen said.Still, the risk of geopolitical or domestic shocks is real, he acknowledged, and traders are only making educated guesses. If they turn out to be wrong, the market could turn upside down again.For most long-term investors, that is an argument for broad diversification. Despite the turmoil in the markets, simple balanced portfolios of stocks and bonds have barely moved since the election. In a period of extreme swerves and shifts, that may count as an achievement.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Bonuses Are Expected to Sink for 3rd Straight Year", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byWall Street bonuses are expected to decline for the third consecutive year, reflecting a period of busted mergers, limited trading activity and muted hedge fund returns.While mergers and acquisitions have been active (and even hit record levels in 2015), the bankers who advise on the deals get paid largely when the deals are completed. This year, antitrust officials thwarted a number of large mergers, including Halliburton\u2019s $35 billion bid for Baker Hughes, as well as the consolidations of the health insurance companies Anthem and Cigna, and Aetna and Humana.In addition, choppy markets damped stock trading activity and prevented skittish companies from making their debuts as public companies, except for a few prominent offerings. Investors dumped hedge fund holdings because of poor returns and high fees.Alan Johnson, the founder of Johnson Associates, describes this pattern as a \u201cmalaise,\u201d and one that is unlikely to reverse itself anytime soon.\u201cI don\u2019t see it changing for the next year or two, either,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe pressures in the industry on profit and fees are going to continue, and I think pay will likely continue to decline in 2017.\u201dEven more than in past years, competitors and clients pressured banks to reduce fees, as there was more disclosure around what companies can and do charge clients, Mr. Johnson said.In March, the state comptroller\u2019s office said that the average bonus for securities industry employees in the New York City area in 2015 was $146,200, while the average salary was $388,000. Both figures declined from 2014, but the compensation was still far higher than in any other industry in the area.According to the Johnson Associates report, some of the deepest cuts in bonuses this year will be among investment banking underwriting, hedge fund and equities professionals.Equity underwriting bonuses could be more than 20 percent lower compared with 2015.Within sales and trading, Johnson Associates said that there were lower levels of client activity, especially in equities, meaning bonuses could be from 5 percent to 15 percent lower than last year.Johnson Associates expects merger advisory bonuses to be about 10 percent lower.Nevertheless, there are more deals in the wings. Research by PitchBook found that through the third quarter of 2016, there was a record number of transactions valued at $10 billion or more. During the first nine months of the year, 31 such deals were signed, compared with 23 in all of 2015 and 16 in 2014. If this year\u2019s deals have better luck with regulators, banks could enjoy a payout later this year or next.Private equity bonuses will be little changed this year, according to the report, as firms were able to increase their assets under management but experienced \u201cmediocre returns.\u201dRetail and consumer banking was not quite as bleak. There, bonuses could actually gain as much as 5 percent over the previous year. That area of finance has benefited from deposit and loan growth as the economy recovers.Johnson Associates has been publishing its report annually for about 15 years. The consultants pore through public filings and interview from 30 to 50 clients to produce the results.Some of the challenges facing banks could soon reverse if interest rates go up meaningfully. With near-zero rates for almost a decade, banks have been able to lend money inexpensively but with lower returns than they received historically. If that dynamic reverses, it could be a boon to the industry, as long as the broader economy remains intact.\u201cIt could be water on the fields for many of these businesses in isolation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cNow the caveat is, what happens to the economy when rates go up?\u201dEconomic challenges are the reason European bank employees are worse off than American ones. And Britain\u2019s vote over the summer to leave the European Union, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d did not help European bank employees\u2019 situation, Mr. Johnson said.A portion of a banker\u2019s total compensation is based on how well his or her company has been doing in the stock market. The stock prices of some European banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, have declined about 50 percent each over the last year as they have grappled with government fines, increasing competition and greater regulation.Executives at those banks and others are talking about how to refocus their businesses to become more profitable.In New York, profit was not an issue. The securities industry generated $9.3 billion in profit during the first half of 2016, the comptroller\u2019s report showed, on track to surpass the $14.3 billion made in all of last year.But with thousands of job cuts and lower compensation for those in securities, it has become clear that the focus of those profits is primarily preservation, rather than making bankers wealthier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Make Bullish Bet on Trump, and an Era of Tax Cuts and Spending", "Date": "2016-11-21", "News": "Supported byTwo weeks after Donald J. Trump swept to victory, investors from around the world are betting that his promises of tax cuts, fewer regulations and a spendthrift federal government can recharge the American economy.This burst of exuberance sent the major markets to record highs on Monday, as investors continued to pull out of government bond funds whose yields are miserly. The momentum has shown few signs of slowing and has resulted in significant flows of money being poured into United States stocks.For that reason, many economists have warned that the downside to a Trump-inspired revival of the United States economy is a spate of calamities in emerging markets, as investors head quickly for the exit.The recent euphoria stands in sharp contrast to Wall Street\u2019s prediction, before the election, of market mayhem if Mr. Trump were to win. The view had been that his unpredictable ways would spook the financial world, not least his threat to rip up trade agreements with Mexico and fight China on its exports to the United States.After a sharp but very brief slide in Asian trading on election night, when it became clear that Mr. Trump would win, markets rallied quickly as the Trump economic agenda was quickly assessed.\u201cOnce this thing starts, you will see people piling on and the prosperity will blow you away,\u201d said Arthur Laffer, a lower-tax evangelist who advised Mr. Reagan on economic policy and is doing the same with Mr. Trump.Mr. Laffer said little about the budget deficits and the surge in debt that resulted from Reagan-era policies. But his ebullience mirrors the mood in the markets as investors choose to set aside gloomier notions and bet instead on a jamboree in stocks that will \u2014 they hope \u2014 be supported by a Trump-style economic boom.At the root of the postelection reappraisal, economists and investors contend, is the view that Republican control of the Senate and House, as well as the White House, will put an end to the divisive politics of the Obama years that prevented his administration from taking more direct steps to stimulate the economy.Moreover, political analysts point to the fact that while Democrats have been criticizing the president-elect on many fronts, on the one subject investors have rallied around the most \u2014 infrastructure spending \u2014 there has been broad agreement with the president-elect.When it comes to market rallies, this one does not match the record set during President Obama\u2019s first term, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 84.5 percent. If the markets were to duplicate that gain during a Trump administration, the S.&.P. 500 would have to be over 4,000 by late January 2021, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The Obama stock market boom was fueled by an unprecedented period of central bank activism in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. Central bankers around the world flooded markets with easy liquidity that flowed into every type of financial asset.With interest rates on the rise and inflation picking up, central banks are now in retreat. That means that the Trump administration will need fiscal policy \u2014 government spending and tax cuts \u2014 rather than relying on the Federal Reserve.Still, on Monday, four major measures of the stock market reached record highs.The benchmark S.&P. 500 closed up 16.3 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,198.18. The S.&P. is now up about 3 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.The narrower Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.47 percent on Monday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended up 0.89 percent. The Russell 2000, a benchmark of companies with smaller market values, ended the day up 0.50 percent.It was the first time since Dec. 31, 1999, when stocks were still enjoying the dot-com boom, that the Dow, the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 reached highs on the same day, according to Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. All but the Russell, however, had previously reached record highs together on the same day just last August.Shares of energy companies led the stock market rally on Monday as oil prices climbed nearly 4 percent to a three-week high. Marathon Petroleum surged nearly 9 percent, Chesapeake Energy rose 7 percent, ConocoPhillips ended up 3.6 percent, and Exxon Mobil closed up 1.42 percent.In recent years, a low oil price has signaled fears of global stagnation and deflation and the worry that hamstrung governments were not in a position to stimulate growth.Now, in contrast to past decades when a high oil price would spark worries about inflation, its trend upward is being seen as a positive, perhaps heralding a move by governments around the world to spend more to lift their economies.Like all stock market upticks, this one has been driven by sharp inflows of money. Not least from investors who had been seeking safety from uncertainty, political and otherwise, in government bonds. In the last 10 years, $1.5 trillion has moved into bond mutual funds, according to Merrill Lynch, while little has been able to stick in the stock market.Now, as optimism spreads about Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda, investors are pulling out of their bond funds and buying stocks that benefit when the economy turns around, like commercial banks.\u201cInvestors are experiencing what I call FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at the research firm CFRA. \u201cThey are playing catch-up.\u201dWhile he describes the recent run as impressive, he also points out that potential disappointments are lurking.\u201cThis will be more of a challenge than people are now thinking,\u201d Mr. Stovall said, referring to the high hopes for infrastructure spending. \u201cThe Republican Congress is still relatively conservative, so for every dollar of spending they will be asking for cutbacks, because our debt is already approaching 100 percent of G.D.P.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about investors\u2019 exuberance over potential economic growth under the incoming administration misidentified whom Democrats broadly agree with on infrastructure spending. It is the president-elect, not the president.Advertisement"}

It proved to be a turning point in French cinema.Shot in documentary style, in natural light, with a constantly moving hand-held camera, \u201cBreathless\u201d overthrew the polished aesthetics of 1950s French film, introducing a B-movie rawness and energy.\u201cWe tried to make it like we were a news crew,\u201d Mr. Coutard told The Houston Chronicle in 2010. \u201cI handled the camera and the lighting, and I had one assistant who was the focus puller. There was no gaffer for the light, and just one grip who was moving around equipment.\u201dThe film electrified audiences and critics, and made overnight stars of Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo. \u201cIt was a revolution,\u201d Le Monde wrote in its obituary of Mr. Coutard.Sometimes described as \u201cthe eye of the New Wave, \u201d Mr. Coutard went on to make more than a dozen films with Godard, including \u201cContempt\u201d and \u201cWeekend,\u201d and four films with Mr. Truffaut, notably \u201cJules and Jim\u201d and \u201cThe Bride Wore Black.\u201dHe became known for his mobile camera and long tracking shots. Using the latest film stocks, he achieved a lustrous chiaroscuro in his black-and-white films, and dazzling, saturated hues in his color films. Armond White, surveying his career in Film Comment in 1989, called him \u201cthe first superstar cinematographer.\u2019\u2019Raoul Coutard was born on Sept. 16, 1924, in Paris, where his father was an accountant for Hoffmann-LaRoche, the pharmaceutical company. He passed the entrance exam to study chemistry, but, lacking the tuition money, he went to work at a photo lab.In 1945 he enlisted in the French Far East Expeditionary Corps and served in Indochina, rising to platoon sergeant in northern Laos. After completing a tour of duty, he returned to do war photography for the French Military Information Service. At the same time, he accompanied ethnographic expeditions in the region, recording village life and customs and photographing the landscape.He later worked from Indochina as a freelance photographer, contributing to the magazines Radar, Paris Match and Life.In Hanoi he befriended Pierre Schoendoerffer, another photographer, and the two made a pact, which Mr. Coutard described in a memoir, \u201cL\u2019Imp\u00e9riale de Van Su: How I Broke Into the Movies While Eating a Bowl of Chinese Soup\u201d (1997). The first one to make a film would bring the other along.In 1958, Mr. Schoendoerffer found himself directing \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Pass\u201d with Jacques Dupont and, true to his word, invited Mr. Coutard abroad.The two went on to make many films together, notably \u201cThe 317th Platoon\u201d (1964) and \u201cDrummer Crab\u201d (1977). \u201cDrummer Crab,\u201d a Conradian tale of the high seas, showed Mr. Coutard at his most ravishing. \u201cCoutard turns the sea into molten silver, the setting sun into spreading red fire, Vietnam into terrain hot with dangerous and hidden life,\u201d The Miami Herald wrote in 1984.Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s extremely difficult for laymen, including most movie reviewers, to know exactly who is responsible for the \u2018look\u2019 of any particular film, it should be possible at this point to acknowledge Mr. Coutard\u2019s genius; that is, his rare ability to realize the very different objectives of each of the major directors he has worked with.\u201dHis collaboration with Mr. Godard ended when France was engulfed by the political events of 1968. \u201cJean-Luc is a fascist of the left, and I am a fascist of the right,\u201d Mr. Coutard told The Guardian. But the two reunited in the early 1980s to make \u201cPassion\u201d and \u201cFirst Name: Carmen.\u201dHe also had a falling-out with Mr. Truffaut, with whom he had collaborated on \u201cShoot the Piano Player\u201d and \u201cThe Soft Skin.\u201d\u201cThe Bride Wore Black\u201d (1967) was their last film together. \u201cI had the ridiculous idea to quit smoking at the same time we were filming the movie,\u201d Mr. Coutard told The Houston Chronicle. \u201cI was very unbearable and very unpleasant, so we parted ways after that.\u201dMr. Coutard was the cinematographer on Jacques Demy\u2019s \u201cLola,\u201d which made a star of Anouk Aim\u00e9e, and on two of the best-known films by Costa-Gavras, \u201cZ\u201d and \u201cThe Confession.\u201d He also contributed to \u201cChronicle of a Summer,\u201d a 1960 film directed by the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pioneer Jean Rouch with the sociologist Edgar Morin.As the New Wave ebbed, he began making his own films. \u201cHoa-Binh\u201d (\u201cPeace\u201d), which dramatized the effects of war on the children of Vietnam, won the prestigious Prix Jean Vigo and in 1971 was nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign-language film.Mr. Coutard followed up with \u201cOperation Leopard,\u201d about a 1978 military raid by French forces in Zaire, and \u201cSAS in San Salvador,\u201d a political thriller.Mr. Coutard, who lived in Boucau, near Bayonne, is survived by his wife, Monique Herran.

{"Headline": "The Money Management Gospel of Yale\u2019s Endowment Guru", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byAs he has done for decades, once a week David F. Swensen convenes his staff \u2014 including his cadre of apprentices \u2014 for a morning-long meeting among the Gothic revival flourishes and crenelations of the Yale University campus to debate investment ideas.Mr. Swensen, 62, runs the school\u2019s $25.4 billion endowment, one of the largest in the country. Usually he is joined by his intellectual sparring partner, Dean Takahashi, his senior director. It amounts to an internship in the world of managing a university\u2019s billions \u2014 and the young analysts have a front-row seat.\u201cIt was like watching a 70-year-old married couple go at it in full force,\u201d recalled Andrew Golden, who was one of those Swensen acolytes in the 1980s.But forget what you think about internships and fetching doughnuts for the bosses. The meetings are supposed to be a crucible of ideas, and the analysts \u2014 some of whom stay in the positions for years \u2014 recalled bringing their own proposals in the early days, and having to defend them or face the music. \u201cIt could be jarring to have your own view shredded by them,\u201d Mr. Golden said.As for Mr. Swensen, it\u2019s an environment that brings together two things he loves: thinking about investments and teaching other people how to think about them. \u201cThey are twin passions of mine,\u201d he said during a recent interview in his sun-filled corner office at the endowment\u2019s headquarters on Yale\u2019s New Haven campus. Certainly no school has incubated as many endowment managers as Yale.Mr. Swensen is legendary in the rarefied world of endowment management. He has pioneered an investment strategy that expanded Yale\u2019s portfolio from a plain-vanilla mix of stocks and bonds to substantial holdings in real estate, private equity and venture capital, along with other alternatives. Until then, the typical endowment was far more conservative.And through his graduates, his investment style has spread to the nation\u2019s prominent schools and foundations. Today, Mr. Swensen and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s oversee nearly $100 billion in endowment money for schools including M.I.T., Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, Bowdoin, Wesleyan and Princeton (which Mr. Golden manages). Other alumni are running the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and working at the YMCA Retirement Fund and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.In an era when it is routine for money managers to elbow their way into the public consciousness \u2014 populating the news channels, burnishing their images \u2014 Mr. Swensen has largely stayed away from the spotlight, aside from writing a book, \u201cPioneering Portfolio Management.\u201d Yet he is one of the most influential people in a generation that has seen endowments grow tremendously in importance at premier institutions. Yale\u2019s endowment now provides 33 percent of the school\u2019s budget, compared with 10 percent in 1985.In a series of extended interviews, he and more than a half-dozen of his investment-office veterans discussed his management style \u2014 where they agree and disagree. Along the way Mr. Swensen gave his views on things as diverse as the pharmaceutical company Valeant \u2014 which \u201cdidn\u2019t even have the fig leaf of R.&D. expenditures,\u201d he said, to justify increasing its drug prices dramatically \u2014 to his toughest year, fiscal 2009, when his fund plummeted 24.6 percent during the economic meltdown.In the aftermath, he got hurt in a particularly bad real estate investment. \u201cThis is one of my biggest mistakes in the past 30 years,\u201d Mr. Swensen said.Mr. Swensen, a lanky, soft-spoken native of River Falls, Wis., initially planned to become a teacher before going into the world of finance, where he understood it wasn\u2019t just about the numbers. \u201cIn poker, you can play the cards or you can play the people,\u201d said Randy Kim, who worked in the endowment office for a decade and went on to run the investment department of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. \u201cDave could do both.\u201dMr. Swensen\u2019s route to the endowment world was circuitous, though. \u201cMy father and my grandfather were both chemistry professors,\u201d he said. After earning a doctorate in economics from Yale in 1980, he considered teaching that subject. But while he was researching bond prices at Salomon Brothers for his Ph.D. dissertation, \u201cthey offered me a job,\u201d he said.Salomon was, of course, a Wall Street bond titan at the time and would eventually help define the go-go 1980s \u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d era of leveraged buyouts. All of that was still a few years in the future, though, and anyway, Mr. Swensen said, \u201cI missed Yale so much that I went back to teach one class every semester.\u201dIn 1985, the Yale provost, William C. Brainard, plucked him from Wall Street and asked him to take over the school\u2019s $1 billion endowment.His acceptance meant an 80 percent pay cut. But Mr. Swensen says he never regretted returning to work for an academic mission. \u201cI am in the fortunate position of making very good money,\u201d he said, for something he loves doing. He made $5.1 million in 2014, the latest numbers available.From the beginning, he brought in analysts and interns to work on the portfolio. Part of that process soon included the weekly meeting to debate investment ideas. \u201cSeeing that there was a debate, even at the most senior level, taught everyone to have their own view,\u201d Mr. Golden said.He recalled proposing at the time that Yale place some of its money with several money managers he had identified as promising. \u201cThey had good track records,\u201d he said. However, the debate centered on something different: \u201cHow good they would be going forward.\u201dIn some cases, Yale selected a manager with little or no track record. That was the case with the Hillhouse Capital Group, an investment fund focused on Chinese stocks that was begun in 2005 by Lei Zhang \u2014 himself a former underling of Mr. Swensen.That Hillhouse investment ended up taking Yale on a wild ride during the 2008 financial crisis. The value of the school\u2019s investment in Hillhouse fell nearly 44 percent, peak to trough. But instead of taking money out, Yale actually invested more in Hillhouse, convinced that Mr. Zhang\u2019s investment approach remained solid.For Mr. Swensen, the decision to stay in was logical. \u201cWho cares about the trailing numbers if the fundamentals of the portfolio are good?\u201d he said. That long-term mind-set paid off. Hillhouse has generated more than a 20 percent average annual return since the endowment first invested in 2005.Explaining his investment strategies and other issues is onerous work. Mr. Swensen said his team worked on long quarterly reports that go to the endowment\u2019s investment committee. \u201cI edit every single memo,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that if you write your argument down, you might recognize flaws in it.\u201dReturns are central, of course, but a manager\u2019s track record \u2014 even if good on the bottom line \u2014 must be balanced against whether that money manager\u2019s goals work in Yale\u2019s interest. The university has \u201cclose to 100 active relationships\u201d with money-management firms, Mr. Swensen said. \u201cThe average length of a relationship is 13 years. That is a long time. It is all about being partners and who you choose.\u201dThere are some categories of manager that turn Mr. Swensen off, like the \u201casset gatherers,\u201d as he calls them, often famed for building mammoth investment funds by attracting scores of individual investors. \u201cThe Bill Grosses and Peter Lynches are about asset gathering\u201d he said, referring to one of the founders of Pimco and to the former manager of Fidelity Investments\u2019 Magellan Fund. \u201cMore assets produce more fees, but they force managers to add more positions, not just Grade A ideas,\u201d he said.A Fidelity spokesman said Mr. Lynch\u2019s record spoke for itself. A representative for Mr. Gross declined to comment.Nor does leverage \u2014 the use of borrowed money to try to amplify returns \u2014 appeal to the Yale team. \u201cWe want managers who are interested in improving operations as a way to create value, as opposed to financial engineering,\u201d he said. The team applies a simple test when considering putting money with an investor who specializes in corporate buyouts: Add up the leverage in the investor\u2019s portfolio, and compare it with the leverage in the stock market (meaning the borrowing conducted by publicly traded companies).Leverage, after all, can become a millstone if things start to go wrong. \u201cDebt restricts your ability to do things,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said.Mr. Swensen also has little patience for some activist investors like William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, who has mounted public battles aimed at spurring target companies to revamp. \u201cThe drill is that they want return of capital, whether it comes from cash distributions or stock buybacks. That is an extraordinarily short-term orientation,\u201d Mr. Swensen said. \u201cBy and large, American companies are underinvesting for the future, and a lot of that has to do with either implicit or explicit pressure from activists.\u201dMr. Swensen has been particularly critical of Mr. Ackman\u2019s highly publicized investment in Valeant, which in recent years stirred national controversy after it dramatically raised the prices on drugs that it had bought the right to sell. \u201cThe excessive price increases abuse market power and create great profits, while burdening our health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business model is at odds with sensible public policy. When Congress and the regulatory authorities catch on, the companies suffer,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Pershing Square, Francis McGill, said: \u201cPershing Square is a long-term investor which has improved the operations and performance of more than 30 corporations. It has never advocated short-term financial engineering techniques.\u201dFormer analysts describe how they learned to be careful observers of personality and engagement when vetting prospective money managers. \u201cWe learned to look for managers who know their portfolios well,\u201d said Paula J. Volent, senior vice president for investments at Bowdoin College. \u201cIf they have to look at a piece of paper in a meeting, then they don\u2019t really know.\u201dAnne Martin, a former Swensen intern who manages Wesleyan\u2019s endowment, described vetting one private equity fund. \u201cWe were near the end of the process. I worried that some of the terms were not fair, so I called the manager,\u201d she said, who adopted a dismissive tone. \u201cI am not adjusting the terms this time, and I am not going to talk to you about it,\u201d she recalled him saying.\u201cSo I thought: This is a partnership, and there will be tough times, so how will it be then?\u201d she said. Wesleyan didn\u2019t give him the money.Mr. Swensen\u2019s analysts have seen his standards prove costly to Yale. For instance, the endowment long had money with Michael Steinhardt, a well-known Wall Street trader, and it had been one of the school\u2019s most profitable investments. But in 1991, Mr. Steinhardt\u2019s firm was swept up in accusations of cornering the two-year Treasury market.The Steinhardt firm later settled, agreeing to pay $40 million without admitting wrongdoing. But Mr. Swensen had already taken Yale\u2019s money out that firm.That decision impressed D. Ellen Shuman, who worked at Yale from 1986 to 1998 and now runs Edgehill Endowment Partners, which manages $650 million for smaller endowments. \u201cDavid put the reputation of the institution ahead of profits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really affected me in my career.\u201dNewcomers often arrive at the investment office from the Yale School of Management, as did Peter H. Ammon, now manager of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s endowment. But they take many routes. Seth Alexander, now head of M.I.T.\u2019s endowment, taught at the business school, but did not attend. Robert F. Wallace, who runs the Stanford endowment, was a ballet dancer before going to Yale to study economics. Ms. Volent, who oversees the Bowdoin endowment, planned to be a museum director.And Mr. Golden, head of Princeton\u2019s endowment, had an \u201cunsatisfying job at a small money management firm,\u201d he recalled. When he met Mr. Takahashi, Mr. Swensen\u2019s associate, Mr. Takahashi told him, \u201cIf you want to do good, we are looking for an intern.\u201d So Mr. Golden joined.Mr. Swensen says he is pleased when his analysts go to the nonprofit world. He never considered leaving Yale and was disappointed when, in 2007, Mohamed El-Erian quit as head of the Harvard endowment, after less than two years, to return to Pimco. \u201cManaging an endowment is a position of trust, not a steppingstone,\u201d Mr. Swensen said.Mr. El-Erian did not respond to a request for comment.Many Yale office graduates remain close, and they share investment ideas. Mr. Golden of Princeton said that when he finds good money managers, he prefers that they have other investors like Yale and Bowdoin, because they have similarly long time horizons.And when they do invest together, \u201cYale negotiates for everyone,\u201d said Ms. Volent. \u201cWe sit back and we let Yale do the hard work if the funds are too expensive.\u201dMs. Shuman said in real estate investments, Mr. Swensen required a fee structure \u201cwhere managers did not get any of the profits until there was a 6 percent hard return, or whatever number an investor could get from a passive investment at that time.\u201d The money managers objected \u2014 they wanted 20 percent on the entire profit \u2014 but lost. \u201cDavid\u2019s way is fairer,\u201d she said.Mr. Swensen likes teaming up to invest with his former analysts. For one thing, it can reduce the risk of panicky withdrawals. \u201cWe were talking to a manager who just had capital taken away because the fund had a bad year,\u201d Mr. Swensen recalled. \u201cThe investor said, \u2018Your five-year numbers are not so good, so we are firing you.\u2019 That sounds like the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d Mr. Swensen said.\u201cWhen managers have to deal with stupid limited partners, they are not spending their time picking stocks,\u201d he said.There have been mistakes. Yale and schools that embraced its model stumbled when the market plummeted in 2008 because they had so much of their portfolios tied up in hard-to-sell assets.Mr. Swensen acknowledges that, going into 2008, \u201cWe were too illiquid, and now we are not as illiquid. We want 50 percent of our assets in liquid investments,\u201d he said.The real estate meltdown took a toll. Yale, along with a host of universities, put money into real estate funds run by Lubert-Adler \u2014 the judgment call Mr. Swensen referred to as his \u201cbiggest mistake.\u201d When one of the funds suffered steep losses as a result of investments in troubled golf resort projects, many schools were hurt, including Yale.Not every Yale-trained manager agrees with Mr. Swensen\u2019s investment parameters. Bowdoin has nearly twice as much in absolute return funds (which focus on asset appreciation, as opposed to performance against an index or benchmark) because the hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller is on the Bowdoin investment committee and plays a role in picking managers.Ms. Volent of Bowdoin, whose returns have well outpaced the averages, pointed out that she has \u201ca lot of money in global macroeconomic funds.\u201d She added, \u201cThey have been great for us, but David hates that area. He thinks no one can anticipate changes in currencies and interest rates.\u201dOne might wonder about the value of Yale\u2019s investment philosophy when looking at the last year\u2019s performance. For the year ended June 30, a plain-vanilla portfolio of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds outperformed more diversified portfolios (like those of endowments). However, over a 20-year run, Yale\u2019s average annual return has been 12.6 percent compared with 7.4 percent for the 60-40 portfolio.Mr. Swenson has no plans to alter his investment strategy, or to slow down. (He has been fighting cancer for four years, he said, and his condition is stable.) He remains convinced that diversification over the long term is crucial. \u201cThis is not a sprint,\u201d he said. \u201cI am pretty happy with the numbers.\u201dAn article last Sunday about David F. Swensen, who manages Yale University\u2019s endowment, misstated the role of a former colleague, Randy Kim, at the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Mr. Kim ran the investment department, not the foundation itself.Advertisement"}

Sound familiar?Its pension fund for police officers and firefighters is near collapse and is seeking an immense bailout.How can this be when Dallas has the fastest economic growth of the 13 largest cities in the country?Panicked local retirees have pulled $220 million from the fund in the last six weeks after a recommendation that they no longer be allowed to take out big blocks of money.Even before that, there were reports that the fund\u2019s investments were worth less than stated.Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat who has been in the statehouse since 1973, recalled enthusiastically voting in 1993 for the plan that sent the pension fund on its ill-fated quest for investment returns of 9 percent.\u201cWe all know some of the benefits, guaranteed, were just probably never realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was good while it lasted, but we\u2019ve got some serious financial problems because of it.\u201dHere\u2019s a puzzle for you:1. Europe may never regain economic vigor if Italy\u2019s banks are in a state of perpetual emergency.2. Italy\u2019s banks cannot get healthy without economic growth.3. Italy\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow without healthy banks.The country\u2019s banks have muddled through for years, but with the economy so weak, bad loans have festered and good loans have deteriorated. Nearly a fifth of loans in the system \u2014 worth nearly $400 billion \u2014 are classified as troubled by the International Monetary Fund.If this also sounds like a familiar theme, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a longstanding problem and one that affects the rest of Europe. Italy\u2019s troubled loans represent about 40 percent of all the bad loans within the eurozone.But, \u201cbanking is a symptom, not the cause,\u201d says Ignazio Visco, the governor of the Bank of Italy.He argues that the bulk of Italy\u2019s bad debt is backed by collateral and most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt.Economists, however, are unconvinced.They say banks prop up zombie companies that will never repay their loans, extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts.This year\u2019s presidential election could be remembered as a pivotal moment for the markets, which have been given the impetus to solidify deeper trends that were already underway.A revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place.But traders are making educated guesses and if they turn out to be wrong, the market could turn upside down again.What does this mean for most long-term investors? Broad diversification, Jeff Sommer writes. Simple balanced portfolios of stocks and bonds have barely moved since the election.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a crazy technical background to do this job. A lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\u201d\u2022 Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, will answer questions at the European Parliament.

{"Headline": "What Happens to the Markets if Donald Trump Wins?", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byDealBookAssume, for a moment, that Donald J. Trump wins the presidency.But what exactly happens the day after? To markets? To the economy?In explaining his prediction, Professor Johnson wrote that Europe\u2019s economy is so fragile that \u201cTrump\u2019s trade-led recession would tip Europe back into full-blown recession, which would likely precipitate a serious banking crisis.\u201d After that, he continued: \u201cIf this risk were not contained \u2014 and the probability of a European banking debacle is already disconcertingly high \u2014 there would be a further negative spiral. Either way, the effects on emerging markets and all lower-income countries would be dramatic.\u201dProfessor Johnson\u2019s view may be a bit hyperbolic, but to one degree or another, his pessimism is shared by many economists across Wall Street, from Citigroup to Goldman Sachs. Each cites a different set of reasons the markets will fall if Mr. Trump wins.But is the conventional wisdom right?In all likelihood, a Trump victory would lead to a swift, knee-jerk sell-off. Many investors will choose to sell stocks and ask questions later.But in the days and weeks after a Trump victory, among investors who cull their portfolios carefully, the decision about buying and selling will be company by company, industry by industry, currency by currency and so forth.In truth, it\u2019s impossible to predict how the markets would settle into a Trump presidency, despite the speculation on all sides. In all likelihood, it will take time for investors to truly make sense and \u201cmath out\u201d how his policies would affect the economy. Yes, the Mexican peso would most likely fall on fears of a trade fight \u2014 Goldman Sachs says it could fall by as much as 25 percent \u2014 and shares of some insurance companies could tumble on the uncertainty of what would happen if Obamacare were repealed.But oil companies and other sectors of the traditional energy industry would be likely to rally given Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to repeal regulations. (Renewable energy companies would fall.) Health care and biotechnology stocks, which have been driven down over concerns that Mrs. Clinton will seek greater regulation and possibly even price controls, might also pop.The biggest test for the stock markets might be pegged to the future leadership of the Federal Reserve. \u201cThere is much more uncertainty regarding who Trump might nominate, though he has made it clear he would not renominate Chair Yellen,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. \u201cHis criticisms of Fed policy are somewhat ambiguous; he has suggested rates have been left too low for too long, but also warns of negative consequences of rate hikes. We would expect that financial markets would view a Trump victory as having slightly hawkish implications, since it would make a change in what many view as a dovish-leaning Fed leadership much more likely.\u201dA handful of economists have suggested that despite all of the promises made by the candidates, the outcome of the election might not actually decide what direction the markets will take.\u201cPutting aside their personalities and policy proposals, it will likely not matter who the next president is when it comes to where markets go,\u201d Mr. Boockvar wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAs we are in the second-longest bull market of all time, and as we approach the eighth year of this economic expansion,\u201d he wrote, \u201codds are high that whoever the next president is, they will preside over a recession, a bear market and rising debts and deficits.\u201dThat might be too bearish of a view, but given that we\u2019ve had a financial crisis of some sort about every eight years or so for the last several decades, it is hard to believe that we will go through the next four years without a hiccup. If merger activity is a gauge of the market\u2019s cycle, the recent spate of deals suggests we\u2019re closer to the ninth inning than the first.Lawrence G. McDonald of ACG Analytics, who has commented on the potential benefits of a Trump presidency, said, \u201cTrump will create a colossal panic, but the relief rally will be outstanding.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton is clearly the favorite choice of Fortune 500 chief executives and investors, Wall Street, perhaps surprisingly, is less enthusiastic about the idea of a Clinton presidency combined with potential Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. \u201cThe S.&P. 500 has tended to react poorly to increases in the implied probability of a Democratic sweep, after removing the estimated effects of changes in growth, inflation and policy expectations,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote. \u201cThe upshot is that the equity market appears to favor Clinton to Trump, but also seems to prefer divided government over single-party control.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The mayor\u2019s office insisted that the timing was coincidental and the decision not political. But the planning chief made clear that he saw a green light to proceed \u201cnow that Trump\u201d had won.Call it the Trump Effect. Around the world, his election is already shaping events \u2014 or at least perceived to be shaping them \u2014 even though he will not take office for seven more weeks. Companies hoping to profit from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies have seen shares soar. Countries fearing his anti-trade stance have seen the value of their currencies plunge against the dollar. Governments are recalibrating policies on trade, defense and immigration.The behavior of the global markets toward Mr. Trump has been uneven. On Monday, stocks and the dollar slipped slightly and bond prices rose, perhaps indicating a bit of caution after the postelection stock market surge.Much of the markets\u2019 mixed reaction reflects uncertainty about a new president who has never held public office, leaving political leaders, business executives and international institutions to make bets on how a Trump administration may rewrite rules that have governed global affairs under American presidents of both parties.Another company that has seen its share value increase since the election is Magal Security Systems, an Israeli firm that helped develop high-tech security barriers around Gaza and the West Bank. With Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico, investors expect that firms like Magal could get some of the business. Magal\u2019s shares rose as high as 24 percent above their pre-election level, with trading volume as much as 150 times higher.Other economies have reacted with trepidation amid fears that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may drive up interest rates and inflation, an expectation that some traders call Trumpflation.In China, initial optimism about Mr. Trump is giving way to skepticism. \u201cWe should stop imagining what benefits Trump\u2019s election could bring to China,\u201d Zhu Chenghu, a retired major general, said at a seminar at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing on Friday. \u201cHe will return to the traditional policies that rely on the role of the U.S. dollar and seek expansion overseas.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s election is getting credit, or blame, for all sorts of events, no matter how tangential. In Russia, a newspaper interviewed an analyst who suggested that the arrest of a cabinet minister on bribery charges may have resulted from Mr. Trump\u2019s success because Moscow no longer had to fear going after prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of reformers who were once close to Washington.Members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition expect Mr. Trump to abandon the practice of Mr. Obama and presidents of both parties who tried to restrain Israel from building housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Shortly after the election, a Trump adviser said settlements were not an obstacle to peace, appearing to have adopted the argument Mr. Netanyahu makes.\u201cThe next few weeks present a unique window of opportunity for Israel,\u201d Naftali Bennett, who leads a pro-settler party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, told a conference sponsored by The Jerusalem Post last week. After years of American pressure, he added, \u201cit\u2019s ours to decide.\u201dBetty Herschman, the director of international relations for Ir Amim, a group that opposes settlement construction, said it was too early to know what Mr. Trump\u2019s policy would actually be. But she said one thing was clear: \u201cThe Israeli right is already celebrating.\u201dBrachie Sprung, a spokeswoman for Mayor Nir Barkat, said last week\u2019s action by the municipal planning committee was a result of the developer\u2019s coming back to the city with revisions to his plan that required new approval.\u201cThere has been no political statement here with this piece of land,\u201d she said.\u201cI intend to exploit the change of the guard in the U.S.A. and bring them to approval,\u201d Mr. Turgeman told Israel\u2019s Channel 2.

{"Headline": "Why Corruption Matters", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byOf course, Donald Trump could be rejecting these favors and separating himself and his family from his hotels and so on. But he isn\u2019t. In fact, he\u2019s openly using his position to drum up business. And his early appointments suggest that he won\u2019t be the only player using political power to build personal wealth. Self-dealing will be the norm throughout this administration. America has just entered an era of unprecedented corruption at the top.The question you need to ask is why this matters. Hint: It\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s the incentives.True, we could be talking about a lot of money \u2014 think billions, not millions, to Mr. Trump alone (which is why his promise not to take his salary is a sick joke). But America is a very rich country, whose government spends more than $4 trillion a year, so even large-scale looting amounts to rounding error. What\u2019s important is not the money that sticks to the fingers of the inner circle, but what they do to get that money, and the bad policy that results.Normally, policy reflects some combination of practicality \u2014 what works? \u2014 and ideology \u2014 what fits my preconceptions? And our usual complaint is that ideology all too often overrules the evidence.But now we\u2019re going to see a third factor powerfully at work: What policies can officials, very much including the man at the top, personally monetize? And the effect will be disastrous.But what\u2019s truly scary is the potential impact of corruption on foreign policy. Again, foreign governments are already trying to buy influence by adding to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal wealth, and he is welcoming their efforts.Destruction of democratic norms aside, however, think about the tilt this de facto bribery will give to U.S. policy. What kind of regime can buy influence by enriching the president and his friends? The answer is, only a government that doesn\u2019t adhere to the rule of law.Think about it: Could Britain or Canada curry favor with the incoming administration by waiving regulations to promote Trump golf courses or directing business to Trump hotels? No \u2014 those nations have free presses, independent courts, and rules designed to prevent exactly that kind of improper behavior. On the other hand, someplace like Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia can easily funnel vast sums to the man at the top in return for, say, the withdrawal of security guarantees for the Baltic States.So how bad will the effects of Trump-era corruption be? The best guess is, worse than you can possibly imagine.Charles M. Blow is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Latina Hotel Workers Harness Force of Labor and of Politics in Las Vegas", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "This LandThe 57,000-member Culinary Union, which is 56 percent Latino and includes guest room attendants, is a powerful supporter of Nevada Democrats.Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 She begins her day in black, the natural black before dawn and the requisite black of her uniform: the T-shirt, the pants, the socks, the shoes with slip-resistant treads, all black. The outfit announces deference.She crams fresh vegetables into a blender and holds a plate over its mouth as the machine whips up her green liquid breakfast. Its whine sounds the alarm for her four school-age grandchildren who, one by one, emerge sleepwalking from corners of their crammed rented house.Time to go. Before shepherding the children into her silver Jeep Patriot, the woman straps on a fabric back brace and covers it with the last piece of her uniform, a gray and black tunic. Then, above her left breast, she pins two small union buttons beside her silver name tag. The combined effect says:This is Celia. Underestimate her at your risk.Celia Vargas, 57, with dark wavy hair restrained by a clasp, works at one of the hotels in perpetual gleam along and around the Strip. She is a \u201cguest room attendant\u201d and a member of the Culinary Union, one of more than 14,000 who clean hotel rooms while guests donate money to the casino of their choice.Ms. Vargas, who is from El Salvador, and her Latina union colleagues are a growing force in the politics and culture of Nevada, vocal in their beliefs and expectations. Their 57,000-member Culinary Union, a powerful supporter of Nevada Democrats, is now 56 percent Latino \u2014 a jump from 35 percent just 20 years ago.\u201cThe power and courage of guest room attendants are the foundation and a big source of strength of the Culinary Union,\u201d Bethany Khan, the union\u2019s communications director, says. These workers, she adds, \u201care the majority of the middle class in Nevada.\u201dSo Ms. Vargas wears her back brace, hidden, but also her buttons, prominent.A wooden rosary draped over the rearview mirror sways as her Jeep wends through a working-class stretch of Las Vegas; this is not where Donny and Marie live. She drops her grandchildren at their school, then goes to the house of a friend from the Dominican Republic. She is standing outside, dressed in the same black and gray.The Jeep drives deeper into the Vegas peculiarity, past the 7-Elevens and massage parlors, the smoke shops and strip clubs. Soon the casino and hotel giants of the Strip are framing the view, including one that sticks out like a gold tooth in a wicked grin.This is where Ms. Vargas will clock in at 8:30, and where she is expected to clean a checked-out room in less than 30 minutes and a stay-over in less than 15. Every room seems to reveal something about the human condition.\u201cSometimes I open the door, and I say \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Vargas says. \u201cAnd then I close the door.\u201dDespite their name tags, guest room attendants are anonymous. They go unnoticed by many as they push their 300-pound carts to the next room, and the next.A glimpse of what is expected of these attendants can be found at the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas, a joint venture between the culinary and bartenders unions and many properties along the Strip. Here, people are trained as cooks or baker\u2019s helpers, bus persons or bar apprentices \u2014 or guest room attendants.A corner of the academy\u2019s building features a series of mock guest rooms, each one representing a specific hotel\u2019s style: a Bellagio suite, an MGM Grand, a Caesars Palace. Students learn how to lift mattresses without injuring their backs; how to wear gloves while reaching with care into wastebaskets; and how to maintain quality while moving quickly, because there\u2019s always another room.\u201cGet in and get out,\u201d says Shirley Smith, a former guest room attendant who now trains others.Consider all the items on that cart. Linens, magazines, water bottles, coffee, toiletries, tissues, glass cleaners, disinfectants, bathrobes, dusters, a vacuum, and assorted brushes, including one for the toilet and one for the crevices around the tub and shower.Now consider the job itself.\u201cWe make the beds, dust, vacuum, mop, fill the coffee, the creamer, the sugar,\u201d Ms. Vargas says. \u201cWe wash the toilet, the bathtub, the shower, the Jacuzzi. Worst, sometimes, is the kitchen. We clean the kitchen.\u201dAll in a half-hour. Nine, 10, 11 times a day.And when her shift ends in the early evening, Ms. Vargas has often sweated through her back brace and black T-shirt. Aching here there and everywhere, she drives home and tells her family that Grandma needs to lie down for a little bit.Grandma\u2019s full name is Celia Menendez Vargas. She grew up in the city of Santa Ana, the daughter of a soldier and a nurse. As civil war engulfed El Salvador in the early 1980s, her husband was killed in a bus bombing, and various family members fled to asylum in Canada and Australia. She entrusted her two children to an aunt and sold her belongings to pay for illicit transport to the United States. She was smuggled in a wooden container on a truck bound for Los Angeles.\u201cIllegal,\u201d she says. \u201cLike a lot of people.\u201dShe worked for four years as a live-in housekeeper, applied for residency and saved up the money to arrange for her two sons to join her legally. She remarried, gave birth to a girl in 1986, divorced and kept working. Newspaper deliverer. Garment factory worker. Babysitter. School custodian. Food-truck cook, making pupusas, those Salvadoran corn tortillas filled with cheese or meat or beans.In 1996, Ms. Vargas became an American citizen. Her reasoning is familiar, yet fresh: \u201cFor me this was very important. I always think this country was the best for the future of my kids.\u201dFriends were urging her to come to the soccer fields some Sunday and meet a man who was also from Santa Ana, but her heavy work schedule precluded romance. \u201cAlways working,\u201d she says. \u201cWorking, work, work.\u201dThey met, finally, she and Jorge Alberto Vargas, and were married in 2003. A few years later they moved to Las Vegas, on word that jobs were plentiful in the neon oasis.Mr. Vargas, who had a work permit based on political asylum, became a chef at a casino on the Strip, and things were fine until they weren\u2019t. Three years ago, he was detained after being arrested a second time for driving under the influence, although the family maintains his second arrest was a medical episode related to diabetes. He spent more than two years being shipped to various federal detention centers \u2014 Nevada, California, Texas, Louisiana \u2014 before being deported back to El Salvador in July.Ms. Vargas saw him last a year ago, for 30 minutes; she cries at the memory. She keeps his clothes boxed in the garage, and files document after document with the government, working toward that day when they might be reunited.This and other travails consume Ms. Vargas. But she has returned to the work force, finding a job as a guest room attendant in this glittering gold nonunion hotel. It paid a little more than $14 an hour \u2014 about $3 less than what unionized housekeepers were making, and with nowhere near the complement of benefits.Some of her colleagues began to agitate for a union vote. Union pamphlets and cards were surreptitiously exchanged in the parking lot, in the bathrooms, under tables in the employees\u2019 dining room. Ms. Vargas joined in, motivated in part by the $17,000 in debt she had accumulated by undergoing surgery for breast cancer; she wanted better health care benefits.At one point she and a few other workers were suspended for wearing union buttons, but this concerted union activity is federally protected. After the Culinary Union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, she was quickly reinstated with back pay, her buttons intact.It has not been easy. Downsizing after her husband\u2019s deportation, selling her bedroom set, moving in with her daughter and her family. Publicly agitating for the union \u2014 and for the Democratic nominee for president \u2014 and then fretting that there might be retaliation at her nonunion, pro-Republican workplace. And working, constantly working.\u201cI tell my children, we have to work,\u201d Ms. Vargas says. \u201cIt\u2019s not for government to support me. We work work work.\u201dShe pulls into the employee parking lot of the gold hotel, set aglow now by the unsparing morning sun. Searching for a parking spot, she passes other women, many of them also in black and gray tunics, hurrying toward the service entrance.Soon she is heading for the same door, one more guest room attendant who wears a back brace while cleaning rooms for a presidential candidate whose name is on the bathrobes she stocks, on the empty wine bottles she collects, on her name tag.He will receive her labor, but not her vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeds of a Fintech Start-Up Sometimes Come From the Trenches", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipWho says the most useful start-up ideas come from millennials fresh from dropping out of Stanford?Some recent tech-based financial innovations haven\u2019t come from venture capitalists or young hotshots but rather from professionals who have toiled away in their industry for decades.Sheryl Rowling, 60, is a financial planner in San Diego who was constantly overwhelmed by the complexity of rebalancing her clients\u2019 portfolios. In portfolio management, rebalancing requires periodic adjustment of client holdings to a preset target of stocks, bonds and cash assembled to meet their goals while minimizing taxes.Although advisers need to keep clients on track with investment goals, rebalancing is often tedious and complex. The process was even more demanding because Ms. Rowling placed high priority on incorporating tax-saving strategies as well. Over the years, she realized that portfolio rebalancing could be automated with the right software.About 10 years ago, her firm was one of the first to put in place one of the early rebalancing software solutions. The software cost $50,000 a year and it took two people 20 hours a week for six months to gear up.When the future of that program became uncertain, Ms. Rowling decided there had to be a better way. She figured if she could design a simpler, more affordable, tax-savvy solution for her own firm, it would also be useful to others.\u201cMost bread-and-butter advisers couldn\u2019t afford six months and $50,000 a year to automate rebalancing,\u201d Ms. Rowling said. \u201cI thought there could be a better, more affordable solution.\u201dAlthough Ms. Rowling had no experience in software coding, she assembled a team to create a program. She financed the development using revenue from her advisory practice, which now has $270 million in assets under management.In 2007, the product that emerged was Total Rebalance Expert, or TRX, which automates the rebalancing process for advisory firms and saves clients money on taxes.Ms. Rowling epitomizes the model of the internal start-up. Unlike the typical profile of a tech-oriented millennial, some entrepreneurs are middle-age, have been in a profession for decades and never thought they would be creating in-demand software.Companies like these eschew the traditional route of angel and venture-capital investing after running businesses for years.David Lyon, 41, who was a Chicago-based registered investment adviser, followed a similar path. A few years ago, he realized that he needed a simple way of effectively communicating with clients about changes in their portfolios or financial plans.To address that, Mr. Lyon started building his own software in 2012. He had a workable package a year later.What emerged was Oranj, a cloud-based platform that \u201callows advisers to maximize time and provide the same level of service across account size.\u201dLike many professionals engaged in their own start-ups, Mr. Lyon also self-financed, or \u201cbootstrapped,\u201d the development of Oranj. He eventually sold his advisory practice to focus on Oranj.He would not disclose revenue for his platform, but said his sales growth was 225 percent year-to-date since 2015. He has hired 47 employees and serves 400 advisory firms.Oranj has plenty of competition: There are dozens of advisory platforms on the market, but Oranj helps advisers avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Lyon said.The platform lets advisers track every client email, call and portfolio change on one \u201cdashboard\u201d page. And clients receive investment advice that\u2019s \u201cagnostic,\u201d that is, not wedded to one investment manager.More opportunities may lay, at least according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, in the area of asset and wealth management, an industry slow to change.Some overhauls are coming about as a result of the Labor Department\u2019s recent rule mandating that financial advisers offering retirement advice act in the best interests of clients.It has been widely speculated that the Republican-dominated Congress and White House will challenge it or roll back the rules. But until that happens, millions of financial advisers, brokers and agents are setting out to meet the conditions of the rule.As a practical matter, this means that advisers must also be able to prove to a regulator that an investment is in the best financial interests of their client and not done just to generate a commission for the adviser.Despite the intense competition to provide financial advice, these start-ups have many opportunities to tap. For example, most of the new \u201crobo-advisers\u201d that provide automated advice on investments are not set up for customized advice on portfolio, tax, estate and post-retirement planning.And older clients need to optimize Social Security benefits, manage retirement withdrawals, monitor tax efficiency and keep up with their investments. Those create openings for advisers who can come up with practical solutions in-house, a growing trend in recent years.For professionals seeking to start a business, getting off the ground can be the most difficult part.Ms. Rowling said she went into her start-up \u201cna\u00efvely and didn\u2019t realize the extent to which technology had to change.\u201d She also realized that her project took more capital and time than she imagined. In addition, after feedback from customers, she had to make adjustments.Ultimately, though, sometimes solving everyday problems left her feeling at the forefront of entrepreneurship.\u201cIt requires a lot of capital to create something there\u2019s a wide need for,\u201d Ms. Rowling added. \u201cAlways be on the cutting edge.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Mr. Ackman sought to explain it away by saying the poor performance was largely caused by just one bad trade.\u201cWe\u2019ve had one problem: Valeant,\u201d Mr. Ackman, 50, said.Shares of the troubled pharmaceutical company have plunged to $17 a share from the average $190 a share his firm paid in 2015, Mr. Ackman said. Pershing has a roughly 10 percent stake in the Valeant. While he acknowledged the stock was unlikely to get back to $190 anytime soon, he outlined what he said was a plan for the company and share price to recover.Mr. Ackman also brushed off suggestions that investors might lose patience with him given the poor performance this year. He said the other stocks Pershing owns had performed better, adding that the firm had a \u201cgood batting average.\u201dAs for his best-known bearish stock call \u2014 Herbalife \u2014 Mr. Ackman said he would still be proved right and the stock would eventually go to zero. But he also struck a humble note, saying he had learned his lesson and would have been \u201cbetter off staying in the shadows\u201d and not going public with claims that the nutritional supplements company was a pyramid scheme.He added: \u201cThis is my last public short.\u201d\u2014 ALEXANDRA STEVENSON and MATTHEW GOLDSTEINLloyd Blankfein may be known for making winning investment calls, but like so many on Wall Street the Goldman Sachs chief made the wrong bet in the presidential election.During the campaign, Mr. Blankfein had voiced support for Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and had been personally featured in a television ad portraying the Democrats as puppets of the global financial elite.But on Thursday the Goldman chief sounded willing to see how Donald J. Trump governs.\u201cI know a lot about Trump the campaigner,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said. \u201cYou go into that office and think about your place in history.\u201dMr. Blankfein said he was not surprised by the two-day rally in the stock market, even as some analysts had predicted a big dip if Mr. Trump was elected, because the Republican\u2019s policies \u2014 most likely a mix of corporate tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks \u2014 will be \u201cmarket supportive.\u201dHe was asked about a media report on Thursday indicating Mr. Trump was considering JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, for Treasury secretary.\u201cHe would be a great Treasury secretary,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein of Mr. Dimon.He said Mr. Trump\u2019s finance chairman during the campaign, Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman executive, is \u201da highflier, a partner at a young age. He did very well. He is a smart, smart guy.\u201dOn Wall Street issues, Mr. Trump has put forth seemingly contradictory proposals. He has said he will repeal the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, though his party\u2019s platform calls for breaking up the big banks.Mr. Blankfein said he thought that neither proposal would gain much traction. \u201cIf you want to be good for bankers you have to have policies that drive economic growth,\u201d he said.Even as Mr. Blankfein struck a relatively optimistic tone about the impending Trump administration, he had sought to assure Goldman employees about the election results.On Wednesday, Mr. Blankfein left a voice mail with employees globally, seeking to reassure the firm in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, which he said \u201csurprised many of us, similar to what we saw earlier this year in the U.K. Brexit vote.\u201dHe told employees he couldn\u2019t predict whether the outcome of Mr. Trump\u2019s election would be \u201cgood or bad in the long run\u201d but that Goldman Sachs would need to \u201ccontingency plan for all scenarios,\u201d according to a transcript of the voice mail reviewed by The New York Times.In his voice mail, Mr. Blankfein also addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic words that at times during his campaign had racist, sexist and xenophobic undertones.\u2014 MICHAEL CORKERY and ALEXANDRA STEVENSONAs the boards of CBS and Viacom weigh re-merging, the scion of the family that controls both companies believes that, in the media business, bigger is better.Shari Redstone, whose family\u2019s corporate vehicle controls the voting power at both CBS and Viacom, argued that now more than ever, the companies that produce content need to get larger to negotiate against distributors like Comcast and AT&T.The matter is becoming more acute after huge acquisitions by some of the biggest television providers in the country, including AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner. (Ms. Redstone said on stage that she believed the deal made sense.)Ms. Redstone and her father have pushed both CBS and Viacom to weigh a reunion, putting together businesses that have been apart for a decade. Since then, CBS has thrived while Viacom \u2014 home to Paramount, MTV and Comedy Central \u2014 has struggled.\u201cScale matters because it is going to give us leverage,\u201d Ms. Redstone said, \u201cand we are going to need leverage with some partners.\u201dAt the moment, special committees at both CBS and Viacom are weighing the merger option. Though media investors and analysts believe that the two companies will go forward, DealBook\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Ms. Redstone if it was possible that the two could stay independent and thrive.\u201cThey are two strong companies, and they both will survive,\u201d Ms. Redstone said. Referring to the presidential election, she added, \u201cEverything is possible \u2014 we just saw that this week.\u201d\u2014 MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and EMILY STEELThe day after Donald J. Trump was elected, traffic to HealthCare.gov surged.More than 100,000 people signed up for coverage on Wednesday, often with federally funded subsidies, through the health care law that Mr. Trump and his party have vowed to repeal, according to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services.Ms. Burwell stuck to a sunny set of talking points on Thursday, emphasizing the changes the law has brought about \u2014 such as guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing health problems \u2014 and how unpopular undoing some of them would be.\u201cWhen the conversation comes to the point of reality, I think it\u2019s going to be a very different conversation,\u201d Ms. Burwell said.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has cast a shadow over the health care marketplace\u2019s open enrollment period, which began Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31.\u201cI\u2019m already starting to get the calls where people are fearful about what is going to happen,\u201d said Bernard J. Tyson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente. \u201cThe questions are now coming: Should I renew? What does this mean? Am I going to get kicked out of Kaiser Permanente after Jan. 20?\u201d(The answer is no. Any 2017 marketplace health insurance plan that a customer signs up for during open enrollment will remain in force for the year.)But both Ms. Burwell and Mr. Tyson see opportunities for reform where, they hope, bipartisan forces can align, especially around shifting the health care industry\u2019s business model away from high-volume, fee-for-service transactions and toward paying for higher-quality outcomes.Kaiser Permanente is succeeding in its initiatives to move more care out of expensive settings like hospitals and into places like patients\u2019 homes, Mr. Tyson said. Half of its 100 million physician visits last year were done virtually, through tools like videoconferencing and smartphones.\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up, in the 21st century, with the home operating as a medical center,\u201d he said. Wearing a Jawbone fitness tracker, he also predicted that wearables would increasingly become medical devices \u2014 a technological change that could usher in significant advances in preventive care.\u201cI got a picture this morning of a swastika,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, Thursday morning.Mr. Schultz, an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton, said he had seen some disturbing things happening in America recently. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand,\u201d he said.Mr. Schultz said that he felt that much of the country and the world were in a state of shock and disbelief about the outcome of the election, but added that Donald J. Trump\u2019s win was likely the result of years and years of many people in America feeling that no one was listening to them.In September, after Mr. Schultz endorsed Mrs. Clinton, Trump supporters called for a boycott of Starbucks. On Thursday, at a conference held by The New York Times, Andrew Ross Sorkin reminded Mr. Schultz that Mr. Trump had once said that one of the most successful Starbucks cafes was located in Trump Tower.\u201cNot true,\u201d he shot back.Starbucks has been involved in political activism for years. In September 2013, the company asked customers to leave firearms behind when they were in its stores or using its outdoor seating \u2014 a policy change that was made days after a shooting spree at the Washington Navy Yard that left 13 people, including the gunman, dead.And over the summer, Starbucks garnered media attention as customers ordered drinks under \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d rather than their names, so that baristas would shout out the phrase when a drink order was ready.At the conference on Thursday, Mr. Schultz defended Starbucks\u2019s role in activism.\u201cShould we hide behind and not take advantage of the platform we have?\u201d he asked.But when asked whether he would run for political office, Mr. Schultz refused to say yes or no.\u201cI don\u2019t think today\u2019s the day to answer that question,\u201d he said.And, upon being asked whether he would accept a position in the Trump administration (on the off-chance that it were offered to him), Mr. Schultz replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me.\u201d\u2014 DANIELLE IVORYRichard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, may not have predicted the outcome of the presidential election correctly, he admitted on Thursday \u2014 but he remains convinced that combining his parent company, Time Warner, with AT&T remains the right move.One of the main reasons the $85 billion combination makes sense, he contended, was that it would yield even better data on viewers, which HBO could then use to do a better job of figuring out what those subscribers want to watch. Nearly half of HBO subscribers watch only movies available on the service, and if AT&T is better able to figure out what those people like to watch, HBO can then do better at serving up the content that would keep them watching.What the data won\u2019t be used for, he said, is to dictate the kinds of shows that will be made.\u201cThe more we get, the more we learn, the more we can micro-target,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cNo one is telling a writer, \u2018Write this based on the data.\u2019\u201dHis counterpart on stage and the chief executive of the cable operator Charter Communications, Thomas M. Rutledge, was more circumspect about the deal. Charter \u2014 which struck its own megadeal by buying Time Warner Cable \u2014 spends about $10 billion a year on content already, which Mr. Rutledge says accounts for much of the expense of cable packages.So putting Time Warner under the aegis of AT&T and potentially charging even more for HBO, CNN and other Time Warner properties remains a concern.\u201cIs there a box of tissues here?\u201d Indra Nooyi said with a smile.Ms. Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo and a Hillary Clinton supporter, had just been asked how she was feeling after the election.She offered her congratulations to President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2014 but then professed a deep sadness and sense of disappointment about the outcome.\u201cI had to answer a lot of questions, from my daughters, from my employees \u2014 they were all in mourning,\u201d she said. \u201cOur employees are all crying and the question that they are asking, especially those that are not white: \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 Women are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 L.G.B.T. people are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 I never thought I\u2019d have had to answer those questions.\u201dAsked about the coarseness of the language used during the election as well as the domestic violence issues confronting the National Football League, which Pepsi sponsors, she said: \u201cForget the Pepsi brand \u2014 how dare we talk about women that way? Why do we talk that way about a whole group of citizens?\u201dShe said she did not think there was a place for a type of language that has sometimes been dismissed as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d \u201cNot in locker rooms, not in football players\u2019 homes, not in any place.\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t nip it in the bud,\u201d Ms. Nooyi added, \u201cthis is going to be a lethal force that takes over society.\u201d\u201cIt has got to stop,\u201d she said \u2014 at which point the auditorium, packed with business leaders, academics and others, erupted into applause.Ms. Nooyi emphasized the need to offer reassurances, as a nation, to women, racial minorities and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.When Aetna ran through post-election expectations, the idea that Donald J. Trump would win the presidency and that Republicans would control both chambers of Congress seemed so implausible that it was not even in play.\u201cWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday \u2014 we had no idea how to approach it,\u201d Mark T. Bertolini, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said Thursday morning at the DealBook conference. \u201cWhat we would have spent months doing if we thought it was even remotely possible, we had to do in a day.\u201dSo what happens now? Mr. Bertolini said he assumed that the Affordable Care Act, the landmark bill that reshaped the health care market, would be repealed but perhaps some parts would survive.In particular, he named three changes mandated by the law that he thinks will endure: allowing young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance policies until they turn 26, the expansion of Medicaid to cover many low-income people and \u201cguaranteed issue,\u201d the rule that requires insurers to offer policies to all applicants, regardless of their health conditions.\u201cI think those are all very important positions that we need to continue,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said.But other provisions are very likely dead, Mr. Bertolini forecast, including the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost plans that was scheduled to take effect in 2020. What happens to premiums in 2018 and beyond is also an open question, he said.The National Football League is considering ways to shorten games, including cutting some advertising from broadcasts, to keep the action moving, says Roger Goodell, the league\u2019s commissioner.Responding to shifts in the way fans watch games, the league is looking at whether games should be shorter, including reducing the amount of time spent not playing and speeding up instant replay reviews, to \u201ckeep our games exciting.\u201dFans often complain about the games being too long and frequently express annoyance at the number of commercial breaks and referee video reviews.The league has been plagued with declining ratings this season as fans find nontraditional ways to view games, including online. At Thursday\u2019s DealBook conference, Mr. Goodell said ratings wax and wane in cycles, but he acknowledged that there had been fundamental shifts in the way people use media. The league\u2019s response is to make sure fans are engaged no matter how they see the games.Most public figures should assume that information about them will be leaked. At least, that\u2019s what Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, thinks.Mr. Schmidt, whose emails with members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign were stolen and recently published online by WikiLeaks, spoke at length about the importance of tightening digital security at a conference held by The New York Times on Thursday, and said that President-elect Donald J. Trump should create a division within the federal government that spends its time auditing the security of its systems.\u201cWe live online now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you grab someone\u2019s smartphone, it\u2019s equal or worse than grabbing their wallet.\u201dHe said Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, once told him that, because \u201cgovernments are capable of systemic evil, which requires planning,\u201d leaking any form of activity at that level would prevent government from getting \u201ctoo far into that evil.\u201d Mr. Schmidt punctuated that story, however, by saying, \u201cThe problem, of course, with this argument, is that he appoints himself the judge of that.\u201dMr. Schmidt added that the United States government had not yet figured out how to deter digital attacks from other countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mergers Could Help European Investment Banks Compete With U.S.", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsCredit Suisse\u2019s chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, is clearly frustrated with the investment banking operations of the institution he oversees.And with good reason: Wall Street banks seem to have won most of the battle for supremacy over who gets most of the fees that the world\u2019s biggest corporations and investment managers pay to bankers and traders.At the same time, the cost of maintaining the Swiss bank\u2019s business of financing companies, advising them on mergers and making markets in a bewildering array of stocks, bonds and other instruments remains high. And regulators keep demanding that banks put up more capital against these activities.It is easy to see where this deliberation might lead. If they cannot make it on their own, Mr. Thiam and others may conclude that they should join forces to take on their American competitors.The idea of merging investment banks may sound so last century and more than a little stupid. After all, Credit Suisse paid $11.5 billion for the New York investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, only to see the firm\u2019s rainmakers depart and their combined market share fail to materialize. It later wrote off the value of the acquisition.But many of the European banks that bulked up over the last few decades on Wall Street now stand at an existential crossroads. They are gazing at a future in which these businesses, even if they are able to make a profit, will probably struggle to cover their costs of capital in the foreseeable future. This puts them at a competitive disadvantage in wooing clients and retaining talent relative to the American companies. It\u2019s an ugly cycle.Look at where the non-American banks stand in the industry league tables compiled by Thomson Reuters. Although not necessarily a reflection of profitability, it\u2019s generally accepted that the industry\u2019s high fixed costs mean scale allows a greater proportion of the fees to drop to the bottom line. Not one company with headquarters outside Manhattan ranks in the top three advising globally on mergers and acquisitions, underwriting debt and equity or arranging big syndicated loans so far this year.Credit Suisse\u2019s best showing is as the sixth-ranked adviser in mergers and acquisitions, just ahead of Barclays. Deutsche came in 10th in mergers and seventh on debt, equity and loans. Barclays managed the fourth spot in debt, just ahead of HSBC. All of this although Credit Suisse bought DLJ and First Boston before that, Deutsche Bank spent $9 billion on Bankers Trust back in 1999 and Barclays picked up the American carcass of Lehman Brothers after the financial crisis for a bargain $1.8 billion.As the head of one United States bank told me last week: \u201cIt\u2019s over \u2014 the Americans won.\u201d The top slots in the rankings for core investment banking products are all held by some combination of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The picture is broadly similar in the arenas of stock and bond market trading.Maintaining these subscale franchises is expensive. Credit Suisse squeezed out a profit before tax of 73 million Swiss francs ($74.1 million) in its investment banking and capital markets arm in the first half of the year, on 931 million francs of net revenue. Its global markets division lost 44 million francs on pretax income of 2.9 billion francs. These two divisions accounted for about 40 percent of the bank\u2019s core risk-weighted assets. By comparison, Credit Suisse\u2019s international wealth management, Asia Pacific and Swiss banking arms made a combined 1.9 billion francs on 6.8 billion of net revenue.One way to be more efficient would be for Deutsche and Credit Suisse to crunch their United States businesses together. They would also get bigger scale. If the banks were able to maintain their respective market share positions under one roof, they would vault up the rankings. A Credit Suisse-Deutsche Bank duo, for instance, would have challenged JPMorgan as the leading underwriter of global equity and equity-linked securities, raising $47 billion for clients, year to date. And it might figure as a top five merger adviser.Merging would undoubtedly be messy. Conflicts of interest would make it hard for the combined group to keep all its clients. The best employees might leave. Regulators, too, might balk at the idea of big balance sheets getting bigger. A merger of Credit Suisse and Deutsche\u2019s United States holding companies would potentially create a $700 billion institution.Winning approval for such a deal would take finesse from the banks involved. The Federal Reserve would need to be persuaded that one better managed, more profitable and less risky institution was preferable to two weak subsidiaries.Analysts at Macquarie Research pointed out last week that \u201cDeutsche Bank has the largest U.S. balance sheet of European peers and is also the most weakly capitalized of peers. This must be an uncomfortable position for U.S. regulators.\u201dOver time, their parents in Switzerland and Germany could eventually spin off all or part of the combined enterprise to investors, reducing their exposure. But a successful combination \u2014 call it First Boston Bankers Trust \u2014 might even attract other banks facing a similar future of death by a thousand cuts.Who knows? One day, maybe Lehman Brothers and Dillon, Read & Company could join the reunion, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Election Night Live Coverage", "Date": "2016-11-08", "News": "Good evening, everyone! Election night is finally upon us, and we\u2019re excited for one more big chat.We\u2019ve got our usual team in place live from The New  York Times newsroom, and exit polls are starting to trickle out.Well, Alan, here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s one more big chat. I still remember being in Florida in December of 2000.Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves! Speaking of Florida, polls close there at 7 p.m. Eastern time. All eyes are on that state.Polls in Georgia, part of Indiana, the western half of Kentucky, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia all close at that time, too.An hour-by-hour look at when states finish voting.The New York TimesThat represents 64 electoral votes right there.Our first batch of exit polls shows some positive signs for Hillary Clinton nationally.More than half of  voters said that Clinton has the temperament to serve effectively as president. Only about a third said Donald J. Trump does.Clinton also gets higher marks when it comes to honesty.But it\u2019s still very early. Polls on the West Coast don\u2019t close for more than five hours. We have a long night ahead.Good evening, guys.Alan, I\u2019ll be Adam\u2019s spokeswoman for the time being.It\u2019s surreal that this is our final chat of the election.Because both Trump and Clinton are viewed negatively by a majority of Americans, as one poll after another has shown, I\u2019m not sure how much we learn from discrete subsets about issues like temperament or honesty.Demographics might end up being the bigger story, Maggie, and they are looking favorable to Clinton right now.My eye is going to be on Florida, just as it always is in an open-seat presidential race.Without Florida, Trump has no path.The new exit polls that just came out show turnout in Florida is running high among nonwhite and urban voters.Another state to keep our eyes on tonight, Alan, is Michigan.There was clearly movement there that Democrats were seeing.Trump\u2019s campaign has said privately that they think they may snatch a win there.Hey, Alan. I have to say one thing: I have learned not to put too much faith in the first wave of exit polls. I can remember doing some serious rewriting on deadline after the second wave came in.They sent President Obama into Michigan over the weekend, right? There\u2019s no early voting there, which is why you\u2019d want him there at the end of the campaign.What I\u2019m struck by from these early polls \u2014 I guess we shouldn\u2019t be shocked \u2014 is just how much Americans do not seem to like these two candidates. And, relatively, how much they like Obama.Adam, your point about Obama being popular is dead on. He became more popular amid this toxic race.Obama was in Michigan the last day of campaigning, on Monday.This is just in from our colleague Amy Chozick, our Clinton beat reporter. Clinton is headed to the Peninsula hotel in New York right now to watch the results come in.She\u2019s planning to stay in the penthouse suite there if she wins tonight.Alan, the thing I\u2019m going to be watching closer than anything else is whether the final results confirm what some people were seeing early on: That there is a big increase in the Latino vote. If that happens, and if Clinton wins, that is going to be a big political legacy of this election.Hey, everyone! It\u2019s amazing that this is finally about to be over. Maggie, I agree about the importance of Florida. The good news is that we might know a lot there pretty quickly: They could have half of the vote counted by 8 p.m., when the polls close statewide.Nate, you are saying that we could end up being done and out the door at 8 p.m.!I doubt that they\u2019ll be able to project the results of the state at that point. But I do think we\u2019ll have a very good idea about whether there is a favorite to win the state, and therefore the election.We won\u2019t be making any calls with our live model: It generally takes a 99.9 percent certainty of victory before the networks or The Associated Press make a projection. But we\u2019ll know whether a candidate is likely to win long before it\u2019s 99 percent sure.The polls are closing in the eastern part of Kentucky and most of Indiana, so we might start to get some results trickling in very soon. Obviously, Trump is a big favorite in both states. But it will be interesting to see whether he can post some big gains in white, rural areas. It might offer some clues about how similar areas in other states might vote.Nate, were you watching Votecastr today? That is the service that had, at least in theory, real-time projections of how the vote was going in some key states. For those who missed it, Nate had a very interesting piece today raising questions about this very trailblazing effort. How did they do? In a first, results will be estimated before the polls close. It\u2019s hard for even pros to do, and very easy for readers to get the wrong impression.The New York TimesI think they had some technical difficulties, but I don\u2019t think they ever put out any outrageous results. We\u2019ll find out how close they were when we get actual results.I\u2019m also interested in what kind of traffic they got. On Election Day, I am constantly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Who is winning?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cUm, you know, people are voting.\u201dWhile we wait for more exit polls and results, it\u2019s a good time to point out some of the great stories that we\u2019ve had today.One that stood out is the surge in visitors to the grave sites of female suffragists. Our colleague Sarah Maslin Nir has some really powerful video of people visiting Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave today. Since dawn the people have poured in to visit suffragist Susan B Anthony\u2019s grave and thank her. It\u2019s dark now,and it\u2019s nowhere near stopping https://t.co/5McDEszKncWe\u2019re now starting to get some absentee vote results from rural Kentucky, and they show Trump up by a 78 to 20 percent lead. That might seem like a huge number, but it\u2019s not astonishing: These are some of the most reliable Republicans in the country.Needless to say, there has been a lot of attention paid to the Hispanic turnout. The exit polls from Florida and Nevada shed some light on how that group is likely to vote.Latino voters in those states expressed broadly positive views of Clinton and President Obama. Trump gets negative marks from about 70 percent of these voters.It looks like Trump is off to an early lead in New Hampshire, a state that is close to his heart. He won his first primary there. Extremely early totals also show him up a bit in Indiana, the home state of Gov. Mike Pence. But again, extremely early.Indiana going to Trump would not be a surprise. New Hampshire was really fought.Maggie, where is Trump right now? Are they hunkered down in the Tower?Alan, they\u2019re at Trump Tower in Manhattan.Any word on the mood there? Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, was just on television and did not appear to be in the best of spirits.The mood this morning was my favorite euphemism: \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201dRealistically, most of his advisers know that Trump is facing an uphill battle. I did just get a message from one adviser saying, \u201cNot looking great.\u201dWhich tells you the mood.Trump did not seem overconfident today in some of the interviews that I heard. There was a lot of talk about rigged votes and whether he would concede if he loses.I did not get the sense he was going to go gently into that good night.The lawsuit filed in Nevada seemed to be a clear signal that they are ready to fight.For those who are just catching up, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Nevada because some polling places stayed open late to let people who were in line vote.Voting issues \u2014 long lines, malfunctioning machines and more \u2014 were reported nationwide: Voting problems amounted to malfunctioning machines, long lines and mix-ups over voter ID laws here and there, but no major disruptions anywhere so far.The New York TimesThe judge in Clark County did not appear to be sympathetic.Alan, I\u2019m not sure how much Trump\u2019s decision here was to fight as it was to de-legitimize the ultimate outcome.I\u2019ve now heard from several people inside the Trump orbit whose moods have dipped.One thing I\u2019ve learned this year: Never try to predict what Trump will do.Regarding Indiana, I\u2019m not particularly interested in the results of the presidential race there, but the Senate race \u2014 where Evan Bayh, a former Democratic senator, is trying to come back \u2014 is pretty fascinating.Republicans and Democrats are battling fiercely for control of the Senate. Here are 10 pivotal races that we\u2019re watching.The New York TimesWe are in New York City tonight, and it was interesting today to see all of these voting sites with huge lines. That is the definition of a symbolic vote \u2014 New York State is, of course, not in play. But if Trump loses by a lot here, in the city he calls home, that is certainly worthy of note.Adam, I agree about New York\u2019s margin.There was a lot of anecdotal evidence of heavy turnout in Manhattan.Adam, two Twitter posts went viral today about Trump voting at his polling place. In one, he was booed lustily outside. In the other, he was openly laughed at by people waiting in line to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna lose!\u201d one man yelled at him.I just got some interesting stats from Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, the group that runs the national election protection hotline.They\u2019ve received more than 30,000 calls today.Interestingly,  they said they are  seeing voter suppression in the form of misinformation throughout Florida.Apparently people are telling some voters that they have to be registered with a certain party to vote at certain polling locations.I\u2019ll tell you something else I\u2019ll be looking at: The Comey impact. The Clinton camp was looking to expand the map this time \u2014 Arizona, Georgia and super-long-shot Texas. If she falls short there, you have to wonder if the past week of dealing with the F.B.I. announcement on email was why.That\u2019s a good point. It\u2019s been hard to tell from the polling how much that damaged her.It was all too compressed timewise. But also, the idea that she was put on the defensive when she could have been on the offensive in the final week is a big deal.We\u2019re about to get our first wave of poll closings at 7 p.m. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether there\u2019s an early call in Virginia for Clinton.Hey, guys, it\u2019s 7 p.m. Do you know where your voters are?Nate, do the quick calls that we often got during the primaries tend to take longer in the general because of more voters?While we haven\u2019t called anything, CNN projects Trump wins Kentucky and Indiana.Not a shock on either. For readers out there, just to stress, this is a CNN projection, not a New York Times projection.And neither is a surprise; they are both Republican-leaning states in presidential years.O.K., The New York Times has called Kentucky and Indiana for Trump and Vermont for Clinton. Folks, I\u2019ve spent the past few hours putting together a story for tomorrow on our fractured country. I have news to report: We are a fractured country.You\u2019ve discussed some of the 10,000-foot findings tonight, from the polls, but it is fascinating (and disheartening) to hear and see examples of it up close.In talking to voters today, our crack team of reporters around the country found a nation at the end of its rope \u2014 paranoid and distrustful. Two countries, really, hostile and disenchanted with each other.I am just old enough to remember covering the 2000 election, which gave us the idea of \u201cred vs. blue America\u201d \u2014 really a fluke of election map color coding by television networks. The country seemed divided then, even coming off of a huge economic expansion.But man, oh man, does it seem worse now.Nick, last October or November, NBC reported a striking statistic from its polling, which was that of eight candidates they polled \u2014 two Democrats and six Republicans \u2014 almost all were viewed negatively by the electorate.It was a first in their polling, they said at the time.And it really portended what was to come.I did a story in 2014 about how \u201c40 is the new 50,\u201d meaning that a number of people running in the midterm elections that year had negative favorability ratings and got elected in spite of it.It was another portent of this cycle, which has been just toxic.The electorate is angry and distrustful of a number of institutions.Whoever goes into the White House will face a daunting situation.It\u2019s looking neck and neck in Virginia, which would be a big one for Trump to carry.If that\u2019s right on Virginia, that would be huge \u2014 given the recent shift of the state and who the VEEP is.So far, the early results are comporting with expectations: Trump is running ahead of Mitt Romney in white, rural areas, whether in Kentucky and Indiana or northern Florida. But he\u2019s not running further ahead of what we expected based on the polls.Alan, most of the vote in Virginia is from Chesterfield County \u2014 a conservative suburb outside Richmond. Clinton\u2019s narrowly ahead there, which would be extremely impressive if it held (the count is still very early).Polls are closing shortly in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.The early vote is coming in fast in Florida, and, I hate to keep saying it, but these are basically the numbers we expected. Clinton is posting impressive margins in Orlando and Jacksonville. Trump will need a solid Election Day.We have Ashley Parker at the New York Hilton Midtown, where his party is.I haven\u2019t heard from her in a bit, but based on Twitter, there seems to be a Trump-shaped cake.I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s not holding it at Trump Tower.Where it all began.As well as two of the signature red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats.The Times called West Virginia for Trump. No shock.Trump has been good to the miners.Is it possible that Trump didn\u2019t want to do the event at Trump Tower because if he loses, he doesn\u2019t want a loss delivered there? B.F.T.B. (bad for the brand).The Times just called Rob Portman (a Republican) re-elected in Ohio. Democrats once had high hopes there, but that faded.I just got a little dispatch from our colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, who has been in Pennsylvania all day.In low-income, African-American communities in Philadelphia, she said that people were coming to the polls in a steady stream to vote for Clinton.They weren\u2019t all enthusiastic about her, she reports, but a fierce desire to keep Mr. Trump out of office united them.\nSheryl also stopped by the local Republican headquarters, which she described \u201cperhaps the loneliest place in Philadelphia.\u201dThat Clinton won only about 20 percent of the vote in the heart of eastern Kentucky and western Virginia coal country is a striking change from when Bill Clinton dominated those areas in 1992 and 1996.Election results from the Kentucky caucus, part of the 2016 presidential campaign.The New York TimesTed Strickland just put out a statement saying that he has conceded to Rob Portman in the Ohio Senate race.Adam, to your question, I do think that may be part of the logic on the hotel choice by Trump. The reason, one aide told me, was that Trump is superstitious.Rand Paul has also won in Kentucky, retaining his seat.No call so far for Marco Rubio in Florida, but that remains one of the most interesting Senate races in the country.After he dropped out of the presidential race, he said he was done with politics, but then he changed his mind.MSNBC just called South Carolina for Trump. We have not yet called it.The urban-rural split that\u2019s emerging so far is very striking: Trump is running well ahead of Romney for voters in basically every non-metropolitan county. Clinton is running ahead of Obama in metropolitan areas.Nate, any indications on Hispanic or African-American turnout so far compared with 2012?I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve learned much so far, Alan. We won\u2019t know until we start getting some completed vote counts. That said, the early vote indicated that Hispanic turnout was way up and black turnout was a little down. The former is all but locked in, the latter could change on Election Day.Nate, was black turnout down in multiple places or primarily in North Carolina?Lots of polls close at 8 p.m., and 292 electoral votes are at stake. Buckle up.An hour-by-hour look at when states finish voting.The New York TimesSo, I promised we\u2019d know a lot about Florida by 8 p.m., and Clinton is up by three points right now with about 6.5 million votes counted (we\u2019re expecting around 9.5 million). She\u2019s not expected to do quite as well in the early vote as in the Election Day vote, and a lot of the Panhandle is left. But this is enough to make Clinton a slight favorite.Here\u2019s our best guess in Florida right now:Here\u2019s our best guess in Florida right now.  Heads-up: Forecasts may be volatile early in the night. These numbers will become more trustworthy once more votes have been counted. Hello there! These dials will spring to life around 7:15 PM ET. Our best guess is that is on track to win in Florida.The New York TimesFlorida remains too close to call. Our colleague Frances Robles, who is on the ground there, points out that Duval County, home to the city of Jacksonville, is deadlocked.She says that this is particularly bad for Trump because has to take the northern Florida counties in big numbers to offset those huge numbers in south Florida.I have to say that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite how this will play out. Trump isn\u2019t hitting traditional Republican targets in Duval, but he\u2019s making up for it with big wins in places like Daytona Beach.The New York Times just called the Senate for Rubio in Florida. Let the 2020 talk begin.Mr. Rubio jumped back into the race for his Senate seat after withdrawing from the presidential contest.The New York TimesWell, Alan, I think we have to get through tonight first. This is a close race in Florida, where I think Clinton was thought to have a bit of a larger edge than this.Trump is doing what he hoped to do among rural white voters in the South. I have to say that I didn\u2019t think there was much room to outdo Romney there, but he\u2019s really making big inroads in rural Virginia and Florida.This year, Democrats have an advantage of just 88,000 early and absentee votes, suggesting an even closer race.Florida, Florida, FloridaWe\u2019re getting some reporting from Ashley Parker, our Trump reporter who is at his election party at the Hilton.Ashley says that the crowd at Trump\u2019s election night party is thin, but starting to slowly fill in in front of the stage.Trump\u2019s supporters are clad in dark suits, with the occasional \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap gliding through the crowd, she reports.We don\u2019t have much yet from Pennsylvania or Michigan, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that we might not know the results for a long time. Florida and North Carolina won\u2019t be called anytime soon.Exit polls are suggesting that Ohio, which also closed before 8 p.m., could be closer than expected because of a rush of late-deciding voters fleeing Trump.He was looking solid there in a lot of late polls.That\u2019s true Adam, but the results so far indicate that Trump is doing very well among white rural voters. Those voters are plentiful in the Northern states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.And Clinton was pretty confident of winning Pennsylvania and Michigan.The Times: Trump wins South Carolina and Alabama.The Times has called Evan Bayh, the Democrat, losing to Todd Young in Indiana\u2019s Senate race.Bayh is a former senator and was seen as an opportunity to claim an open Senate seat that had been held by a Republican.Democrats had viewed Mr. Bayh\u2019s candidacy as a prime opportunity to claim an open Senate seat that had been held by a Republican.The New York TimesIn Florida, one interesting note from the exit polls is that Trump is leading with white voters who have college degrees.Generally he has struggled with highly educated voters nationally.This is going to be a late night, folks. Clinton is doing better in metropolitan areas than Obama had done, but not vastly better. Trump, on the other hand, is making very big gains in rural America.Nate, would you say he\u2019s outperforming his polling?I don\u2019t think that\u2019s clear yet, Alan. But I think it\u2019s quite possible.The Times calls Rhode Island for Clinton.Noteworthy tweet from Jeb Bush Jr.:Ok so what\u2019s the Over/Under for The Donald saying or announcing Trump Tv durning his speech tonight? #ElectionDay #Election2016I think it\u2019s worth pointing out that Gary Johnson is currently pulling 2.2 percent of the vote in Florida, which in a close race could be the difference.Hey, Nate, at this point, what states would you expect to go really late? Florida? Virginia? Ohio? North Carolina?As I recall, in 2008, it was pretty clear by 9 p.m. that Obama was going to win, and we called it officially around 11 p.m. There were no seesawers.The Upshot forecast currently gives Clinton a 74 percent chance of winning, with Trump at 26 percent. The gap has been narrowing. Heads-up: Forecasts may be volatile early in the night. These numbers will become more trustworthy once more votes have been counted. Hello there! These dials will spring to life around 7:15 PM. Our best guess right now is that is on track to win.The New York TimesIt\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t going to be decided for quite some time. The counts in Michigan and Pennsylvania are usually very slow, and I think it is clear that Clinton will not win either by the sort of wide margins necessary to generate an early call. North Carolina and Florida will be extremely close, even if Clinton squeaks out a win.Even if Clinton manages to take this election, I think it will be a real wake-up call to the Democratic Party about how dependent they\u2019ve been on the support of white working-class voters who simply aren\u2019t at the heart of the party\u2019s message.A big wave of polls are closing momentarily. New York, Minnesota, the western half of South Dakota, Nebraska, the southwestern corner of North Dakota, the northwestern corner of Michigan, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Wisconsin and Wyoming.I spoke to some Democrats before the election who were confident of her winning. They said that you need those voters to govern but not necessarily to win; the unstated calculus is the increasing numbers of Latino and African-American voters. The results so far suggests that is not necessarily true.That those Democrats believe that is at the heart of their problem. White working-class voters made up one in three of Obama\u2019s voters in 2012.The Times reports that Clinton carries New York (shocker).For the record, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York was just re-elected.Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is poised to take over as his party\u2019s Senate leader.The New York TimesTammy Duckworth, a Democrat, just won the Senate race in Illinois.Ms. Duckworth\u2019s victory puts both Senate seats in Illinois in the control of Democrats.The New York TimesThe Times calls Texas for Trump. There was some (I thought far-fetched) speculation that this would be the year that Texas goes Democratic in presidential races.Clinton has an eight-point lead in the early vote in Jefferson County, Colo., a key suburban county around Denver. So it does appear that she\u2019s still favored there \u2014 despite her challenge elsewhere.Welcome back, Maggie.Has the mood in Trumpworld brightened in the last hour, as I would imagine?Alan, indeed. They are feeling quite buoyant right now.One aide just told me to \u201cstart saying it: \u2018President Trump.\u2019\u201dNate, do you see a way in which Clinton can overcome that vote deficit?In Florida, Maggie? Well, I think there would have to be many more votes in South Florida than we think are out there.Just to update everyone on where we stand, Trump currently has 130 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 97.Obviously it\u2019s still early.How much of this closer-than-expected night is because of the Comey announcement? I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a question many Democrats are asking.Also, our Upshot forecast now has Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the presidency at 59 percent. That\u2019s down from 85 percent.Trump\u2019s huge margins among white working-class voters have spread into the Upper Midwest \u2014 the region of the country where Democrats depend most on their support. It gives Trump a very real chance in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.The early results in Wisconsin may not be representative, but they are very good for Trump.The same thing is true in Michigan.I don\u2019t buy that, Nick. The early results there are not good for Clinton.It seems like his strategy of focusing almost entirely on white voters is working better than many strategists expected.Nate, can you refresh everyone\u2019s memory on Clinton\u2019s path if she loses Florida, North Carolina and Ohio? What are her must-wins in that case?Let\u2019s assume she loses Arizona and Iowa, as well. If that\u2019s true, then she would need Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and either New Hampshire or Nevada.Explore the paths to victory available for the presidential candidates.The New York TimesAshley Parker, our reporter in at the Trump party in Manhattan, says that the mood there brightened around 9 p.m.She says the ranks of Trump supporters thickened and their energy has improved. Supporters are gazing up at the two large television screens broadcasting Fox News, and are cheering each new state announced for Trump.Trump is now favored in our forecast.How about that.CNN is reporting that the Republicans have officially locked up control of the House of Representatives.Alan, that\u2019s less of a surprise than almost anything else tonight.A few things to consider here, as we go along.This race is extremely close right now, obviously.If Trump wins, it will be the upset of the last 50 years.Some say it would be bigger than the Cubs winning the World Series.If Clinton wins, it will be an eked-out victory, meaning that Trump will remain on the scene for potentially a long time.Many people are saying, Alan.But I think it\u2019s going to be hard to grasp how fractured this country is going to be.One way to think about this election: Less-educated white voters just decided to block vote like a minority group. They represent 40 percent of the electorate, so that\u2019s enough.That\u2019s well put, Nate.Fox News is now projecting that Virginia will go for Clinton.Some relief there for Clinton supporters, if it holds up. But she has a long way to go to the White House.Closing momentarily are Iowa, most of Idaho, Utah, Nevada and Montana.There is obviously a huge disconnect between different parts of the country \u2014 it is a gap of race, of class, of opportunity and of power.The dizzying shift tonight \u2014 when Clinton was so heavily favored going in and now is favored to lose \u2014 hints that the gap is not merely demographic, but informational.One other point: Trump has made clear that he is ready to call the race \u201crigged\u201d depending on the outcome.If she wins and remains this close, Trump seems unlikely to cede defeat.It\u2019s worth noting that we still have Clinton as a pretty clear favorite to win the popular vote.Trump is up by only 1.9 points in the popular vote right now, and that\u2019s without anything from the West Coast or many urban centers out East.So one of two things \u2014 or both \u2014 has happened in this race.Fox is reporting that Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, will beat Deborah Ross in their Senate race.Alan, if Burr beats Ross, then Trump should win North Carolina.Here\u2019s how we see it right now: Clinton is a pretty clear favorite in Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. She\u2019s probably a favorite in Maine, as well.\nThen Clinton would need all of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All three are true toss-ups.Back to the two things that happened.The modeling by the Clinton team, as well as a number of public polls, was way off.And while Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, often was mocked for talking about a \u201chidden Trump vote,\u201d at the moment, there seems to be signs of that.At this rate, Wednesday could be a very ugly day for the financial markets. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures plunged by as much as 600 points.Something to watch: Trump is up just .5 percent in the early vote in Arizona. Democrats generally do better on Election Day. Maybe that won\u2019t be true this time, but it\u2019s worth watching.The Times is also calling the North Carolina Senate race for Burr.Senator Burr, a Republican, held off a challenge from Deborah Ross, a Democratic former state director of the American Civil Liberties Union.The New York TimesYes, just one of the three.So, at this point, Trump has an easier road to the White House than Clinton does.Absolutely.Folks, I am just struck by all the machinery of politics in which Clinton appeared to have an advantage in this election. She had more money, a big \u201csuper PAC.\u201d Way more advertising. A sophisticated data operation built on the successful experience of the Obama campaign. And none of those things seem to have made the difference.Even if she does win, Trump will have gone incredibly far without any of them.Plus a huge advantage of endorsements \u2014 including from every major newspaper\u2019s editorial board in the country (that and 25 cents \u2026).Trump is going to owe no one a thing, if he wins.And he will be acutely aware of it.There are fewer than 10 people who endorsed him and stayed with him unequivocally.There\u2019s a minor talk-radio personality who got a lot of mockery for tweeting recently that Trump\u2019s \u201cgroundgame is in our hearts.\u201dIt turns out he was on to something.Michael Moore, the liberal moviemaker who hails from Michigan, has been warning about this for months.CNN projects Trump takes Ohio.Earlier tonight I moderated a Times panel that included Peter Wehner, the former Bush speechwriter.He was an early critic of Trump, and he was vocal that he wanted to see Trump dealt a punishing blow in the race.Without that, he said, Trump would remain on the stage with tens of millions of people having backed him.What we are seeing now is either a Trump win or Trump in near-perpetuity.Just another note on the markets: We\u2019re seeing drop in the dollar, a big drop in the value of the peso and a rally in U.S. Treasury bonds \u2014 all signs of jittery investors.Stocks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and other major markets were down as much as 2 percent, and Wall Street futures indicated a looming sell-off of about 2.5 percent.The New York TimesFox just called Colorado for Clinton.Clinton has not won a state yet that she was not expected to win, right? As opposed to Trump.Right.For what it\u2019s worth, nobody has called Florida yet.Right. Politico just called Virginia for Clinton.Maggie, when this campaign was getting started, before Trump got in, you and I wrote a piece about how much the Democrats had riding on Clinton. We wrote about how the apparent dominance of Democrats at the electoral college level had concealed extraordinary weaknesses in Congress and in state and local government, where Republicans hold sway.And we noted that the Democrats had no backup plan, no farm team.They bet it all on Clinton.Right, Nick. Brexit.It feels like we are at a historic turning point not only for our country, but what was once called Western Civilization. In Europe and the United States, we are now seeing a high tide of populist nationalism, rallying disaffected white people who are angry and opposed to the multicultural societies these countries have been becoming.Adam, I think we have to discuss the obvious, but often obscured, truth that elections are about power. Who has it and who will have it.The New York Times has just called Ohio for Trump.There are millions of voters who saw their power and prestige in American culture and politics in decline, and they reacted strongly when they found a candidate who expressed what they were feeling.Trump just spoke briefly with one of our colleagues, and appears to be in a good mood. He did, however, take time to divert from the brief discussion to ask the colleague to relay his deep displeasure with a story that four of us wrote in Monday\u2019s paper about the final days of his campaign.Among other things, he insisted he did not cede his Twitter account.One has to wonder how Bernie Sanders is feeling right now and if he would be faring much differently.Fox calls North Carolina for Trump.Sanders probably could have wrested away some union households.One of the things that was striking to me was that in a recent Ohio poll, Clinton was running well behind how Obama ran with union households in 2012.Union officials privately acknowledge seeing a drop-off that worried them in the last few days among a number of subsets.Our colleague Jason Horowitz is reporting chants of \u201clock her up\u201d at Trump\u2019s new hotel in Washington.Cheering and calls of Lock Her Up at Trump\u2019s DC hotel as NC is called for Trump https://t.co/awE2pz6fWLThe reality here is that we\u2019ve spoken a lot more about race than we have about women and reactions about a female president.Hillary Clinton is not a tabula rasa \u2014 people have very hardened, polarized views of her.That having been said, the amount of open misogyny during this campaign has been really striking, from a lot of Trump\u2019s supporters.We are also going to hear a lot about the successes and failures of data and analytics.Florida goes for Trump, according to The Associated Press. This state has not been called by The Times.Politico just called Florida for Trump. I don\u2019t think it is going out on a limb here.An update from Ashley Parker at Trump headquarters: \u201cThe crowd erupted as Fox News called North Carolina for Mr. Trump. Someone has passed out red \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hats, and they bob and dip as supporters jump up and down.\u201dAnd yes, Adam, that seems like not a stretch.Trump didn\u2019t make any meaningful investment in data.And the Republican National Committee modeling still showed him behind in key states he\u2019s won.The challenge, Maggie, is that it\u2019s hard to tell how much of this is reaction to Mrs. Clinton \u2014 because we both know there is a lot of resentment/dislike of her \u2014 and how much of it is the reluctance of some voters to support a woman. I just do not know. Mrs. Clinton is not the best model to test this question.Now, again, that problem would not have existed had the email server never existed.No shock: CNN gives California and Hawaii to Clinton.But Comey also did something that was at odds with agency practice.John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, just retained his Senate seat in Arizona.Mr. McCain was buoyed by a deep campaign war chest and by help from the Republican establishment.The New York TimesSo, Nick, would you argue that the country is not ready to elect a woman for president (or at least is resistant to)?Definitely the latter.The Times calls Kamala Harris in the Senate race in California; she is replacing Barbara Boxer. Again, not a huge surprise.Adam, I agree with Nick\u2019s earlier point about the invective that\u2019s been used.I do remember some of the language against President George W. Bush in the 2004 re-election getting hot.The Times has called Virginia for Clinton, and North Carolina for Trump.Every couple of election cycles seems to bring a new collapse of some widely cited theory or rule of thumb. This time, it was the Democrats\u2019 supposed inherent advantage in the Electoral College.And the demographic advantage (which is related).One point to make here: Many of the Trump people are now saying they knew all along he would win. That\u2019s just not true. As we reported out the story on his final campaign week, they knew they got lucky with Comey. Even earlier this evening most of them thought he would lose.Nate, there\u2019s a ton of interest on social media about The Upshot model. Can you give a basic explanation of how we come to that 95 percent number favoring Trump and why the big swing from earlier?Before I answer that, let me start by saying that Clinton is going to get a massive margin out of California, which will make it likely that she wins the popular vote.I believe that the new conventional wisdom, if Clinton wins the popular vote but loses the presidency, will to be about the politics of nullification: That continued Republican political success in national politics depends in large part on constitutional structures or political decisions that favor them.Maggie, I was going to ask you, there was no grand plan here by the Trump campaign? My sense is they talked about the hidden white vote, but didn\u2019t really believe it.No, Adam, most of them did not.The other point to make here: Yes, Comey appears to have done Clinton real damage.In terms of our model, it\u2019s not very complicated: In Wisconsin and Michigan, Clinton is losing. There\u2019s a mix of both Republican and Democratic vote remaining: There\u2019s no obvious path to a comeback, even if it\u2019s possible. In Pennsylvania, we think there\u2019s more Republican vote left than Democratic vote. She needs to win all three states, and, honestly, she might not win any of them.Maggie, what do you think the response from the \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican coalition will be if he wins? Will they seek forgiveness or go their own way?And Adam, to your question \u2014 while Trump certainly struck a nerve within the party, the degree to which his team did not expect a win suggests a level of isolation from the country, as well.But this is a failure of modeling, polling, punditry and a number of other things.Makes you wonder, if he wins, how he is going to organize a Trump White House.One thing: If the night keeps going this way, it\u2019s good news for the Alec Baldwin \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d fans, at least for the next four years.Alan, Trump never struck me as a particularly forgiving kind of guy. The \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican coalition might have a cold four years, if he wins.Folks, one difficult question is what line Democrats now take on the Supreme Court vacancy.You can imagine the argument forming for a four-year blockade.But that\u2019s a tough line to hold.Fox called Wisconsin for Trump.Does that give Trump 270 electoral votes, Alan?And The Times calls Florida for Trump.Not yet, Adam.It\u2019s not great to kick people when they\u2019re down, but the Clinton team and their Democratic supporters ran a campaign based on a lot of assumptions.They left Wisconsin and Michigan undefended for most of the general election.Maggie, was it an irrational decision given what they knew then? I really don\u2019t know.Unless she wins Arizona or Georgia, Clinton can\u2019t get to 270 votes.I hear what you are saying, Maggie, but didn\u2019t the public polls show her in strong shape in those states? These decisions are data-based, right? It seems to me that again \u2014 again \u2014 we have seen a real collapse in public polling.Fox has called Georgia for Trump.And ABC has given Trump Iowa.Adam, they did. My point is the data-gathering was broken.Clearly.This isn\u2019t just traditional pollsters, too. The Democratic analytics world was confident.It will be fascinating to see if Democrats try to form a total blockade of Trump\u2019s agenda the way Republicans have done with Obama.Although the way Congress is shaping up, it will be hard.Nate, where do the Senate races stand?This probably rewrites the rules on how to run a campaign for president.The Republicans are favored to hold the Senate as well, Maggie.Alan, some commenters on my Twitter feed make the point that the Senate Republicans could do what their Democratic colleagues had been thinking of: invoke the nuclear option and abolish the filibuster to prevent a confirmation blockade.Hillary Clinton ran a conventional presidential campaign, one based on polling, research, get-out-the-vote operations, voter identification and spending lots of money on television advertisements. She is a politician who worked her way through the system with a long-term goal of being president, from the years when she worked on the Watergate committee, through her eight years in the Senate. Adam, Maggie and Alan, I think we ought to reflect on something that is really significant here. One part of the country is horrified and the other triumphant. So it ever was on election night. But I think this is different. I think there are residents of large cities who are looking around right now and can\u2019t believe that they live in the same country that elected Trump. I am reminded of a famous quote from the movie critic Pauline Kael, to the effect that she didn\u2019t know how Richard Nixon won because she didn\u2019t know anyone who voted for him.That is absolutely right. Every campaign I\u2019ve covered has ended with some degree of polarization. But this really feels like two completely different countries.I hate to raise this \u2014 don\u2019t yell at me \u2014 but would Bernie Sanders have done better against Trump  tonight?Ashley Parker at Trump headquarters reports that Trump supporters at his party seemed almost equally as excited by the prospect of Clinton\u2019s electoral misfortune as by the success of their own candidate.She tells us that one man asked what size prison jumpsuit Mrs. Clinton would wear, while others whispered excitedly about the prospect of actually sending the Democratic nominee to jail.And when the TV briefly switched over to show scenes from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s election night gathering, one man howled, \u201cLook at them! They\u2019re so depressed.\u201dIt\u2019s been raised already here!Oh, sorry. We are on hour nine here, right?If by nine you mean ninety, totally.So, the White House, the Senate and the House are poised to be held by Republicans.Another big loser tonight? President Obama. Fairly or not, a vote like this is to some extent \u2014 to some extent \u2014 a referendum on his legacy.I haven\u2019t checked in a while, Adam, but early on, the exit polls said that Obama had a 54 percent approval rating among voters.Never before has a president invested so much of his time, energy and prestige into the election of his successor. He specifically framed it as a way of continuing his policies and legacy. He almost made it as much about him as about her. Nothing wrong with that at all \u2014 but the next four years are going to be about dismantling, or attempting to dismantle, everything Obama did for the past eight years. I would say that even if he had a 60 percent approval rating among voters.David Duke weighs in: GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP! It\u2019s time to do the right thing, it\u2019s time to TAKE AMERICA BACK!!! #MAGA #AmericaFirst #LockHerUp #GodBlessAmericaCNBC is reporting that NASDAQ and S&P 500 have halted futures trading for the time being.When was the last time that happened?Dow futures had fallen more than 800 points.Stocks in Japan have also plunged.Politico is saying that the Democrats hold on to Harry Reid\u2019s seat in Nevada. Makes me think Clinton will win that state too; Reid wasn\u2019t going to let that one get away.I don\u2019t think anyone \u201ccalls\u201d the national popular vote, but we can say with confidence that Clinton is overwhelmingly likely to win the popular vote.Trump has now taken the lead in Pennsylvania, which means Clinton is now trailing in three must-win states: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.I\u2019m seeing a lot of these from really smart political consultants who said Clinton was going to waltz to the White House. This from David Plouffe: Never been as wrong on anything on my life. Still a beating heart in WI and the 2 CDs. But sobriety about what happened tonight is essentialThe Associated Press has called Nevada for Clinton.That leaves Clinton with a very narrow path through three states in the Rust Belt.I\u2019d note that we\u2019re not convinced Clinton will win in Minnesota, either, Nick. Although she is at least favored there, unlike Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.In other news, marijuana is now legal in California.Voters in California and Massachusetts legalized recreational use in what advocates said was a major step toward changing the country\u2019s attitude toward the drug.The New York TimesAs we\u2019ve alluded to before, the polling and political analytics industries have suffered deep blows tonight. The reaction is starting to come in.And Mike Murphy, the Republican strategist who has been vocally critical of Trump, said he has lost faith in data.I\u2019ve believed in data for 30 years in politics and data died tonight. I could not have been more wrong about this election.One bright spot for Democrats is the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada.Outside groups spent nearly $90 million on the tight race, but the biggest factor might have been Donald J. Trump.The New York TimesHarry Reid\u2019s seat was not flipped. And interestingly, the Republican opponent had abandoned Trump.Networks won\u2019t call Trump the winner until he\u2019s clinched 270 electoral votes. We think he has a greater than 95 percent chance of getting to 270, but at the moment, he doesn\u2019t have a greater than 95 percent chance in states that add up to 270.Trump is holding steady in Wisconsin. It appears that it all rests on Milwaukee.Nick, you spent a lot of time reporting about the rise of the \u201calt-right.\u201d  Do you think it will gain mainstream acceptance if Trump pulls this out?I think a better way to think of it is that the alt-right \u2014 by the way, this is not a very precise term \u2014 was mainstreamed by Trump to some extent. It has a fairly precise language it uses that not many Trump voters, I think, actually share. But the ideas are in common: a country with a distinct culture under assault by outsiders.Mainstream Republicans who voted for Trump probably do not think of themselves as representing a \u201cwhite America.\u201d The critical thing is that their conception of America has them at the center. Voting for Trump is a way to say that they want that America to continue. I also think the fact that Trump comes from New York, in terms of media coverage of views he mainstreamed, helped him a great deal.A candidate who did not live a few blocks from a number of the cable and broadcast networks would have struggled.Ashley Parker reports from the Trump party that George T. Conway III, the husband of Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, arrived at the Trump party around midnight, tears of joy rolling down his cheeks.He continued to weep, on and off, for the next hour, talking about how his wife had helped make history and spontaneously wrapping his friends in full-armed bear hugs.Folks, let\u2019s talk about post-Obama Washington and the post-Trump Democrats.But parties locked out of power tend to fragment. Instead of another Republican autopsy, expect a bitter Democratic one.It is easy for me to imagine a rising Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing of the party, arguing that Democrats lost for not tapping enough into voter frustrations, for being too centrist.Democrats face a difficult map in 2018. If they don\u2019t win the Senate tonight, they will have an uphill battle in two years.There is a Supreme Court vacancy that Republicans, under a President Trump, are likely to be able to fill.Who are the leaders to take the party forward now? Who runs for president in 2020 and 2024?Nick, I thought the Democrats would be in a tough place even if Clinton had won \u2014 the party was divided, had no obvious bench and, I\u2019d argue, Mrs. Clinton had no clear mandate or agenda. I think you are going to see from the left what the Republicans have struggled with from the right for years: In this case, people like Warren and Sanders saying the party needs to return to its liberal roots to become competitive.I think a lot of forces that were contained by Obama\u2019s historic rise and his popularity within his party are now about to be unleashed.It would have been a problem if Clinton had won (or if she does win). But it\u2019s going to be much worse now. Which is not to say that this is going to be easygoing for the Republican Party. It is not.Senator Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican, just won re-election.Mr. Toomey\u2019s victory in this battleground state was a relief to Republicans who had feared he might become a casualty of Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaignThe New York TimesThe Upshot forecast is at a 95 percent likelihood that Trump wins the presidency. He could do so with Clinton winning the popular vote.Not to be picky, but it\u2019s a greater than 95 percent chance.The Associated Press has just called Pennsylvania for Trump.Alan and Nate, The Times just called Pennsylvania for Trump. This makes it very hard to see how Clinton climbs back.Alex Burns and I wrote a story in August about how Trump had a narrow path that related to winning Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio.He appears to have done that.It appears Clinton has not left her hotel, but her campaign manager, John Podesta, has, per this CNN tweet: John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, just left the Peninsula hotel. Asked if HRC was headed over, he said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m headed over.Trump is already getting some congratulations from like-minded politicians from other countries. France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front party, sent her best wishes via Twitter.

We are so proud of you, and we are so proud of her,\u201d Podesta says.\u201cShe has done an amazing job, and she is not done yet,\u201d Podesta says.He concludes by saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get those votes counted, and let\u2019s get this done.\u201dCorey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is assailing Clinton on CNN for failing to concede.The Associated Press and now The Times has called Alaska for the Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. Roy Blunt is the winner in Missouri, giving control of the Senate to the Republican Party. Although Missouri has been a reliably red state in recent years, Senator Blunt\u2019s support of Donald J. Trump turned off some of the moderate voters who had traditionally backed him.The New York TimesDemocrats picked up at least one seat but were finding others elusive, ensuring that they would remain in the minority of a fiercely divided chamber.The New York TimesIt looks like Trump is heading to the venue where he will speak.According to Sean Spicer of the Republican National Committee, Trump will speak shortly at the Hilton.CNN is calling Wisconsin for Trump.That\u2019s a state that Trump failed to win in the Republican primary race.Here we go: The Associated Press is now projecting that Donald J. Trump has been elected president.CNN is also reporting that Clinton conceded.And Clinton may have conceded, MSNBC reports. BREAKING: SOURCE TELLS ME CLINTON HAS CONCEDED ON PHONE WITH TRUMPThe Times is calling Wisconsin and the election for Trump.Here comes Mike Pence to the stage.Pence is giving the introduction to Trump.Maggie Haberman reports that Huma Abedin called Kellyanne Conway, who handed the phone to Trump. Clinton then conceded.Pence says he is \u201cdeeply grateful to the American people for placing their confidence in this team\u201d and giving them the opportunity to serve.Trump is walking out on the stage.

She congratulated us; it\u2019s about us, on our victory,\u201d Trump says.Trump says he congratulated Clinton on her very hard-fought campaign. \u201cWe owe her a major debt of gratitude for her debt to our country,\u201d Trump says.Trump calls for Republicans and Democrats to come together \u201cas one united people.\u201dA very conventional victory speech so far: congratulates Clinton and promises to be \u201cpresident for all Americans\u201d and bring the two parties together.Trump says to those who did not support him, \u201cI am reaching out to you for your guidance and your help\u201d to unify the country.Clinton could have given this speech. With a few, um, adjustments.We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, he said.Trump is thanking his children and siblings, including his late brother, Fred. \u201cFantastic guy,\u201d Trump says.\u201cThis was tough,\u201d Trump says of all of the hours he put in. \u201cThis political stuff is nasty, and it\u2019s tough.\u201dTrump gives a special thanks to Rudy Giuliani, who has been one of his staunchest supporters.And a shout out to Chris Christie.Speculation is about Christie and Giuliani in a Trump cabinet.One of the interesting things is, considering how many mainstream Republicans ran away from him, who he is going to turn to to fill his White House.Trump is saluting Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee, two of his former competitors for the Republican nomination.Trump says that Reince Priebus is a \u201csuperstar.\u201dI\u2019ll go out on a limb here, Alan: Reince Priebus is not going to get forced out as chairman of the Republican National Committee.Priebus takes the stage briefly to call Trump the next president of the United States. \u201cThank God,\u201d he says.Trump just thanked the Secret Service. Trump: \u201cWhile the campaign is over, our work on this movement is just beginning.\u201dAnd Trump White House here we come.Trump concludes by saying: \u201cI love this country.\u201dAnd by playing \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want,\u201d by the Rolling Stones.On that note, we are going to wrap things up.It has been quite an evening. Thanks to all of our readers for joining us for this historic election.Thanks to you readers still with us! Both of you!We leave you with this analysis of how Trump won.Based on exit polls, the 2016 presidential election seems to have dramatically redefined how certain demographic groups vote.The New York TimesThe 2016 campaign has been about changing demographics and shifting party coalitions as much as the two main candidates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Tangled Web", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialEven if he no longer manages his businesses directly, Mr. Trump will continue to own them and his family will be involved in deals, both foreign and domestic, to develop real estate projects or license his brand. He will still be aware of the existence of his business interests and how his actions as president will affect them. The conflicts between his private interests and his public role will be impossible to untangle.It\u2019s very unlikely Mr. Trump will sell his businesses or put them into a blind trust.

{"Headline": "A Donald Trump-Led Trip Back to the Gold-Plated \u201980s", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byInside WealthThe American wealthy are about to enjoy a giant back-to-the-1980s party, hosted by the new billionaire in chief, Donald J. Trump.From his gold-plated penthouse to his trickle-down tax cuts and his Reaganesque slogans, President-elect Trump is bringing back the \u201980s prosperity gospel. His approach to wealth harks back to the days of \u201cDynasty,\u201d DeLoreans and deficits, when the rich were admired and a former actor-turned-president restored America\u2019s optimism and global muscle.The wealthy are already partying like it\u2019s 1989. If Mr. Trump makes good on his tax cut promises, billions are expected to go back into their pockets. The stock market is reaching record highs, and sales of Picassos and Warhols are resurgent. All that is missing now is Robin Leach\u2019s \u201cChampagne wishes and caviar dreams.\u201d And Mr. Leach is optimistic.\u201cIn the next four years, it will be O.K. to be rich again,\u201d said Mr. Leach, whose hit TV show \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\u201d helped define \u201980s aspirations. \u201cThe cars will get bigger, the houses will be more luxurious, and it will be O.K. to wear jewelry and gowns again.\u201dOf course, times have changed since Gordon Gekko said that \u201cgreed, for lack of a better word, is good.\u201d In a post-Thomas Piketty world where even traditional Republicans warn about the wealth gap and the effects of globalization and technology, Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201980s blueprint may prove as outdated as shoulder pads and the Cold War. His rewards for those at the top are likely to make inequality even wider and could draw criticism from the populist voters who helped elect him.Still, Mr. Trump remains a creature of the decade that made him famous. Take his tax plan. He has proposed cutting the top rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent, cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, trimming the capital gains tax and eliminating the estate tax. These would be the largest tax cuts for the wealthy since the Reagan reductions of 1986.According to the Tax Policy Center, the after-tax incomes of middle-class and lower-income taxpayers would grow less than 2 percent under the Trump plan. The incomes of the top 1 percent of earners, by contrast, would soar about 14 percent.Put another way, nearly half of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent \u2014 recalling Reagan\u2019s trickle-down theory: Money at the top will flow down to those at the bottom.\u201cThe question is: In this economy, will that actually happen?\u201d said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Mr. Trump, of course, has invited the Reagan comparisons, borrowing Reagan\u2019s 1980 slogan \u201cLet\u2019s make America great again.\u201d And like Reagan, his combination of tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending by government could lead to higher deficits.Yet for now, Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is ushering in an \u201980s-like euphoria among the rich. Since the election, stocks have reached record highs. Strong art sales this month at Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips brought in a total of more than $1 billion. Christie\u2019s sold a de Kooning for $66.3 million (well over its estimate of $40 million) and a favorite of \u201980s collectors, a Monet, for $81.4 million.High-end real estate, which was in a slump, is also poised for growth now that a real estate developer will be in the White House.Sales of luxury goods are rising, after a slowdown in China and less conspicuous consumption put a damper on them last year. An executive with Net-a-Porter, the high-end fashion company, cited Mr. Trump\u2019s wife in the 1980s \u2014 Ivana \u2014 as a \u201ckey inspiration\u201d for some of the fall fashion lines, which emphasize \u201chard-edged, power-shoulder jackets,\u201d bouffant hair and bright lipstick.Even Mr. Trump\u2019s celebratory election dinner was an \u201980s throwback moment. Rather than heading to Maialino, Le Bernardin or any of the current power restaurants, Mr. Trump and his family opted for the \u201c21\u201d Club, a favorite haunt of the celebrities and power brokers in the 1970s and \u201980s. As he told the wealthy crowd at the restaurant, \u201cWe\u2019ll get your taxes down. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump is reluctant to give up his ultimate homage to the \u201980s: his apartment. The three-story penthouse in Trump Tower is filled with gold, marble, Greek gods painted on the ceiling and pillows embroidered with the Trump family \u201ccoat of arms.\u201d For a man who once said, \u201cPart of the beauty of me is that I am very rich,\u201d it is no wonder he is having second thoughts about leaving his Versailles in the sky for public housing on Pennsylvania Avenue.Mr. Trump\u2019s flash and dazzle stand in stark contrast to the new culture of wealth. In the \u201980s, success meant excess, bigger was better, and wealth was meant for display. Today\u2019s wealth culture, by contrast, is all about staying under the radar \u2014 jeans and sneakers instead of suits, whitewall minimalism rather than gold, and a Tesla in the garage, not a Rolls. They prefer the attention of signing the Giving Pledge to buying a megayacht.The question is whether Mr. Trump, leading by example, will make wealth glamorous again \u2014 and bring back the days of Champagne wishes and caviar dreams.\u201cThe funny thing is, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t even drink Champagne or any alcohol,\u201d Mr. Leach said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t eat caviar.\u201dROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "They worry that global climate change has led to rising sea levels and the hottest temperatures on record. They want to stem overuse of the earth\u2019s resources. And they feel compelled to put pressure on companies that violate workers\u2019 rights.That explains why Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing has become so popular in the past couple of years. Wealthy investors are flocking to financial products that take into account the ethics, social responsibility, corporate governance and environmental records of the companies they invest in.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge increasing interest in responsible investing,\u201d said Janine Guilliot, director of capital markets policy and outreach for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a San Francisco organization working to develop ways companies can report their sustainability efforts. ESG investing is growing as more investors adopt the philosophy that investments should not only create value, but also reflect their values. Just as some consumers may avoid shopping at companies with large carbon footprints or poor workplace safety records, investors are harnessing their power to influence positive changes when picking their portfolios.And while there once was a fear that ESG investing could be a costly decision, investors now see growing evidence that they don\u2019t have to sacrifice good returns for good deeds. On the contrary, according to a 2015 analysis by the University of Oxford and Arabesque Asset Management, 80 percent of academic studies found that the stocks of companies with \u201cgood sustainability practices\u201d do better than other stocks.Investors are demanding companies prove they can do more than deliver big returns. They\u2019re also looking to focus their investments on companies that are well positioned to avoid ESG risks in the long term. These \u201ctrusted thinkers\u201d discuss big issues and share ideas in blogs, articles, videos and at events.In May of last year, the Center\u2019s board of directors challenged itself to have the organization's significant reserve funds invested in a way that aligns with the nonprofit\u2019s values. This is not a simple proposition: The Center relies on returns from this reserve for its annual operating funds, so it needs those investments to be profitable. But it also must not pour money into industries that contribute to climate change. \u201cAs an organization that is working at the moral crossroads of these social and ecological challenges, we have taken a look at the implications of climate change,\u201d said Brooke Hecht, the Center\u2019s President. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to divest our portfolio from the fossil fuel economy and invest in companies that are working toward a clean energy future.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Combative, Populist Steve Bannon Found His Man in Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byWhen Julia Jones arrived at her office in Santa Monica at 8 a.m. \u2014 by Hollywood screenwriter standards, the crack of dawn \u2014 she found Stephen K. Bannon already at his desk, which was cluttered with takeout coffees. They were co-writers on a Ronald Reagan documentary, but Mr. Bannon had pretty much taken it over. He had been at work for hours, he told her, writing feverishly about his political hero.\u201cA man with a vision,\u201d the trailer says. \u201cAn outsider, a radical with extreme views.\u201dThe Reagan presidency has been a recurring touchstone for Mr. Bannon since 1980, when as a 26-year-old Navy officer he talked his way into Mr. Reagan\u2019s election night celebration. It was at an early screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil\u201d that he met fellow Reagan admirer Andrew Breitbart, the budding conservative media provocateur.Breitbart.com\u2019s scorn for Muslims, immigrants and black activists drew a fervent following on the alt-right, an extremist fringe of message boards and online magazines popular with white supremacists, and after Mr. Bannon took control of the website in 2012, he built a raucous coalition of the discontented.Mr. Bannon told a colleague in multiple conversations during the presidential campaign that he knew Mr. Trump was an \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d for the revolution he had in mind. But the upstart candidate and the media entrepreneur bonded anyway.Like Reagan, Mr. Trump addressed the people he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d \u2014 the white working and middle class. He vowed to take on Islamic radicalism, as Reagan had faced off against communism. Echoing the sole-savior theme of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d Mr. Trump declared of the nation\u2019s predicament, \u201cOnly I can fix it.\u201dMs. Jones, for one, had no trouble seeing the parallels. \u201cTrump,\u201d she said, \u201cis Steve\u2019s Reagan.\u201dTo understand what to expect from the Trump administration means in part to fathom the driven, contradictory character of Mr. Bannon, whom the president-elect has named senior counselor and chief White House strategist. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a president-elect, thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities and many other Americans.How did this son of Richmond, Va., who attended Harvard Business School, spent years at Goldman Sachs and became wealthy working at the intersection of entertainment and finance come to view the political and financial elites as his archenemy? Why does a man who calls himself a \u201chard-nosed capitalist\u201d rail against \u201cglobalists\u201d of \u201cthe party of Davos\u201d and attack the Republican establishment with special glee?As a filmmaker, Mr. Bannon, 63, has cited both the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl and the left-wing documentarian Michael Moore as models. In top physical shape as a young Navy officer, and for years wearing the banker\u2019s uniform of expensive suits, Mr. Bannon has in recent years sported flannel shirts and cargo pants. With a paunch and a sometimes scraggly beard, Mr. Bannon has a rugged look that Stephen Colbert described as \u201cRobert Redford dredged from a river.\u201dVociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an anti-Semite and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable self-confidence and striking intensity. (Mr. Bannon turned down a request for an interview, saying he was too busy with the presidential transition.)\u201cNo one has called him nice,\u201d said Patrick McSweeney, a former chairman of the Virginia Republican Party and a Bannon admirer who has known his family for years. \u201cHe is the least politically correct person I know. His overriding concern is getting the mission accomplished.\u201dSome longtime associates said they had never heard him express bigoted views. \u201cIn the 14 years I\u2019ve known him, I\u2019ve never heard him utter a racist or anti-Semitic comment,\u201d said Peter Schweizer, a conservative author and the president of the Government Accountability Institute, where Mr. Bannon was a founder and the executive chairman.Mr. Bannon\u2019s backers note that several of Breitbart\u2019s top editors and managers are Jewish \u2014 as was Mr. Breitbart himself \u2014 and the site is staunchly pro-Israel. They also point out that Mr. Bannon\u2019s longtime assistant, Wendy Colbert, is African-American; so are Sonnie Johnson, a conservative writer he promoted on Breitbart, and a former Goldman colleague who has been a close friend for three decades and considers Mr. Bannon family, but who asked not to be named to avoid a flood of media attention.Mary Beth Meredith, Mr. Bannon\u2019s sister, said accusations of personal bigotry against him were \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d \u201cWe have interfaith marriages in our own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have interracial marriages \u2014 our family is a microcosm of the U.S.\u201dWhere some perceive racism and nativism, others see a different -ism: opportunism. Whatever may be in his heart, they say, Mr. Bannon was happy to draw a white nationalist following to Breitbart, while denying that was his intent.Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who has been sharply critical of Mr. Bannon, called him \u201ca manipulator\u201d who had \u201cmainstreamed\u201d far-right extremists for cynical political purposes.Ms. Jones, Mr. Bannon\u2019s former film collaborator, who describes herself as very liberal, said, \u201cSteve\u2019s not a racist.\u201dBut, she added, \u201che\u2019s using the alt-right \u2014 using them for power.\u201dRobin Mickle, a fellow Navy officer of Mr. Bannon\u2019s aboard the destroyer Paul F. Foster, remembers that he and some of his idealistic mates were struck by something Mr. Bannon told them in 1978.\u201cHe said he joined the Navy so it would look good on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because he wanted to go into politics someday,\u201d said Mr. Mickle, a retired defense contractor.Another officer, Sonny Masso, who would stay in the Navy and eventually make admiral, recalls a devoted reader of The Wall Street Journal who picked stocks to buy through a San Diego broker and had an astonishing ability to retain information.He was fit, too. \u201cHe\u2019d run five miles at lunch and he had a 32-inch waist,\u201d Mr. Masso said. \u201cVery preppy when we were out of uniform \u2014 polo shirts with alligators on them, and penny loafers with no socks.\u201dMr. Bannon was the middle child of five in an Irish Catholic family from a leafy North Richmond neighborhood. His father, Martin, 95, to whom he remains very close, was a telephone lineman who had worked his way into middle management at the phone company.Steve was bit of a brawler as a boy, said his older brother Mike Bannon. \u201cHe was a fighter. He was a guy that believed what he believed.\u201d On occasion, Steve summoned Mike to the neighborhood pool for reinforcement. \u201cHe\u2019d get in little scrapes and come back and get me, and I\u2019d say, \u2018I wished it wasn\u2019t eight guys we were fighting. If it was two or three, I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u2019\u201dMike Bannon, eager to rebut charges of racism against his brother, said the boys took two buses to get to Benedictine, and their parents instructed them to give up their seats if a woman boarded: \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference if they were black or white or Indian or Jewish or anything else,\u201d he said.Their mother, Doris, who died many years ago, loved to tell them about sneaking Jewish friends into her neighborhood pool in Baltimore \u2014 past a sign that said \u201cNo Jews Allowed.\u201d She later worked on campaigns for Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who became the first African-American governor of Virginia.For Mike Bannon, his brother Steve is \u201ca son of the South\u201d who has never shifted his principles or his character. \u201cHe knew who he was in fourth grade and he\u2019s never changed much over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in his own skin.\u201dAt Virginia Tech, Steve Bannon got his first taste of politics, winning the Student Government Association presidency in a 1975 race that grew quite heated after he challenged the status quo. An opponent, Gary Clisham, told the student newspaper that Mr. Bannon had \u201cimmense charisma\u201d but predicted that he would get nothing done.After graduation, Mr. Bannon joined the Navy, attended Officer Candidate School and served two deployments aboard the Foster, a destroyer that took him all over Asia and into the Persian Gulf. His basketball style \u2014 running the length of the court without passing \u2014 earned him a sarcastic nickname, Coast-to-Coast, said Mr. Masso, his shipmate. Still, he said, Mr. Bannon was popular with the sailors he led in the engineering department, nearly 50 men, the majority of them African-American, Hispanic or Asian.Though his family had Democratic roots, Mr. Bannon, like most of his fellow officers, was scornful of President Jimmy Carter and entranced by Ronald Reagan. At Mr. Masso\u2019s condo, while they watched the two candidates\u2019 debate on television in 1980, Mr. Bannon could hardly contain his excitement.\u201cHe was pacing my living room, and whenever there was a point-counterpoint, he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 like we were watching a boxing match,\u201d Mr. Masso said. When Mr. Bannon heard later that the Reagan election night party was planned for a Los Angeles hotel, the Century Plaza, he worked the phones to try for tickets.When he got the brushoff, Mr. Masso said, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cHey, listen pal, we just got back from the Persian Gulf.\u201d Soon, he had Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger on the phone saying, \u201cThe governor would be honored to have you there.\u201d It was 4 a.m. when their group left the victory celebration to return to the ship, Mr. Masso said.Both men went on to take Pentagon jobs, and Mr. Bannon earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations at Georgetown at the same time. Mr. Masso thought his friend might try to get into politics, but he was accepted at Harvard Business School, and he left the Navy in 1983 to begin a new life.Friends at Harvard and later at Goldman Sachs were aware of Mr. Bannon\u2019s conservative views, but politics was rarely discussed. \u201cHe was in mergers and acquisitions, I was in corporate finance, and we were both working 100 hours a week,\u201d said Scot Vorse, who met Mr. Bannon on their first day at Harvard and joined Goldman at the same time.After less than four years, Mr. Bannon left Goldman to start his own firm, Bannon & Co., which Mr. Vorse soon joined. As head of a scrappy start-up going up against financial behemoths to get Hollywood deals, Mr. Bannon showed the fierce competitiveness that would later drive his politics.\u201cWe were the underdog,\u201d Mr. Vorse said. \u201cWe were competing for the business of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and we did well.\u201d Mr. Vorse said Bannon & Co. represented the Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; the Italian media tycoon and later the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi; Samsung; Westinghouse; and other big players.Mr. Vorse was the detail man, he said. Mr. Bannon \u201cwas the visionary, seeing things before anyone else. He was the rainmaker. He was a leader.\u201dEven as they became successful, Mr. Bannon was not a lavish spender. \u201cHe was driving an eight-year-old Celica convertible,\u201d he said.But in 1993, as part of the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Turner Broadcasting System, he acquired a share of the royalties from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d a move that would prove extremely lucrative as the show became a cultural force.In 1998, Bannon & Co. was acquired by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and Mr. Bannon ran a series of companies working at the intersection of entertainment and finance.\u201cVery intense, very passionate,\u201d said Trevor Drinkwater, who worked with him in film distribution from 2004 to 2010. \u201cI was impressed that while he was very right wing, he had a lot of liberal friends.\u201d He saw Mr. Bannon\u2019s dress evolve toward the casual, \u201cthe flannel shirt over the polo shirt.\u201dThrough films, Mr. Bannon was turning his attention back to politics. Tim Watkins, his co-director on the Reagan documentary, said Mr. Bannon worked from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to, say, go to a ballgame,\u201d he said. But Mr. Watkins found his collaborator\u2019s combativeness wearying.\u201cSteve thinks everything has to be a fight,\u201d he said. Once, an argument broke out when he told Mr. Bannon that the rough cut of the film, at two hours and 10 minutes, should be trimmed further. Angry, Mr. Bannon \u201cactually flipped over the table,\u201d Mr. Watkins said.At first, he recalled, before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, they intended to make a standard biopic. But the attacks \u201cchanged the film radically,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War battles merged with the coda, which showed the hijacked airliners hitting the World Trade Center and people jumping to their deaths.\u201cSteve crafted a lot of the big ideas,\u201d Mr. Watkins said, notably that \u201clife is a battle of good and evil, and history repeats itself.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again,\u201d they read.When his eldest child, Maureen, got into West Point, Mr. Bannon was thrilled and joked about switching his allegiance to Army from Navy. He never missed her volleyball games, and he was at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 2011 when she returned from a deployment to Iraq. \u201cThat was one of the greatest feelings I\u2019ve had, seeing my dad when I walked off the plane,\u201d she said.But through his daughter\u2019s service, he saw an inequity that fueled his anger at the privileged Americans among whom he had long worked.At West Point, \u201che saw a complete, utter lack of people from the upper economic levels of American society,\u201d said Mr. Schweizer, the conservative writer. \u201cHe thought it was appalling, especially because the elite set so many policies that sent these kids into war.\u201dMr. Bannon was put off by the George W. Bush administration\u2019s creation in 2003 of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which he saw as a blatant giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies. The financial collapse of 2008 and the bailouts that followed infuriated him, including the devastating effect of the stock market collapse on the retirement accounts of men like his father, a phone company retiree.Mr. Bannon often spoke to friends about his father\u2019s \u201chonest work,\u201d contrasting it with the paper-pushing he had seen on Wall Street. \u201cWe consider ourselves middle class, and we think the middle class has been shafted,\u201d Mike Bannon said. \u201cBlack, Hispanic, white, everybody. The political class has given them happy talk but delivered nothing. I think that\u2019s what Steve\u2019s talking about.\u201d\u201cNot one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the 2008 crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon fumed. \u201cAnd in fact, it gets worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken.\u201dBut if his scathing economic analysis sometimes seemed to dabble in Marxism, on other subjects, including race and religion, he made no concessions to political sensitivities. After Mr. Bannon met Mr. Breitbart at the 2004 screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d the two men hit it off, bonding over their similar views and a common irreverent streak.Ms. Jones, the film colleague, said that in their years working together, Mr. Bannon occasionally talked about the genetic superiority of some people and once mused about the desirability of limiting the vote to property owners.\u201cI said, \u2018That would exclude a lot of African-Americans,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jones recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u2019 I said, \u2018But what about Wendy?\u2019\u201d referring to Mr. Bannon\u2019s executive assistant. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s different. She\u2019s family.\u2019\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s African-American friend from his Goldman years said that he had been at pains to defend him in recent years to mutual acquaintances put off first by Breitbart\u2019s reputation and now by Mr. Bannon\u2019s association with Mr. Trump. Most Christmas seasons over the past two decades, he said, Mr. Bannon was \u201cmy only token white guy,\u201d or one of two or three, invited to an annual dinner at a New York City club for nearly a score of African-American friends who work or worked in finance.\u201cNow I\u2019m getting a lot of, \u2018What happened to Steve?\u2019\u201d from concerned black acquaintances, the friend said. He said he hoped Mr. Bannon \u2014 and more important, Mr. Trump \u2014 would more forthrightly denounce the bigots who have cheered them on. Still, he said, he completely rejects the accusations against Mr. Bannon.\u201cHell, no, he\u2019s not a white nationalist,\u201d the friend said.Mr. Bannon took over as executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 after Mr. Breitbart died, playing a hands-on role in assigning, approving and sometimes dictating changes to articles, according to several former Breitbart employees. Staff members grew polarized for or against him. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed a nondisclosure agreement.They describe a decentralized operation overseen by Mr. Bannon in two conference calls a day. Employees rarely had any idea where their peripatetic boss was because he seemed to be constantly moving between homes, offices or borrowed premises in Florida, Washington, New York and occasionally Los Angeles or London.Mr. Bannon\u2019s critics assert that he sometimes put his political preferences ahead of fairness or even of the facts, directing that stories be rewritten to his specifications and shrugging off protests that his changes might make them inaccurate. While Breitbart did not traffic in outright racial slurs, it specialized in inflammatory coverage of police shootings, immigration and Islam in ways intended to prick liberal pieties.Alex Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart, denied that Mr. Bannon ever deliberately permitted an inaccurate story to run on the site. \u201cBreitbart represents certain values, like conservatism, populism and nationalism, and Steve Bannon wanted our content to reflect that,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. He said the site has 45 million readers and should not be judged by \u201ca couple thousand people on Twitter\u201d who express offensive views.In 2011, as Mr. Trump pondered a 2012 presidential run, David Bossie, a conservative activist who headed Citizens United, took Mr. Bannon to Trump Tower in New York to meet him. \u201cThey definitely hit it off,\u201d said Mr. Bossie, who has collaborated with Mr. Bannon on a series of films.Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon had in common a willingness to defy some small-government conservative notions \u2014 for instance, by pushing for a large, costly infrastructure plan to create jobs.Mr. Bannon was deeply impressed in 2014 when an insurgent Virginia Republican, David Brat, managed an unexpected primary race upset of Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader. \u201cHe began casting around for other unconventional candidates to support \u2014 people that were not a part of the establishment and would run populist campaigns,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said.As Mr. Bannon became a steadily more obvious supporter of Mr. Trump, some Breitbart editors and reporters thought he was turning a news site into a propaganda platform \u2014 though other staff members approved. Mr. Shapiro was the most outspoken critic, saying that Mr. Bannon had \u201cbetrayed\u201d Mr. Breitbart\u2019s mission of \u201cfighting the bullies.\u201dIf the criticism bothered Mr. Bannon, he did not show it. He was already deeply involved in advising Mr. Trump, and he believed, unlike most pollsters and pundits, that the chaotic, low-budget campaign had a chance.One warm evening in August, after Mr. Trump called on Mr. Bannon to take charge of the campaign, Mr. Caddell, the pollster, met with him at a New York hotel, sitting outside on a veranda.Mr. Bannon said he knew the campaign needed discipline, with Mr. Trump more consistently presenting himself as a populist outsider, Mr. Caddell recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Believe me, I\u2019m going to bring this home. I know what needs to be done, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Caddell said.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Whatever Reagan scholars like Mr. Cannon might say, Mr. Bossie, who also joined the Trump campaign, said that he and Mr. Bannon discussed Reagan parallels as they saw huge crowds waiting for hours to hear Mr. Trump. Mr. Reagan had run when many voters felt the country was threatened at home and abroad, Mr. Bossie said. \u201cYou can see the same things today with Donald Trump \u2014 that America has lost its way and it\u2019s lost its strength, and Americans are looking for leadership,\u201d he said.Kellyanne Conway, who took the job of campaign manager when Mr. Bannon became chief executive, would later call him \u201cthe general\u201d who made many critical decisions. He pushed for Mr. Trump to visit Flint, Mich., where the water supply was contaminated with lead, and to appear at a black church. Mr. Bannon also hugely accelerated the tempo of what he thought had been a 9-to-5 campaign.In the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Bannon was sure the polls pointing to a Clinton victory were wrong, other campaign officials said. His family, including all four siblings and his 95-year-old father, made the trip to New York City for election night.For Mr. Bannon, the long night at the New York Hilton was his second presidential campaign victory gathering, coming 36 years after the first. At 4:30 a.m., Mr. Vorse, his former colleague, reached him to offer congratulations. He was reminded of their Hollywood days, when \u201cwe would have victories and Steve would celebrate for two seconds, and then it was on to the next thing.\u201d\u201cHe said, \u2018I got to go because we have a meeting in three hours. I got to hop.\u2019\u201dAn article on Monday\u2019s front page about Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist for President-elect Donald J. Trump, misidentified the type of ship on which Mr. Bannon served. The ship Paul F. Foster was a destroyer, not a guided-missile destroyer.Sharon LaFraniere, Jo Becker and Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump\u2019s Victory Might Mean for Banks", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDonald J. Trump\u2019s surprise election victory should bring some welcome relief to banks. A Republican Party in control of Congress also usually appeals to the financial markets.The president-elect\u2019s erratic positions on other important issues, however, could turn those short-term gains into long-term pain.A commitment to spending on American roads and bridges, reinforced in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory speech, is also a good sign for Wall Street. A repeal or significant reform of Dodd-Frank, President Obama\u2019s 2010 law reining in banks after the financial crisis, is more likely, too, and may help the bottom line of financial institutions. The next Treasury secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and head of supervision at the Federal Reserve also could be friendlier to the industry.Higher interest rates would be an additional benefit, and Mr. Trump has supported the idea. A one percentage-point increase could add billions of dollars to the top line of the biggest American lenders within a year and act as yet another stimulus to the trading desks of banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.Mr. Trump\u2019s inconsistency over financial policy and regulation could cancel out those gains, though. This year, he spoke in favor of low rates, for example. If he names a replacement for the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, uncertainty would abound.America\u2019s banks would be better placed than their European peers. Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist leanings imply that foreign banks with big United States operations, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, might face even more punitive oversight than now, for example.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Murky Russia, One Investor Finds Value in Thinking Small", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionMOSCOW \u2014 There\u2019s no doubt Russia is a country with grandeur in its scale, sweeping across 11 time zones and home to gargantuan oil, gas and mining companies.The country\u2019s wealthy also have a reputation for living large and taking risky bets. But in the economic swoon today, getting by as an investor, says one wealthy Russian in the capital, means thinking small.\u201cIn the past two years, Russia has changed quite a bit,\u201d said Aleksei A. Kozlov, a partner in a private equity firm. \u201cBefore we invested in simple things like stocks and large company debt, but we changed strategy because the risk just wasn\u2019t justified.\u201d\u201cThe business climate is extraordinarily murky, and the judicial system is poor,\u201d Mr. Kozlov said. But opportunity exists in untapped potential in the creative and educated population, particularly in Moscow.\u201cWe invest in medium businesses that would be very difficult to take away from the owners, and that are in demand,\u201d he said. A favorite category is private medical clinics, which are booming given cuts to state medical services. Because the doctor talent pool is the heart of the company, it cannot easily be seized, reducing risk.Mining for minds, and not for minerals, has been paying off, Mr. Kozlov said. Despite Russia\u2019s woes, a space exists for private investors.Mr. Kozlov\u2019s private equity firm typically steps in to replace bank loans, taking from 25 percent to 49 percent of shares in a closed stock company in exchange.\u201cA lot of companies have defaulted because of the currency drop, the sanctions or counter-sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the businessmen are good at what they do, but they are weak in financing,\u201d which is where he sees his firm\u2019s role. The firm, which has about $25 million invested in small and medium-size businesses, rarely puts more than $1 million into any one company.\u201cWe don\u2019t have companies with a lot of capital \u2014 land, machines, tools, or anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all risk, all hard to sell.\u201dMr. Kozlov, 42, is married to a prominent political activist, Olga Romanova. Like many businessmen, he failed once spectacularly, before bouncing back \u2014 with a Russian twist.\u201cI had a corporate dispute with my partner, who was a member of the Senate,\u201d and well-connected with prosecutors, he explained. At issue was ownership of a factory outside Moscow that was making artificial leather. In 2008, Mr. Kozlov was arrested on fraud charges he said were trumped up.When his legal problems were finally resolved, Ms. Romanova suggested the couple leave Russia. \u201cMy wife said, \u2018You are exonerated, but it\u2019s better to leave.

Paying bribes is a shortcut for the wealthy in Russia, he said, but also a trap. With persistence, it\u2019s possible to run a transparent business, he said. \u201cThe chances are it will be all right.\u201d\u201cWe have been through more than one crisis\u201d in Russia, and times of crisis are always the best for investing, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a time to start. Some parts of the economy fall, other parts rise. It never happens that everything falls at once.\u201d\u201cWhat worries me is the political situation and foreign policy, the conflict that is happening between Russia and a lot of other countries.\u201d He worries that potential buyers of his shares in the small companies may not show up when he wants to exit.On weekends, Mr. Kozlov dedicates time to his wife\u2019s charity, saying he is giving back for the support shown to him during his roughly three-and-a-half years in jail. The government\u2019s business ombudsman estimates more than 100,000 small-business men are in jail in Russia. The charity, among other things, brings clothes and food to jails to pass along to incarcerated businessmen.Another weekend ritual for Mr. Kozlov, as for so many other Russian businessmen, is to visit the Sanduny steam baths, an opulent, Greco-Roman themed bathhouse with a deep history in the Russian capital as a mixing place for the well-to-do.Here, wearing sheets or nothing at all, Russia\u2019s financial and governmental elite let the week\u2019s worries seep away. And sometimes, deals can be cut in the more relaxed atmosphere that could not happen in suits in an office, Mr. Kozlov said.\u201cI go with a group of friends and discuss business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good atmosphere. It\u2019s totally relaxed. And there\u2019re no cellphones bothering us. We go early in the morning, when there aren\u2019t so many people. And we get the pleasure of the steam, and of our company.

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs, Bank to the Elite, Makes Pitch to the Masses", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs, long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks \u2014 debt happens.On Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals \u2014 even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range \u2014 out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan.\u201cDebt happens. It\u2019s how you get out that counts,\u201d the ads say.Dustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman\u2019s new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank\u2019s aim was to \u201cdestigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.\u201dThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple. Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans \u201ccan be a better option,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research.Mr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut.Through the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals.Goldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its \u201cvampire squid\u201d reputation.But these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman\u2019s longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets.\u201cThe real driver\u201d of the new Marcus lending push is \u201cthe way the capital rules are,\u201d Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. \u201cWe are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it\u2019s easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,\u201d Mr. Blankfein added.The last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley, which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter\u2019s steadier fee-driven revenues.Although the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010.Marcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman\u2019s head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. \u201cWe were looking for something different, something new\u201d that wouldn\u2019t compete with Goldman\u2019s existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said.Goldman\u2019s growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from great to merely good,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk.It is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. \u201cDigital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,\u201d Mr. Scherr said.Lending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. \u201cThe thing to worry about, when you\u2019re refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,\u201d she said.The small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future.\u201cI think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThen three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stocks and bonds cannot give you the same satisfaction as a heated saltwater pool with a waterfall, surrounded by mahogany decking, and Amagansett ocean breezes.While owning residential real estate is typically part of a diversified investment portfolio, what is different in the last year or two is the role the uncertain economy is playing in making purchasing decisions.\u201cBut once they have found what they want, there\u2019s more urgency,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said. \u201cIn the past year, they\u2019ve been quicker to pull the trigger on a purchase once they\u2019ve identified such an opportunity.\u201dMany high-net-worth investors are plunking cash in a second or third high-end residence as a safety net, stemming from concern about a wide range of economic and political factors.

{"Headline": "A Study Tests the Safety of Women Using Abortion Pills Sent by Mail", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byWhen the abortion pills arrived in her mailbox this summer, she felt anxious but also in control, knowing she could end her pregnancy entirely in the privacy of her own home.\u201cI was happy that I was going to be able to do it myself and I did not have a nurse there or doctors there staring at me and judging me,\u201d she said, asking to be identified only by her middle name, Marie, because she did not want people outside her immediate family to know about her abortion.At a time when access to abortion is being restricted on many fronts, advocates say being able to terminate a pregnancy through telemedicine and mail-order drugs would provide a welcome new option for women. Opponents of abortion find the concept dangerous and deeply disturbing.Having the pills delivered to her home in Hawaii meant that Marie could avoid the cost and time of traveling by plane to the nearest abortion clinic, over 100 miles away in Honolulu or Maui. Once she received them, she set the package aside for a week in her bedroom, waiting until she could schedule time off from her job at McDonald\u2019s.The first pill, as expected, had little effect. The next morning, with her mother at her home to watch her toddler, she took the second. Almost immediately, the bleeding and cramping began. Within three hours, her eight-week pregnancy was over. She described the pain as a five on a 10-point scale. That night she cooked dinner for her family, and the next day she went back to work.The study Marie participated in is being conducted in four states \u2014 Hawaii, New York, Oregon and Washington. It is being funded and organized by Gynuity Health Projects, a nonprofit research group focused on reproductive health services that seeks to improve women\u2019s access to medical abortions. The F.D.A. has allowed the experiment. Women learn about it when contacting the abortion clinics in the study and other health providers who are aware of the trial.Danco Laboratories, the company that makes the pills, has no plans to seek wider distribution of the medication either through mail-order pharmacies or physical ones, a spokeswoman said. It would have to seek the F.D.A.\u2019s permission to do so; the agency can also ask companies to change how their drugs are distributed.\u201cAbortion is a politically charged issue in this country, and there is an extra degree of caution,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Abby Long, explaining that research would be needed to support changing the drug\u2019s distribution.Of the first 12 women who participated in the study, all in Hawaii, 11 reported they had no complications and one did not take the pills, researchers said. Ten who completed surveys afterward said they were satisfied with the service and would recommend it to a friend, according to the researchers.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely an important step forward to expanding access to abortion that is safe and effective and creating options for women,\u201d said Susan Wood, director of the Jacobs Institute of Women\u2019s Health at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C. She was not involved in the study.Anti-abortion groups are outraged by the experiment, and their concerns may well carry greater momentum in Washington in the coming months with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and Donald Trump winning the presidency on a sharply anti-abortion platform.\u201cWe have grave concerns about handing out dangerous, life-ending drugs without medical supervision because women face great risks for chemical abortions,\u201d said Kristi Hamrick, spokeswoman for Americans United for Life.Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, also raised safety concerns.\u201cIf pills are sent through the mail, who are they supposed to call if they have a problem?\u201d she said.\u201cThere are serious downsides from the pills,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cand just talking to someone over a computer and sending pills in the mail, to me, that is just reckless.\u201dThe process does not allow women to avoid the doctor\u2019s office entirely. Using a video hookup on a home computer, a woman first consults with a doctor (or other clinician such as a nurse practitioner) at one of three participating abortion clinics who evaluates her medical history and explains how to take abortion pills and what to expect afterward. She must then get tests including an ultrasound and blood work.If the tests show she is eligible for the study, the clinic sends her a package with pills and instructions via overnight mail. After taking them, she has some additional tests, such as an ultrasound to verify that the abortion is complete and also a phone consultation to review the results.In the United States, the F.D.A. has approved medical abortion pills for use only in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, while surgical abortions can be done later than that.The American abortion study using overnight mail comes nearly a decade after Iowa became the first state to offer medical abortion counseling via telemedicine from a physician. But in Iowa and the three states that followed \u2014 Alaska, Maine and Minnesota \u2014 women must still go to a clinic that stocks mifepristone to receive the pills.If the study shows the telemedicine and mail approach works, that could encourage the F.D.A. to stop restrictions on mifepristone, Gynuity\u2019s principal investigator, Dr. Elizabeth Raymond, said.\u201cAll kinds of dangerous drugs are prescribed and available at pharmacies, including drugs for heart disease and Viagra,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no justification for why this safe drug should not be in pharmacies now.\u201d\u201cWhile this has the potential for being the future of abortion delivery for a good segment of the population, that vision might not be fulfilled due to the politics around the issue and restrictions in many states,\u201d said Jessica Arons, president and chief executive of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project in Washington, an advocacy group.This article was produced in collaboration with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Years of easy money from central banks have helped inflate the prices of just about everything an investor can buy, like stocks or property.\u201cI think that clearly we are in an asset bubble,\u201d Mr. Shan said in a phone interview from Hong Kong.So what should investors do? Mr. Shan recommended a return to the basics. His firm, with $16 billion under management in funds that specialize in fields like private equity and real estate, is looking for value in areas still growing in a sluggish world economy.\u201cWe are not chasing bubbles as many of our peers do,\u201d said Mr. Shan, a former professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cI only want to look at the fundamentals. I want to know how much money this business makes.\u201dIn that, Mr. Shan is positioned well. PAG focuses mainly on investments in or related to Asia, where the fortunes of China, India and other countries remain buoyant even as the global economy sags.\u201cIf you look around the world, Asia is where the growth is,\u201d he said.Mr. Shan said that China, where he was born, \u201cis the most interesting market because of its growth.\u201dBut that growth has declined. In the third quarter, China\u2019s gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent, in contrast with the 9 percent to 10 percent the country enjoyed for years. The downturn has intensified the struggles of what Mr. Shan called China\u2019s \u201cbad economy\u201d \u2014 mainly manufacturing and heavy industries, which have too many factories and too much debt.Mr. Shan, however, also sees a \u201cgood economy\u201d in China. As the government tries to shift the country\u2019s engine of growth away from investing in steel mills and apartment blocks, it is encouraging more private consumption. That is opening opportunities in areas that cater to Chinese consumers.\u201cChina has a split personality at this moment,\u201d Mr. Shan said. But \u201cthe good economy remains quite resilient in spite of the bad economy.\u201dMr. Shan, who once served as a senior partner at the investment firm TPG, is focusing his money on companies that can benefit from China\u2019s rising consumerism. In October, PAG\u2019s private-equity arm invested an undisclosed amount in the Paradise Group, based in Singapore, which operates restaurants across China and Southeast Asia.In August, it spent about $250 million to acquire Golden Apple, which runs a chain of private schools from Chengdu, China\u2019s western metropolis.In its most prominent deal, PAG in April joined Apex Technology, a Chinese producer of ink cartridge components, and others in the acquisition of the printer maker Lexmark International, based in Kentucky, a transaction valued at $3.6 billion. The deal was appealing to PAG, in part because the new owners hope to raise the profile of Lexmark printers in the Chinese marketplace.Mr. Shan also wants to take advantage of some of Asia\u2019s bad economy. With debt levels continuing to rise in China, PAG is developing a strategy for buying and profiting from bad loans at Chinese banks. He also says his firm has generated good returns from buying distressed debt backed by real estate in the region. PAG, which has 30 percent of its capital in real estate, is still sniffing around for reasonably priced property as well.\u201cWe invest in real estate where the price is not out of whack,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is in times like this that you really can differentiate among investors who will be more focused on fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cwho invests along with the rest of the bandwagon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Traders Bet on Big Stimulus Spending. Congress May Not Go Along.", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stock traders celebrating Donald J. Trump\u2019s election have been bidding up equity prices on a risky bet: that the new president will steer congressional Republicans in a U-turn away from their tightfisted fiscal policies \u2014 and bring Democrats along for the ride.The hope, reflected in financial firms\u2019 postelection tip sheets for investors, is for a robust program of tax cuts and new spending, especially for infrastructure projects.That combination could bring soaring stock prices back down to earth.\u201cMarket expectations of quick fiscal expansion may be running ahead of political and legislative realities,\u201d Alec Phillips, a Goldman Sachs economist, recently cautioned clients in an analysis, a point he reiterated in an interview.Mr. Phillips suggested to clients that \u201ca modest infrastructure package\u201d is more likely. But even that probably would not come as soon in 2017 as markets seem to anticipate, given the political and budgetary hurdles ahead.Mr. Trump is unleashing a debate within the Republican Party that will challenge its fiscal orthodoxy against spending and deficits \u2014 and test how fully he has commandeered the party. Conservative hostility to stimulus spending, proposed by both President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama, helped spawn what became the Tea Party movement.For evidence of just how significant the fiscal policy shift could be for Republicans, consider the difference between the bottom lines of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign platform and the most recent House-passed budget outline.Republicans\u2019 anti-spending bent was evident within days of the election, when the lame-duck Congress convened to finish the annual government-funding bill. Hard-line conservatives in the House publicly warned that Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s job would be in danger if he compromised with Mr. Obama on additional spending.He has countered that Congress last year passed, and Mr. Obama signed, the largest highway bill since the 1990s. But the roughly $60 billion a year the law provides over five years for roads and mass transit is far less than Mr. Obama wanted \u2014 or Mr. Trump has proposed \u2014 and would not cover public works unrelated to transportation, like water systems, levees and schools.Yet with Mr. Trump\u2019s election, just the prospect of the federal government\u2019s belt-loosening has cheered not just markets, but also economists who otherwise worry that the president-elect\u2019s trade and immigration proposals, if realized, could hurt the economy.Lately those complaints have mounted, spurred by a new economic development: the prospect, forecast by the Fed, of lower-than-expected interest rates for perhaps years. Lower borrowing costs for public investments could put people to work now and provide long-run returns for the economy and society, a range of proponents say. So Congress and the White House should invest more for now, they say, and worry less about deficits.\u201cBorrowing, especially for investment, passes a cost-benefit test,\u201d he added.In an interview, Mr. Elmendorf, now dean of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, said the \u201coverwhelming\u201d consensus of economists was that Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act had bolstered economic output and employment.\u201cToo many political leaders don\u2019t understand the importance of fiscal policy in fighting recessions and making crucial public investments,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the place where the federal government does any genuine investment to improve the economy in the future,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cAnd the caps really just codified what was going on anyway, which is that the large amount of entitlement growth is just pushing all of the sort of basic infrastructure, research, education, national security out of the budget.\u201dYet the sort of projects he named suggest a need for direct government spending. Dangling tax credits to private investors is not likely to spur them to undertake public works that do not readily offer a profit stream, critics say; instead, tax breaks of as much as $1 trillion over 10 years could reward investors for endeavors like energy pipelines that would have been built anyway.Congressional Republicans are more likely to favor tax credits over spending. But Mr. Trump\u2019s trillion-dollar tax credit proposal has its conservative critics. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said he was \u201cenraged\u201d by it, given its cost and the claim that it would pay for itself through growth.Democrats prominent in the debate, such as Representative John Delaney of Maryland, say they will oppose a tax credit without new funding for public works, and perhaps a long-discussed infrastructure bank to leverage public and private investment. Steven Mnuchin, a senior member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team and a possible nominee for Treasury secretary, told reporters that the president-elect was \u201clooking at the creation of an infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure investments.\u201dIn the past, Mr. Ryan had negotiated with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who will be the Senate Democratic leader, on a deal to increase infrastructure spending if Democrats supported reducing the tax on multinational corporations\u2019 foreign profits so they would bring the money to the United States to invest.But they could not reach agreement, and now the infrastructure-tax trade-off could be moot. Some Republicans say that, with Mr. Trump\u2019s election, they would rather use tax revenues from corporations\u2019 repatriated profits to offset the cost of reducing corporations\u2019 overall tax rates.Advertisement"}

Pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some far-off part of the world or the impact on their portfolio.Real investors focus on the things they can control, like saving a bit more next year, keeping their investment costs low, not paying fees unless it\u2019s necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low.6. Pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have short-term impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks.Real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than 180 percent in the last 20 years.So ask yourself this: Isn\u2019t it finally time to stop pretending now?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ahead of Trump Presidency, Global Investors Sell Bonds and Grab Stocks", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byGlobal investors have rendered their verdict on Donald J. Trump as president: Sell government bonds and pile into stocks that will benefit the most from a resurgent United States economy.From Indonesia to the United States, government bonds are undergoing a sharp sell-off as investors \u2014 large sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds, as well as the accounts of American retirees \u2014 restructure investment portfolios to try to capture the fruits of what they expect will be a free-spending Trump presidency.Across the board, the yields of these bonds, which move up as their prices decline, are pushing higher. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note \u2014 a benchmark for mortgages and other lending rates \u2014 has risen to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent in less than two months. For such a widely held and traded security, that is an unusually abrupt move.Other safe-haven bonds have had similar reactions. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year notes has gone to positive. In just a week, it has gone to 0.35 percent from negative 0.15 percent.And the Swiss 10-year is now on the cusp of paying investors to borrow money after close to two years of trading in negative interest rate territory.If the trend continues, it will signify a jarring philosophical shift from the view put forward by many prominent economists, like the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, that the global economy is destined to stagnate for some time under a regime of low growth, zero interest rates and deflation.A series of earlier signals pointed to a move away from bonds in the weeks before the election, including higher wages in the United States and signs of increased inflation in Europe.But what has resonated deeply with countless risk-averse investors who have been camping out in government bonds for years now is Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to have the federal government take responsibility for stimulating the economy \u2014 in the form of infrastructure investments and tax cuts \u2014 away from global central banks.\u201cIt does not surprise me that the markets have reacted this way,\u201d said Luciano Siracusano, chief investment strategist for WisdomTree asset management in New York. \u201cThis is a very pro-growth agenda, and we have not had that in a while.\u201dAfter the financial crisis unleashed an unprecedented wave of activism on the part of global central banks, investors the world over followed the lead of central bankers and loaded up on long-term government bonds.Until recently, it has been a no-fault trade, with global growth stagnant, governments divided and political risk omnipresent.The numbers tell the story.According to J. P. Morgan, central banks and financial institutions in developed markets are sitting on $26 trillion in bonds, or 49 percent of the tradable market for these securities. That figure is up from 40 percent in 2002, and it highlights the extent to which worries about deflation and stagnation (political and economic) have resulted in a nonstop bull market for government bonds.Most investors, and many policy makers as well, have become fed up with this so-called stagnation trade and they have been calling for lower taxes and more government spending not just in the United States but also in Europe and Japan.\u201cInvestors have been frustrated with the limits of monetary policy,\u201d said Michael Zezas, a bond strategist with Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere has been a presumption of the necessity of fiscal stimulus. With a Trump presidency, the political rationale aligns with the economic rationale.\u201dSoaring bond yields are not the only way that this new \u201creflation trade\u201d is playing out. Investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like copper, the price of which was up 20 percent in the last month.Bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest rates, which help their lending margins.Even the long-suffering stock price of Deutsche Bank, for example, has bounced back by nearly 20 percent in the last week.More broadly, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 3.8 percent last week, while on Monday, the major market measures ended largely flat.Of course, such an investment trend carries with it serious risks. If bond yields shoot up too starkly, investors in the stock market will get jittery and all the fast money that has recently piled into stocks could turn tail, leaving chaos in its wake.For example, $22 billion has poured into exchange-traded funds that invest in the United States stock market in the last three days alone.It is worth recalling that the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies, was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar \u2014 which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now.A Trump-inspired inflationary surge could also force the Federal Reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates, a dynamic that no investor wants to see.The trick, of course, for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and, in addition to pushing for a building boom, cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures. That could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control.For now, such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in Mr. Trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth, low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny, all of which pushed them into the safety and security of low-yielding government bonds.Some even suggest that a President Trump will not be unlike President Reagan in showing a devotion to bedrock laissez-faire principles, even if many of those philosophies were called into question when American investment banks nearly torpedoed the global economy.\u201cThe global impact of this stuff is that once you start it, you can\u2019t stop it,\u201d said Arthur Laffer, a supply-side evangelist who advised Ronald Reagan and was among a core group of economists who cobbled together Mr. Trump\u2019s own tax-slashing program. \u201cThat is the way it was with Reagan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
