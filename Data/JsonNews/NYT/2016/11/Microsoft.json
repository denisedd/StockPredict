{"Headline": "Protecting Your Digital Life in 9 Easy Steps", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byEditors\u2019 note: This article, originally published in November 2016, was updated May 16, 2017. There are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information.\u201cWhen I use the term \u2018attacker\u2019 I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven\u2019t given express permission to,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a hacker, a corporation or even a government.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended. We added a few of our own, based on additional interviews and news events.Encryption is just a fancy word for scrambling your data so no one can understand what it says without a key. It\u2019s useful for protecting information on your computer, but also for making sure prying eyes can\u2019t snoop on text messages and emails on your phone. But encryption is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around.\u201cYou can be sure by looking at the code that they\u2019re not doing anything weird with your data,\u201d Mr. Larson said.\u201cIn general, the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible,\u201d said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the organization that developed Signal.In May, cybercriminals used ransomware, a type of software that locks down people\u2019s data and threatens to destroy it if the attacker is not paid, to hijack hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.Also, make sure to update your software regularly, particularly your operating system. Frequently, software companies will release updates that patch bugs and vulnerabilities when they are discovered. But outdated or unauthorized copies of the software may still contain the security flaws. This is a particular problem with computers using Microsoft Windows, the most popular operating system in the world and therefore a big target for hackers.Your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket, but Mr. Larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information.Even if your data were password-protected, someone who gained access to your computer \u201cwould have access to all your files if they were unencrypted.\u201dBackups will protect your photos, documents and other data not only from a technical malfunction, but from ransomware and other malicious hacking. Just make sure to test or check your backups periodically.But making up new combinations all the time is irritating and inconvenient, tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple. That is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes. It\u2019s far better to create really strong ones for every login. And new passwords can pose security risks, because it\u2019s hard to remember complex ones, so you are tempted to write them down.That can lead to a lot of hard-to-remember passwords.As far as making passwords up goes: Don\u2019t be precious about it. Use a random word (an object near you, for example), scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks. If you\u2019re writing passwords down or using a password manager, you don\u2019t have to worry about making them memorable.When you turn on two-factor authentication, anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security: a code that is sent to your phone via text message. (Though sadly, not through Signal.)You should also set two-factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites where it\u2019s available. But email is the most important account, since many sites use email for password recovery, a fact that hackers have exploited. Once they have access to your email, they can get access to banking, social media, data backups and work accounts.And this is a good time to note that you should always find out whether the Wi-Fi network you are using is secure. Public networks \u2014 and even private networks without security keys \u2014 often are not.VPNs create an encrypted \u201ctunnel\u201d through which all of your data is sent, meaning other computers or devices on the same network as your computer can\u2019t make sense of it. The only people who have the \u201ckey\u201d in this case is your computer and the VPN provider you connect to when you turn it on. This is especially useful on public Wi-Fi networks, like at the airport or coffee shop, where you don\u2019t know who else is using the same network.This feature, available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, among other browsers, may sound secure, but pay attention to the clear warnings.On Chrome, the second paragraph of the \u201cincognito\u201d home screen spells it out for you.\u201cYou aren\u2019t invisible,\u201d it says. \u201cGoing incognito doesn\u2019t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider or the websites you visit.\u201d In reality, it simply keeps your computer from keeping a record of where you go. It doesn\u2019t stop sites from tracking and collecting data on you, and doesn\u2019t do anything to protect your online privacy or security. It does, however, keep anyone using your computer from knowing where you went.He said, however, that he was not paranoid.\u201cGoogle is built on the hacker ethic, and they have put principle above profits in some aspects,\u201d he said.But he also acknowledged that he meets \u201cpeople all the time who are extremely skeptical of any large software organization, and I think that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d There are trade-offs. Google\u2019s search results are more useful and accurate than competitors\u2019 precisely because of the ways it collects and analyzes information about its customers\u2019 searches.That way, if someone has found a way to compromise your computer, they cannot spy on you.Nicole Perlroth contributed expertise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Are No New Ideas, Only Rediscoveries", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Around 1900, a century before Tesla\u2019s Model S, there were more than 30,000 electric cars registered in the United States. In London, passengers were being ferried around by a small fleet of electric taxis, nicknamed Hummingbirds for the distinctive whir of their engines. So begins \u201cRethink: The Surprising History of New Ideas,\u201d the British journalist Steven Poole\u2019s attack on what he calls a \u201cSilicon Valley ideology\u201d: the notion that every great innovation of today is a \u201cflash of inspiration,\u201d an invention of \u201csomething from nothing.\u201d In an anecdote-rich tour through the centuries, Poole traces \u201cnew\u201d ideas in mental health back to the Stoics; dates the invention of the e-cigarette to 1965; and tells us that the leech is now an F.D.A.-approved \u201cmedical device,\u201d used for, among other things, preventing blood from pooling after reconstructive plastic surgery. We live in \u201can age of rediscovery,\u201d Poole writes. \u201cOld is the new new.\u201dPoole\u2019s strategy is to categorize. He assembles chapters on ideas that should have died but won\u2019t (\u201czombie ideas,\u201d he calls them), on bad ideas that led to good ones (\u201csteppingstones\u201d) and so on. The method, though, yields little in the way of insight. A survey of ahead-of-their-time ideas, for example, leads to the underwhelming conclusion that the world would have been a better place if folks had figured things out sooner.And Poole, perversely, finishes every chapter with a recapitulation, each a dispiriting reminder of how little his argument has progressed, delivered in the tone of Microsoft Word\u2019s old AutoSummary function: \u201cMany people died needlessly of cancer in the decades after the electronic cigarette had been invented, and before its eventual rediscovery, but the new version may be a revolution in public health. Similarly, the rejection of atomism for so long may well have delayed the development of lifesaving technologies, but at least now we enjoy its benefits in molecular pharmacology and other fields. And in future the embrace of edible insects could, according to its proponents, forestall major famines.\u201dPoole, a language columnist for The Guardian, is the author of five other books. He\u2019s a brisk writer, and his prose can be charming: In a review of a book on eating meat, he writes, \u201cIf I ate only animals I killed myself, I would live on a rather uninspiring diet of clothes moths and the occasional mosquito.\u201d Here, though, things never get moving because he shirks the basics of narrative writing: character, scene, emotional connection. I was eager to know Grace Hopper, an early software developer braving a man\u2019s world, but Poole describes her only as a \u201crebel pioneer.\u201d His field reports lean heavily on perfunctory stock settings (\u201cdark, wintry afternoon,\u201d \u201ccrisp spring afternoon,\u201d \u201ca light-filled studio\u201d) and then devolve into pages of stultifying quotation.The whole project has a slapdash, cynical vibe. On the first page, Poole introduces us to the Scottish chemist Robert Davidson and credits him with building, in 1837, \u201cthe first known electric car.\u201d In fact, it was a locomotive. In lieu of transitions, he reaches for easy, but quite awkward, rhetorical questions. \u201cBut how exactly could the inheritance of acquired characteristics take place?\u201d Two pages later: \u201cBut how exactly do we establish that inheritance of stress and depression can happen in humans?\u201d A writer more wary of the familiar might have resisted the urge to remind us of the quote from Ecclesiastes, that there is \u201cno new thing under the sun,\u201d or of George Santayana\u2019s admonition that those who do not know the past \u201care condemned to repeat it.\u201d His sentences include generous helpings of phrases like \u201ccutting-edge\u201d and \u201chigh-tech\u201d and other mainstays of weak-sauce hype. By the final pages, when, I kid you not, Poole riffs on humanity\u2019s future in the stars, it becomes clear that \u201cRethink\u201d will never answer its existential question: Yes, old ideas are rediscovered, but where, for readers living in a golden age of vinyl records and home pickling, is the surprise in that?Gareth Cook, a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blockbuster Deals in a Race to Stay Ahead of the Competition", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWorld-changing corporate transactions just seem to keep coming. It won\u2019t last, however.The number of multibillion-dollar deals announced in recent weeks is staggering by any measure, particularly in an election year, when the uncertainty tends to drive away deals.Time Warner\u2019s & AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion proposed tie-up has dominated the headlines as consumers latch on to tales of media dominance, but in October alone, $329 billion worth of deal activity in the United States has been announced, according to Thomson Reuters, a record. The worldwide number, $483.1 billion, is also no slouch and the fifth highest on record.Other gigantic deals include General Electric\u2019s combination of its oil business with that of Baker Hughes, British American Tobacco\u2019s $47 billion takeover offer for Reynolds American and Qualcomm\u2019s $38.5 billion deal for NXP Semiconductors. One of the biggest deals this year is Bayer\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto.Looming in the future are potential other big deals like a recombination of Viacom and CBS.Conventional wisdom is that this activity is all about cheap money. Interest rates are at 400-year lows and the world is awash with liquidity as investors try to find anything that yields a decent rate. Capital markets are so well developed that AT&T can seek to borrow $40 billion to buy Time Warner without missing a step. The days of the financial crisis are well and truly over as lenders are again jumping to lend \u2014 albeit at lower leverage rates. (We did learn something from the crisis, thankfully.)The other broad force driving this merger boomlet is confidence. The worldwide economy is choppy, but we are actually in a period of stability. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has come, and though it may prove to be a disaster for the British economy, it has not brought the trade bloc down with it.Indeed, since the British referendum on June 23, the British stock market is up about 15 percent. The decline in the value of the pound has spurred deal-making, like Softbank\u2019s $32 billion acquisition of the British chip maker ARM Holdings.Forget about shareholder value; the top priority of any chief executive is to remain employed. And in a sluggish economy with few obvious opportunities, a big merger has become the only way to acquire growth or a new product or new technology and ensure that the chief executive holds on to power.The challenge facing chief executives is compounded by the changes wrought by technology. Companies, particularly in technology, media and telecommunications, are racing to keep up and avoid being outmaneuvered. Microsoft\u2019s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn can be viewed solely as a defensive play \u2014 keeping its global reach on the internet.This trend has also been apparent in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology deal making of the past years as companies bought drugs instead of developing them.And tech itself continues to produce new challengers and spur further deal activity. The potential initial public stock offering of Snap at very likely an extraordinary valuation will push other tech companies to go public, generating more money in the pockets of the tech elite to make acquisitions.But the result of all this merger activity is a broad push toward oligopoly, meaning industries are dominated by just a few big players.Take media and telecommunications. We are heading into a world that is focused on video as people spend their lives on their smartphones, at least for now. The AT&T-Time Warner combination is built on this premise as AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, bets that the money in telecom is in content.In this new media world, there will probably be four or five big providers of content, two of which will certainly be Facebook and Google. AT&T is making its play to stay in that elite league through its proposed acquisition.A cynic might see the AT&T deal and others getting ahead of any changes to our inadequate antitrust laws. In a low-growth economy, getting bigger and squeezing out competitors is a clear way to success.Yet the monopolistic power play has changed. In the case of AT&T, its businesses do not overlap with those of Time Warner. This is a so-called vertical merger, which is harder to stop, and there is little history of the government doing so.It is how Facebook has been allowed to preserve its dominance by acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 two emerging potential rivals that were swallowed before they could challenge the Google/Facebook dominance.You may have noticed that the \u201cbigger is better\u201d mantra is not politically popular at the moment. Republicans and Democrats alike have called for regulators to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal.In Washington, you can expect not just greater enforcement but possibly a change in the laws to focus on corporate giants that dominate a market through their immense size.So there is a rush to get deals through before the laws change. Either way, things are not getting better. And the risk of being left behind because of technological disruption and change is driving companies to make acquisitions faster. It is also a trend that, not surprisingly, affects larger companies. Thomson Reuters reports there have been 615 deals year to date, down from 967 in 2014, so the deals are concentrated at the higher end.This trend is spurring the return of the oft-derided conglomerates that came about in the 1960s. As was the case then, instead of growth and survival, we may just end up with bloat.At the moment, it is hard to find anything that can slow the merger train. Everything is going right. But it is in these times that perhaps caution is necessary. The merger market has always been cyclical. The current is moving forward, but sentiment can change. In addition, the risk of disruption still exists, whether it be the United States election, renewed uncertainty in Europe or global turmoil from Russia. And there is the prospect of higher interest rates, and how that will affect cheap deal financing is anybody\u2019s guess.If we have learned anything from more than 100 years of corporate mergers, it is that the lurking influences eventually emerge and the current trends driving all of this merger activity are unlikely to last. Let\u2019s hope it ends slowly and not with a sudden burst.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips Take Different Paths to \u2018Sold!\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byIt was difficult to escape a sense of unreality in Manhattan last week.High in his eponymous 664-foot-high tower in Midtown, a real estate tycoon and erstwhile reality show host, having just been elected as the 45th president, was appointing members of his administration while protesters down below chanted their disapproval.At the same time, the three big international auction houses were trying to persuade the superrich to buy some of the world\u2019s most expensive art. By and large, they succeeded.\u201cEveryone has been in the dark about how the market would react to the craziness that has been going on in the outside world,\u201d said David Nisinson, a private art dealer based in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re not back to 2007, but this must have a positive effect,\u201d he said about the success of the five evening auctions, which all registered selling rates of more than 80 percent.But all three auction houses, using contrasting strategies, did manage to coax onto the market significant paintings in the $20 million to $50 million range, and ensure they found buyers.Phillips posted the most improved results. Its Wednesday evening auction of 20th-century and contemporary works raised $111.2 million, more than double the $46.6 million from the equivalent sale in May.The auction house, privately owned by Mercury, a luxury retail group based in Russia, has recently made a number of high-profile hires, including Robert Manley, a former deputy chairman at Christie\u2019s, and Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby\u2019s former worldwide head of contemporary art, who starts in March.Edward Dolman, the chairman and chief executive of Phillips, described the result of his sale as \u201ca significant step up in a market that has contracted.\u201dBut the auction houses\u2019 reliance on third-party guarantees to source and sell big-ticket artworks, particularly at Phillips and Sotheby\u2019s, does raise the question of how much that $25.6 million for the Richter represented a \u201ctrue\u201d market price.Values can be inflated when auction houses offer competitive guarantees to secure major consignments. These guarantee can then be transferred to a third party, who will either buy a work at a sale, or be rewarded for their unsuccessful bidding. More recently, some third-party guarantors \u2014 called \u201cirrevocable bidders\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 have also been paid fees if they are the purchaser. These confidential arrangements, denoted by symbols in the catalog, can have the effect of deterring bidding in the salesroom.\u201cIt\u2019s a sold picture, with uplift if possible,\u201d said Alan Hobart, director of the Pyms Gallery in London. \u201cThe price is arranged by the vendor and is normally high. It\u2019s become very opaque,\u201d added Mr. Hobart, who paid $8.45 million for Picasso\u2019s unguaranteed 1951 bronze sculpture, \u201cTete de Femme,\u201d at Sotheby\u2019s Nov. 14 auction of Impressionist and modern art.Bidders at Sotheby\u2019s were similarly lukewarm when Edvard Munch\u2019s 1902 Symbolist masterwork, \u201cGirls on the Bridge,\u201d was offered \u2014 with a third-party irrevocable bid \u2014 as the star of an otherwise relatively thin 42-lot Impressionist and modern auction. Estimated at a heady $50 million, this was bought for $54.5 million by the guarantor.In the case of both the Richter and the Munch, the third-party buyer was also paid a fee by the auction house. Following an approach from Sotheby\u2019s, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs recommended in September that \u201cnet\u201d prices reflecting buyer discounts should be published after such sales, and all three houses have complied. The buyer of the Richter received about $1.6 million from Phillips; the buyer of the Munch $2 million from Sotheby\u2019s, according to post-auction calculations.\u201cThe air has got quite thin at the top,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. \u201cThere used to be at least two bidders on most of the lots, but now there is usually only one. Guarantees do provide cover for the lots and give a sense of security. But what do the totals mean in terms of profit? We\u2019re blind.\u201dWith 16 of the Ameses\u2019 works covered by third-party \u201cirrevocable\u201d bids, competition was conspicuously measured. But a sumptuous red-hued 1986 Richter abstract, \u201cA.B. Still,\u201d which the Ameses bought at Sotheby\u2019s in 1991 for $264,000, was doggedly pursued by two telephone bidders to a top price of $34 million, against an estimate of $20 million.Over all, the 79 lots of the Ames Collection raised $131.3 million, a total which would suggest that Sotheby\u2019s did make a profit on the guarantee.Similarly, the following evening at Christie\u2019s Impressionist and modern sale of 48 lots, Claude Monet\u2019s 1891 \u201cGrainstack\u201d \u2014 a spectacular sunset from the artist\u2019s first set of series paintings, also offered without a guarantee \u2014 set off a 14-minute bidding duel that ended in a telephone buyer paying $81.4 million with fees, also an auction high for the artist and the highest auction price this year.Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, the historic rivals of the auction world, are taking different approaches to winning consignments. The privately owned Christie\u2019s has drawn back from the high-rolling guarantees that bought it market dominance in 2015 and is now luring sellers with the promise of higher prices in competitive bidding at its auctions.With Phillips now in the mix, three-way bidding for consignments of blue-chip works is becoming the new reality at the top end of the auction market. This is good news for owners of valuable art, if not bidders in salesrooms.\u201cI\u2019m very happy, said a smiling Fran\u00e7ois Odermatt, a collector based in Montreal, just before Phillips\u2019s auction last Wednesday. \u201cThe more competition the better.\u201dAn earlier version of the article mischaracterized the status of Cheyenne Westphal at Phillips. She will take up a position there in March; she has not already joined the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Leaders Support Steps to Rescue Climate", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan car alliance, gives a clear reason his company is taking the lead in developing moderately priced electric cars.The rules governing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for climate change are going to get stricter, he said. If so, that is bad news for the future of vehicles powered by emissions-producing gasoline and other fossil fuels.\u201cYou know that the only technology that will allow the industry to continue to prosper is zero emissions or very low emissions, \u201c he said.While there is much skepticism on the eve of the meetings about climate change in Marrakesh, Morocco, known as COP22, about whether the world is taking big enough steps to prevent temperatures from rising to dangerous levels, the changing attitudes of business leaders are one reason for cautious optimism.While governments may make the rules, the responsibility will likely fall on businesses to implement energy- and emissions-reducing changes in how they operate and the products they provide to society.Many business leaders say they recognize climate change as a serious problem and that they are under pressure to demonstrate to their customers and employees, as well as governments and regulators, that they are doing something about it.\u201cI think the demand comes from the people who buy our products,\u201d said Trisa Thompson, vice president for corporate social responsibility at Dell, the computer maker.Dell is taking some energy-saving steps, like moving away from delivering computers on daily Boeing 747 flights from China to the United States. Instead, the company is putting the machines on boats.Dell is also delving extensively into what is known as the circular economy, reusing the plastics in its computers and even exploring the possibility of using plastic debris gathered in polluted estuaries in its packaging.Ms. Thompson and Mr. Ghosn spoke at a two-day New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference in Paris that ended Friday.At the conference, technology companies like Dell and Microsoft said that they saw many business opportunities in the need to save energy and cut emissions.Rob Bernard, chief environmental strategist at Microsoft, said the world was on the cusp of what he called a fourth industrial revolution and that there was a \u201chealthy paranoia\u201d in most executive suites that if companies did not make better use of resources they would find themselves out of business.The tech companies say they can make a big contribution through digital strategies, including those that save energy or manage it better. \u201cWe believe technology is the backbone of the changes that will solve the world\u2019s big hairy problems,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.Even what seem to be very traditional companies apparently are capable of change.Enel, the large Italian utility, is reinventing itself as a much more nimble company focused on renewables and services rather than building large-scale utility projects.Investing directly in renewables is becoming a larger and more stable business, executives said.Torben Moger Pedersen, chief executive of PensionDanmark, a Danish pension fund, said the firm had invested about 3 billion euros, or $3.33 billion, in various renewable projects.\u201cInvestors looking for opportunities to invest in large-ticket projects can relatively easily find them out there,\u201d he said.Clean energy sources, like wind and solar energy, represented more than half of the new electric power capacity installed around the world last year, according to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy security group, which has added climate change to its portfolio.Yet, leaders of major oil companies warned that despite the powerful shift that was unquestionably occurring, oil and gas would be needed for decades to come.Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, Europe\u2019s largest oil company, said that while Shell was investing in biofuels and other renewable energy, there was no alternative to oil and gas that would pay the company\u2019s shareholders the large dividends they expected.\u201cAt this point in time, of the $30 billion that we invest each year, I cannot find a significant percentage to invest in renewable projects simply because they are not there,\u201d he told the conference.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the chief environmental strategist at Microsoft.

In Auction World, Phillips Is Making Strides", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byBut by positioning itself as a boutique house that would show the relatively modest collection some marketing love, bring to bear the expertise of its new team of contemporary-art specialists \u2014 and include an undisclosed guarantee for the Basquiat, \u201cUntitled (Devil\u2019s Head)\u201d \u2014 Phillips won the consignment. (The piece sold for $3.6 million on a low estimate of $3 million.)Phillips\u2019s forthright use of guarantees, as well as its roster of new specialists able to attract high-quality material, succeeded in making the auction house a player this season.\u201cThey definitely stepped up their game,\u201d said Alex Rotter, who recently left Sotheby\u2019s to become chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s Americas. \u201cThey\u2019re building something that needs to be seriously considered in the 20th-century and contemporary art world.\u201dPhillips was the only auction house whose contemporary and 20th-century total was up this season, over the equivalent sale last year (by 66 percent, to $111.2 million from $67 million).Phillips\u2019s sale was also 92 percent successful and captured 17 percent of the market share for all contemporary evening sales in November, a 10 percent increase from a year ago.\u201cThat last sale was by far the best sale they\u2019ve had,\u201d said the art dealer Larry Gagosian. \u201cYou opened the catalog, and there were things you really wanted \u2014 it did not look like a bunch of things dealers were trying to unload. The material looked fresh.\u201dThe auction house, which is privately owned by the Russian luxury retail group Mercury, is investing and expanding rapidly in Asia; on Sunday, it held its first full contemporary-art sale in Hong Kong, which totaled $19.6 million (the low estimate was $13.8 million) and had a respectable 82 percent success rate.To be sure, there was not a flurry of bidding throughout the November sale. Phillips\u2019s top lot \u2014 Gerhard Richter\u2019s 1963 painting \u201cD\u00fcsenj\u00e4ger,\u201d consigned by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen \u2014 sold on a low-estimate bid of $25.5 million with fees to its third-party guarantor, based in Asia. (The buyer received about $1.6 million from Phillips for serving as the guarantor.)But the auction house also sold its first work by the Abstract Expressionist painter Clyfford Still after multiple bids \u2014 albeit to the guarantor.\u201cThere was quite a bit of bidding on quite a few lots at the sale,\u201d said Edward Dolman, who became chairman and chief executive officer of Phillips in 2014, \u201cbut the air remains thin right at the top end.\u201dOver the last year, the two big auction houses have been wrestling with the issue of competitive guarantees: They are reluctant to offer these minimum prices, which can eat into profits, but are also compelled to give them to secure blue-chip consignments.Phillips, however, does not hesitate to rely on guarantees, even as it also tries to offload some of the risk to third parties. Thirteen of the 37 lots in the November sale had guarantees, 10 by third parties and three by the house.\u201cGuarantees are here to stay \u2014 it\u2019s something all our clients want to consider,\u201d Mr. Dolman said. \u201cSuccess is in making the right decisions around those guarantees \u2014 making sure the risks are laid off, if you can lay them off, and not expose the company to huge losses if you get it wrong.\u201dPhillips acknowledges that these are early days in Mr. Dolman\u2019s tenure; many of the specialists he has lured away from other houses only recently took up their new positions after completing their noncompete agreements.In 20th-century and contemporary art, this crew includes the Christie\u2019s alumni Jean-Paul Engelen and Robert Manley, and the former Sotheby\u2019s experts Scott Nussbaum and Jonathan Crockett (who is based in Asia). Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby\u2019s former worldwide head of contemporary art, and Marianne Hoet, previously an international director at Christie\u2019s, begin positions at Phillips next year.\u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand about this business is it needs an absolute core of infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Dolman said.\u201cI was asked to develop a long-term plan for the arts sector in Qatar and had completed that work,\u201d Mr. Dolman said. \u201cThe change of emir certainly acted as a catalyst for my decision, as the priorities of the new government became uncertain. The old emir had been a great supporter of the arts in Qatar.\u201dPhillips took some risks in its contemporary evening sale this season that paid off, like featuring two lesser-known artists, Carmen Herrera, the Cuban-American abstract painter, and Mira Schendel, a Brazilian artist, who both would have typically been featured in a Latin American sale but here sold at auction highs.\u201cIt was great to put these amazing women artists on a platform with Richter and Dubuffet and Calder,\u201d Mr. Manley said. \u201cStarting next season, we\u2019re going to break down those boundaries more and more.\u201dPhillips is also taking an approach to auction catalogs that is different from that of its competitors, which tend to publish costly \u201chuge tomes that are these pseudo-art-historical textbooks that increasingly few people will ever read,\u201d Mr. Manley said.\u201cWe try to focus on the information that really matters to clients,\u201d he added.This fall, for example, Phillips published a separate catalog detailing the restoration of Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s 1994 canvas \u201cNudes in Mirror,\u201d which was slashed during a 2005 exhibition. (The painting sold for $21.5 million, with no guarantee.)\u201cThey were always upfront with me about their assessment of the painting and the sale,\u201d said Richard Rush, whose family consigned the work. \u201cWe were all 100 percent behind this strategy, and it was really a team effort.\u201dThe Phillips specialists acknowledge that their November sale was only an opening move; the larger effort to disrupt the duopoly has just begun. \u201cWe\u2019re still in this phase when we get the sympathy vote,\u201d Mr. Engelen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a giant leap. It\u2019s just a good step to take.\u201d\u201cAs long as we have a seat at the table, that was the whole point,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s get a seat at the table.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Janet Reno, First Woman to Serve as U.S. Attorney General, Dies at 78", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byJanet Reno, 1938-2016Janet Reno, who rose from a rustic life on the edge of the Everglades to become attorney general of the United States \u2014 the first woman to hold the job \u2014 and whose eight years in that office placed her in the middle of some of the most divisive episodes of the Clinton presidency, died on Monday at her home in Miami-Dade County, Fla. She was 78.Ms. Reno was never part of the Clinton inner circle, even though she served in the Clinton cabinet for two terms, longer than any attorney general in the previous 150 years. She was a latecomer to the team, and her political and personal style clashed with the president\u2019s, particularly as she sought to maintain some independence from the White House.Ms. Reno was never a natural fit in Washington\u2019s backslapping, competitive culture. At weekly news conferences, held in the barrel-vaulted conference room outside her office in the Justice Department building on Pennsylvania Avenue, she was fond of telling reporters that she would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d on legal issues and judge them according to \u201cthe law and the facts.\u201dThe comedy could not obscure her law-enforcement accomplishments. Ms. Reno presided over the Justice Department in a time of economic growth, falling crime rates and mounting security threats to the nation by forces both foreign and domestic.Ms. Reno was a strong advocate of guaranteeing federal protection to women seeking abortions and safeguarding abortion clinics that were under threat.But in some areas she seemed conflicted about the law. She opposed the death penalty, for example, but repeatedly authorized her prosecutors to ask juries to impose it.When she took office, she endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate administration figures. But she later testified against renewing the law governing their use, saying it did nothing to take politics out of the inquiries.Before becoming attorney general, Ms. Reno was the Dade County state attorney for 14 years, when the Miami area was growing rapidly and experiencing rising drug-related crime, widening racial divisions, demoralizing police corruption and waves of immigration from Cuba.Mr. Clinton, committed to appointing a woman as attorney general, settled on Ms. Reno after his first two choices \u2014 the corporate lawyer Zo\u00eb Baird and the federal judge Kimba Wood \u2014 withdrew their names in the face of criticism after it was disclosed that they had employed undocumented immigrants as nannies.\u201cI\u2019m just delighted to be here, and I\u2019m going to try my level best,\u201d Ms. Reno said at the Rose Garden ceremony at which Mr. Clinton announced her nomination on Feb. 11, 1993.Two months later, she gained the nation\u2019s full attention in a dramatic televised news conference in which she took full responsibility for a botched federal raid of the Waco compound of the Branch Davidians, an offshoot of the Seventh-day Adventists.Ms. Reno\u2019s candor was viewed as refreshing in a city where blame shifting is the norm, and it gave her sudden celebrity status in the new administration.The luster faded quickly. Within weeks, Ms. Reno faced tough questions about the raid and her claim that children were being abused at the compound. She was also faulted for failing to influence an important crime bill. By the end of her first year in office, she was facing mounting scrutiny in the news media.With Mr. Clinton\u2019s re-election and his decision to keep Ms. Reno at her post, Republicans began questioning her independence when she resisted their calls for a special counsel to look into allegations that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had broken campaign fund-raising laws in 1996.The clamor, led by the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, grew when it was disclosed that Louis J. Freeh, the head of the F.B.I., also favored a special counsel.Ms. Reno would not budge, saying her stance had nothing to do with protecting the president. A review of the evidence, she said, convinced her that a special counsel was not warranted.\u201cLet me be absolutely clear,\u201d Ms. Reno told hostile Republican questioners during one of several hearings on Capitol Hill about the call for a special counsel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to violate my oath in this matter because of pressure from any quarter, not from the media, not from Congress, nor from anywhere else.\u201dQuestions about her handling of the Waco raid resurfaced in 1999, when new evidence suggested that the F.B.I. might have started the fire that destroyed the compound.The disclosure further soured her dealings with Mr. Freeh \u2014 a relationship that had been close early in her tenure but had grown tortured by 1999. He let it be known that he favored a special counsel in the fund-raising case and a new inquiry into Waco. She sent marshals to F.B.I. headquarters to seize a tape of communications made the day of the assault.Her final and perhaps most personal crisis as head of the Justice Department was the case involving Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who was found floating on an inner tube off the coast of Florida after his mother and 10 others had drowned in a failed crossing from Cuba by small boat.The boy became a unifying figure among Cuban exiles in South Florida, who were determined to see him remain in the United States in defiance of the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.Ms. Reno favored returning Eli\u00e1n to his father in Cuba, and she became immersed in negotiations over his fate because of her ties to Miami.Early in 2001, however, she did go home, her service finished. She said she was excited about a red pickup truck she had bought.Janet Reno was born in Miami, on the edge of the Everglades, on July 21, 1938, to Henry Olaf Reno and the former Jane Wood. Her father, born Henry Rasmussen in Denmark, came to the United States in 1913 with his own mother and father, who chose the name Reno off a map, believing it sounded more American.Henry Reno was a police reporter in Dade County for more than 40 years. Jane Reno, born in Georgia, was an eccentric naturalist who would have a profound effect on Ms. Reno.\u201cOutspoken, outrageous, absolutely indifferent to others\u2019 opinions, Jane Reno was truly one of a kind,\u201d Paul Anderson, a former Miami Herald reporter, wrote in his biography of Janet Reno. It was her mother who had wrestled small alligators, though the stunt was sometimes erroneously ascribed to the daughter.Ms. Reno, the eldest of four siblings, was about 8 when her parents bought 21 acres bordering the Everglades and moved there. Her mother, who had no construction experience, built the family home. \u201cShe dug the foundation with her own hands, with a pick and shovel,\u201d Ms. Reno told senators at her confirmation hearing in 1993.It was a rustic life; peacocks and other creatures roamed the property, and Janet and her siblings \u2014 Robert, Mark and Margaret \u2014 cavorted barefoot. But she also glimpsed a more sophisticated world: After junior high school, she traveled to Europe to stay with an uncle, a military judge, as he presided over a spy trial.Besides her sister, who is known as Maggy, Ms. Reno is survived by seven nieces and nephews. Her brother Robert, a former columnist for Newsday on Long Island, died in 2012 at 72. Her brother Mark had an adventurer\u2019s life: game warden, boat and oil supply ship captain, alligator wrestler, scuba diver, paratrooper as well as carpenter and bailiff at the Miami-Dade Justice Building. He died in 2014, also at 72.After finishing high school in Miami, Ms. Reno attended Cornell University, graduating in 1960 with a degree in chemistry. She won admission to Harvard Law School and graduated in 1963, one of a handful of women in her class of more than 500.Seeking to practice law in South Florida, Ms. Reno was turned down by one of the state\u2019s best-known law firms, Steel Hector & Davis, and went to work for a smaller firm instead. She became active in local Democratic politics and met a fellow Harvard graduate, Gerald Lewis, a lawyer with electoral aspirations. Ms. Reno helped him win a State House seat in 1966, and the two opened a general-practice law firm together.Ms. Reno entered government service in 1971 as general counsel to the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives, where she worked on a difficult overhaul of Florida\u2019s courts. Her work in Tallahassee, the capital, whetted her appetite for public office, and she campaigned for a state legislative seat of her own the next year. She lost in an upset to a Republican candidate helped by the landslide re-election victory of President Richard M. Nixon.Ms. Reno did not wait long for her next opportunity. The day after her defeat, Richard Gerstein, the state attorney for Dade County, offered her a job on his staff. As she told The Miami Herald, she expressed reservations in her characteristically straightforward manner.\u201cMy father was always convinced you were a crook,\u201d she said she told Mr. Gerstein. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always been a critic of yours.\u201dMr. Gerstein replied that those were the reasons he wanted to hire her. Within a few years, she was Mr. Gerstein\u2019s chief assistant.Ms. Reno left the prosecutor\u2019s office in May 1976 to join Steel Hector & Davis, the firm that had rejected her out of law school. But her tenure there was short.Ms. Reno retained the post through a thicket of drug, murder and corruption cases. In one, she was accused of being antipolice when she prosecuted five Miami officers in the beating death of a black insurance executive after a traffic stop; the officers, she said, had tried to make it look like an accident.The officers were acquitted \u2014 one by the presiding judge in the trial, held in Tampa, and the others by an all-white jury \u2014 provoking criticism of her legal strategy and four days of deadly riots in Miami\u2019s predominantly black Liberty City neighborhood.To quell the furor, Ms. Reno undertook an outreach effort that restored some support among Miami\u2019s black citizens. She remained state attorney through five election campaigns \u2014 until February 1993, when the White House called.Ms. Reno was formally nominated to be attorney general that month, just a few weeks after the death of her mother, Jane, the guiding influence in her life. She invoked her mother\u2019s memory in her remarks that day at the Rose Garden ceremony with Mr. Clinton.\u201cMy mother always told me to do my best,\u201d she said, \u201cto think my best and to do right.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misidentified the subject of a quotation from Paul Anderson, the author of a biography of Ms. Reno. He wrote that Ms. Reno\u2019s mother, Jane, was \u201coutspoken, outrageous, absolutely indifferent to others\u2019 opinions\u201d and \u201ctruly one of a kind\u201d \u2014 not Ms. Reno herself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Giants Turn to Drones and Sensors in New Embrace of the Digital World", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byThe London-based start-up flies unmanned aircraft around offshore platforms, oil rigs and other sites, collecting high-resolution videos and images that can spot potential infrastructure problems and, according to Mr. Blackford, cost roughly 80 percent less than traditional inspections.But for many in the energy industry, the technology was still new and untested. That started to change after Talisman Energy, the Canadian oil and gas explorer, gave the fledgling company a chance on one of its offshore sites in 2012, leading to significant time and cost savings. Other energy companies\u2019 reluctance then quickly turned into interest and, eventually, a growing demand.\u201cIf you name a global oil company, we\u2019ve probably worked for them,\u201d said Mr. Blackford, whose clients include Chevron and BP. Since 2014, the start-up has branched out from mere drone inspections, offering clients access to sophisticated data analytics and algorithms that examine gigabytes of sensor information, for onshore and offshore sites, to flag potential problems that cannot be detected by the human eye.\u201cIn the last six to 12 months, we\u2019ve seen a spike in people\u2019s interest in the data that we can bring to the table,\u201d he said, adding that his team can, for instance, analyze the amount of corrosion to be expected on an oil rig over the coming year. \u201cWe can take the data, measure it and look for trends.\u201dThese tech innovations are part of a renewed push to bring the digital world into the oil and natural gas industry.And more advanced efforts \u2014 like rig-inspecting drones and even autonomous vehicles \u2014 are also being tested as the sector tries to catch up with other areas of the economy that have more readily embraced technological advances. The reams of digital data collected from offshore platforms, refineries and oil rigs, among other sites both onshore and offshore, may better detect energy deposits, find more-efficient ways to produce refined oil products like gasoline and even predict where future breakdowns, which can force costly and unexpected shutdowns, are likely to happen.For many in the energy industry, such predictions may sound all too familiar.Over the last two decades, companies have put hundreds of millions of dollars into new digital technologies, often with limited results. Around 2008, when oil hit a record $147 a barrel, analysts said many oil majors spent big on data centers and advanced software programs, only to see such projects be outpaced by those from IBM, Amazon and Microsoft, which could offer similar computing power at a fraction of the cost.\u201cIn the 2000s, resistance to technology was everywhere,\u201d said Nate Clark, an energy partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, in Houston. \u201cPeople tried to do too much, too fast.\u201dDespite some continuing resistance, the industry's technological credibility has been burnished by the recent shale revolution, which is driven by tech advances in drilling techniques, data crunching and other improvements aimed at making the sector more nimble as global oil and natural gas prices fluctuate. Roughly two-thirds of energy companies, according to a recent study by Ernst & Young, the consulting firm, have spent at least $100 million on data analytics over the last two years, a rise over previous years.\u201cThe amount of data is like a tsunami coming at us,\u201d said Keith Grey, who runs BP\u2019s supercomputer center. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining advantages that will be hard for others to try and match.\u201dFinding new ways of using that data also has become a priority.\u201cIt\u2019s easier than ever to leverage this type of data,\u201d said Richard Holsman, global head of the energy, digital and technology practice at the consultancy Accenture, which has worked with Woodside Energy. \u201cWhat they learned is that they can avoid failures by taking a different approach to the data they already have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Quite a few large mergers have also been thwarted by antitrust officials.In addition, choppy markets have dampened stock trading activity and there have been relatively few initial public offerings.Still, things could be looking up, with more deals waiting in the wings. There is also the possibility that a meaningful rise in interest rates could improve their returns.The little banana-colored creatures, bouncing around to promote everything from Comcast\u2019s voice-controlled TV remote to NBC dramas, show how Comcast and NBC Universal have come together to champion business initiatives and prospered.There are some notable differences, however.Comcast bought NBCUniversal when its businesses were struggling, whereas Time Warner is judged to be at its peak.Leaders at Comcast, for their part, were big believers in collaboration, with a deep understanding of both distribution and content.

{"Headline": "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byIt was a rough night for number crunchers. And for the faith that people in every field \u2014 business, politics, sports and academia \u2014 have increasingly placed in the power of data.Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory ran counter to almost every major forecast \u2014 undercutting the belief that analyzing reams of data can accurately predict events. Voters demonstrated how much predictive analytics, and election forecasting in particular, remains a young science: Some people may have been misled into thinking Hillary Clinton\u2019s win was assured because some of the forecasts lacked context explaining potentially wide margins of error.The election prediction business is one small aspect of a far-reaching change across industries that have increasingly become obsessed with data, the value of it and the potential to mine it for cost-saving and profit-making insights. It is a behind-the-scenes technology that quietly drives everything from the ads that people see online to billion-dollar acquisition deals.But data science is a technology advance with trade-offs. It can see things as never before, but also can be a blunt instrument, missing context and nuance. All kinds of companies and institutions use data quietly and behind the scenes to make predictions about human behavior. But only occasionally \u2014 as with Tuesday\u2019s election results \u2014 do consumers get a glimpse of how these formulas work and the extent to which they can go wrong.This year, Facebook\u2019s algorithm took down the image, posted by a Norwegian author, of a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs. The software code saw a violation of the social network\u2019s policy prohibiting child pornography, not an iconic photo of the Vietnam War and human suffering.This week\u2019s failed election predictions suggest that the rush to exploit data may have outstripped the ability to recognize its limits.\u201cState polls were off in a way that has not been seen in previous presidential election years,\u201d said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who is a co-founder of the Princeton Election Consortium. He speculated that polls may have failed to capture Republican loyalists who initially vowed not to vote for Mr. Trump, but changed their minds in the voting booth.Beyond election night, there are broader lessons that raise questions about the rush to embrace data-driven decision-making across the economy and society.The enthusiasm for big data has been fueled by the success stories of Silicon Valley giants born on the internet, like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The digital powerhouses harvest vast amounts of user data using clever software for search, social networks and online commerce. Data is the fuel, and algorithms borrowed from the tool kit of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, are the engine.The early commercial use for the technology has been to improve the odds of making a sale \u2014 through targeted ads, personalized marketing and product recommendations. But big-data decision-making is increasingly being embraced in every industry, and to make higher-stakes decisions that crucially affect people\u2019s lives \u2014 like helping to make medical diagnoses, hiring choices and loan approvals.The danger, data experts say, lies in trusting the data analysis too much without grasping its limitations and the potentially flawed assumptions of the people who build predictive models.Mr. Brynjolfsson said that people often do not understand that if the chance that something will happen is 70 percent, that means there is a 30 percent chance it will not occur. The election performance, he said, is \u201cnot really a shock to data science and statistics. It\u2019s how it works.\u201dSo, what happened with the election data and algorithms? The answer, it seems, is a combination of the shortcomings of polling, analysis and interpretation, perhaps both in how the numbers were presented and how they were understood by the public.Mr. Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, and Mr. Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium said state polling errors were largely to blame for the underestimates of Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning.In addition to the polling errors, data scientists said the inherent weakness of election models might have caused some forecasting errors. Before an election, forecasters use a combination of historical polls and recent polling data to predict a candidate\u2019s chance of winning. Some may also factor in other variables, such as giving higher weight to a candidate who is an incumbent.But even with decades of polls to analyze, it is difficult for forecasters to predict accurately a candidate\u2019s chance of winning the presidency months or even weeks ahead of time. Dr. Mutalik of Yale compared election modeling to weather forecasting.\u201cEven with the best models, it is difficult to predict the weather more than 10 days out because there are so many small changes that can cause big changes,\u201d Dr. Mutalik said. \u201cIn mathematics, this is known as chaos.\u201dBut, unlike weather prediction, current election models tend to take into account only several decades\u2019 worth of data. And changing the parameters of that data set can also significantly affect calculations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stranded $2 Trillion Overseas Stash Gets Closer to Coming Home", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe next president may have a rare opportunity to close tax loopholes that have let American corporations stash more than $2 trillion in untaxed profits outside the United States.This enormous hoard of stranded cash has barely been an issue in the contentious election campaign of 2016, and precise predictions of deals that could be made in Washington are foolhardy until the nation goes to the polls.But this much is clear: There is a growing political consensus that the time has come for change in the tax rules to encourage repatriation of the vast troves of corporate earnings held outside the country. Companies, ordinary American taxpayers and thousands of investors have substantial and sometimes conflicting stakes in the outcome.\u201cEveryone agrees that something is going to be done about this,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now a law professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe question, of course, is exactly what.\u201dUnder current rules, by declaring that foreign profits are permanently or indefinitely reinvested abroad, American companies can defer taxation on that money. How much money, exactly, is subject to interpretation, but careful estimates extend from about $2.4 trillion to roughly $3 trillion.One reason is that the sums that could be made available for use by the government have become staggeringly large. Like the gravity of an outsized planet, the concentration of so much money creates a nearly irresistible force: Something needs to be done about it.An approach called deemed repatriation \u2014 in which untaxed foreign corporate profits are subject to immediate taxation \u2014 would provide a gigantic infusion to the Treasury and give corporations a significant incentive to move money home. Leading plans in Congress include this approach, Mr. Kleinbard said.Reforming the tax code is anything but simple, however. The details are crucial, and there are plenty of them, giving corporate lobbyists ample opportunity to shape eventual changes in a manner that favors the big companies.Consider the implications of that sum for a moment.On paper, if not in reality, corporations are required to pay a federal tax rate of 35 percent. If all of that money had been taxed at that rate, it would amount to $910 billion in taxes.In fact, Goldman Sachs research indicates that companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index paid a median federal effective tax rate of 28 percent, on average, over the last decade, while companies with high foreign earnings paid about 22 percent.But let\u2019s stick with the statutory 35 percent rate for a moment. My calculations show that at that rate, the lost corporate tax revenue would amount to almost two-thirds of all the money ($1.39 trillion) paid by Americans in personal income tax in 2014, according to Treasury data. And the lost tax revenue is more than 2.5 times the income tax paid annually by American corporations. Even if corporations were given a big break \u2014 which is highly likely under any tax code revision \u2014 the impact of any tax payments on those profits would still be large.Stock investors would also enjoy a windfall under earnings repatriation plans, but the lower the corporate tax rate, the greater the benefit. It\u2019s easy to see why.For one thing, studies show that in 2004 when the American Jobs Creation Act granted a \u201ctax holiday,\u201d in which companies were allowed to bring money home at a 5.25 percent tax rate, they used very little of their repatriated money to create jobs or develop new businesses or technologies. Most of the cash simply flowed to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends.That\u2019s why the details of a tax deal are so important. A tax holiday could encourage companies to stockpile earnings overseas again and defer American taxes, while enriching investors. If $1 trillion were repatriated and companies funneled nearly all of it to their shareholders, the windfall would be very large indeed: It could come close to the $975 billion in buybacks and dividends for all S.&P. 500 stocks for the 12 months through June, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.For these reasons, in a recent report for clients, Goldman Sachs suggested that investors consider buying shares of companies with the biggest untaxed foreign earnings: Microsoft, General Electric, Apple and Pfizer, which also top the list of untaxed earnings giants compiled by Audit Analytics, an accounting research firm.There is a surprising degree of bipartisan consensus that the American tax system needs to be fixed and that the stranded earnings should be brought home. Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in line to be the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, have favored tax changes that would encourage corporate repatriation. Mr. Schumer and Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, agreed on the framework of such a plan, and President Obama did as well.A gigantic pot of money is sitting overseas. It will be up to the next president and Congress \u2014 and their counterparts abroad \u2014 to decide exactly what to do about it.Gretchen Morgenson, whose Fair Game column normally appears on this page, is away.Advertisement"}

European officials have said the two companies\u2019 practices not only stopped rivals from competing directly, but also limited consumer choice and, in the case of Google, hindered innovation in the fast-expanding mobile world.The cases against Google and Microsoft, however, are not identical.The claims came on the heels of a separate antitrust investigation into whether Microsoft broke European competition rules by unfairly promoting its Windows Media Player over alternatives offered by rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.That included automatically including Internet Explorer with every version of Windows, which was then used on about 90 percent of all computers worldwide.

That has already led to an array of academic, governmental and private efforts to explore a technology that until recently was largely the stuff of science fiction.In the last decade, faster computer chips, cheap sensors and large collections of data have helped researchers improve on computerized tasks like machine vision and speech recognition, as well as robotics.\u201cWe are at a unique point in time where the technology is far ahead of society\u2019s ability to restrain it,\u201d Mr. Suresh noted.But at the same time, he said some people are a bit too optimistic about their claims of A.I. advances, particularly when it comes to autonomous vehicles.Mr. Suresh said he personally did not think self-driving cars would be in widespread use in the next three years.The Uber laboratory has been a sensitive spot for Carnegie Mellon. The field of artificial intelligence emerged in part at Carnegie Mellon in the 1950s in the work of faculty who developed software that showed how computer algorithms could intelligently solve problems.University officials said the departing faculty have been replaced and 13 additional professors have been hired since the defections. They also said that between 2011 and 2015, Carnegie Mellon faculty and staff created 164 start-up companies.University officials pointed to a partnership the school entered into last year with Boeing to use machine-learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data generated by modern aircraft such as the Boeing Dreamliner.The new center is being created with a $10 million gift from K&L Gates, an international law firm headquartered in Pittsburgh. It will draw from several academic disciplines and will initially add two faculty and three positions for graduate students.

{"Headline": "The Future of Health Care Mergers Under Trump", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported byThe proposed health insurance mega-merger between Anthem and Cigna heads to court on Monday, as the companies face off against a Justice Department seeking to block their $48 billion deal. It will be followed in just a few weeks by the trial for another proposed insurance mega-merger, between Aetna and Humana.Together, those two mergers would remake the industry, resulting in the nation\u2019s five largest health insurers shrinking to just three, including UnitedHealth Group, which remains independent. And the Justice Department is set to argue that the consolidation would be bad for consumers.But the election of Donald J. Trump could recalibrate how vigorously the federal government handles these two deals, as well as the many other deals now taking place in health care, according to legal experts. On Friday, Mr. Trump nominated Senator Jeff Sessions, the conservative Republican from Alabama, to replace Ms. Lynch. While it is unclear how Mr. Sessions would have the department handle antitrust cases, Mr. Trump has said that he wants less government regulation of business.In each of the two big cases headed to court, a federal judge will decide whether consumers would be worse off after the mergers take place. The companies contend people would benefit because a bigger company would be more efficient and better able to strike deals with hospitals and doctors that result in lower prices for medical care. In its pretrial brief, Anthem argues the government\u2019s opposition threatens to \u201cdeprive American consumers of lower health care costs.\u201dAny fallout from the election would almost certainly not be felt immediately. Both cases are expected to be decided before Mr. Trump takes office in January.But a Trump administration could still have a major say, particularly if either the companies or the government decide to appeal the initial decision.There is little expectation that the Justice Department under the Trump administration would drop the case if the companies lost and appealed, for example, but it might be inclined to strike a settlement less onerous to the insurer. After the department under President Bill Clinton won its antitrust case against Microsoft, the officials taking over for President George W. Bush pursued a settlement that many viewed as less far-reaching than one that would have been sought by their predecessors.There is also a distinct chance, antitrust experts said, that the approach to health care mergers will not pivot much from the current one.\u201cThere is a history of bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement in health care,\u201d said Leslie C. Overton, a partner at Alston & Bird and a former Justice Department official. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should expect a wholesale shift, based on the change from Democratic to Republican.\u201dThe clearest sign of the new administration\u2019s position, antitrust experts said, will come from who is appointed to crucial positions at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.Other parts of the health care industry will also be on the lookout for any shift in stance. Hospital mergers, for example, have been aggressively challenged by the F.T.C. Last week, two large Chicago-area health systems, Advocate Health Care and NorthShore University HealthSystem, said they would continue their legal fight after an appeals court sent the case brought by the commission back to a lower court.The F.T.C.\u2019s position on the health care deals may change less than the Justice Department\u2019s. The commission, an independent agency that includes both Republicans and Democrats, is somewhat less subject to the political preferences of the White House. But priorities often do change.\u201cThe swings from administration to administration have not been as strong as they have in the Justice Department,\u201d said Michael J. Perry, a former lawyer for the F.T.C. who is now a partner at Baker Botts. The agency has a long history of pursuing hospital mergers, he said, and \u201chas a lot of success\u201d in its attempts to block various deals.In any event, few expect the deal-making that has taken place in recent years to abate. Hospitals have joined with other hospitals and bought physician practices, surgery centers and the like to bulk up. Last month, two of the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit health systems, Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health, said they were in talks to join forces.Even among smaller insurers, mergers are likely to continue. This month, WellCare Health Plans announced its intention to buy Universal American, a smaller insurer, as a way to expand its presence in the private Medicare Advantage market.Although the federal health care law that was passed under President Obama, which prodded both insurers and health systems to deliver less-expensive medical care, encouraged some of the merger activity, many of these entities were likely to combine anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a global merger wave,\u201d said Martin S. Gaynor, an antitrust expert at Carnegie Mellon University.The possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which many Republicans are pushing, is unlikely to change those dynamics. Hospitals may feel more pressure to join forces as a way of coping with what many people think will be a difficult environment. Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid could become less generous with their payments, and hospitals may experience an increase in the number of patients who have no insurance.What\u2019s more, health systems need access to capital to pay for sophisticated computer systems, and insurers, hospitals and doctors prefer the negotiating clout that comes with being bigger.Hospitals are likely to see the divide between winners and losers grow, said Dr. Sanjay B. Saxena, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, whose clients include health systems and insurers.\u201cThat shake-up,\u201d he said, \u201cis going to continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Puts Slack in Cross Hairs With New Office Chat App", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byREDMOND, Wash. \u2014 In the last couple of years at Microsoft, some old habits have been tossed away, like obsessively placing Windows software at the center of all the company\u2019s big bets. But the company would still dig trenches to protect Office, its $23-billion-a-year software franchise.Microsoft on Wednesday took the wraps off Microsoft Teams, an addition to the Office package that will allow professionals to huddle virtually with colleagues in private chat rooms to talk about anything from work projects to where to get lunch.If you think Microsoft Teams sounds a little like Slack, the relatively new chat service that has pulses pounding among Silicon Valley investors and customers, you would be correct.In fact, if this were 1997, a more bellicose time at Microsoft, people inside the company would be whispering that the new application was a Slack killer. But the tone is different these days, even if the intent is essentially the same.\u201cLook, my job No. 1 is to make sure that the 85 million users I have on Office 365, we go meet their needs and keep growing that base,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference room last week on the Microsoft campus. \u201cThis is not to take away any success anyone else has. We\u2019ve always had lots of tools out here that have competed and also coexisted.\u201dMicrosoft Teams is the most significant new addition in years to Office 365, the current name of the Microsoft software suite, which has over the years migrated from the PC to become a product delivered over the internet that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other applications. Bill Gates, a Microsoft co-founder and now technology adviser, even had a hand in its creation.The reception to Microsoft Teams will help determine whether Mr. Nadella, who became chief executive of the company in early 2014, can extend his recent run of success.Microsoft plans to use distribution, an old standby, to get people using Microsoft Teams, bundling it with the business version of Office 365 at no additional cost.\u201cWe are orders of magnitude bigger in terms of the users we serve,\u201d said Rajesh Jha, executive vice president of Office Engineering at Microsoft.Customers generally pay $5 to $20 a month to subscribe to Office 365. Mr. Nadella\u2019s 85 million figure is the number of active monthly business users of the software.\u201cThat\u2019s where Microsoft has an inherent advantage around security,\u201d Mr. Diwan said.\u201cThe moral of the story is if you\u2019re a large incumbent with many lines of business, it is incredibly difficult to take on a smaller, focused start-up that has traction in the market,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive of Slack, which took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on Wednesday welcoming Microsoft to the market.What\u2019s more, most people are using Slack because they want to, not because it is being shoved down their throats by a corporate I.T. department. Slack has been embraced by many as a more efficient way for teams to communicate than email, which is not designed for real-time conversations.Messages in Slack are archived and searchable, and people can use it on mobile devices and PCs. Mr. Butterfield said Slack had particularly helped create more transparency across boundaries inside companies, allowing, for example, marketing teams to see what sales staff are talking about and engineers to eavesdrop on product designers.In a demonstration last week at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters, executives showed how Microsoft Teams both resembles Slack and adds to its innovations. Like Slack, the software lets people pepper their messages with GIFs and emojis. There are also ways of connecting Microsoft Teams with other applications and services like Twitter and GitHub.The most noticeable difference is that Microsoft Teams organizes conversations into threads, grouping messages on the same topic to make conversations easier to follow than they are in Slack\u2019s unthreaded message streams. It has customizable tabs for making it simpler to get to commonly used services and files, like budget spreadsheets.Mira Lane, principal architect of Microsoft Teams, demonstrated how people could spontaneously start videoconferences inside the software if they would rather hash things out face to face. \u201cIt\u2019s a really low-friction way of having an ad hoc meeting,\u201d Ms. Lane said.Mr. Butterfield of Slack said the service had plans to support both threaded conversations and videoconferencing in the future.Microsoft began working on Microsoft Teams about 18 months ago, after Mr. Gates encouraged Brian MacDonald, a respected Microsoft engineer credited with creating Outlook, the company\u2019s flagship email application, to come up with a new take on productivity applications.\u201cWe\u2019d have pretty frequent conversations, sometimes group reviews, sometimes one-on-ones,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said. \u201cHe\u2019d send me big, long memos to consume. I\u2019d send him a few ideas back. It was great.\u201dMicrosoft does not always build a new product when it wants to expand the range of Office. About four years ago, it paid $1.2 billion to acquire Yammer, a social networking app that had found a following in the tech industry. So did Microsoft consider buying Slack?\u201cIt\u2019s not something that I looked at,\u201d Mr. Nadella said, adding that he did not know if others who work for him seriously considered it.Mr. Butterfield declined to say whether he was approached by anyone from Microsoft about a deal, but it would not have mattered if someone had. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been pretty clear publicly, and in private conversations with everyone else in the industry, that we have no interest in being acquired,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Rajesh Jha. He is executive vice president of Office Engineering, not corporate vice president. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a picture caption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Advocates for New York\u2019s Working Poor Push for Discounted Transit Fares", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byAt a time when New York City can seem unbearably expensive, advocates for the poor are targeting a rising cost that many people struggle to afford: a MetroCard.And with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority poised to approve its latest fare increase in January, they are pressing Mayor Bill de Blasio to finance a program that would offer half-price subway and bus fares to New Yorkers living in poverty.One of the authority board\u2019s newest members, David R. Jones, is challenging Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, to support the proposal as part of his re-election campaign. Mr. Jones, who was nominated to the board by the mayor, said Mr. de Blasio\u2019s transportation priorities, from new ferry boats to a planned streetcar line, though fine ideas, did not address income inequality.\u201cThis could have the most immediate impact to help the working poor right now rather than years in the future,\u201d said Mr. Jones, the president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit.The de Blasio administration said it was examining the proposal, but city officials were reluctant to commit to paying for it without the help of the state and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the authority. Given the tension between the mayor and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, Mr. Jones said he hoped the city would act quickly to finance the program itself.But the idea of offering income-based fares in New York would be the biggest experiment of its kind yet. The city\u2019s subway and bus system is vast, with more than 7.5 million daily riders, and the plan would be expensive, especially at a time when the authority is financially strapped and struggling to cope with record ridership.Next week, the authority is expected to release a proposal for a 4 percent increase on fares and tolls across the agency\u2019s network of subways, buses, tunnels and bridges. The new base fare, which may rise to $3 from $2.75, is expected to take effect in March as part of regularly scheduled increases every two years.But the current fares are already too expensive for many New Yorkers. Leslie Wells, a substitute teacher who lives in Harlem, often worries about finding enough change to pay the cost of a ride. After paying for housing and food, there is little left over. She said she certainly could not afford to spend $116.50, the current price of a monthly pass.\u201cI have to think about it,\u201d said Ms. Wells, a member of the Riders Alliance. \u201cWhat if the change doesn\u2019t add up? It\u2019s extra stress added to my day.\u201dMs. Wells said she had sometimes asked her son to duck under turnstiles to avoid paying his fare, even though she knew that doing so was against the rules.\u201cI really didn\u2019t have any other choice than to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought it was an adventure. I didn\u2019t feel good about it.\u201dThe city\u2019s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said the city and the authority had discussed discounts for low-income riders, but that the expense of such a program should not be borne by the city alone because the authority is a state agency.\u201cI do think we\u2019re ready to sit down with the M.T.A. and look at, potentially, are there creative revenue sources we can come up with here, if we all collectively agree that this is an important priority?\u201d she said.Ms. Trottenberg, who serves on the authority board, said the city also wanted to examine a potential expansion of the City Ticket program, which provides discounts to riders traveling on commuter railroads within New York City on weekends, and whether it was fair to be offering discounts only when riders put at least $5.50 on their MetroCards.The authority has been a source of tension between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, who feuded last year over whether the city should pay more for the transit system\u2019s long-term projects. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Freddi Goldstein, said the city already paid a hefty sum toward the authority\u2019s operations and capital budget.\u201cThis proposal will be evaluated as part of the fare-setting process for the M.T.A., as well as the state and city budgets,\u201d Ms. Goldstein said in a statement about the idea of half-price fares.A spokeswoman for the authority, Beth DeFalco, said the agency helped low-income riders in New York City by subsidizing fares for students and people 65 or older.\u201cThe M.T.A. keeps fares as low as possible while providing safe, reliable service,\u201d she said.Though riders have been frustrated by regular fare increases, officials at the authority said its policy was better than those used by other systems, like New Jersey Transit, which has less predictable increases and imposed one of 9 percent last year. The authority has said it plans to stick to a 4 percent increase across its network every two years.In the Seattle area, more than 35,600 people have enrolled in a discount fare program for low income riders that began in March 2015. Riders can qualify for what is known as an Orca Lift card if their household incomes are less than double the federal poverty level.The program addresses inequality in the Seattle area, where residents who work for companies like Microsoft and Amazon can afford to pay full fare, but others with limited education cannot, said Dow Constantine, the King County executive and chairman of Sound Transit, a transportation agency that serves multiple counties in the region.\u201cThe results we\u2019re seeing are that people are actually using transit more frequently now that they have the Orca Lift card, and that is a good thing, because mobility translates to opportunity and productivity,\u201d he said.The costs of the Seattle-area program have been relatively small compared with the projected expense in New York City: $3.4 million for operating and capital costs to start offering discounts, and about $3.9 million in lost revenue in the first year, officials said.When Jonathan Kumar moved to Seattle from Michigan recently, his rent nearly tripled. While trying to establish a start-up to help homeless people, he had little income and qualified for a discount card to ride the bus.\u201cThe savings allow me to better afford rent, to better afford utilities and groceries,\u201d he said.Now that his start-up is doing well, Mr. Kumar said he would no longer need the discount.\u201cNow I\u2019ll be able to better afford to pay a regular fare,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the 21st-Century Craze for Redesigning Everything", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "1. The ProblemIn theory, the redesign begins with a problem. The problem might be specific or systemic or subjective. A logo makes a company\u2019s image feel out of date. A familiar household object has been overtaken by new technology. A service has become too confusing for new users. And so on. The world is, after all, full of problems.The human desire to solve problems fuels brand-new inventions too: The wheel, for example, eased conveyance significantly. But the redesign tends to address problems with, or caused by, dimensions of the human-designed world, and identifying such problems may be the designer\u2019s most crucial skill. Redesigns fail when they address the wrong problem \u2014 or something that really wasn\u2019t a problem in the first place. While progress may entail change, change does not necessarily guarantee progress. But a clever redesign, one that addresses the right problem in an intelligent fashion, improves the world, if just by a bit.Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Simons was so impressed that she signed two students, Amy Wu and Luke Stern, to a three-month contract that summer. The two of them soon zeroed in on a particularly thorny design problem: the big, instructional decal on Citi Bike\u2019s kiosks. Annual members used a key fob and had no reason to interact with the decal, but it was the gateway for casual users. Consisting mostly of text, the decals were dense and off-putting, especially to tourists uncomfortable with English. Some failed to understand that they were supposed to type in a code from a printed receipt to unlock a bike; instead, they tried to figure out how to insert the receipt itself into a slot on the docking station.There was another, more prosaic reason that Stern and Wu focused on the decal: It was something they could actually change. Citi Bike is operated by a private firm, but New York\u2019s Transportation Department oversees it, too, and the technology involves an external vendor. The decal, however, was produced in-house. So Stern and Wu proposed refashioning it, using a set of instructional pictograms loosely inspired by Ikea booklets. They tested several prototypes and endured baffled responses from Citi Bike users until eventually landing on a gridlike arrangement of visuals that people found intuitive. Simons and the Transportation Department signed off on a final version, and it was installed on the city\u2019s 300-plus Citi Bike stations. Wu checked the service\u2019s publicly available user data a month later and discovered that casual ridership had increased about 14 percent. \u201cIt was a little bit surreal,\u201d Stern recalls. \u201cWe can actually make a difference.\u201dIndeed, this is the platonic ideal of the redesign: A designer sees a problem, proposes a solution, makes a difference. Such tidy narratives fuel a reigning ideology in which every object, symbol or pool of information is just another design problem awaiting some solution. The thermostat, the fire extinguisher, the toothbrush, the car dashboard \u2014 all have been redesigned, whether anybody was clamoring for their alteration or not.This hunger for change has been a boon for firms like IDEO. Tim Brown, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, has overseen IDEO\u2019s steady expansion from product design to interactive and service design for businesses like Bank of America and Microsoft, and in more recent years even for municipalities and governments. He has been a vocal proponent of the idea that \u201cdesign thinking\u201d can be applied to just about any problem. \u201cThere are two takes on the redesign,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThe glass-half-empty take on redesign is, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re unnecessarily redesigning a chair,\u2019 or a lamp, or whatever.\u201dProblem: not enough casual users. Solution: reworking the instructions for newcomers from a text-heavy approach to something more pictorial, reminiscent of Ikea instructions.The glass-half-full take requires a broader perspective: \u201cThe need to redesign is really dependent on how fit for purpose the thing in question is,\u201d Brown says. In his thinking, much of our world is built around systems designed to respond to the social structures and technologies of the industrial age. Everything from systems of education and health care to the design of cities and modes of transportation, he says, all trace their roots to a drastically different era and ought to be fundamentally rethought for the one we live in now. \u201cI think we\u2019ve potentially never been in a period of history where there are so many things that are no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore the idea of redesign is entirely appropriate, I think \u2014 even though it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d2. What to ChangeYou don\u2019t have to listen to Karim Rashid for very long to get a sense that he thinks pretty much every single manifestation of the built environment needs to be redesigned. Known for his colorful personal and professional style, he has had a long run as one of the most famous industrial designers in America. He believes design is a fundamentally social act that makes the world a better place. But it is also, he points out, a business. So in practice, most redesigns begin with a client; without one, not much happens. He has worked with many of them \u2014 on furniture, packaging, gadgets, housewares, luxury goods, even condos and hotels. But he has learned that even having a client does not guarantee that any given redesign will ever make it out of renderings and prototypes and into the real world. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m prolific,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine if all the other stuff got to go to market?\u201dAs Rashid sees it, so many of the things that surround us bear cumbersome vestiges of the past. \u201cThe world is full of this kind of kitsch history \u2014 history that has nothing to do with the world we live in now,\u201d he says. He points to a redesign project of his that fizzled, a complete rethinking of the business-class tableware for Delta Air Lines. His proposal was bold: His bowls had sharp angles that echoed Delta\u2019s triangular logo, his trays had subtle recesses that anchored dishes in place and his wineglasses skipped the stem in favor of a tapered shape with a wide base.\u201cThe stem on a wineglass is meaningless,\u201d Rashid says. He dismisses the conventional argument that it prevents the drinker\u2019s hand from interfering with wine\u2019s ideal temperature; to have the slightest such effect, he claims, you\u2019d have to wrap your palm around the bowl for 20 straight minutes. The stem is actually a leftover artifact, he says, from centuries ago, when goblets made of metal had high stems to signal status and wealth. This design quirk remained after we switched to glass, Rashid says. Making wineglasses look a certain way because that\u2019s how they have always looked is a classic example of privileging form over function. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in first class or business class on an airplane with turbulence,\u201d Rashid says, \u201cwith a wineglass with a stem on it \u2014 do you understand? It\u2019s so stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHis proposed redesigns were striking, but they had to pass muster with the service-item maker, the flight attendants\u2019 union and Delta itself \u2014 which ultimately declined to move forward with the concepts Rashid proposed. \u201cIt was all rejected,\u201d he tells me, with a sigh. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t look like domestic tableware.\u201dRashid loves to \u201cbreak archetypes,\u201d in effect redesigning a whole object category. But the hurdles to doing so involve practicality as well as taste. More recently, he designed the Solarin mobile phone for Sirin Labs. It is equipped with extreme encryption capabilities and made with wealthy, privacy-obsessed customers in mind. It costs an eye-popping $12,000 and up. The client had a sky\u2019s-the-limit attitude about imbuing the phone with a truly distinct form.The payment giant\u2019s top priority in revisiting its logo for the first time in decades: Don\u2019t mess it up. The result, released earlier this year, is a version of the familiar interlocked-circles symbol streamlined for the digital era.3. What to KeepSituations like this can unnerve clients, and this knowledge was certainly relevant to Mastercard when it decided this year to update its logo for the first time in more than 20 years. Raja Rajamannar, the global chief marketing and communications officer, says that the first parameter he gave his designer, Michael Bierut at Pentagram, \u201cwas not to mess things up.\u201d The online crowd can get \u201cpretty nasty,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get mired in unnecessary controversy and negativity.\u201dThis conservatism among clients can frustrate designers. \u201cI was kind of brought up in this tradition that, you know, there\u2019s nothing more inspiring than the blank slate, the open brief,\u201d Bierut says. But over the years he has come to appreciate the challenge of \u201cstarting with a given,\u201d particularly now.\u201cThe last big period of redesign was the postwar era,\u201d Bierut says. \u201cThere was this mania to make older companies look new and modern.\u201d As a more corporate world emerged, the visual vernacular of mom-and-pop businesses looked quaint, and so design shifted from an emphasis on manufacturing things to selling more abstract forms of value. A railroad doesn\u2019t run trains, the thinking went; it provides transportation \u2014 so instead of a representation of a locomotive, its more modern logo might rely on arrows and italic typography. More broadly, idiosyncratic or hand-drawn lettering gave way to stylized and minimal iconography and type treatments that projected far-flung and trustworthy power. \u201cCorporate design was done as a command-and-control exercise,\u201d he says, resulting in a master solution laid out in \u201ca thick binder\u201d prescribing how every branding element would appear.By the \u201980s and \u201990s, that approach started to feel dated, suspicious and at odds with a vogue for more agile management theories. So in the last two decades, there has been a fresh wave of redesigns as companies have repositioned themselves in a more globalized, technologized marketplace. Mastercard is one of many examples of a company looking to update visual strategies designed with billboards and brick-and-mortar stores in mind for the age of social media and a transnational customer base.Nevertheless, the specific dimensions of Mastercard\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t mess it up\u201d parameter included keeping the interlocking circles \u2014 one red, one yellow \u2014 that the brand has used for more than half a century. Bierut believes that this was wise: Unlike a book cover or a poster, a brand mark is \u201cmore like a building,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t unveil it thinking it\u2019s going to work once and then be on its way. It\u2019s supposed to accrue value the longer it\u2019s invested in.\u201d The raw familiarity that builds up over years, which marketers refer to as \u201cequity,\u201d probably plays a bigger factor in our assessment of a supposedly great logo design than we realize. Bierut is tickled, for instance, by how many people seem to admire Target\u2019s logo. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine if you went to your client whose name was Target and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea,\u2019 then you went away for a few weeks and came back with a circle with a dot in the middle, and an invoice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe client would be skeptical \u2014 and the world at large would destroy you.\u201dFor Mastercard, Pentagram got as creative as the brief allowed, offering dozens of yellow-and-red-circle variations \u2014 adding additional colors to suggest inclusivity, or a superminimal take presenting only the outlines of the interlocked rings. Rajamannar (and others at Mastercard, crosschecked by multiple rounds of market research) passed on those, opting for a treatment that amounted to a kind of reiteration of the existing mark. The colors became a little brighter, a set of stripes in their overlap was eliminated in favor of a single orange-y color and the name moved below the circles. Ultimately, in fact, the new symbol is designed to be able to stand alone, with no name at all; Rajamannar says testing conducted across 11 countries found 81 percent of respondents recognized the wordless version of the logo as Mastercard\u2019s.In short, the not-messing-it-up mission was deemed a success \u2014 and there was no notable backlash. \u201cThis kind of brand mark has become more ubiquitous than the designers of the \u201960s and \u201970s ever would have dreamed,\u201d Bierut says, and that may explain a public interest in design that would have been a shock in that era. It should not be so surprising today; the design profession has been on a decades-long mission to have its work taken seriously across the culture. But now, having achieved what they wanted, many designers seem to wish the public would be more deferential \u2014 something Bierut finds amusing. \u201cIf designers claim to want people to be interested and invested in and care about design,\u201d he says, \u201cthey sort of have to accept that interest on the terms of, you know, the audience.\u201d4. Where to CompromiseIn 2011, Jamie Siminoff had just sold a start-up and was spending most of his days in his garage in Pacific Palisades, Calif., determined to come up with a new business concept. Tinkering with ideas including a gardening business and new conference-call technology, he soon became annoyed, because he could never hear his doorbell, and he kept missing visitors. So he \u201chacked together\u201d a system that linked the bell to his phone. His wife told him that it was far more useful than the notions he was chasing in the garage. The idea evolved to include a camera and a motion detector \u2014 and thus the ability to monitor your front door from anywhere, with a smartphone, making the object as much about security as convenience.The product he ended up with, Ring, is a good example of a broader phenomenon in the world of industrial design. The technology shifts that Brown and Rashid cite have quickened the pace of redesigns in more mundane, less grandiose ways. Thanks to the proliferation of cheap sensors, circuit boards, cameras and other components, practically every consumer good now seems susceptible to reinvention as a \u201csmart object.\u201d Even the path Siminoff traveled from concept to design was made easier by technology and start-up mania, first with the aid of a crowdfunding campaign, then with an unsuccessful but profile-raising appearance on \u201cShark Tank.\u201dSometimes such a path results in a version of what the tech critic Evgeny Morozov calls \u201csolutionism\u201d \u2014 starting with a supposed breakthrough and then seeking out a supposed problem that it can hypothetically solve. And at times the presumed innovations in these tech-centric redesigns seem to run well ahead of their potential privacy and security pitfalls. (\u201cYes,\u201d the tech site Motherboard reported last year, \u201cyour smart dildo can be hacked.\u201d) But sometimes it results in a hit, like the widely celebrated update of the thermostat in internet-connected, app-controlled form created by the start-up Nest, which was ultimately bought by Google for $3.2 billion.By his own account, Siminoff\u2019s first stab at the product was a bit off. He called it Doorbot, and its look matched the geeky name: a vaguely sci-fi, curved object with a camera concealed by a spooky, bulbous protrusion. \u201cThat was the pride of the design,\u201d Siminoff says now, laughing. He prototyped it in his garage with a couple of recent college graduates; none of them had a design background. The marketplace set him straight, he says: \u201cNo one wanted this big HAL 9000 thing on the front door.\u201d He still believed in the object\u2019s utility, but he realized he would need to redesign his redesign.Siminoff found his way to Chris Loew, an industrial designer in Silicon Valley, with a long record in technology hardware; he worked on early versions of tablet products and spent 16 years at IDEO helping clients including Samsung and Oral-B. In more recent years he has been hired by a number of start-ups. Impressed by Siminoff, Loew also recognized the issues with Doorbot. \u201cIt was very gadgety,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if you were being shot with radiation or \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not offensive, but you didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d In short, it didn\u2019t look like a doorbell, and even the most impressive technical capabilities have to be presented in a form that makes sense to the consumer.The original version of this reimagined doorbell (equipped with a camera and intercom) had such a sci-fi look that visitors often didn\u2019t know what it was. A redesign of that redesign has placed it in the realm of functional home d\u00e9cor \u2014 and it has been installed in hundreds of thousands of homes.In this case, that meant a design that resonated with basic home architecture. There were already serious technologized constraints: It had to accommodate a fairly large battery, a camera, a circuit board and a motion detector that required an opening of a specific size. And from a purely aesthetic perspective, the architectural setting imposed limits that might not apply to a free-standing product: Nobody really wants to tack a wild experiment in product design to a front door. Loew settled on a rectangular shape that would visually echo molding. \u201cEverybody\u2019s house is really just extruded shapes and planar shapes,\u201d says Loew, who is now Ring\u2019s lead product designer. The product comes in various finishes informed by classic door hardware, and is meant to be notable but not flashy.The company has grown to 500 employees, with hundreds of thousands of installations already done. The only holdover from Doorbot is a circle around the button that glows blue when pressed.5. When to Start OverSmiedt paused on one image of a carry-on bag with a side pocket containing a flask-shaped plastic bottle outfitted with a strong microfilter. This accessory popped up during the luggage-design process as a useful alternative to buying bottled water after every airport security check. \u201cSo no matter what country,\u201d Rashid explained, \u201cI go across and to the bathroom and fill it up with clean water. Because it\u2019s absurd, this idea of drinking bottled water \u2014 the landfill is enormous, 18 million bottles are thrown away a day in America.\u201d Both men immediately saw its appeal. Smiedt promptly \u201cdisappeared,\u201d Rashid continued, \u201cand six months later came back and said: \u2018You know, forget the luggage. We\u2019re doing the water bottle.\u2019\u2009\u201dOn its own, the flasklike form seemed off, so Smiedt pushed for alternatives, something more like what was on Rashid\u2019s product shelf \u2014 but not exactly. An hourglass-like, squeezable shape that Rashid eventually dreamed up was perfect. But it required making a lengthy search to find a capable manufacturer \u2014 \u201cNobody had made a blow-molded bottle that was thinner in the middle,\u201d Smiedt said \u2014 and committing to a huge production order for the product, which they called Bobble.\u201cCompanies are often risk-averse,\u201d Smiedt continued, \u201cand don\u2019t get design\u2019s possibilities. But designers do what they want to design, and it often doesn\u2019t connect with the consumer,\u201d at least not the mass scale he had in mind. \u201cFor me,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe key to design is that it can\u2019t polarize.\u201d Many designers would recoil from that assertion, but as a mass-market-oriented entrepreneur, Smiedt\u2019s goals are different. He thinks a lot about who is not going to like a new take on a useful object, as a way to \u201cget to something that\u2019s really understood.\u201dThis new take on the reusable water bottle started out as an accessory to a luggage redesign. The luggage was scuttled \u2014 but Bobble, with a distinct shape and a strong microfilter, has sold millions.The Bobble bottle sold 15 million units in its first three years on the market. Smiedt sold Bobble to Seventh Generation and has gone back into business with Rashid, this time in a partnership. They want to redesign more travel-related accessories, so they started by dumping their luggage onto a table and talking about what they carried, and what they needed. Their first idea involved finding a way to keep smeary touch-controlled gadgets clean. Rashid designed a travel-size spray bottle, arriving at an elliptical form, more like a worry stone than a bottle. They both loved the object\u2019s shape and feel but wondered about the breadth of its appeal. Ultimately, they shelved it, though not entirely.They went back to the results of the bag-dump experiment and zeroed in on the most bothersome objects: the dull-colored, blocky, careless-looking power adapters and portable chargers and their various entangled wires. What if you combined a wall charger and mobile battery in a single object? What if it had a more appealing aesthetic? Smiedt sourced the technology, and Rashid designed around it to create an object they called Bump. Sifting through a box of prototypes, Smiedt pointed out that this completely different product has almost the same elliptical shape as the discarded cleaner idea. This \u201cfun\u201d form (it comes in magenta, red, black and blue) will carry through the entire product line, he explained. Rashid also devised a matching cable, and a clever silicone sleeve that is used both to store the cable and to protect Bump when it\u2019s tossed into a bag.Of course, there was a hitch. Market testing found that consumers were often happy to use Bump with the (less attractive) power cable they already owned, and didn\u2019t bother with the sleeve. So as Bump goes on sale online and rolls out across big retailers, starting with the Container Store in late October, the cord is now sold separately. And that clever silicone sleeve may also be sold separately \u2014 or it may be on its way to a prototype box somewhere.6. The SolutionAll redesigns have something in common: They end. This does not happen at the moment the redesigned symbol, object or interface is implemented. It happens when that redesign is replaced. Maybe that\u2019s the lofty logic of progress, or just the workaday logic of capitalism. But it\u2019s certainly the logic of the redesign, and perhaps design in general, in the early 21st century. When IDEO\u2019s Tim Brown talks about updating all that is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d today, he\u2019s talking about entire systems, not just their individual and tangible components and manifestations.IDEO started out as an industrial-design firm working on consumer products; it expanded further into interaction design as the digital world took hold, and then it went into services. Now its projects include \u201credesigning\u201d such abstractions as the school lunch (for the city of San Francisco) or the vote (for Los Angeles County), experimenting with how to lace in 21st-century technology elements and shed out-of-date practices. These are incremental efforts that play out over years. There is no momentous before-and-after unveiling, just a continuous process of researching, trying and replacing ideas. This, after all, is how designers work: in an ongoing system of study, hunches, prototypes, tests and do-overs.The inevitability of re-redesign is something that Amy Wu (now part of a Microsoft design team in San Francisco) and Luke Stern (now a designer for Intersection, a firm focused on civic spaces) encountered in their work for Citi Bike. A few months after the triumphant installation of their redesigned kiosk decals, the company that operated Citi Bike was bought by another bike-share operator, Motivate, which runs similar programs for several other cities. They got an email from Citi Bike saying they might be needed again, but then never heard back.The new owner promptly set about a broader upgrade of Citi Bike\u2019s system involving new software and changes to the hardware in those kiosks. This meant that the decals needed to be redesigned yet again. The new ones incorporated some of Wu and Stern\u2019s thinking, but in a new look that, among other things, visually announced to the world that Citi Bike had been updated.Stern and Wu are philosophical about this turn. \u201cThe logistics had changed,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThey had to update the system. Our design wasn\u2019t actually relevant any more. That\u2019s reality, right?\u201d Right. And it was certainly a useful final lesson for an effort that started out as a student project: All redesigns end, but the redesign never does. \u2666Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Spends Big to Build a Computer Out of Science Fiction", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Microsoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today\u2019s digital computers.There is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible \u2014 and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics.Microsoft\u2019s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs.In the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company\u2019s approach is based on \u201cbraiding\u201d particles known as anyons \u2014 which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions \u2014 to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles.Leading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today\u2019s digital systems.Unlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an \u201centangled\u201d state \u2014 physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined \u2014 with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of qubits.\u201cOnce we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,\u201d Mr. Holmdahl said.There is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created.Mr. Holmdahl\u2019s project will also include the physicists Leo Kouwenhoven of Delft University, Charles M. Marcus of the University of Copenhagen, David Reilly of the University of Sydney and Matthias Troyer of E.T.H. Zurich.Microsoft\u2019s newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the last two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable qubits.\u201cThe magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and superconductors,\u201d Dr. Marcus said. The researchers recently made a \u201cremarkable breakthrough\u201d in their ability to control the materials used to form qubits, he said. Most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures.So far, there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than today\u2019s digital computers. One early effort, known as Shor\u2019s algorithm, would be used to factor numbers, giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes.That would potentially have world-shaking consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers. Other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning algorithms, which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition.More immediately, however, these tools might advance the basic understanding of physics, a possibility the physicist Richard P. Feynman mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in 1982.For his part, Dr. Kouwenhoven said, \u201cMy dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum physics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what you need to know:\u201cWe don\u2019t operate on incomplete information,\u201d Mr. Obama told a digital video news service, NowThis News. \u201cWe don\u2019t operate on leaks..\u201d_____Our reporter is with Iraq forces, witnessing what life was like under the Islamic State and getting a feel for the grim urban fighting that lies ahead._____Anger at the United States may have contributed to the shift._____Prosecutors also implicated a senior aide to Ms. Park who resigned this week, Ahn Chong-bum.__________But why?One reason, some historians say, is that social permissiveness has governed the region since the Gold Rush days.\u201cLeadville, Colo., and San Francisco were disproportionately male, young and single. Those were places that had a lot of commercialized vice,\u201d David Courtwright, a history professor, said.Most Western states were admitted to the Union in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their constitutions often make it easier than ones in older states to organize ballot initiatives \u2014 which is how most states have legalized marijuana so far.Mr. Courtwright called the region an \u201cinteresting combination of blue state social liberalism and red state libertarianism.\u201dApparently they\u2019re drawn by the spirit that fueled the Gold Rush: turning natural resources into fortunes.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m really into this video game where I\u2019m a witch hunter in like the 1400s and have to speak to everyone like this. Then I hack up scary monsters with my sword and cool potions. It\u2019s very much like my real life.Call me old, or something, but it\u2019s starting to bore me. Maybe my life isn\u2019t cool enough to broadcast live all the time.All I know is, if it shows me anything like the weird gadgets they have in SkyMall, I\u2019m down.Imagine that: Already serving one fourth of the world and still growing like a weed. I truly don\u2019t understand how that happens. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told me it was because they have a \u201cgreat product\u201d which, uh, simplifies things a bit. I really want to know the secret sauce.But what goes up must come down, and analysts are freaked out about Facebook reaching the limits of \u201cad load,\u201d or how many ads they can jam into the News Feed over time. Which, I think, is a reasonable concern if your main worry is how Facebook is going to keep making more and more money. A rather base concern to me, but hey, I don\u2019t work on Wall Street.Sure, in the next few years, it\u2019s possible Facebook\u2019s ad business may not grow as fast as it\u2019s been growing. But getting that many people hooked is an incredible foundation on which to build all kinds of new products and other ways to make money. If your product is a daily addiction for nearly two billion people, how can you lose?So it\u2019s a bit snoozy, but it\u2019s key to the future of how we work. As more of us telecommute and forgo regular trips to the office \u2014 I\u2019m writing this on the floor of my apartment right now! \u2014 we\u2019re growing increasingly reliant on services like Slack (or Microsoft Teams) to stay in communication with our co-workers. You and I do most of our private chatting on Slack when we\u2019re not tweeting. Or, you know, talk about \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with other co-workers.So the conceit is, perhaps one or a handful of companies will be responsible for providing the connective tissue that serves us all in our nifty workplaces of the future. Slack, so far, has been doing a good job where many others like Yammer, a Microsoft-owned product, mind you, have so miserably failed in the past. Now, Microsoft wants another crack at the problem, and is using its incredible distribution clout with Microsoft Office to give its new product away to paying subscribers.What say you about collaboration? Isn\u2019t this incredibly important to you?And Microsoft has a real shot here. Slack has momentum, but Microsoft has a huge sales staff and deep connections with I.T. staff at businesses across the world. In its full-page ad, Slack confessed to being a little bit scared of Microsoft\u2019s big push. I think it should be.Also, are you going to join my Microsoft Team?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American in a Strange Land", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "FeatureAfter more than a decade away, a foreign correspondent comes back to take stock of his divided homeland.Supported byI didn\u2019t really know how to respond. I hadn\u2019t lived in the United States since 2003, when The New York Times moved me to Beijing as a foreign correspondent, along with my wife and two kids. We assumed we would move back home soon enough, but it never happened. We lived for six years in China, where our third child was born, followed by four years in New Delhi, where my beat was South Asia. By the time we settled in Rome in 2013, we had drifted into the category of American expatriates. When we saw our countrymen around the city \u2014 big, friendly tourists, a bit loud \u2014 my kids referred to them as \u201cthe Americans.\u201dWe weren\u2019t completely cut off. Most summers, we visited family and friends in the States; the kids streamed the American shows; my wife listened to \u201cMorning Edition.\u201d I worked for an American company, for American bosses, and I wrote articles trying to explain the world to a mostly American audience. All of this created the gentle illusion that we were still truly connected to home. Yet as the years passed, I realized that I had lost touch, that the country I left was no longer the same.The year I moved away, George W. Bush stood beneath a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner on an aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. Facebook hadn\u2019t yet been turned into a company. The iPhone did not exist. I left before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, before Detroit went bankrupt. I missed the Great Recession (though I am still living the European translation of it). I missed most of the last two presidencies. I missed Brangelina.Instead, I witnessed from the other side the global forces that would bring profound changes to America. I visited industrial regions of southern China where the ground seemed to vibrate under the weight and bustle of all the countless new factories. Once iPhones had been invented, it was Chinese workers who assembled them. I watched Bangladeshi seamstresses stitch clothes sold at Walmart. American consumers benefited from the cheaper goods, but American manufacturers did not. Between January 2000 and December 2014, the United States lost roughly five million manufacturing jobs.Then I moved to Rome and watched the European Union grow ineffective and paralyzed, as the dream of a vibrant, unified Europe seemed to wither. Democracy was losing ground in Hungary and the Philippines; it had all but surrendered in Russia. Syria became a slaughterhouse. The Islamic State dispatched terrorists around the world. China\u2019s politics became more oppressive, as President Xi Jinping cracked down on dissent and nurtured a Maoist-style cult of personality. Economic globalization was supposed to accelerate political liberalization around the world, but instead authoritarianism appeared to be on the rise. The West, it seemed, had failed to anticipate the possibility that globalization could contribute to the destabilization of \u2014 or pose a threat to \u2014 democracy, even in the United States.This summer, I decided I wanted to explore this place that had become a foreign country to me. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. I planned a zigzag route, revisiting places where I once lived or worked, a 29-day sprint through 11 states (and four time zones). I knew I would be moving too fast to make any sweeping declaration about the state of America, and I wouldn\u2019t ask people which presidential candidate they were voting for. I was more interested in why they were so anxious about the present and the future. I wanted to find out why the country was fragmenting rather than binding together. Most of all I wanted to see with my own eyes what had changed \u2014 and so much had changed.When I asked if he had any concern about this election damaging American democracy, he said he didn\u2019t worry too much about that. He talked about the European Union as evidence of the political dangers posed by immigration and described \u201cethno-nationalism\u201d and economic nationalism as potent political forces. \u201cI look around the world, and I think all those countries are coming apart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think ours is going to come apart. The melting pot is not melting anymore.\u201dI mentioned that I was leaving the next day to travel along the Texas-Mexico border. Buchanan grimaced for a moment and jokingly offered to lend me a shotgun. I thanked him, and later I flew off into the heat.I had been in contact with United States Customs and Border Protection but never thought to mention my aerial tour. A few hours after we landed, an agency spokesman emailed me. He was friendly but anxious: Agents reported seeing someone taking photographs from a helicopter tracing the border. Was it us?I had gone to El Paso often as a national correspondent for The Times, and I always liked the atmosphere there. Everybody seemed to know everybody else. El Paso is isolated from most of Texas, yet Ju\u00e1rez lies no more than a long baseball toss away. There is a fluid give and take between the two sides, even as the disparities are stark: Ju\u00e1rez has frequently ranked among the most violent cities in the world, while El Paso routinely rates among the safest municipalities in the United States.My helicopter ride had come about in typical El Paso fashion: I called a state senator, who connected me to the county judge, who nudged a local businessman to organize the trip. They saw it as a good opportunity to help rebut the 2016 election narrative that the border was a lawless, out-of-control sieve through which illegal immigrants flooded north and wreaked violence upon unsuspecting Americans. The county judge, Veronica Escobar, had grown wearily accustomed to the assumptions made in other parts of the country. \u201cOne of the first questions people frequently ask is, Will I be safe?\u201d she told me. \u201cYou can tell people that deportations are up and that in-migration is down from Mexico. You can tell people that the border has never been safer. You can provide people with as many statistics as possible \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201dEscobar, a Democrat and El Paso County\u2019s highest elected official, grew up here and considers the city an unlikely oasis of tolerance. She is Mexican-American; the city\u2019s police chief is African-American. We had dinner my first night in El Paso, and when I mentioned something Pat Buchanan said to me \u2014 he dared me to drive around El Paso with a Trump bumper sticker on my car \u2014 she laughed. But she worried that El Paso was changing. Even some of her own relatives, people who had moved away from El Paso, have posted pro-Trump, anti-immigrant messages on Facebook. Fear and anger overcame the facts on the ground, she said.\u201cHow did America get that way?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dI was starting my journey in El Paso because six months earlier I was across the border in Ju\u00e1rez, on the outside of America, looking in. As a correspondent based in Rome, I also cover the Vatican, so I traveled with Pope Francis\u2019 retinue on his trip to Mexico in February. His final stop was Ju\u00e1rez. As he prayed for migrants at the border\u2019s edge, I stared through the fence into the United States. Snipers were posted on rooftops; police cars with flashing lights blocked an overpass; agents watched from horseback or peered across the border with binoculars. Presumably some of this was to protect the pope, but I flew back to Italy startled by this show of force, this demonstration of American power and anxiety.A girl playing at her house in Baton Rouge, La., not far from where the police shot and killed Alton Sterling.\u00a0Soon after setting out in my rental car from El Paso, I saw just how thoroughly the Texas border had become militarized. Since I left, the number of Border Patrol agents nationwide had roughly doubled, to more than 20,000, a vast majority of them stationed along the 1,989-mile border with Mexico. They have motion detectors, helicopters, cameras, fixed-wing aircraft and drones at their disposal. Their boats ply stretches of the Rio Grande. Texas state troopers have also been dispatched to \u201csecure the border.\u201dThe El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, who has criticized the buildup, told me that so many troopers were present that they often had little to do besides enforce traffic laws. \u201cIt is a waste of money,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cIt was a response to the rhetoric that the border is unsafe. And that is wrong.\u201d (A new study by the Border Network for Human Rights found that troopers have been disproportionately stopping Latino motorists in many border counties, including El Paso.) At a convention of the Texas Republican Party this year, Gov. Greg Abbott falsely stated that the Islamic State was \u201crunning through the border.\u201d In April 2015, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted that the Islamic State had a training camp in Mexico, near El Paso. Again, there was no evidence to back up the claim.Safety feels like a tenuous concept right now, when a malcontent can detonate a homemade bomb in Chelsea or suicide bombers can blow themselves up outside a soccer stadium in Paris. But so much of the safety rhetoric around the border blends legitimate concerns \u2014 especially when it comes to smuggled drugs, money and weapons moving in both directions \u2014 with political opportunism. The rate of people being apprehended while trying to cross the border from Mexico declined in 2015 and is now at its lowest point in more than 40 years. And even as President Obama pushed for immigration reform, his administration approved high numbers of deportations.One afternoon, I pulled up to a checkpoint on Interstate 10, about an hour or so east of El Paso, near the town of Sierra Blanca, Tex. A Border Patrol agent in a bulletproof vest asked if I was an American citizen while a dog sniffed the rental car for drugs. Less than an hour later, a Texas state trooper pulled me over on State Highway 90 in Presidio County for failing to use my blinker while changing lanes. The road was so quiet that a jack rabbit hopped across. The trooper asked if I was an American citizen, checked my passport and sent me on my way with a warning. Traffic enforcement.\u201cThis country is huge,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said one day. \u201cIt is like 50 countries all together.\u201dTom\u00e1s, a Chilean, has traveled the world, but this was his first long tour across the United States. On seeing one rural road sign, he asked what it meant to \u201cadopt a highway.\u201d Another day, another road sign: \u201cHitchhikers May Be Escaping Inmates.\u201d Tom\u00e1s was startled by how thoroughly so many American cities emptied out at night. In Colorado Springs, we attended a rodeo where the announcer made a long soliloquy praising our military for defending our freedom at home. Tom\u00e1s had embedded many times with American forces in Afghanistan. He liked the soldiers, but he didn\u2019t understand how sending troops to other countries, particularly Iraq, kept Americans free at home.Before the rodeo, I met two ranchers, Rob Alexander and Bill Craig. The air smelled faintly of horse manure as we sat on a plastic cooler drinking Coors. Alexander, 53, explained that the rodeo was a fund-raiser for ranch hands, who often lacked health insurance or a safety net to help out in emergencies. Ranching families had taken a hit in the past two decades, in part because trade agreements led to the consolidation of many cattle operations and an increase in imported beef from South America. Craig, 35, is a fourth-generation rancher, but he said land is now so expensive and profit so meager that he could never afford to start a ranch from scratch today. They talked like men whose lifestyles and values were endangered.\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWatch the TV. The moral compass is so far out of whack in our country right now.\u201dAt the University of Texas at Austin, I met Lisa Moore, a professor of English and women\u2019s studies who is one of three plaintiffs suing to overturn a new state law allowing students to carry concealed handguns on campus. Born in Canada but a resident of Texas for 27 years, Moore is a naturalized American citizen who is still a bit baffled by her new country. \u201cThat is the weirdness of the United States to me: Everybody is always talking about their rights,\u201d she said, while identity in Canada derives from the idea of the social compact.Moore is a gay, married mother of two children who teaches courses on L.G.B.T. literature. \u201cCampus carry\u201d infringes on free speech, she argues, by inhibiting her ability to provide a safe learning environment. What if a student becomes enraged by the subject matter and pulls out a Glock?American gun manufacturers produced 3.3 million guns the year I left for China, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. By 2014, the number was nine million (supplemented by 3.6 million guns imported into the country). According to some recent estimates, there are now roughly as many guns as people in the United States, maybe even more. To many foreigners, the American infatuation with guns is an inexplicable, if defining, national trait. On a taxi ride in Beijing once, the driver, upon discovering I was American, shaped his hand like a pistol and began shooting imaginary bullets.At a firing range outside Austin, I met six guys shooting semiautomatic rifles. Several of them worked for Defense Distributed, the open-source organization in Austin that came up with a plastic handgun whose design can be downloaded from the web and produced with a 3-D printer. The State Department ordered the company to remove the design code, but the company is challenging that order in court. For Benjamin Denio, at the time a 36-year-old who worked in desktop support and did product testing at Defense Distributed, being able to produce your own plastic gun is a safeguard against the tyranny of the state. \u201cThe term I would use to describe the level of vitriol in the country,\u201d Denio said, \u201cis that it is the \u2018cold civil war.\u2019\u2009\u201dI was running into so many disgruntled people that I began to worry, as I dipped in and out of places, that I was inadvertently being drawn to angry people. I figured I would get a taste of Middle America by stopping in Russell, Kan., which I visited 20 years earlier when a local hero, Bob Dole, was the 1996 Republican presidential nominee. Walking along the redbrick Main Street, I saw a crowd streaming out of a local theater. Inside, Christina Fowler, a pastor, had just finished services for her nondenominational congregation. Today was her son\u2019s birthday, and she invited me to a potluck lunch with the congregation in her backyard.Everyone sat at folding tables eating potato salad and lasagna. I sat with the associate pastor, Lonnie Whitten Jr., and a congregant named Cindy, who asked that her last name not be published. Whitten, who had a bushy ZZ Top beard and arms covered in tattoos, described himself as a reformed bad boy. This congregation, he said, was moving away from the culture of the \u201ccorporate church\u201d and also opposed same-sex marriage. Cindy had been part of a local delegation taken to San Diego for the 1996 Republican National Convention as living proof of Dole\u2019s hometown values. \u201cWe were treated like royalty!\u201d she said. Now 59, Cindy explained that too many ministers around the country watered down the true message of the Gospel, serving up baby food, not meat. And what was the real message? That homosexuality is a sin. That Islam is incompatible with Christianity.\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time when someone gives the signal,\u201d she told me of Muslims living in America, \u201cand we\u2019re all going to be beheaded.\u201dI ate some potato salad, a bit stunned.Living in Louisiana in the 1990s, I regularly visited the capital for stories about state politics. I thought back to 1991, when the white supremacist David Duke made it to a runoff in his gubernatorial campaign against Edwin Edwards, the former Democratic governor who was perpetually under investigation for corruption. \u201cVote for the Crook: It\u2019s Important,\u201d his supporters\u2019 bumper stickers read. (Years later, he was finally convicted.) Now Duke is running for the Senate, and his re-emergence has coincided with the racial splintering of Baton Rouge.On July 5, Alton Sterling was shot by the police as he sold CDs outside a convenience store. The police shooting of yet another black man, captured on video, became a national scandal. Twelve days later, a black veteran of the Marines shot six law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, killing three, including one who was black.One afternoon, Lionel Bazile Jr. picked me up at my hotel for a tour of the neighborhood where Sterling was killed. Bazile, a 66-year-old retired postman, is a Roman Catholic and a member of an interracial, interfaith coalition called Together Baton Rouge. It was founded about six years ago, after a prominent black pastor, Lee T. Wesley, led an outreach effort to some white ministers and community leaders because he felt the city was dangerously, if silently, divided. That split became clear when a predominantly white group of organizers in southern Baton Rouge sought to create their own school system and, ultimately, incorporate their own city, St. George. They needed a new school system, they argued, because the East Baton Rouge Parish schools were struggling. But carving out a wealthy area of Baton Rouge as a new municipality would have drained tax revenues from the surrounding city and gutted the funding for Baton Rouge public schools. The new municipality was also laid out to include the Mall of Louisiana, a major source of sales-tax revenue. Bazile, along with others from Together Baton Rouge, helped defeat the St. George movement, but the underlying problems had hardly gone away.\u201cNow we are crossing Florida Boulevard,\u201d Bazile told me as we rode in his truck. \u201cWe call Florida Boulevard the Mason-Dixon line that divides Baton Rouge.\u201dOnce we entered North Baton Rouge, the historically black section of the city, the road immediately became bumpier. According to Bazile, the neighborhood received only a small slice of the money from the citywide road-improvement project. \u201cYou are not going to see too many shopping centers around here,\u201d he said as we passed dilapidated strip malls. We drove by a hospital where the emergency room had been closed down. During our drive, I did not see a single national chain store.North Baton Rouge had apparently died from gradual abandonment. Most politicians ignored the neighborhood. When crime began to rise, Bazile\u2019s home was burglarized four times, and the value of his property began to depreciate. He and his family moved out, as did many middle-class black families. The Mall of Louisiana opened in the late 1990s near the city\u2019s predominantly white southern suburbs and soon became a magnet for more public and private investment. \u201cNorth Baton Rouge was dying,\u201d Bazile said, \u201cbut southern Baton Rouge was booming.\u201dBazile and I pulled into the parking lot of the Triple S Food Mart, where Sterling was killed. Someone had painted Sterling\u2019s image on the side of the store, and soggy bouquets of flowers and tributes lay piled on the pavement. Veda Washington-Abusaleh, one of Sterling\u2019s aunts, stood nearby with a protest poster rolled up in her hands. She told me she was out there every day. When I explained that I was a journalist, she began shouting. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing changed!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is still the same. I can tell you what needs to change! White police officers need to be better trained.\u201d She pointed to the spot in the parking lot where activists and political leaders erected a stage in the days after the killing. \u201cRight where his blood stained the street,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt is a political thing for them. But I want justice.\u201dA lot of people did. Today, Baton Rouge is a reminder of the entrenched racial and economic segregation in many American cities. Nationally, stubborn disparities remain between whites and blacks as far as income, college-graduation levels and employment. The median adjusted income for white households was roughly $71,300 in 2014, compared with $43,300 for black ones. The median net worth of white households is about 13 times as high as that of black ones, according to the most recent figures from the Pew Research Center. John Logan, a sociologist at Brown University, told me that racially biased economic development is one reason these disparities remain entrenched. Black communities have been routinely passed over for commercial projects, like shopping malls, which attract other development projects and lift property values.On my last morning in Baton Rouge, I met Gary Chambers Jr., a black civil rights advocate and journalist who was a leader of the protests over the Sterling killing. We met at an IHOP, which Chambers picked because the franchise was black-owned. Chambers had become an outspoken advocate for North Baton Rouge and a blunt critic of the city\u2019s racial status quo. He blamed the police and politicians, including the city\u2019s black mayor. Chambers described his own agenda as being unabashedly \u201cpro-black.\u201d \u201cWe are supposed to live in this society where we want everybody to be a part of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd we do. But I live in Baton Rouge, and it\u2019s just not the case.\u201dTo Chambers, the Sterling killing was as much about economics as bad policing. \u201cWhy is Alton Sterling selling CDs in the middle of the night, outside a convenience store in the hood?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have economic opportunities in North Baton Rouge.\u201d When I mentioned Together Baton Rouge and the efforts to build deeper relationships between whites and blacks, Chambers chuckled softly and then paused a moment. \u201cThey are all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying.\u201dBut I could tell he was skeptical. He told me that it was time for the older generation to simply get out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m 31,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve been in office since the \u201980s and my community looks like this, then you have some blame. My generation is inheriting this. We didn\u2019t create this. So don\u2019t tell us how to feel about it.\u201dA week or so after I left Baton Rouge, the city flooded; some areas were inundated with six to eight feet of water. Parts of the region were declared disaster areas. After I sent a sympathy note to Broderick Bagert, an organizer of Together Baton Rouge, he wrote back: \u201cWe\u2019ll invite you back when the plague of locusts arrives, which I understand is expected to be next week.\u201dThis has pushed some low-income people onto the streets, or out of the city, and intensified the pressure on street people to move on, often to the Tenderloin and other commercial neighborhoods downtown. After three days in the city, Tom\u00e1s and I were dazed by what we had seen: drug addicts shooting up; two people engaging in oral sex, in broad daylight; a young woman vomiting on the sidewalk, unable to digest a donated pastry; homeless people camping on streets that reeked of urine; two old men, wheeling their possessions in dueling grocery carts, fighting midday on Market Street near the offices of Twitter, with one man waving a steel rod and the other swinging a bear knife until the police arrived.\u201cHomelessness issues are very real, but they are also very symbolic of so many other inequities and stressors that are happening in the city,\u201d Peter Cohen, an affordable-housing advocate, told me one morning. \u201cYou say, What\u2019s the problem? The tech economy is booming. Employment is up. It only becomes apparent when you drill down to the level of the neighborhood. We are struggling in San Francisco, to some extent, with the excesses of wealth that have concentrated here.\u201dIn the November elections, San Francisco has multiple local ballot initiatives related to homelessness (which has been a woefully nonexistent issue in the presidential campaign). There is also a battle over the rapidly expanding sharing economy, some of whose largest companies were started in the area. Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco, markets thousands of units in the city and spent heavily to defeat a local ballot initiative last November that would have severely restricted short-term rentals. In June, the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved some restrictions anyway, prompting a lawsuit from Airbnb. Whatever the outcome, the usual parameters of housing issues \u2014 say, tenants versus landlords \u2014 seem forever changed.Dale Carlson, a consultant who has played a central role in the political fight against Airbnb, said the sharing economy has contributed to the rise in rents and has encouraged some landlords to evict tenants and convert apartments to short-term rentals. (Advocates for house-sharing platforms say the rentals are vital in helping people make extra money to afford the high cost of living in the city.)\u201cIt\u2019s essentially, Who gets to live here?\u201d Carlson said of the political fight. \u201cAnd who is squeezed out?\u201dOne day, I drove down Highway 101 to Silicon Valley to meet Reid Hoffman, a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock and the chairman of LinkedIn, the professional-social-networking company, which was then in the process of being sold to Microsoft for $26.2 billion. Hoffman founded LinkedIn the same year I left for Beijing; now he was a billionaire. He is politically active, having supported and advised Obama and raised money for and donated money to Hillary Clinton. I mentioned how the election had become a referendum of sorts on globalization and trade, yet there had been little discussion about the next big earthquake \u2014 artificial intelligence, or the approaching world of self-driving cars, smartphones that can diagnose a melanoma and much more. Globalization may have ravaged blue-collar America, but artificial intelligence could cut through the white-collar professions in much the same way.Hoffman said the reactions to artificial intelligence range from utopian to dystopian. The utopians predict huge productivity gains and rapid advances in medicine, genetic sequencing, fighting climate change and other areas. The dystopians predict a \u201cRobocalypse\u201d in which machines supplant people and, possibly, threaten humanity itself. \u201cMy point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it is a massive transformation and does really impact the future of humanity, but that we can steer it more toward utopia rather than dystopia with intelligence and diligence.\u201dEither way, another major economic shift is coming, perhaps sooner than people realize. Hoffman said that many of the jobs in today\u2019s economy will change fundamentally during the next 20 years. On the same day I met with Hoffman, Uber announced a pilot program to test self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. It also bought a company developing self-driving trucks. \u201cWe have to make sure that we don\u2019t have a massive imbalance of society by which you have a small number of people that own the robots and everyone else is scrambling,\u201d he said.Back in the Tenderloin, I met with Del Seymour, a former drug dealer who runs a nonprofit organization called Code Tenderloin, in which he trains local low-income people for the job market. In recent years, the city had granted major tax breaks to companies that opened offices in the area, and Seymour offered tours to show tech workers their new neighborhood. I joined a small group from Zendesk, a cloud-based customer-service software company founded in Denmark whose headquarters are in the Tenderloin. Its employees had already done volunteer work with a local nonprofit organization, distributing clean syringes to local drug users to prevent the spread of AIDS. It was not the usual tech job.The tour ended inside the Cadillac Hotel. Jerry Garcia once lived there in the early 1960s, Muhammad Ali once sparred there, and it now has many subsidized rooms for low-income residents. Seymour asked the Zendesk employees to sit in the lobby and praised the company for its volunteer work. But then he pointed out that tech companies hire more than just techies \u2014 about 30 percent of the jobs, he said, did not require technical training. He told them how he was once one of the biggest dope dealers on Taylor Street. He had changed, however, and other people in the Tenderloin could, too. \u201cLet us in your back door,\u201d he said, his voice rising like that of a preacher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your food. We don\u2019t want your sympathy. We want jobs.\u201d\u201cThere will be fires tonight,\u201d Elaine Cromie said as we drove through the city streets. \u201cThat is for sure.\u201dCromie, a freelance news photographer, was giving me a tour of the city. Even though Detroit was out of bankruptcy and downtown boosters were pushing a resurgence narrative, the arson fires were still happening often enough that the local media had to pick and choose which ones to cover. \u201cIt\u2019s really only news if it is a hazardous-materials fire,\u201d she said.We turned onto Goldengate Street and parked near a few vacated houses. Trees still shaded the rotting homes where middle-class families once lived, before many of them walked away from bad mortgages. The emptiness of some streets reminded me of photographs of the depopulated, decaying buildings left behind after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. That part of Ukraine has been largely without people for 30 years and is now known as the Zone of Alienation, which seemed like a fitting phrase to describe parts of Detroit too.Five years back, the organizers of Occupy Detroit spent the winter on Goldengate, but the anticapitalist movement fizzled and the street today is mostly populated by hippies and squatters. It is, in fact, a counterculture oasis, known as Fireweed Universe-City. Cromie was looking for a guy who was supposed to connect us with a community leader, Doctor Bob, but instead we bumped into Zack Zduniak. Zduniak, 26, had simply checked out of mainstream America, which today\u2019s Detroit made possible.Zduniak grew up in suburban St. Clair Shores in an era of diminished prospects, while the local auto industry declined. He liked living off the grid, but it wasn\u2019t easy; he was sleeping with his cat in a friend\u2019s delivery truck. He worked part-time at a restaurant, sometimes foraged for berries and knew which churches gave out free food. Visitors turned up, often Europeans, some via couchsurfing.com, for a binge of partying or a voyeuristic taste of life on the antimaterialist fringe. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to be involved in this crazy, consumerist society,\u201d he told me.Zduniak thought Doctor Bob could better represent the community, so we knocked on his door. Bob Pizzimenti is a chiropractor, urban farmer and the proprietor of the healing center and vegetarian cafe down the street, which was the only nearby outpost of private enterprise that I spotted. Everyone called him Doctor Bob. He bought his two-story brick house six years ago for $1,400 when others were fleeing. He liked that there were seemingly no rules in Detroit. He bought several empty lots around his house and planted corn and other vegetables on them. He wanted a different type of community, something new. He thought America had lost its way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At World Chess Championship, Familiar Overtones of East-West Politics", "Date": "2016-11-27", "News": "Supported byA Cold War battle has been playing out in Lower Manhattan for the last three weeks, in a soundproof glass chamber watched by partisans around the world. When the contest ends this week, victory will belong either to a resurgent Russia or to Norway, a wary neighbor along Russia\u2019s increasingly militarized border.The battlefield is a chessboard. The contestants are Sergey Karjakin, a Russian, and Magnus Carlsen, a Norwegian and the defending world champion.As they approach play on Monday for the final regulation game in the best-of-12 World Chess Championship, the players are in a dead heat. If the game ends in a draw, they will meet again to break the tie on Wednesday.In their mid-20s, the men are the youngest ever to meet for the world championship, and belong to an era of transnational athletes with online followings and commercial sponsors. Through 11 games, each has managed just one win, with nine games ending in draws.The contest, held in New York for the first time in 21 years, comes at a time of escalating tensions among Russia, the United States and Western Europe, including a warning from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to NATO countries about increasing their military presence in the region.But the political backdrop to the match, including Mr. Putin\u2019s military buildup and support for the Syrian government, has been anything but sportsmanlike.Mr. Karjakin has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Putin and Russia\u2019s annexation in 2014 of Crimea, which led to sanctions from the United States. The chess player was born in Crimea and at 12 became the youngest grandmaster ever, before moving to Russia in 2009. \u201cI switched because I didn\u2019t have any support, nothing,\u201d he said before the match.No Russian has held the title of world champion since Vladimir Kramnik in 2007, a grievous drought in a country where chess is part of the national character. Russians held the title from 1958 to 2000, except for a three-year period when Mr. Fischer won it and then refused to defend it. Mr. Karjakin came into the match in the unaccustomed position of underdog.\u201cFor Russian chess, it is a chance to restore its status,\u201d Sergei Shipov, a prominent Russian grandmaster, said in Moscow last week. \u201cPerhaps we won\u2019t be able to reach the Soviet heights, but the fact that leading media outlets pay attention to the match is very positive. We haven\u2019t seen it for 30 years. Russia and Norway do not sleep right these days.\u201d However, he added, \u201cFor all normal people this is a chess match, not a political game.\u201dLev Alburt, a Soviet defector and grandmaster who was at the world championship match, said the ardor to reclaim the title was especially impassioned this year because Russian athletes had been barred from the Summer Olympics and Paralympics for using banned substances, which Russians saw as an insult perpetrated by the West, especially the United States.Yet in Norway, where Mr. Carlsen\u2019s matches are broadcast live, he is \u201csort of a rock star,\u201d said Hans Olav Lahlum, a chess commentator, who added that people stop him on the street to talk about chess. But he did not see geopolitical passions aroused by the match. \u201cPutin uses chess for his sports nationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think common people in Norway see this match as a West versus East.\u201d The first question asked at the match\u2019s opening news conference was whether Mr. Carlsen was making chess sexy. His answer cast doubt on the suggestion.For American chess fans, Mr. Karjakin, 26, was largely unknown before he beat two higher-rated Americans and five other grandmasters in a qualifying tournament in Moscow in March. Considered an underdog against Mr. Carlsen, 25, he has shown poise and tenacious defensive skills throughout the match, several times overcoming a disadvantage to eke out a draw.The match\u2019s first seven games ended in draws \u2014 some exciting, some short on drama \u2014 before Mr. Karjakin drew first blood in the eighth round, applying pressure until Mr. Carlsen made a series of errors and had to concede after 52 moves. Mr. Carlsen skipped a required postgame appearance, for which he will probably be fined.After that, Mr. Karjakin just needed to play even for the next four games to become champion. But after a draw in Round 9, he missed a chance for a draw in Game 10, and Mr. Carlsen inflicted a six-and-a-half-hour, 75-move grind to surrender. Afterward, Mr. Carlsen smiled and said the eight draws and one loss were the longest he had gone in a match without a win.Now it all comes down to Monday\u2019s game. Unless it ends in another draw. As in global geopolitics, contests are not always decided on schedule.An article on Monday about the World Chess Championship referred incorrectly, in some editions, to the television coverage in the United States of the 1972 match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. The match was covered in real time with live commentary, not broadcast live.Henrik Pryser Libell and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Reels After Trump\u2019s Election", "Date": "2016-11-09", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley\u2019s luminaries woke up Wednesday morning to a darkened new global order, one that the ceaseless optimism of their tech-powered visions seemed suddenly unable to conquer.\u201cThe horror, the horror,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist at the firm Sherpa Capital who, like just about every leading light in tech, had strongly supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThere were too many people in the tech industry who were complacent. They waited and waited and waited to get engaged in this election. And now we have this nightmare.\u201dOthers were more succinct in their devastation. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of the corporate messaging service Slack.For some, buried in the visceral reaction was also a realization that the tech industry\u2019s relationship with government \u2014 not to mention the public \u2014 looks bound to shift in a fundamental way.Mr. Trump\u2019s win promises to rip apart that relationship. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during the interminable campaign that led to his victory. Mr. Trump promised to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon, repeatedly vowed to force Apple to make its products in the United States, and then called for a boycott of the company when it challenged the government\u2019s order to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration plans are anathema to just about every company in tech.Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft offered no immediate comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s win, or how the new administration\u2019s stated policy goals would affect their businesses.But it seems clear that a shift is in the offing. Leaders of these behemoths have long spoken in ambitious, gauzy sentimentalities about a broadly progressive future. Their goals weren\u2019t simply financial but, they said, philosophical and democratic \u2014 they wanted to make money, sure, but they also wanted to make the world a better place, to offer a kind of social justice through code. Theirs was a tomorrow powered by software instead of factories, and offering a kind of radical connectivity that they promised would lead to widespread peace and prosperity.In private, during the campaign, many tech leaders were positive that their vision would prevail over Mr. Trump\u2019s. When asked about whether they were preparing in any way for a Trump victory, bigwigs at many of the industry\u2019s leading tech and financial firms were bemused by the notion. They thought it would never happen.The deeper worry is that tech is out of step with the national and global mood, and failed to recognize the social and economic anxieties roiling the nation \u2014 many of them hastened by the products the industry devises.And then you get to the economic problems. Unlike previous economic miracles, the tech boom has not led to widespread employment. Much of the wealth generated by the five biggest American tech companies flows to young liberals in California and the Pacific Northwest, exactly the sort of \u201cglobal elites\u201d Mr. Trump railed against in his campaign.\u201cWe need to figure out how to connect more Americans to the economic engine of technology,\u201d said John Lilly, a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners.On Wednesday, some in Silicon Valley worried about their disconnection from the mass of voters who chose Mr. Trump.\u201cIn tech, we need scale, so we look at the world through the lens of aggregate metrics like page views, active users and even revenue,\u201d Danielle Morrill, the chief executive of a start-up called Mattermark, wrote in an email. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we understand the people on the other side of the screen as individuals. That\u2019s the danger, and the opportunity.\u201dOthers weren\u2019t as high-flying, but were nevertheless resolute.Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, an online document storage company, suggested that the tech industry promote specific policy issues.\u201cTo shift to an economy driven by innovation from tech-enabled businesses, we need to get ahead on the issues we\u2019ve been talking about in Silicon Valley for years, like education, patent reform and immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, minus taxes and some tax repatriation issues, much about Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been antithetical to most of the big businesses that are driving the economy.\u201dMark Suster, a venture capitalist at Upfront Ventures, echoed the idea.\u201cTech needs to take a deep breath, and then reflect on how this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd have policy proposals that can realistically address the inequality in our country.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.comKatie Benner contributed reporting.Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and Congress Both Want Tax Cuts. The Question Is Which Ones.", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported bySeveral economic issues divide many Republicans in Congress from Donald J. Trump, the Republican president-elect. Free trade versus tariffs to limit imports. Immigration reform versus a border wall. Cutting Social Security and other benefit programs versus protecting them.But one economic matter unites just about every member of the Republican party: support for tax cuts, particularly for those at the top of the income ladder.\u201cTax reform is the thing that always unites Republicans,\u201d said William Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush. \u201cI would guess that that\u2019s Item 1 on the congressional agenda.\u201dHouse Republicans already have a fairly detailed blueprint for Congress and the White House to follow.\u201cMy sense is that Trump doesn\u2019t really have the details of a tax reform package that he wants,\u201d Mr. Gale said. \u201cHe has broad ideas, and then the Congress will go at it and pin down the details. The House blueprint seems like the place to start and may be fairly close to where they finish.\u201dThat does not mean Mr. Trump will not have his own ideas. Mr. Gale expects a Trump White House to insist on continuing a deduction for interest paid on debt-financed projects, a provision dear to real estate developers. (The House plan proposes ending the deduction, instead allowing businesses to immediately deduct expenses and investments.)While sweeping tax cuts were never a crusading theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s, they have long been near the top of Mr. Ryan\u2019s agenda. And Mr. Trump has suggested he would be happy to let Congress take the lead.There is certainly a significant overlap. Both would cut income tax rates across the board and keep rates low on income from investments, an approach intended to spur savings that effectively guarantees the juiciest cuts for the wealthy.Lowering the tax on capital gains \u2014 which also benefits the wealthy the most \u2014 draws wide support among the leadership headed for both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in 2017 as well.Republicans say they also want to provide some tax cuts for those lower on the income ladder. Senator Marco Rubio, who was re-elected to represent Florida after his failed presidential bid, favors increasing the child tax credit; Mr. Ryan, who is working closely with Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, supports expanding the earned-income tax credit to poor working families without children. Mr. Trump has suggested he wants to provide tax cuts to two-income families with children as well.For all the similarities, there are important differences as well. The biggest contrast between Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Ryan\u2019s tax approaches can be seen on the corporate side, where they differ on how to tax capital investment and debt. They also differ on the proposed tax rate for most small businesses.The most compelling target for business tax reform is the roughly $2.6 trillion that American corporations like Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and Pfizer have kept abroad on an extended tax holiday, out of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s reach.\u201cEveryone agrees that the foreign tax situation is ludicrous because it doesn\u2019t raise any revenue and keeps several trillion dollars abroad,\u201d said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.Mr. Trump has said he was determined to get multinational companies to pay their American tax bills every year, although the sting would not be as great since he would also cut corporate rates and allow credits for foreign taxes paid.By contrast, the House Republicans have been pushing for what is known as a territorial system, which would tax all businesses solely on what goods and services they sold in the United States.The flaw in a territorial approach, Mr. Pozen and other economists have pointed out, is that it encourages businesses to shop the world for lower tax rates, ultimately shifting even more profits and jobs overseas.\u201cWhy is that good for a president who wants to have more jobs and more facilities in the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Pozen asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can reconcile those goals under a territorial system.\u201dMr. Pozen favors a global minimum tax that every American business would have to pay. Companies that shift their tax home or try to funnel more profits through low-tax nations would nonetheless be required to make up the difference between that rate and the minimum by paying the United States Treasury.However part of that stash is recaptured, there is a broad consensus in Congress that some of the new revenue should be used to invest in repairing and improving public infrastructure. Mr. Trump spoke of spending $1 trillion over 10 years on roads, bridges, waterways and airports, although he said he planned to rely primarily on tax credits for private companies, equity investments and privately raised debt.Linking international reform to infrastructure funding could work, said Janice Mays, a former staff director of the Ways and Means Committee who is now a managing director at the tax and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cI do think Trump wants to do infrastructure, to help people get jobs and stimulate the economy.\u201dBut as a longtime veteran of budget and tax battles on Capitol Hill, Ms. Mays warned that obstacles continually pop up in both expected and unexpected places. The size of the projected deficit from the various tax-cutting plans \u2014 as much as $7 trillion over a decade \u2014 could set off an internal war among Republicans who favor restraining spending on Social Security, Medicare and benefit programs for the poor and those, like Mr. Trump, who say they want to prevent the blue-collar families who flocked to his campaign from losing government programs that help keep them above water.\u201cI just think they may be a little optimistic at the moment,\u201d Ms. Mays said.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Question on Climate Crisis: How to Inspire Innovation", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byAround the world, energy innovation seems to be speeding up. Large historical forces are converging to create unprecedented turmoil and opportunity in what had long been one of the most hidebound industries.The changes are coming just as governments have finally resolved, after two decades of failed efforts, to tackle the global climate crisis. The emissions that cause global warming have already fallen in some of the biggest countries, including the United States.Yet none of it is happening fast enough.Experts say that to forestall the worst effects of global warming, emissions need to drop by 80 percent or more globally by 2050, a mere 34 years from now. But at a global scale they are not falling at all, and the promises countries have made about the energy transition, even if kept, would get the world nowhere close to where it needs to be.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.That means, experts say, that innovation in the field of energy will have to accelerate if governments hope to stave off catastrophe.While the cost of renewable energy sources has plunged, it is still not low enough in most places to drive dirty energy out of the market. And while renewables have shown that they can replace large amounts of fossil fuels, many experts say they believe they cannot do the whole job and new technologies will be needed in coming decades to get greenhouse emissions to zero.Progress on those new approaches has been halting, at best. So the future habitability of the Earth might depend on the answer to this question: How can innovation in the energy business be pushed into overdrive?Many people have a pretty clear idea about how innovation works \u2014 or at least they think they do.After all, millions of people have one of the most dazzling fruits of modern technology, the smartphone, in their pockets. At the root of innovations like the smartphone and the flat-screen television are microchips that get ever faster, reducing the cost of gadgets even as their capabilities mushroom.Now that almost everyone accepts that dirty energy is a problem, could it not be fixed with that same kind of innovation? It is a rational question, and only a few years ago some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley were asking it, too.Billions of dollars poured into \u201cclean-tech\u201d investments. Most of them failed, and within a few years, investors were acknowledging they had misjudged the difficulty of the problem.\u201cThey ran up against the hard realities of the energy sector,\u201d which does not remotely work the same way as most of the technologies emerging from Silicon Valley, Mr. Norris said.To understand why, start with this: Though energy may appear to be a free market, with prices rising and falling as traders buy and sell oil and electricity, appearances are deceiving.The most obvious example is electricity. Because the delivery of electricity is a natural monopoly \u2014 multiple sets of wires would be a chaotic mess \u2014 state governments essentially took control of the electricity business a century ago.They dictated what companies were allowed to build and set the prices they were allowed to charge, usually by lumbering, bureaucratic procedures that took years. The focus was on forcing the utilities to keep prices low while eking out modest returns on their investments.Not surprisingly, electric utilities were among the least innovative businesses in the entire economy, spending next to nothing on research and development. Some aspects of the business have been reformed in recent years, but progress has been halting.That means governments exercise a huge influence over supply; they can and do manipulate it for reasons having nothing to do with business principles.On top of that, the oil industry benefited for decades from government favoritism, including big tax breaks in the United States and big consumer subsidies in other countries, that helped lock in a global dependency on oil.As it became clear late in the 20th century that the emissions from coal, oil and natural gas threatened the world\u2019s climate, a cry for change arose.But the tight linkages between energy companies and governments meant that if change was to come, it would only come as a result of strong public policies.That, in turn, set off a debate that is still underway: What, exactly, should those policies be?For two decades, Europe has been the world\u2019s hothouse of experimentation in energy policy. Along the way, European governments have learned painful, expensive lessons.The governments saw promise in technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, but realized these would never be able to compete with entrenched utilities unless the market for them grew large enough that manufacturers could benefit from economies of scale. They tackled that head-on, creating subsidies funded from the pockets of electricity consumers.It worked, driving down the cost of renewables at a precipitous pace in recent years. Germany has pushed hardest among the large European countries and now gets a third of its power from various forms of renewable energy.State governments in the United States also adopted renewable targets, though the United States is behind Germany, with about 13 percent renewable electricity, counting power from dams.Despite their success in building the market, European governments were slow to adjust their subsidies, even as renewable power grew cheaper. Over time, the cost ballooned. The average German family is paying close to $300 a year on its electricity bill to support the green-energy push.Among environmental groups, the subsidies and mandates are largely seen as a success.That view is supported by a powerful argument: Economists have recognized that the falling cost of green energy is directly related to the size of the market. Every time the market for solar panels doubles, for instance, their cost falls by nearly 20 percent, according to research from a consultancy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance.So the preferred energy policy of the green groups is basically a more ambitious version of this established approach. If governments keep using subsidies and mandates to push for scale, they say they believe green energy will eventually be able to compete on economic grounds, giving society the tools it needs to reach low emissions by the middle of this century.But many energy experts say they believe this will not be enough, and see an urgent need to speed the pace of research and development. Their concerns center on the limitations of renewable power. Because the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, solar panels and wind turbines are not entirely reliable sources of electricity.Now, they are finding a better way.Recently, instead of handing out fixed subsidies, they have been running \u201creverse auctions\u201d for new wind projects. The company that asks for the lowest subsidy on a particular project gets the deal, and the subsidy.The results have been startling, awakening fierce price competition among the developers of wind projects.Offshore wind farms have been installed only in shallow water, but Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, and other companies are pursuing floating turbines that could work in many parts of the world where the sea floor drops off steeply. Statoil will soon start building the first commercial project of this type, a pilot off the coast of Scotland.On the outskirts of this city, it is testing a method in which surplus electricity would be used to heat up rocks, with the heat recovered later and used to generate power when renewable output is low. The energy could potentially be stored for days or weeks. The company will begin a much larger test next year.\u201cWe already know it works,\u201d said Till Barmeier, the Siemens project manager, as he offered a tour of the hot rocks one recent afternoon. \u201cThe question is, does it work well enough?\u201dEven with all the recent progress, it is still unclear just how far renewable energy can go.A few experts argue that the electricity system could go 100 percent renewable. But others reject that because of the intermittency problem, arguing that in the 2030s and beyond, society will need new huge power plants that can run most of the time without generating greenhouse emissions.If they are correct, only a handful of options are on the horizon.They could include new types of nuclear power plants, designed so that it is physically impossible for them to explode or leak radiation. Another possibility is to burn fossil fuels, but to capture the emissions.With big ideas like this, the basic problem is that building a large prototype plant can easily cost $1 billion or more, and private financiers are often reluctant to take the risk on unproven technology.One solution, of course, is for governments to spend money to subsidize big demonstration projects. Many Americans probably imagine that quite a bit is being spent already. But the numbers are actually low. The federal budget devoted to new energy technology is on the order of $6 billion a year, less money than American consumers spend on potato chips.It is not yet clear, though, whether Congress will honor President Obama\u2019s pledge.Speaking recently in New York, the secretary of energy, Ernest J. Moniz, sounded optimistic. He said he believed the political parties could find common ground by focusing on energy innovation, and if they did so, \u201cthe American approach\u201d would prevail.What is that approach?\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Dr. Moniz explained. \u201cWe recognize it. We solve it.\u201dFollow Justin Gillis on Twitter @JustinHGillisLike the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Hard to Make a Website for the Government?", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.O\u2019Farrell, who has been involved with government food programs since graduating from college nearly three decades ago, understood why his office would be a promising target for this kind of tech push. California\u2019s food-stamp participation rate, roughly 50 percent of eligible residents, was one of the lowest in the country, and the bureaucratic friction in the application process deserved at least some of the blame. Enlisting technology\u2019s aid made a lot of sense: More than three-quarters of Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year now use the internet, and Obamacare has ushered in a new generation of social-service clients who grew up on their smartphones and expect to interact with government the same way they do everything else. Yet CalFresh \u2014 in contrast to the Silicon Valley companies in the neighborhood, where teams of designers, product managers and data scientists cater to their online users with intense precision \u2014 offered a poor \u201cuser experience\u201d for clients on its digital channels. It lacked text or email support; its website didn\u2019t work well on mobile devices. These were just the sorts of problems that Code for America fellows figured they knew how to solve.The fellows soon discovered that an external vendor, Hewlett-Packard, had been contracted for years to maintain the site. A bigger obstacle to remaking MyBenefits CalWin would have been negotiating the cooperation of all 18 counties that used it. But one fellow, Jake Solomon, had an idea. The only information legally needed to submit a complete food-stamp application, he had learned, was a name, an address and a signature. Code for America could work around MyBenefits CalWin and build its own simple website just for CalFresh applicants. At the very least, this would make for a good proof of concept, a way to show various government officials that social-service delivery could be, in Solomon\u2019s words, \u201cdead simple.\u201d In 2014, after his fellowship had ended \u2014 he was still affiliated with Code for America \u2014 Solomon pitched this idea to his colleague Dave Guarino one afternoon, and they coded a prototype over the next few days.The following week, Solomon and Guarino gave a demonstration at O\u2019Farrell\u2019s office. Guarino handed a phone with the prototype on it to O\u2019Farrell, who filled out an application in a few minutes. With its clear language and big buttons, it felt slick, like Twitter or Facebook, not kludgy, like most .gov sites. O\u2019Farrell was impressed. \u201cThis could be a game changer,\u201d he said. \u201cGo for it. We like it.\u201d\u201cMy biggest lesson this year was that local governments are constrained,\u201d Solomon wrote in a blog post. \u201cThey\u2019re constrained by a complex web of local politics, state legislation and federal laws. The constraints cascade downhill, as does the responsibility.\u201dIn 2013, Code for America had nearly 30 fellows \u2014 selected by competitive application \u2014 working on behalf of 10 partner cities. Its annual operating budget was $7 million, more than half of which came from private grants. Pahlka often found herself on the road, giving talks and courting donors. Her pitch was simple: Use technology to make government better. What exactly she meant by that could be hard to parse, but the apps she cited and the anecdotes she shared were compelling, with a folksy, community-driven appeal. (Take care of your neighborhood storm drain!)Solomon, Guarino and Williams, part of the 2013 class of fellows, were initially assigned to different cities and themes. Solomon went to the Human Services Agency of San Francisco. Before Code for America, he worked for the RAND Corporation on health policy; before that he was at Palantir, a Silicon Valley data-analytics start-up that created software for intelligence services and other clients. Guarino, a software developer and policy wonk who had spent time at the California Health Benefits Review Program, devoted his fellowship year to building an app that allowed residents in South Bend, Ind., to report on the conditions of vacant and abandoned properties. Williams, a designer, built digital trail maps for parks in northeast Ohio. As a junior at Tulane during Hurricane Katrina, he had seen the storm sweep across Lake Pontchartrain and then flood much of New Orleans. \u201cI watched government fail on so many levels,\u201d Williams says. \u201cIn this very visible, physical way, where levees failed, but also the soul-crushing process that people went through afterward to get FEMA support.\u201dThe three young men had an easy rapport from the start. None of them fit the stereotype of the Silicon Valley engineer. Each majored in a social science \u2014 Solomon in economics, Guarino in political economy, Williams in English and political science. I saw them at their most animated in long conversations over Mexican takeout, talking about John Rawls and social contracts and the unfortunate amount of discretionary power wielded by street-level bureaucrats. For them, and for many of their Code for America colleagues, technology was a means more than an end, a lever with which they could move people\u2019s lives toward the good. While their peers in Silicon Valley wanted to play with cool new programming languages for the sake of playing with cool new programming languages, Solomon, Guarino and Williams, it seemed, found their motivations elsewhere. \u201cI care about helping people, period,\u201d Guarino told me.The normal process worked like this: Once an application was received \u2014 whether delivered in person, online or via fax \u2014 and entered into the database, the CalFresh office in the applicant\u2019s county would schedule an interview, to be held either over the phone or in person. At these sessions, eligibility workers, whose job is to determine whether clients qualify for social services, review documents like pay stubs, utility bills and identity cards. Eligibility is set at 200 percent of the poverty line, or roughly $41,000 in gross income for a family of three, but subject to a host of caveats; in granting exceptions to these caveats, eligibility workers exercise a great deal of discretion. They can choose to overlook missing documentation or demand additional receipts. They can verbally elicit information omitted from the application.The Code for America team\u2019s plan had always been to leave the scarier stuff off the website \u2014 questions like, \u201cHave you ever traded food stamps for explosives?\u201d or \u201cHave you ever committed a felony?\u201d Those questions could be answered during the live interview. The key was to settle on how much information to ask for at the start. Require too much, and users would be put off and give up; too little, and the eligibility workers, who preferred more details rather than fewer, would complain. In the end, the team settled on a compromise. After the user submitted a name and an address, two choices would present themselves: to continue filling out the rest of the application or to \u201cStop working and submit application now.\u201d Clicking the second option would lead to another page and the warning: \u201cAre you sure you want to submit right now? Since we only know your name and address, it will be hard to process your application. Instead of finishing it on the phone, we will have to send you paperwork in the mail.\u201dThe main technical challenge confronting the team followed directly from Solomon\u2019s initial flash of insight to create an independent site. Because GetCalFresh wasn\u2019t actually replacing MyBenefits CalWin, but was instead just offering an alternative point of access, they still needed to work with its existing infrastructure, which lacked an A.P.I., or application programming interface. Modern websites consist of a front end, or web page (what a user sees on the computer screen); a back end (a database and a server that hosts it); and usually an A.P.I. that sends data between them. We all regularly rely on things that function like A.P.I.s in the physical world. Say, for instance, you want to get takeout from your favorite Chinese restaurant. In this analogy, the front end would be your phone, the back end is the kitchen and the A.P.I. is whichever restaurant employee relays your order to the cooks. She\u2019s how you place an order of dumplings, cancel that order or modify it to include sweet-and-sour soup.In software development, A.P.I.s allow coders to change front-end or back-end components easily, while leaving the core of a program intact. The lack of an A.P.I. for MyBenefits CalWin meant that GetCalFresh, however great it looked, couldn\u2019t actually put any information into the earlier site\u2019s database. The state would not officially know about any of the applications it received; it wouldn\u2019t even know where to send a check. So the Code for America team\u2019s members, when they received an application through GetCalFresh, needed to figure out a way to get that information into the MyBenefits CalWin system.In April 2015, Guarino, while on a trip to Utah with Solomon and Williams, finally came up with a workaround. If the problem they faced was relying on people to manually enter information into the database, why not just write some code to take care of that part? Guarino used a technology called Selenium WebDriver that mimicked a user\u2019s activity on a website. Playing the role of the applicant, the webdriver would go to MyBenefits CalWin\u2019s front end and fill in each question using the information collected through GetCalFresh, then click \u201cnext.\u201d This was not exactly best practice when it came to coding: Webdrivers are used primarily in testing web applications, not in their actual operation. Because the webdriver couldn\u2019t catch all errors, when someone mistakenly submitted an impossible birth date, for example, or a nonexistent ZIP code, that information would trigger an error when it was entered into the legacy system. A human being would then have to correct the information from that faulty entry by hand.Williams worried, when giving demonstrations to county representatives, that the whole process would seem amateurish to them, the way it sometimes did to him. But he came to realize that the existing systems used by CalFresh staff members tended to be far more cumbersome and time-intensive than his inelegant webdriver. They didn\u2019t see the absence of tests and logs, the redundant code, the inability to deal with errors like missing information gracefully. He recalled a presentation at which the projector was broken, so the audience gathered around his computer. When he ran the webdriver, a new browser window opened up straight away to the legacy website, and the applicant\u2019s data automatically appeared, as if typed in by unseen fingers. Williams describes it as \u201ca magical moment.\u201d The genius of the webdriver was that it didn\u2019t require clerical workers to do anything different: no encryptions, no new data entry or software systems to deal with. It did exactly what workers at food banks and community-based organizations already did \u2014 fill out the legacy application on behalf of clients \u2014 except faster. It reinforced technology\u2019s most basic power: the ability of automation to eliminate boring and repetitive tasks.No one had a good answer, including the executives at Code for America. By many measures, GetCalFresh had surpassed all of the nonprofit\u2019s previous projects, and Code for America now found itself in unfamiliar territory. It had typically presented its projects as proofs of concept, but many of them, as one of the organization\u2019s officials later admitted in a blog post, lacked \u201cconsistent paths to sustainability.\u201d By that fall, out of the many dozens of apps created by Code for America fellows, fewer than 10 had found enough support to justify being spun off into start-ups. Many of them had not been updated on Github, the website where most collaborative coding projects are hosted, in months.As Solomon, Guarino and Williams saw it, a couple of obvious paths lay before them. The first was to solicit funds from traditional philanthropic sources. The second was to become a government I.T. vendor and sell to other counties and states. Neither path appealed to them. Donor funding, while probably necessary in the short term, seemed unsustainable in the long term \u2014 especially because, under the reigning Silicon Valley ethos, even philanthropic tech projects are expected to present a business model. Government I.T. vending work, on the other hand, was self-sufficient but uninspired. It was limited, by definition, to what was imagined under any given contract. \u201cIt abdicated responsibility for anything outside the software,\u201d Williams says. And for all of Code for America\u2019s beliefs that tech could serve as a lever for good, the bad code plaguing the public sector was rarely the only problem with a particular program; it would be a hollow improvement to give CalFresh a better application site without, say, making sure that reminder letters were sent out before an appointment or that the customer-support lines were adequately staffed.As the months passed and the financing remained unresolved, the team submitted proposals to several organizations \u2014 including Molina Healthcare in Long Beach, Calif., from which they sought $3 million over three years, characterizing their project as a preventive-health measure. But their reluctance to work for the government seemed to come from some deeper motivating force. In the beginning, I wondered whether it had to do with prestige. Public employees can get stuck working in rooms with ugly linoleum floors writing memos that may never be read; I.T. vendors, meanwhile, are the equivalent of enterprise software sales. Perhaps either fate seemed at odds with the team\u2019s self-image.But in talking to them, I found that their worries seemed to revolve less around social standing than around effectiveness. Having been exposed to the way government operated, they saw a decision-making system in which the status quo always wins. The lengths to which the team would have had to go to modify the legacy site, MyBenefits CalWin, was one example. The process to amend a notice of action \u2014 a letter informing CalFresh clients of changes in their eligibility, for example \u2014 was another. \u201cWhen you work for the government, ties go to the county, ties go to the state,\u201d Solomon told me. At the moment, the Code for America team controlled almost every aspect of GetCalFresh: If they wanted to, say, experiment with live chat for customer support, they could. That freedom would be curbed if they began collecting paychecks from the state.\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Cantonese, do you?\u201d he asked me as soon as I entered. I did not, alas. Many of the clients of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank were non-English speakers, and among them Cantonese was the most common native tongue. But the Cantonese-speaking employee who was supposed to be on duty that morning had called in sick. Liliana Sandoval, the food bank\u2019s senior program manager, was scrambling to find a replacement.A half-hour later, Sandoval and the replacement arrived, dragging a large file folder between them. His name was Calvin Yan, he worked for the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and, thankfully, he spoke Cantonese. They pulled out a pair of Microsoft Surface tablets. \u201cGo to demo.GetCalFresh.org,\u201d Solomon instructed. The landing page for GetCalFresh showed a glossy image of an Asian woman holding a toddler and standing in front of the produce aisle in an unidentifiable grocery store. At the top, it read: \u201cGet extra money for groceries every month. Take the first step. Apply for CalFresh in 10 minutes.\u201d In the footer: \u201cGetCalFresh.org is a service delivered by Code for America on behalf of the people of California.\u201d The favicon, the tiny image that appeared in the browser tab space when you navigated to the site, was a federal building with Corinthian columns and the symbol for Wi-Fi overlaid on the roof.Yan flipped through the screens. \u201cOh, this is really short,\u201d he said.\u201cYup,\u201d Solomon said, satisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d Yan said, before asking if eligibility was still at $1,900 per month.\u201cNo,\u201d Sandoval chided. She tossed him a San Francisco-Marin Food Bank resource guide. \u201cYou should be fine. The only thing might be sponsors.\u201d Sponsors backed immigrants, making them financially responsible for the new arrivals, but in practice they could be difficult to track down. Sometimes food-stamp applicants said they hadn\u2019t had contact with their official sponsors in years.At 10 a.m., the doors opened, and the first clients arrived: an attractive young couple, the man blond and beefy, the woman dark and wide-eyed. Each wore a backpack. Sandoval began speaking to the woman in Spanish. What was her monthly income? How many people in her household did she regularly shop for groceries with? Were any of them students? The woman reached out and touched her boyfriend\u2019s arm. Sandoval switched to English. How many classes was he taking at city college? Three, he said. Did he know how many credits that was? He didn\u2019t. There was a meek, quiet pause. \u201cWould it be helpful if I found out?\u201d he asked.The issue, Sandoval told him, was that full-time students were ineligible for CalFresh, although there was a long list of exceptions \u2014 he could be eligible, for instance, if he had kids. He shook his head. No kids. Then he should probably go to the registrar and confirm his status, Sandoval said. Meanwhile, she would submit a CalFresh application for his girlfriend and refer them to a food pantry in their neighborhood.Sandoval turned to Yan. \u201cCan you pull up the food-pantry locator?\u201d she asked. Another in-house civic-tech team had put together a search tool for food pantries.\u201cWhich neighborhood?\u201d Yan replied, typing on the Surface.\u201cNorth Beach,\u201d the woman answered.Yan flashed her a smile. \u201cMy neighborhood. O.K., the bad news is that there aren\u2019t too many options. But the good news is that there is a food bank just around the corner from your building. It\u2019s not in the search tool.\u201d He tapped his temple. \u201cBut I know it because it\u2019s just down the street from me. I\u2019ll write down the address for you.\u201dSandoval continued: \u201cOnce a week, you can go and pick up a bag of groceries.\u201d\u201cYou can pick what you want?\u201d the woman asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a 30-pound bag, more than 15 pounds of which is fresh produce, and then the rest, staples.\u201d She said they would hear back about their application in a few weeks. The couple shrugged on their backpacks. They thanked Sandoval.After the couple left, everyone waited. A good 45 minutes went by. No one else showed up. After noon, Solomon and I went to grab lunch. In all of our previous meetings, Solomon had projected an unrelenting positivity bordering on pretense. Today he seemed tired, less guarded. \u201cJust think about if every person from all those organizations \u2014 their energy were redirected toward software development,\u201d he said. I pointed out that not everyone had the skills for software development. And in any case, the event suggested the limits of technology. Sandoval\u2019s Spanish skills, Yan\u2019s local knowledge \u2014 these were the things that the technology, at least as of now, had yet to replace, and their softening effect called to a mind an earlier line from Solomon himself, that \u201cstigma was created or eroded at the point of service delivery.\u201dAs we waited for our sandwiches, Solomon got some bad news he\u2019d begun to expect: The $3 million they were seeking from Molina Healthcare \u2014 which could have kept their effort to expand GetCalFresh going \u2014 had been rejected because of restrictions on what the company could support.\u201cWhat else do you have in the pipeline?\u201d I asked.\u201cRight now, nothing,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cC.F.A. has been extremely generous, but they can\u2019t just let us carry on without strategic funding and strategic partners.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe need to figure out whether this model\u201d \u2014 digital nonprofits in the social-services sector \u2014 \u201cactually works or not.\u201dAs in the private sector, the GetCalFresh team\u2019s work would apparently be judged by people\u2019s willingness to pay for it. To me, this seemed absurd: Wasn\u2019t the whole purpose of government to fund collective projects that are irrational for individuals to take on alone? But Solomon and his team seemed to be caught between a public sector unwilling to finance them and a private philanthropic culture that didn\u2019t see enough value in what they did.Williams and Jaime-Alexis Fowler, then director of marketing at Code for America, joined Solomon for lunch. The waiter who came up to take the orders greeted them like old regulars. \u201cHey! I thought one of you guys was done.\u201d\u201cThis is his new office,\u201d Fowler quipped.\u201cMy new H.Q.,\u201d Solomon said.Fowler told me that in the last couple of weeks, a few significant individuals and foundations in Silicon Valley had come forward as sources of funding for GetCalFresh. The money wasn\u2019t in the bank yet, but things were looking promising, despite all the stresses and doubts of the previous months. Some people still believed in improving digital delivery by government \u2014 \u201cpeople who are saying what you are doing is really important and it\u2019s O.K. that you haven\u2019t figured out all the ins and outs of it.\u201dAfter the kale salads arrived, I asked Solomon what he was going to do now. GetCalFresh was his brainchild, and this creation process, he had told me before, represented the best job he ever had.His plan was to dream up similar projects, he said, but as a kind of social entrepreneur. \u201cIt just became increasingly apparent that moving forward we were going to be working for the government, which is great. There\u2019s a lot that can be done there. But I think my interests are closer to advocacy work than enterprise software. I need to set up a situation where I\u2019m working for my clients, my users.\u201d He paused. \u201cOne of the first things I\u2019m going to do is figure out whether there\u2019s a market for an intermediary in food stamps, the way that people are willing to pay $50 not to deal with the I.R.S.\u201d At the high end, these intermediaries were attorneys and financial advisers. In the middle, they were TurboTax, travel agencies, real-estate brokers. At the low end, of course, there was nothing.If government interactions are so unpleasant that intercessors are necessary, I suggested, then perhaps we should reform government instead of creating another go-between.\u201cBut I think intermediation is often \u2014\u201d Solomon began.Williams threw up his hands. \u201cYes!\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes!\u201d\u201cIn many cases it is those intermediaries who are the strongest pressure for reform,\u201d Solomon said.\u201cThey\u2019re also the strongest opponents of reform in some cases.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Solomon admitted. \u201cIntuit is a great example.\u201d Several years ago, California proposed simplifying tax returns for some taxpayers, but it was opposed by Intuit lobbying.Williams prodded his food with his fork. \u201cSo who\u2019s the most powerful actor?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the intermediaries oftentimes. And that can be a force for good, or a force for self-serving interest.\u201dAs lunch wound down, I asked where Dave Guarino was. I hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. \u201cDave is coding,\u201d Williams said.Now that things on the funding side were looking up, feature development could begin again. The GetCalFresh team was replacing Solomon with an engineer, Andrew Hyder, who was a Code for America fellow with Solomon, Guarino and Williams in 2013. And once the money arrived, there would be resources for hiring more people too. Williams looked meaningfully at Solomon when he said that.As it happened, the money would come in, and then some. In April, California declared its intent to award GetCalFresh a two-year \u201coutreach\u201d contract, federal money designed to reimburse nonprofits that helped clients through the application process for social services. It would be the first time California had made an award for web-based application assistance. \u201cWe see this as a major first piece of a client-based revenue model \u2014 since we will receive reimbursement based on the number of people we help,\u201d Williams told me. He credited, above all, the support of people like Leo O\u2019Farrell and Kim McCoy Wade, who became the state\u2019s new head of CalFresh in 2015. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who really pulled for us,\u201d Williams said. The team\u2019s immediate financial future secured, its members \u2014 Williams, Guarino and Hyder (three new hires were planned) \u2014 steeled themselves for a long summer leading up to a Code for America summit meeting in Oakland, where they hoped to persuade the various CalFresh directors to try them out.In my last conversations with Williams, the tone was one of cautious optimism. While the California contract kept GetCalFresh going for another two years and gave the team a sense of momentum, it hardly solved all their problems. A real A.P.I. needed to be built and additional county CalFresh directors won over. Above all, the team needed to show impact \u2014 in terms of numbers of users, applications and food-stamp approvals \u2014 on the scale that everyone had come to expect from tech ventures. Everything they had done until now \u2014 all the prototyping, hand-holding, cajoling, fund-raising \u2014 was just preparation. Now the work would really begin.It\u2019s hard to predict whether GetCalFresh will become the vanguard of a new movement in social services or a forlorn entry in the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. But GetCalFresh has made it further than the vast majority of civic-tech projects. It has overcome every kind of crisis \u2014 technical, financial, existential \u2014 while exposing the distance between the current fetishization of innovation and the reality of implementing even the best ideas within intransigent organizations. Perhaps most important, its team has demonstrated a commitment that goes beyond Silicon Valley opportunism.\u201cFor the longest time, if someone asked me what I did at a party or something,\u201d Williams told me, \u201cI would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a product designer,\u2019 or \u2018I work in tech.\u2019 Now I say I work in social services.\u201d Even Solomon, the prodigal son, hasn\u2019t strayed far. Back at the lunch at Citizen\u2019s Band, it occurred to me that despite his qualms, the public sector built so little of its own software that even so-called in-house projects were often procured from vendors. So in the end, you could either pay $30 to have someone outside the government handle the food-stamp application process for you, which is what Solomon wanted, or the government would pay a contractor $30 per successful food-stamp application, which is what Williams and the team wanted: a system in which government contracting outside the I.T. world could align with users\u2019 interests. This seemed a distinction without a difference \u2014 maybe they\u2019d all work together again at some point.Solomon smiled at that. \u201cI think over the next year, he\u2019s going to continue to try to recruit me, and I\u2019m going to continue to try to recruit him, and we\u2019ll probably meet somewhere in the middle.\u201d \u2666Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer based in New York.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: A Face-Off of Smart Speakers", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixTO get an idea of how annoying it can be to say \u201cO.K., Google\u201d multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand.O.K., Pepsi. O.K., Chipotle. O.K., Skittles. You get the picture. It\u2019s difficult to utter \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d the phrase used to control Google\u2019s new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool.That is too bad because Google\u2019s Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon\u2019s Echo.So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both Alexa and Google side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories that they shared in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home.What I found was that while Echo is currently more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google\u2019s product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years.Home\u2019s link to Google\u2019s database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase.Just give them both a pop quiz to see. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap?Amazon declined to comment.Occasionally there are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google\u2019s Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent.Most of the time, however, Google has answers when Alexa fails.Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won\u2019t offer a guess.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to presume an answer that may not be right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being really cautious with this feature.\u201dGoogle\u2019s speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone\u2019s residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on Day 1, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies.Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung\u2019s smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue.Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo.With Home, I managed to get Google\u2019s Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn\u2019t able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google\u2019s lack of support for the devices.Google said that for Home\u2019s release, it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come.One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior.For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film \u201cDrive\u201d resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album \u201c2014 Forest Hills Drive\u201d by J. Cole.For podcasts, both speakers were adequate \u2014 but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like \u201cFresh Air\u201d or \u201cRadio Lab,\u201d but it failed to play \u201cThe Sporkful,\u201d a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for.Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf.On the down side, Alexa and Home are fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment.The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino\u2019s, but otherwise can\u2019t do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby.Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants are.One task Alexa can pull off that Google can\u2019t is list showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Mr. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance.\u201cIf you verbally spit out what\u2019s on the screen, then it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said.Echo and Home are largely the same in the basic tasks they can perform. The capabilities that Home currently lacks, like movie showtimes or support for other smart home accessories, will probably show up in software updates or future partnerships.So what really distinguishes one from the other? Right now, Echo\u2019s major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you.But if you aren\u2019t big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google\u2019s speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player. Home, priced at about $130, is also cheaper than Amazon\u2019s $180 Echo.Let\u2019s just hope Google eventually gives people more ways to talk to its speaker other than \u201cO.K., Google.\u201d (The only other option is \u201cHey, Google.\u201d) It gets so tedious that you may eventually say, \u201cO.K., I\u2019m over this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weyerhaeuser Moves Out of the Woods and Into Urban Seattle", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetSEATTLE \u2014 The new headquarters of Weyerhaeuser seem an exception to other office buildings in this waterfront city. Instead of a tower on a busy street, this new corporate base is a horizontal structure with a front door that opens onto a public park.Tucked inside a group of 19th-century buildings, the steel-and-glass home of Weyerhaeuser, a wood products and timberlands company, is almost hidden by a row of trees.Weyerhaeuser, founded in 1900, moved from a forested 400-acre spread in suburban Federal Way, about 22 miles south of Seattle\u2019s central business district. Since October, the company\u2019s 700 employees have worked in the new building, which has a half-acre footprint and is in the historic Pioneer Square district, just south of Seattle\u2019s downtown area.The old building \u201cwas too big for us,\u201d said Jack Evans, a company spokesman. At the same time, he added, the company also recognized the recruitment value of an in-town headquarters. \u201cSeattle is the center of gravity,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Developed by Urban Visions, based in Seattle, the seven-story Weyerhaeuser building is a bit of an outlier in the explosive Seattle office market, which is centered on the downtown area to the north, and a second neighborhood, South Lake Union, a former light industrial area just north of downtown. Currently, at least 13 office buildings are rising in these central Seattle markets.\u201cSeattle is one of the busiest markets in the country right now,\u201d said Jake Bos, an office leasing agent who is a senior associate with Kidder Mathews, a local commercial real estate brokerage firm that is not connected to the Weyerhaeuser development.Central Seattle, in fact, is among the leading markets for new office space in the Western United States. In the first nine months of this year, 822,000 square feet of new office space were completed in central Seattle, and 4.93 million more square feet were under construction, according to Kidder Mathews research. In comparison, the financial district of San Francisco, one of the fastest-growing West Coast office markets, reported 1.07 million square feet of office space completed in the same period, and 3.77 million square feet under construction.\u201cAmazon was the catalyst of the office boom, which has been fueled by tech,\u201d Mr. Bos said.In South Lake Union, at least four new office buildings are expected to open before the end of the year; two of them are fully leased to Amazon. Separately, Vulcan Inc., a company owned by Paul G. Allen, a Microsoft founder, recently received permission to build a four-building complex for Google in the same district. Covering two city blocks, the master plan calls for housing, shopping and 607,000 square feet of office space.The interest in central Seattle is a sign of a changing culture. With natural beauty and plentiful waterways in the region, Seattle has a high hip factor and has long been a magnet for millennials. Corporations are returning to urban markets in part because of the ease of attracting younger workers and city dwellers.Mr. Evans of Weyerhaeuser said the new location was a positive for recruitment. The new neighborhood \u2014 unlike one isolated in the woods \u2014 offers amenities including a bakery, a combined bookstore-gallery and a craftsman bookbinder.Access to public transportation also played a large role in Weyerhaeuser\u2019s choice of the historic district, which is within walking distance of nearly every type of transit available in Seattle, including light rail, regional rail, streetcars and ferries. Ninety percent of the employees are transit users.Within an attractive neighborhood, the building itself is a recruitment tool, said the developer, Greg Smith, the founder and chief executive of Urban Visions. \u201cThe emphasis in this building is on wellness and health, including mental health,\u201d he said.A big attraction is the exterior deck on top of the seventh floor. This green roof has a Ping-Pong table, a fire pit, a barbecue grill and an elevated walking path circling the building. From the roof deck, employees have a postcard-worthy view of Elliott Bay, the orange cargo cranes of Seattle harbor directly ahead and the skyline of the central business district.Replacing a parking lot in Pioneer Square, a designated historic district, required the developer to clear many hurdles. The design went through several versions before it won the approval of city officials, who vetted materials, signage and even color choices. In one concession, the sides of the Weyerhaeuser building were made of hand-laid brick, to help the structure blend with its neighbors.\u201cThe design had to pay homage in the neighborhood without trying to appear to be a historic building,\u201d said Leslie Smith, the executive director of the Alliance for Pioneer Square, a nonprofit group. Ms. Smith, who is not related to Mr. Smith, the developer, said she was pleased with the result: \u201cThe building is beautifully understated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anger Rooms: A Smashing New Way to Relieve Stress", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byPrototypeWhen she was a teenager on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1990s, Donna Alexander fantasized about setting up a space where stressed-out people could relieve their tension in a safe, nonviolent way \u2014 by smashing mannequins, televisions, furniture and other objects. She was confident in her idea, but she wasn\u2019t sure how to turn it into a business.Finally, in the fall of 2008, and by then living in Dallas, Ms. Alexander began an experiment. She invited current and past co-workers to her garage to pulverize items she had collected from the curbs in her neighborhood. \u201cI would play music on my laptop and just let them have at it,\u201d she says. She charged $5. Soon, word of the stress-relief sessions spread throughout Dallas.\u201cI started getting strangers at my door asking if my house was the place to break stuff,\u201d Ms. Alexander said. \u201cWhen that happened, I knew I had a business.\u201dThe Anger Room charges $25 for five minutes of crushing printers, alarm clocks, glass cups, vases and the like. Prices rise to about $500 for custom room setups. The most expensive setup so far has been a faux retail store, replete with racks of clothing.Several other anger rooms have popped up around the world, including in Houston, Toronto, Niagara Falls and Australia.The American presidential election increased business at some anger rooms. Stressed-out voters traveled all the way to Toronto from New York before and after the election, says Steve Shew, co-founder of the Rage Room there. Customers wrote the name of the candidate they were frustrated with on a plate and smashed it.At the Anger Room in Dallas, mannequins of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were taking beatings before the election. Customers demolished two Clinton mannequins, requiring replacements. But Trump attracted even more ire. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through at least three of the male mannequins that we have to dress up as Donald Trump,\u201d Ms. Alexander says.Sessions in an anger room are meant to be therapeutic. But mental health professionals question the efficacy of rampaging in a faux cubicle or whacking airborne glasses.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s appealing to think that expressing anger can reduce stress, there is not much evidence of that,\u201d says George M. Slavich, a clinical psychologist and director of the Laboratory for Stress Assessment and Research at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cOn the contrary, the types of physiological and immune responses that occur during anger can actually be harmful for health.\u201dMr. Slavich recommends stress-reduction techniques that can be incorporated into daily life, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation and cognitive behavior therapy.\u201cYou have a desk with a computer and phone, chair and a mannequin dressed up in a suit, uniform or whatever relates to their real-life issue,\u201d Ms. Alexander says.Customers are provided with protective equipment that includes a helmet, goggles, boots and gloves. And they can pick out a music soundtrack \u2014 including classical, R&B, grunge and heavy metal \u2014 and an array of objects to swing.\u201cSome of our typical options are baseball bats, golf clubs, two-by-fours,\u201d Ms. Alexander says. \u201cWe get things like metal pipes, mannequin arms and legs, skillets, legs from tables. Sledgehammers, crowbars and things like that.\u201d Off-limits are sharp objects and those that use ammunition.The Anger Room accepts donations for its rooms from residents and businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Its four employees also go out on bulk trash pickup days looking for crushable items. The employees build the rooms, filling them with the breakables, and do the postwreckage cleanup.Customers have included executives at large corporations, including Hilton and Microsoft, Ms. Alexander says. In the first year, the Anger Room\u2019s revenue was $170,000. Since then, she has received about 2,500 inquiries from other aspiring anger-room entrepreneurs, and she is in the process of drafting a licensing agreement for franchisees.At the Rage Room in Toronto, 45 minutes of destruction costs $19.99 and includes video downloads of the sessions. Customers bring their own music.The Rage Room\u2019s \u201cdate night package\u201d is its most popular offering, Mr. Shew says. And a favorite activity for couples is for one person to throw a cup in the air for their date to smash.\u201cPeople really love that,\u201d Mr. Shew says. \u201cI guess because it has a bit of a teamwork element to it.\u201dStart-up costs for such a business are modest, Mr. Shew says. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is just setting up the room, reinforcing the walls, giving them a bat and crowbar, getting some smashing items and they just go in there,\u201d he says. Add to that providing protective gear, obtaining insurance and finding a suitable spot for the business.In the first several years, Ms. Alexander struggled to find a permanent space. The company\u2019s first location was near Texas Instruments, which became a source of breakables. But after the first year, the business outgrew the space. Over the next four years, it moved three times.Mr. Shew concurs that finding an appropriate space for an anger room is a challenge. Retail districts are not well suited to it, he says. \u201cWe find that most people have an easier time with more of the industrial warehouse areas.\u201dAnother early obstacle for both the Anger Room and the Rage Room was obtaining insurance. Since it\u2019s a new concept, Ms. Alexander says her insurer \u201cliterally had to create a category for my business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How LinkedIn Drove a Wedge Between Microsoft and Salesforce", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Once so close they flirted with a merger, the software giants became archrivals when they realized the value of the data amassed by social networks.Supported byThis is a story of love lost after a fight over social media.Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn \u2014 hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople. When Microsoft won, Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European antimonopoly laws.But not long ago, the two software giants were tight. They even talked about merging their businesses \u2014 not once, but twice. The second round of talks hasn\u2019t previously been reported.A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce, which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model, and Microsoft, which is racing to adjust, exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter. The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.There are big personalities behind the battle. At Microsoft, the job of adjusting course has fallen to Satya Nadella, a poetry-quoting chief executive who is trying to aggressively remake the company in hot areas like the cloud business applications where Salesforce is a leader.\u201cMicrosoft decided it could go ahead and recreate the best parts of Salesforce,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures who has spoken with Mr. Nadella and other business-development executives at Microsoft.Marc Benioff, a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, is considered a self-assured visionary. But he had doubts about staying independent around the time he understood that Microsoft was getting serious about competing with his company.At the time, software used by businesses was usually sold through huge licensing deals for software that would be installed directly on company PCs. Mr. Benioff\u2019s idea was to undercut that model: He would offer the same thing over the internet, without expensive installations, and customers would pay by the month.The idea proved prescient. Though it only recently began turning a profit, Salesforce is on track to have more than $8 billion in revenue this year, representing annual growth of about 25 percent. The total market value of the company is over $50 billion. Salesforce is the largest tech employer in San Francisco, and the company will move into the city\u2019s tallest building, Salesforce Tower, when it is completed.It took Microsoft years to see the potential in what Salesforce was doing. Microsoft had its own C.R.M. product, Dynamics, but it took a back seat inside an empire that, under the former chief executive Steven A. Ballmer, was consumed with battling more prominent competitors like Apple, Google and Sony.Mr. Nadella, a longtime Microsoft executive whose career odyssey at the company included overseeing its C.R.M. product, was less combative than his predecessor. He began reaching out to leaders of many rival companies after he became chief executive in early 2014, with a special goal of improving Microsoft\u2019s standing in Silicon Valley.John W. Thompson, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who had recently become chairman of Microsoft\u2019s board, arranged a dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., for Mr. Nadella to meet other tech executives, including Mr. Benioff, the Salesforce chief said in a 2015 interview. \u201cAt the end of dinner, I really gave Satya a number of areas I thought we could work closely on,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in the interview. \u201cHe took me up on all of them.\u201dMr. Nadella and Mr. Benioff declined to be interviewed for this article.At one point, Mr. Benioff offered to buy the Dynamics business that Salesforce competed with, but Mr. Nadella turned him down, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Several people briefed on the talks said that account was accurate, though two of them said another factor was that Mr. Benioff thought Microsoft was not respectful enough of his accomplishments in building Salesforce. It was unclear whether Mr. Benioff would be happy in a subordinate role at Microsoft after building Salesforce from the ground up, and it was equally hard to imagine a successful Salesforce without him.Quickly, there were signs that Microsoft planned to get its act together in the C.R.M. business. As part of a broader shake-up, Mr. Nadella moved Dynamics under Scott Guthrie, one of Microsoft\u2019s most respected engineering leaders. This telegraphed that it intended to go after Salesforce\u2019s business.\u201cThey\u2019re serious in a way they haven\u2019t been before,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, an angel investor in Seattle and a former Microsoft manager who occasionally consults with the company.Salesforce did not sit idle. In November, it hired a former head of Dynamics, Bob Stutz, to oversee its data analytics products.Still, Microsoft and Salesforce had reasons to keep the peace. Mr. Nadella wanted Salesforce to use Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure, called Azure, to run its internet applications. A marquee customer like Salesforce could lend credibility to Azure as Microsoft tried to catch Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure provider.In the months after, Mr. Benioff met privately with Mr. Nadella to talk business. Mr. Benioff discussed using Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens augmented reality headset in a Salesforce presentation; that never panned out. And he again brought up the idea of Microsoft\u2019s acquiring Salesforce, according to several people briefed on the talks.Microsoft seemed less receptive to the idea than before, partly because of Salesforce\u2019s price tag and also because Microsoft had decided to compete more aggressively with its own product, these people said. By last February, the discussions were dead, they said.The conversations became contentious enough to place a strain on the longtime friendship between Mr. Benioff and Mr. Thompson, according to two people with knowledge of the relationship. The two men did not speak for months (although things have since thawed). That\u2019s around the time Mr. Benioff seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by Microsoft \u2014 a well-capitalized competitor, many times the size of Salesforce \u2014 according to people who discussed the issue with him.The most alluring acquisition target for both companies, though, was LinkedIn.The business social networking site has become an indispensable tool for people to advertise their employment histories and professional achievements. LinkedIn\u2019s enormous database of profiles could be coupled more tightly with C.R.M. systems to help sales representatives close deals, both companies believed. LinkedIn\u2019s data could also be used to strengthen Microsoft products such as Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s most lucrative products. And LinkedIn comes with a steady revenue stream.For the next several months, Microsoft and Salesforce privately made competing offers for LinkedIn, each sweetening their bids as the competition increased. Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a board member, wooed Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and chairman, according to the LinkedIn filing. Salesforce code-named its LinkedIn effort Project Burgundy.In mid-June, Microsoft won LinkedIn with a bid of $196 a share, all of it in cash, which provided more certainty for LinkedIn shareholders than the combination of cash and stock that Salesforce was offering. Microsoft has more than $136 billion in cash and short-term investments. Salesforce has less than $1.2 billion.\u201cWe were closer than we realized \u2014 maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it!\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cBut we were definitely over our skis!!!!\u201dAs the prospect of a LinkedIn deal began to dim for Salesforce, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, Burke Norton, sent an email to the board saying the company, as result, could contemplate a number of other acquisition targets, one of which \u2014 Demandware \u2014 it ended up buying. Other possibilities, including Adobe, Box, Tableau and Workday, remain independent, according to a presentation attached to the email, which was published on DCLeaks.com.Mr. Benioff has bought at least 10 companies in all. His most expensive purchase, at $2.8 billion, was Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. One big acquisition, the document software company Quip, took direct aim at Microsoft Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s cash cows.There is, of course, no guarantee that LinkedIn will give Microsoft the edge it seeks in data analytics, machine learning and C.R.M. software. The company has a history of fumbling big acquisitions, including its disastrous acquisition of Nokia, which ended in a $7.6 billion write-off, after which Microsoft backed away from mobile phones.While Salesforce\u2019s acquisitions and war chest are relatively small, the company highlighted in a presentation to analysts this fall that it had acquired Quip in part to land its co-founder, Bret Taylor, a former Facebook and Google executive. Analysts view Mr. Taylor as someone who can weave Salesforce\u2019s pieces into a more competitive company.In the meantime, Mr. Benioff cut a deal in May to use primarily Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, not Microsoft\u2019s. The deal was worth $400 million over four years for Amazon.Microsoft wooed away a big Salesforce customer, HP, in September to use Dynamics.\u201cGiven Microsoft\u2019s history and existing monopolies, it is sometimes necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to intervene to ensure that Microsoft is operating in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\u201d said Mr. Norton, Salesforce\u2019s chief legal officer.It\u2019s not clear if the complaints will be a problem for the deal, which has already been approved in the United States.In response to Salesforce\u2019s complaints, Microsoft has said it will bring more price competition to the market. But neither company is totally estranged from its rival, and they say they must work together. In a statement, Peggy Johnson, an executive vice president at Microsoft, said that \u201cwhile we\u2019ll continue to compete, we look forward to continuing to partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drug Giant Faced a Reckoning as China Took Aim at Bribery", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byChina RulesSHANGHAI \u2014 Peter Humphrey was in the bathroom of his Shanghai apartment when the police kicked the door off its hinges and knocked him to the ground. Nearly two dozen officers stormed his home. They confiscated files, laptops and hard drives related to his work as a corporate investigator.Mr. Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, were taken to Building 803, a notoriously bleak criminal investigation center normally reserved for human smugglers, drug traffickers and political activists. Sleep-deprived and hungry, he was transferred later that day to a detention house, placed in a cage and strapped to an iron chair. Outside, three officers sat on a podium and demanded answers.Mr. Humphrey knew the reason for the harsh interrogation. He and Ms. Yu had been working for GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceutical maker under investigation in China for fraud and bribery.The Glaxo case, which resulted in record penalties of nearly $500 million and a string of guilty pleas by executives, upended the power dynamic in China, unveiling an increasingly assertive government determined to tighten its grip over multinationals. In the three years since the arrests, the Chinese government, under President Xi Jinping, has unleashed the full force of the country\u2019s authoritarian system, as part of a broader agenda of economic nationalism.Driven by the quest for profits, many multinationals pushed the limits in China, lulled into a sense of complacency by lax officials who eagerly welcomed overseas money. Glaxo took it to the extreme, allowing corruption to fester.When bribery accusations surfaced, the company followed the old playbook, missing the seismic changes reshaping the Chinese market. Rather than fess up, Glaxo tried to play down the issues and discredit its accusers \u2014 figuring officials wouldn\u2019t pay attention.Along the way, there were bribes of iPads, a mysterious sex tape and the corporate investigator, who gave his operations secret code names. The company\u2019s missteps are laid bare in emails, confidential corporate documents and other evidence obtained by The New York Times, as well as in interviews with dozens of executives, regulators and lawyers involved in the case.The crackdown has prompted a complete rethinking for Glaxo \u2014 and for much of the pharmaceutical industry. To appease the government, drug makers have promised to lower prices and overhaul sales practices.\u201cFor a long time, there\u2019d been this policy of going easy on foreign enterprises,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, a longtime legal adviser to Western companies. \u201cThe government didn\u2019t want to cause embarrassment or give outsiders the impression that China is plagued with corruption. But they\u2019re not thinking like that anymore.\u201dThe Glaxo case was fueled by missed clues, poor communication and a willful avoidance of the facts. For more than a year, the drug maker brushed aside repeated warnings from a whistle-blower about systemic fraud and corruption in its China operations.The company\u2019s internal controls were not robust enough to prevent the fraud, or even to find it. Internally, the whistle-blower allegations were dismissed as a \u201csmear campaign,\u201d according to a confidential company report obtained by The Times.Glaxo just wanted to make its problems go away. It offered bribes to regulators. It retaliated against the suspected whistle-blower. It hired Mr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu to dig into the woman\u2019s background, family and government ties, as a way to discredit her. And Glaxo may even have gone after the wrong person, documents and emails obtained by The Times suggest.None of it mattered. The allegations were true.Prosecutors charged the global drug giant with giving kickbacks to doctors and hospital workers who prescribed its medicines. In 2014 Glaxo paid a nearly $500 million fine, at the time the largest ever in China for a multinational. Five senior executives in China pleaded guilty, including the head of Glaxo\u2019s Chinese operations, a British national, in a rare prosecution of a Western executive. With Glaxo embroiled in scandal, sales plummeted in China, the company\u2019s fastest-growing market.Glaxo has declined multiple requests for comment, referring instead to earlier statements. Glaxo \u201cfully accepts the facts and evidence of the investigation, and the verdict of the Chinese judicial authorities,\u201d one statement read. \u201cGSK P.L.C. sincerely apologizes to the Chinese patients, doctors and hospitals, and to the Chinese government and the Chinese people.\u201dMr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu, both in their late 50s at the time of their arrests, were punished too. The couple spent two years in prison for illegally obtaining government records on individuals.Mr. Humphrey was crowded into a cell with a dozen other inmates. There were no beds or other furniture, just an open toilet and a neon light overhead. During his incarceration, Mr. Humphrey said, he suffered back pain, a hernia and a prostate problem that was later diagnosed as cancer.\u201cI was in a state of complete shock and breakdown,\u201d said Mr. Humphrey, who was released along with his wife in July 2015. \u201cI was physically broken down and mentally blown away. I didn\u2019t sleep for 45 days.\u201dAn anonymous 5,200-word email in January 2013 to the Glaxo board laid out a detailed map to a fraud in the Chinese operations.Written in perfect English, the email was organized like a corporate memo. Under the header \u201cConference Trip Vacations for Doctors,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote that medical professionals received all-expenses-paid trips under the guise of attending international conferences. The company covered the costs of airline tickets and hotel rooms, and handed out cash for meals and sightseeing excursions.In a section labeled \u201cGSK Falsified Its Books and Records to Conceal Its Illegal Marketing Practices in China,\u201d the email explained how Glaxo was pitching drugs for unapproved uses. As an example, the whistle-blower said the drug Lamictal had been aggressively promoted as a treatment for bipolar disorder, even though it had been approved in China only for epilepsy.Glaxo \u201calmost killed one patient by illegally marketing its drug Lamictal,\u201d said the email, which was obtained by The Times. \u201cGSK China bought the patient\u2019s silence for $9,000.\u201dThe email was one of nearly two dozen that the whistle-blower sent over the course of 17 months to Chinese regulators, Glaxo executives and the company\u2019s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers.When the authorities pressed Glaxo, the company was dismissive. It failed to properly investigate the allegations. It didn\u2019t beef up its internal controls. And it didn\u2019t change its marketing practices.The decision was calculated. In the decades since China began opening its economy, most multinationals had avoided scrutiny over bribery. China needed overseas companies to help develop its economy, by setting up manufacturing operations and creating jobs. The authorities were reluctant to jeopardize investment, so they took a softer approach to enforcement.When companies did run into trouble, fines were tiny. The rare cases tended to be colored by politics. Seven years ago, the Chinese authorities detained executives from the global mining giant Rio Tinto on suspicion of stealing state secrets. The charges were eventually downgraded to bribery and theft of commercial secrets, and the company avoided punishment.By the time Glaxo\u2019s fraud bubbled to the surface, China had changed.Over the last decade, China has emerged as an economic powerhouse, but it took off even more as the rest of the world slowed after the financial crisis. That gave China the upper hand with overseas companies, which were increasingly dependent on profits from the country\u2019s growing consumer base.The economic might coincided with the Communist Party\u2019s increasingly nationalistic stance. The authorities in China, already undertaking a severe crackdown on Chinese companies, wanted to show that, like American regulators, they could also penalize and sanction global companies.And it was no secret that big drug makers were violating the law in China.Years earlier, the consulting firm Deloitte warned about rampant corruption in China\u2019s pharmaceutical market. As Deloitte found, doctors and health care workers were poorly compensated, so they could easily be induced to write more prescriptions with offers of cash, gifts, vacations and other benefits. Big drug makers, eager for growth, willingly obliged.\u201cThe remarkable thing is that China is a more hospitable environment to this type of corruption, because it\u2019s a market where doctors and hospitals are heavily reliant on drug sales,\u201d said Dali Yang, who teaches at the University of Chicago and has studied the industry. \u201cThey were like fish swimming in water.\u201dAmerican investigators had punished several major drug companies for such behavior abroad. In 2012, Eli Lilly agreed to pay $29 million, and Pfizer $45 million, to settle allegations that included employees\u2019 bribing doctors in China. In settling the cases, neither company admitted or denied the allegations.That summer, Glaxo agreed to pay $3 billion in fines and pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States for marketing antidepressants for unapproved uses, failing to report safety data on a diabetes drug and paying kickbacks. The case was built off tips from several whistle-blowers.After that, Glaxo\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Witty, pledged, \u201cWe\u2019re determined this is never going to happen again.\u201dBut it did \u2014 in China.In early 2013, Glaxo realized it couldn\u2019t ignore the problems. The authorities were asking questions. The whistle-blower continued to send emails.So the company tried another common gambit in China: bribing officials.The company set up a special \u201ccrisis management\u201d team in China and began offering money and gifts to regulators.That strategy had worked in the past. A company, often using a middleman, would try to soothe officials and regulators, offering gifts and favors.One government agency had received multiple emails from the whistle-blower, and Glaxo targeted multiple branches of the agency, according to state media reports. One executive tried to cozy up to a Shanghai investigator with an iPad and a dinner totaling $1,200, another Glaxo employee said in a statement to the police. When that executive asked for money to bribe the Beijing branch, Mark Reilly, the head of the company\u2019s Chinese operations, gave the \u201cgo ahead.\u201dAnother executive with Glaxo\u2019s Chinese operations bribed regulators to focus on \u201cunequal competition,\u201d rather than a more punitive investigation into \u201ccommercial bribery.\u201d The goal, that executive admitted in a statement, was to limit any potential fine to about $50,000. It didn\u2019t work.As pressure mounted, the case took a bizarre turn, setting Glaxo on a collision course with the government.In March 2013, Glaxo\u2019s chief executive and five other senior executives in the company\u2019s London headquarters received an anonymous email with a media file. In it, a grainy video showed Mr. Reilly, the executive in China, engaged in a sexual act with a young Chinese woman.The attached email alleged that Mr. Reilly, a British national who had helped manage the company\u2019s China operation for four years, was complicit in a bribery scheme tied to a travel agency called China Comfort Travel, or C.C.T. According to the email, Glaxo funneled money through the travel agency to pay off doctors. The travel agency also supplied Mr. Reilly with women, as a way to secure that business.\u201cIn order to acquire more business, C.C.T. bribed Mark Reilly, the general manager of GSK (China) with sex,\u201d the email said. \u201cMark Reilly accepted this bribery and made C.C.T. get the maximized benefits in return.\u201dGlaxo later discovered that the video had been shot clandestinely, in the bedroom of Mr. Reilly\u2019s apartment in Shanghai. Analysts working for the company said it had been edited to disguise the location.Glaxo executives in London were shocked. They deemed the video a serious breach of privacy, involving a possible break-in at the home of a senior executive in China. Mr. Reilly moved to a more secure residence.Like many global companies, Glaxo has a code of conduct that encourages employees to report fraud or wrongdoing without fear of retaliation by the company. In many countries, including China, the rights of whistle-blowers are protected by law.Glaxo didn\u2019t seem to care.By the time the video surfaced, Glaxo already had its suspicions about the identity of the whistle-blower. Months earlier, the company had fired Vivian Shi, a 47-year-old executive handling government affairs in Glaxo\u2019s Shanghai office. The official reason for Ms. Shi\u2019s firing was falsifying travel expenses. In fact, she was dismissed because the company believed she was the whistle-blower, according to confidential corporate documents obtained by The Times.Ms. Shi did not return multiple calls for comment.After receiving the video, Glaxo took more aggressive action, seeking to discredit Ms. Shi, who had already left the company.At that point, in the spring of 2013, the company turned to Mr. Humphrey, the investigator. He ran ChinaWhys, a small risk consultancy firm that advised global companies like Dell and Dow Chemical.His firm was engaged in what he called \u201cdiscreet investigations,\u201d helping multinationals cope with difficult situations like counterfeiting and embezzlement. Short in stature, with a shock of white hair, Mr. Humphrey portrayed himself as a kind of modern-day Sherlock Holmes.\u201cHe likes a good adventure and likes solving cases,\u201d said his friend Stuart Lindley, who runs a financial services company in China. \u201cBut he was definitely aware that some of that stuff was risky.\u201dIn April 2013, Mr. Reilly met with Mr. Humphrey at Glaxo\u2019s glass office tower near People\u2019s Square in central Shanghai. According to meeting notes obtained by The Times, they discussed the emails, the sex video and Ms. Shi, the suspected whistle-blower. Mr. Reilly told the investigator that she held a grudge against Glaxo.At the meeting, Mr. Reilly asked the investigator to look into the break-in at his apartment. But he made clear that he also wanted to assess what power and influence Ms. Shi might have with the government.Legal experts say Mr. Reilly should not have been put in charge.\u201cThe executive so accused has an obvious conflict of interest in overseeing such an investigation,\u201d said John Coates, a Harvard Law School professor. \u201cEven if the executive were entirely innocent of the whistle-blower\u2019s charge, giving that same executive the role of investigating the whistle-blower smacks of retaliation.\u201dEfforts to reach Mr. Reilly, who has since left the company, were unsuccessful.Using the code name Project Scorpion, Mr. Humphrey and his staff spent the next six weeks working undercover, gathering evidence. They visited Lanson Place, the upscale apartment complex where Mr. Reilly lived when the sex tape was made. They created a dossier on the suspected whistle-blower, searching for motives and ties to high-ranking officials or regulators. They interviewed former co-workers, scrutinized her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and scoured the web for information about her father, a former health official.Glaxo may have crossed a line in this regard, putting the company more sharply in the government\u2019s sights.As part of the investigation, Mr. Humphrey turned to a Chinese detective to acquire a copy of Ms. Shi\u2019s household registration record, or hukou. The official document contained information about her husband and daughter. The authorities had warned private detectives about acquiring confidential government documents.\u201cThis type of household information is supposed to be private,\u201d said John Huang, a former government official who is now managing partner at McDermott, Will & Emery in Shanghai. \u201cBut people were buying and selling it.\u201dGlaxo got little payoff from the investigation.On June 6, 2013, Mr. Humphrey delivered a 39-page report to Glaxo that said Ms. Shi was probably the whistle-blower and even had a \u201ctrack record of staging similar attacks\u201d at a previous job. But the report included no evidence linking her to the emails or the sex video, according to a draft obtained by The Times.Glaxo\u2019s strategy of bribery and discrediting ultimately failed.With the Chinese government in the midst of a crackdown on corruption, the police carried out a series of raids on June 27, 2013. They seized files and laptops from multiple Glaxo offices and interrogated dozens of employees. In Shanghai, four senior executives were detained. Investigators also raided the offices of several travel agencies that had worked closely with Glaxo, including China Comfort Travel.A week later, the police stormed Mr. Humphrey\u2019s apartment in Shanghai. He and his wife were charged with violating privacy laws.Mr. Humphrey declined to comment on the specifics of the Glaxo case. His son defended his work, saying Glaxo engaged him \u201cunder false pretenses.\u201d \u201cMy father is an honorable and law-abiding man,\u201d said the son, Harvard Humphrey.When prosecutors announced the case against Glaxo in July 2013, several weeks after arrests began, their allegations closely mirrored those of the whistle-blower. They described an elaborate scheme to bribe doctors and workers at government-owned hospitals using cash that had been funneled through a network of 700 travel agencies and consulting firms.\u201cIt\u2019s like a criminal organization: There\u2019s always a boss, and in this case GSK is the boss,\u201d said Gao Feng, one of the lead investigators.Glaxo said little about the developments until July 15, when several high-ranking executives confessed from prison on state-run television. After that, the company capitulated, issuing a blanket statement for its misdeeds: \u201cThese allegations are shameful and we regret this has occurred.\u201dDressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Mr. Reilly, the Glaxo executive, was led in handcuffs into a small courtroom in the city of Changsha, in central China, in September 2014. With security guards behind him, he stood alongside four other senior Glaxo executives as a judge read the charges.\u201cThe defendant company GSKCI is guilty of bribing nongovernment personnel and will be fined 3 billion yuan,\u201d the judge, Wu Jixiang, said sternly, referring to Glaxo\u2019s Chinese name. The company and the executives, having confessed, were given relatively light sentences, the court said.Mark Reilly was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to be expelled from China.After handing down that sentence, the judge turned to Mr. Reilly.\u201cDo you obey the court\u2019s verdict? Do you appeal?\u201d he asked.Mr. Reilly said that he would not challenge the verdict. Because he was swiftly deported, he will not serve prison time in China.Glaxo is still trying to clean up the mess.In China, Glaxo has promised to overhaul its operations and has put in place stricter compliance procedures. The company has changed the way its sales force is compensated and has eliminated the use of outside travel agencies.Glaxo has also tightened oversight of expenses and cash advances, areas central to the case. Employees must now send in photographs of the guests and food, to verify that the meetings took place.And in August 2015, Glaxo tried to make amends by rehiring Ms. Shi, an acknowledgment that the company had erred in firing an employee suspected of being a whistle-blower.But the decision also hinted at a more troubling admission \u2014 that Glaxo had targeted the wrong person. There are indications that Ms. Shi was not the whistle-blower, and that there may have been more than one person.The emails sent to regulators were written in fluent English and came mostly from a Gmail account. The email with the sex video came from a local Chinese account and was written in poor English. The only similarity was the anonymity.The Times sent emails to both accounts and got a response from just one, the person who had written the detailed emails to the Chinese authorities and Glaxo. \u201cYou have reached who you are looking for,\u201d the person replied.In a series of exchanges, the author denied being Ms. Shi, acting in concert with her or sending the video. The person said Glaxo had erroneously blamed Ms. Shi for the emails and never found the actual whistle-blower.The Times was unable to verify the identity of the person, who described working in Shanghai but declined to come forward for fear of retribution.\u201cI didn\u2019t reveal to GSK personnel that I was the whistle-blower because doing so would have placed me in potential physical jeopardy,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote in an email to The Times. \u201cYou understand that criminals \u2014 you know that they were convicted later in Chinese courts \u2014 were in charge of GSK China at that time, and I truly believe that they would have harmed me in some fashion had they discovered my identity. \u201dAn article on Wednesday about a crackdown on corruption in China that ensnared the drug maker GlaxoSmithKline referred incompletely to charges faced by the mining company Rio Tinto seven years ago, when China took a softer approach to enforcement. They were downgraded to bribery and theft of commercial secrets, not bribery alone.Advertisement"}

That prompted T.

Such brinkmanship will serve the acquirer well. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are ahead of Oracle in developing cloud-based services and infrastructure for clients. Mr. Ellison\u2019s skepticism over embracing this shift also put at risk Oracle\u2019s share of the database and application markets.

{"Headline": "Russia Prepares to Block LinkedIn After Court Ruling", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byLinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft, is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that it had breached the country\u2019s data protection rules, a sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating in the country.The case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government\u2019s hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election.Russia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes. The case began in August, before Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal.The country\u2019s push to gain greater control over its internet users is one of a number of attempts by governments worldwide to dictate how people use digital services.From China\u2019s blocking of whole swaths of the internet to Europe\u2019s efforts to regulate what can and cannot be viewed online, different regions and countries are in a battle with companies and other governments to decide how the internet will expand.Officials said the rules were aimed at protecting people\u2019s online privacy from hackers, but critics have claimed the legislation could allow Russian authorities to force companies \u2014 both local and international \u2014 to hand over sensitive information about their users.Many of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech companies, like Facebook and Twitter, also do not store data locally within Russia, but Roskomnadzor, the country\u2019s telecommunications watchdog, targeted LinkedIn for its failure to comply with the new data rules.It was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted in particular, rather than any other major social networking site. Analysts have suggested that the Russian authorities focused on the company, an also-ran in the country\u2019s social networking market, as a warning to larger tech companies.The Moscow court decision, upholding a previous ruling against LinkedIn, means the company will now be blocked from operating across the country.The ban could take effect as early as Monday, with internet service providers in Russia blocking access to LinkedIn\u2019s web address. The company, which has fewer than five million Russian users among its 467 million global users, could still appeal the court\u2019s decision.\u201cThe Russian court\u2019s decision has the potential to deny access to LinkedIn for the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,\u201d Anoek Eckhardt, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request.\u201dA number of other American tech companies like Facebook and Twitter have made efforts to expand their footprints within the country, though they have had to balance people\u2019s use of these social networks with the government\u2019s often heavy-handed efforts to gain control of digital information.Despite criticism of Russia\u2019s data protection rules, other countries, including Germany, have passed similar legislation that forces tech companies to store people\u2019s digital information on local servers.The efforts have been aimed at safeguarding individuals\u2019 personal data, though companies have been quick to voice their skepticism over such practices.In Russia, companies like Google have also faced other challenges from local incumbents like Yandex, the country\u2019s largest search engine, which have often outmuscled international rivals in their home market.Andrew E.

She was 59.The cause was thyroid cancer, her husband, Hart Hooton, said.Ms. Irvine broke ground in a male-dominated field in her corporate roles and as a founding board member and chairwoman of the nonprofit New York New Media Association. The group, which had 8,000 members at its peak, was acquired by the Software and Information Industry Association in 2003.Ms. Irvine began her quarter-century career in the digital industry in the mid-1980s at Activision, a video game and educational software company. From 1989 to 1993, she ran customer relations and strategic planning for the Prodigy Services Company before joining the Hearst Corporation in 1994 as vice president and general manager of new media.At Hearst, she guided its first digital ventures, including an interactive newspaper and the marketing of CD-ROMs.Within two years she was the general manager of Sidewalk, an early online guide to local businesses started by Microsoft. Sidewalk, described as a digital version of urban newsweeklies, emerged as one of the most heavily trafficked sites on the internet. Ms. Irvine stepped down when the guide was sold to Citysearch in 1999.She went on to oversee a series of acquisitions that led to Digitas Health\u2019s sale to Publicis Groupe, a multinational advertising and public relations company based in France.Ms. Irvine became chief executive and president of the About Group of The New York Times Company in 2008. (The Times had purchased About Inc. and its website About.com in 2005 for $410 million.)She left in 2011. The About Group was sold the next year to Barry Diller\u2019s IAC for about $300 million in cash.In 2011, when Ms. Irvine became chief executive of Vibrant Media, a digital advertising company, David Kenny, the former chief executive of Digitas, told paidContent.org that she had been instrumental in planning the agency\u2019s acquisition strategy and in integrating newly acquired companies.She remained with Vibrant until 2013 and had been consulting since then.Cella Maria Irvine was born on Sept. 23, 1957, in Manhattan to the former Josephine Cella, the director of educational services for the Ballet Hispanico in Manhattan, and Bonnell Irvine, an architect and designer.She graduated from Friends Seminary in Manhattan and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in history from Cornell University and a master\u2019s in general management from Harvard.In addition to her husband, a digital marketing consultant, she is survived by their two children, Giovanna and Hudson, and her mother.An obituary on Sunday about the digital media executive Cella Irvine misstated the name of a company acquired by the advertising agency Digitas when she was its chief administrative officer.
