{"Headline": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Episodes 1 and 2: Stiff Lips, Warm Heart", "Date": "2016-11-04", "News": "Supported byAs we saw from the success of \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d the reassuring rigidities of the British class system can do wonders for angsty Americans. If you\u2019re grossed out by the utter charmlessness and moral squalor of a year\u2019s worth of debased political self-indulgence, a perfect antidote is \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix\u2019s compulsively watchable dramatization of the life of Queen Elizabeth II, served up on a silver platter by dramatist Peter Morgan (\u201cThe Queen\u201d) and the director and producer Stephen Daldry (\u201cThe Audience\u201d).Instead of sitting with an ice pack on your head and listening to John King yakking on CNN about red and blue paths to victory, revel in John Lithgow\u2019s droll old war horse, Winston Churchill, as he makes his imperial progress up the aisle at Westminster Abbey. Notice how augustly the patriotic hero takes his seat in a pew next to his sanely amused, age-appropriate wife, Clemmie, at the wedding of the young Princess Elizabeth to Lt. Philip Mountbatten of the Royal Navy, formerly the Prince of Greece and Denmark and newly the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich.Instead of ranting about the leaking and the belching and defaming of email leaks and social media, experience the private courage \u2014 the crushing, unexpressed pain \u2014 of the 56-year-old King George VI, played with quiet depth and range by Jared Harris (best known as the tormented Lane Pryce in \u201cMad Men\u201d). Shudder as he begins to realize that his blood-flecked cough is a death sentence hidden from him by his own doctors and struggles with what that will mean for the British constitution and his own beloved family.And what about the children? \u201cThey\u2019re too young to notice,\u201d she says firmly, a line that signifies her first acceptance of a lifetime\u2019s distancing between her own desires and the needs of her country, along with the collateral damage that will inevitably follow. (I think of the famously poignant moment when the 5-year-old Prince Charles greeted his mother after a six-month absence on a royal tour in 1953, not with a hug but a grave, extended handshake.) As Philip, Matt Smith (an erstwhile Doctor of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d) has great chemistry with Ms. Foy\u2019s Elizabeth. He has just the right combination of rippling impatience and dangerous, masculine self-confidence for a consort whose loyalty is laced with a sometimes heedless power to cause her pain.The real triumph of the first two episodes of \u201cThe Crown\u201d is the unerring emotional focus of Mr. Daldry, the director. He finds the heart in every scene and takes us into the interior world of people so famous and so familiar they have drained into stereotypes and gesture. He makes us care so much I winced every time the king dragged deeply on one of the lethal cigarettes to which he was addicted. In short, he discovers the royal family\u2019s humanity.Anyone who has seen Mr. Daldry\u2019s theatrical tour de force \u201cBilly Elliot\u201d or his flying fleet of Mary Poppinses at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics might expect the visual audacity he brings to his stage productions. And \u201cThe Crown\u201d has plenty of that, from the jarring opening image of a toilet bowl flushing blood from the king\u2019s diseased lungs to the soaring, saturated scenes in Westminster Abbey as the packed congregation sings \u201cI Vow to Thee My Country\u201d over a thundering organ. (Netflix\u2019s hundred-million-dollar budget is, as they say, all up on the screen.) But Sam Spiegel once told me that the biggest challenge in making \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d was \u201cto not let the sand overwhelm the movie.\u201d Mr. Daldry could have let pageantry overwhelm \u201cThe Crown,\u201d or allowed it to slide into costume drama. He avoids the sentimental clich\u00e9s.When the young queen, far away with Philip in Kenya on the royal tour at the idyllic wildlife retreat Treetops, is brought the news that the king has died, Mr. Daldry does not give us her reaction. We see her as her aides would \u2014 at a distance, held in Philip\u2019s embrace on the lawn. Nor do we see the grief of the dead king\u2019s wife, suddenly the queen mother. Instead Mr. Daldry shows a household suddenly in motion as the news sweeps through Sandringham \u2014 first the shock, then the running, running through the corridors, the queen mother still in her nightdress, everyone running toward the death chamber except the queen\u2019s younger sister, Princess Margaret, who stands in a stricken eddy of silence, her grief double-edged: not only for the loss of her father, the king, but for fear she will also have to say goodbye to his closest aide, the married group captain Peter Townsend, with whom she has fallen hopelessly in love.It\u2019s fair to say that, so far at least, \u201cThe Crown\u201d is not a work of political or social history. It\u2019s family history, and it\u2019s a love story \u2014 more precisely, a series of overlapping love stories: between a father and a daughter, between a princess headed for greatness and her dashing prince, between another princess headed for heartbreak and her forbidden swain, and between a royal household and an adoring public. It shows us that public as the royals see it \u2014 again distantly, from palace balconies or through the windows of limousines and planes and luxuriously outfitted steam trains rushing through the peaceful beauty of the British countryside. Beyond the manicured gardens and immaculate driveways that surround the royals, and as invisible to us as it was to them, is a postwar Britain of drab, bomb-pockmarked streets and pale, exhausted Londoners clutching their ration books.If all goes as intended, these two enthralling episodes will be the opening chapters of an epic that promises to occupy viewers into the 2020s. \u201cThe Crown\u201d has already been approved for two seasons of 10 episodes each. The plan is for each season to cover a decade in the life of the queen and her realm, with casts that change as the central characters age. My hope is that the show\u2019s canvas will open up and out into the world as Elizabeth\u2019s emerging self-discipline, composure and moral clarity are tested by family and country into the 1960s and beyond, right through what is now the seventh decade of an extraordinary and still vibrant reign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Miuccia Prada Met David O. Russell", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byUnbuttonedOn Tuesday, in downtown Los Angeles, a new David O. Russell film, \u201cPast Forward,\u201d a silent, surreal story of multiple women (Freida Pinto, Allison Williams, Kuoth Wiel) in parallel realities, had its premiere. The stars were all there. So were co-stars like John Krasinski and Sacha Baron Cohen. There was a long step and repeat as well as Champagne.It happened the day before the glittering unveiling of \u201cBrave,\u201d a new musical short film by Spike Lee, in New York, where the director was joined by Ansel Elgort and Linda Evangelista, among others.Yes, that Burberry. The man behind the brand that also happens to have underwritten the film \u2014 actually, it\u2019s more like a trailer for a film that never was \u2014 just as Prada commissioned the David O. Russell film and Moncler the Spike Lee film. All of which will be viewable for everyone on the respective brands\u2019 websites. Though they are not shoppable.Which raises the question: What exactly are they selling? And how exactly are we, the viewing/consuming public, supposed to interpret what we see? The hybrid nature of the result demands a hybrid analysis, so Wesley Morris, a New York Times cultural critic, and I suited up for the debate.But what that trend is, I am not exactly sure. And by the way, it\u2019s probably wrong to even call them fashion films. But I am not sure what else to call them, especially since the longest one, the Prada/Russell collaboration, is only about 15 minutes. Maybe you have a better term.But these are 14 dutiful minutes. Mr. Russell is trying on his own collection of classic Hitchcock and vintage Antonioni, namely 1962\u2019s \u201cEclipse.\u201d The three women (Ms. Williams, Ms. Pinto and Ms. Wiel) have all been styled to look like Monica Vitti. It\u2019s ambitious, but it\u2019s sloppily assembled in a way that reminds you once again that style isn\u2019t what you look to this director for. More important, this didn\u2019t make me want to buy anything.Same, to an even greater extent, with Prada, since that film is not linked to any specific Prada collection. The Moncler film commemorates a big New York store opening.But because you didn\u2019t know this back story, just like any viewer who comes to these films cold on a brand website, you still saw them as commercials, which is, I think, pretty significant. Brands want viewers to consider them a gift of art. Hence the level of talent involved. But people still think they are getting ads. And that is a recipe for confusion.But I don\u2019t need to tell you that these companies know their clientele, and if you\u2019re Burberry shopper and you see Sienna Miller working that coat the way she does in one shot, and it makes you want to fly into one of its stores, I suppose Mr. Kapadia has more than done his job.Mr. Russell and Mr. Kapadia probably had a good time working in a new style. I\u2019d just be curious to know where the thinking behind these collaborations leads. To more of these sorts of low-stakes brand amplifications? Or to actual feats of feature filmmaking by the likes of Mr. Russell and Mr. Lee?Although I will note that by Wednesday evening, the Burberry film had been viewed almost 5.9 million times on YouTube since it was posted early this month. So maybe it will lead to fashion underwriting actual feature films. Which would be an interesting, possibly logical and probably beneficial turn of events.Advertisement"}

The people are eccentric and hale and smiley \u2014 maybe too smiley. It feels cut off from the world \u2014 you can barely even get a cellular signal \u2014 as if, in the words of Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), \u201cThe entire town was constructed in a giant snow globe.\u201dThere\u2019s always the danger, with cultural nostalgia, that sweetness can tip over into something uncanny and eerie. There\u2019s a fine line between celebrating the past and exhuming it.\u201cA Year in the Life\u201d was conceived as a kind of do-over. The creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, left the original series after six seasons (along with her husband and writing partner, Daniel Palladino) in a contract dispute. \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d sputtered on for one tongue-tied final season, but Ms. Sherman-Palladino wasn\u2019t there to execute the ending that she had planned down to the series\u2019 last four words.Though the mini-series does end on those four words, \u201cA Year in the Life\u201d is not, and can\u2019t be, the final season we never got.\u201cA Year in the Life\u201d begins in early 2016, four months after Richard\u2019s death, which has resurfaced bitter feelings between Lorelai and Emily. Rory, now a peripatetic journalist, comes home to figure herself out, see old friends and walk and talk with her mother through the town\u2019s tourism-brochure-perfect snowscape.On the surface, little has changed. Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), Lorelai\u2019s old squeeze, is still haranguing the customers at his diner, though now over Wi-Fi abuse rather than cellphone use. The pop-culture references still fly, updated to include \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cOutlander\u201d and man buns.But Rory is 32 now, the same age as Lorelai when the series began in 2000. (On one level, the entire mini-series is a \u201cWanna Feel Old?\u201d listicle.) This is a time-conscious story, down to the structure \u2014 four feature-length episodes, one for each season. Rory is feeling her age; Lorelai is feeling her mortality; Emily is feeling both heartbreak and the opportunity to change.The mini-series is sentimental but not maudlin, and Ms. Graham and Ms. Bledel quickly fall back into their Tracy-Hepburn comedic rhythm. \u201cWow. I\u2019m winded,\u201d Rory says after their first verbal tap dance. \u201cHaven\u2019t done that for a while,\u201d Lorelai answers.There\u2019s more of that self-consciousness, and a parade of \u201cWell hello, you!\u201d cameos. You will likely be indulged no matter whom you consider the best supporting character. (The correct answer, by the way, is Paris Geller, Rory\u2019s former classmate played by Liza Weil, who gets an update that shows off her brittle imperiousness.)But there\u2019s some bloat, including a \u201cWaiting for Guffman\u201d-like community musical interlude, featuring Christian Borle and Sutton Foster, that runs 10 minutes and would have been better at 10 seconds. And elements of Rory\u2019s plot feel like they were intended more for a character in her early 20s \u2014 as Ms. Sherman-Palladino originally planned \u2014 than one in her early 30s.Mostly, though, \u201cA Year in the Life\u201d succeeds at recreating the voice of \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d which is what creates the world of \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201dLike Lake Wobegon or Mayberry, Stars Hollow is a wish in the shape of a town, an idyll where everything is low stakes. Townspeople argue, but mostly over things like an international food fair or a proposed sewer system. They have decent, not overly demanding jobs, blue collar and white. Young adults who fail to launch can come home to their parents\u2019 cozy houses (a running joke in one episode). Stars Hollow is not just a safety net, it\u2019s a giant, fluffy featherbed.This is an eternal fantasy, but it\u2019s well timed for the Thanksgiving weekend after an election that has made fractious Emilys and Lorelais of many relatives. (There are few political references beyond a quick allusion to \u201cBrexit,\u201d but it\u2019s noteworthy that the story wraps in the fall, just as real America is about to head off to the polls.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jennifer Weiner Writes a Middle-Grade Novel", "Date": "2016-11-11", "News": "Supported byChildren\u2019s BooksWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In Jennifer Weiner\u2019s whimsical first novel for children, an accident-prone human girl who feels like a Sasquatch, and a delicate Sasquatch who feels more at home with humans, each get a chance to walk in the other\u2019s shoes (or big feet, as it were).Weiner, whose controversial tweets and widely shared Times Op-Ed pieces consistently take issue with the mainstream media\u2019s portrayals of women, paints the Bigfoot as a symbol of the outsider. Bigfoots are lonely monsters whose great height and shaggy countenance doom them to haunt the edges of our campfires instead of being invited inside the friendly circle of light. It\u2019s not hard to understand why the mysterious legend continues to capture the imaginations of so many young people, as they sprout unexpected hair in odd places, struggle to coordinate a tangle of lengthening limbs and navigate a social wilderness that is in constant flux.Twelve-year-old Alice, an only child of wealthy, distant parents who has \u201cfailed to make even a single friend\u201d during her tenure at seven different private institutions, is ready to give up. Alice\u2019s tall, wide body and hapless clumsiness made her a target at all her other schools, and she is sure that the Experimental Center for Love and Learning in upstate New York will be no different, despite its promise to \u201ccreate an atmosphere of inclusivity and respect, where hierarchies are nonexistent.\u201d However, she is cautiously optimistic when her quirky bunkmates are friendly and she is allowed to take cooking lessons with the school\u2019s taciturn but kind chef. Sadly, her growing self-esteem is dashed when coquettish, conniving Jessica arrives and chooses Alice as the victim of a hateful prank.In parallel chapters, the Bigfoot of the title, Millie Maximus, is dealing with her own set of problems. As the smallest in stature and lightest in color Yare (the proper term for Bigfoots), Millie is already on the outs with her tall, dark and hairy tribe. Her parents are community leaders, and as their only daughter, she is expected to adhere to their strict code of secrecy and silence. But Millie, who watches episodes of \u201cFriends\u201d on old Aunt Yetta\u2019s closely guarded \u201ctop-lap\u201d and longs to become a famous pop star, wants nothing more than to shed her fur and join the human race \u2014 preferably in the spotlight. Sadly, Millie is fated to spend her life in the shadows unless she can convince her overprotective parents that the No-Furs (the Yare term for humans) in the school across the water mean no harm.When Millie and Alice finally meet by accident on the shore of the lake that divides their two worlds, they form a bond that is the first real friendship either of them has ever experienced. Unfortunately, their time to enjoy it is short, since Jeremy and Jo, two local middle-school students and amateur Bigfoot hunters, are just as determined to find proof that the Bigfoots exist as the Bigfoots are to stay hidden. There\u2019s a cliffhanging ending and a \u201c1\u201d on the spine; Alice and Millie\u2019s adventures appear to be just beginning.Weiner does a superb job of inventing the Bigfoots\u2019 charming culture, which is largely based on distorted human manners and customs. They fear Bad Red-Suit No-Fur and Bad Fairytooth No-Fur, who are rumored to steal the toys and teeth of innocent sleeping Yare. They support their Snickers \u201csnackle\u201d habits by selling handmade goods via Etsy \u201con-the-line,\u201d and power their village using an outlet from an abandoned campsite. Then there\u2019s Millie\u2019s fictional obsession with Ross and Rachel, which coincides with a real-life \u201cFriends\u201d renaissance: The beloved \u201990s sitcom has been embraced by tweens since being rereleased on Netflix. Through recognition and laughter over these universal behaviors, kids will quickly grasp the larger point that the person they may have labeled \u201cmonster\u201d in their own lives isn\u2019t all that different from themselves.Anyone who\u2019s ever taught an adolescent or raised one knows that body image woes start young and loom large. While readers will root for Millie to fulfill her singing ambitions and escape her well-meaning helicopter parents, it is quietly angry Alice and her love/hate relationship with her body that give Weiner\u2019s familiar themes of self-love and respect an astute middle-school voice. Young readers who have ever felt too big or been made to feel small will feel just right in the cheerful glow of Weiner\u2019s contemporary fairy tale.Jennifer Hubert Swan is the director of library services at the Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump and the Bieber Doctrine", "Date": "2016-11-20", "News": "Supported bySofia, Bulgaria \u2014 It seems no matter what happens with American politics, the 19th-century French thinker Alexis de Tocqueville has something to say about it. In his classic \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d he suggested that democratic politics was in need of drama; as an election nears, \u201cintrigues become more active, agitation more lively and more widespread. The entire nation falls into a feverish state.\u201d But, once the election has passed, \u201ceverything becomes calm, and the river, one moment overflowed, returns peacefully to its bed.\u201dWe can all agree that the first part describes exactly what happened in 2016 \u2014 because, whatever we think about this particular race, it was merely a hyperbolic version of the usual democratic process. During an election period, candidates frame the normal as catastrophic while promising that all calamities can somehow be overcome. Democratic politics might be interpreted as a nationwide therapy session in which voters are confronted with their worst nightmares \u2014 demographic collapse, economic meltdown, environmental disaster, a new war \u2014 but are persuaded that they have the power to stave off the devastation.When the elections are over, the world magically returns to its status quo. And even if it doesn\u2019t, people will do their best to believe otherwise. Following the initial shock of Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, both friends and foes will downgrade the significance of what has transpired. The same people who portrayed a Trump victory as apocalyptic will come to see it as business as usual.The risk is that, this time, we\u2019re not returning to business as usual. Irrespective of the policies that the president-elect will adopt, Mr. Trump\u2019s victory will have profound political repercussions in the United States and abroad. It is a global regime change. Indeed, the fall of the Berlin Wall might be a useful analogue for the present moment: Nov. 9, 2016, could become no less consequential than Nov. 9, 1989. And in their panic and disorientation, liberal elites now are not much different from Communist elites then.The significance of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory goes far beyond the defeat of Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump has buried the liberal narrative of what happened after the Cold War. A period that only yesterday was hailed as the liberation of peoples is now understood as the liberation of the elites, and the unleashing of chaotic world forces that only an American strongman can contain. Even if Trump supporters become disillusioned with the president-elect and his policies, his rejection won\u2019t inspire a return to the rhetoric or the policies of the 1990s.In the same way that Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s efforts to reform the Communist system upended the assumptions on which his system was based, Mr. Trump\u2019s victory makes what was common sense yesterday unintelligible today. Who will stand ready to claim that globalization still connotes freedom and prosperity for all and that democracy means respect for minority rights when Americans \u2014 in the eyes of the world the greatest beneficiaries of globalization and traditional advocates of human rights \u2014 voted unambiguously that the system is broken?Trump\u2019s victory is also a powerful statement that anti-populism, the attempt of elites to play on people\u2019s anxieties of a reckless and unpredictable populist-inspired reality, is no longer the way to win elections. In fact, the word \u201celite\u201d today may be the dirtiest word in the popular vocabulary.His victory makes clear that we live in a moment when the fear of an uncertain future is a weaker mobilizing force than a disgust with the present. It signals that threatened majorities have emerged as a major force in Western democratic politics. These majorities fear that foreigners are taking over their countries and threatening their way of life, and they are convinced that the current crisis is brought on by a conspiracy between cosmopolitan-minded elites and tribal-minded immigrants.The Trump effect will be felt differently around the world, but its impact may be most powerful in Europe. Mr. Trump\u2019s victory not only emboldens populist leaders and parties in Europe; it puts the future of the European Union in question. Since World War II, when it comes to security, Europe has been America\u2019s protectorate; no longer does that seem to be the case.In 1989, Mr. Gorbachev announced his Sinatra Doctrine, the idea that every country in the Soviet bloc could go its own way and that Moscow would refrain from intervention. Over the course of his campaign Mr. Trump was maddeningly vague about concrete policies, but he did suggest what I might call the \u201cBieber Doctrine\u201d \u2014 that America would no longer see its allies\u2019 security problems as its own. \u201cAnd if you think that I\u2019m still holdin\u2019 on to something,\u201d Justin Bieber sings, \u201cYou should go and love yourself.\u201d\u201cGo and love yourself\u201d is essentially Mr. Trump\u2019s message to his European allies. The preservation of the European Union is no longer the priority nor the objective of American foreign policy.Moreover, the irony of Mr. Trump\u2019s effect on global politics is that his victory has liberated the world from the need to love, envy or hate America. It was President Obama who dared to suggest that America is not exceptional, but it is the election of Mr. Trump that convinced the world that America\u2019s democracy is not different from ours. It can also be chaotic and dangerous.It\u2019s reported that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia instructed his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, that if he wanted to understand how America worked, the only thing he needed to do was watch the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d The American president-elect would most likely agree. Which means, perhaps, that de Tocqueville is no longer required reading on American politics. Instead, just watch Frank Underwood.Advertisement"}

The process requires an average of six to eight hours to complete. For Ms. Brooks, he created a small crown on her forehead in a nod to royalty, and the idea of beauty and knowing one\u2019s worth. Mr. Senbanjo said the triangles he paints on himself are symbolic of a religious trinity: father, son and Holy Ghost, and the idea of stability.\u201cFor the Yoruba, as well as in several African cultures, the head is the wellspring of wisdom and seat of divine power,\u201d Ugochukwu-Smooth C. Nzewi, curator of African art at the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College, said in an email. With the head also a source for creativity, Dr. Nzewi said Mr. Senbanjo\u2019s work is \u201cpushing the boundaries of indigenous art traditions through recuperation, appropriation and reinvention, and combining them with formal ideas.\u201dMs. Brooks, who plays Tasha Jefferson (known as Taystee) in the Netflix series \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d said in a telephone interview that the experience, which she likened to a ceremony, is an exercise in mutual trust. \u201cWhen he is so intimately close to your body in that way, he\u2019s seeing all of your scars, all of the things you deem beautiful or all of the things that you don\u2019t like.\u201d She continued: \u201cThere\u2019s a part of him that he\u2019s also sharing with me, the things that he\u2019s writing on my body are a part of his culture.\u201dMr. Senbanjo, a former human rights lawyer in Nigeria, found himself yearning for a life beyond the constraints of the corporate world. In 2013, he changed careers to focus full time on his art and relocated to New York.\u201cThere\u2019s something Brooklyn does to you, to be honest, something about an artist here \u2014 either you evolve or you die,\u201d said Mr. Senbanjo, who now splits his time between Nigeria and New York. The struggle to break through the gallery scene led him to embrace the idea that everything could be his canvas, from murals to custom-designed clothing.It was an Instagram photo that sparked the idea for his sacred art of the Ori. One evening in 2014, at Parsons School of Design for a show, he saw Reign Apiim, a fellow artist, observing a painting. Staring at her, he said, she appeared to become a part of the work. He sent her a direct message shortly after, inquiring if she would be open to trying an idea \u2014 her body as the canvas.\u201cThe first time we did it, it was full-out performance art, we never did a practice run,\u201d Ms. Apiim said of their Afropunk festival collaboration in 2015. \u201cAs he\u2019s applying paint to you, you\u2019re kind of washing away all the negative energy of the day. Every time he paints me, when I wake up the next day I feel like I\u2019ve had a spiritual experience. It becomes more and more meditative.\u201dBrands, art institutions and celebrities took notice but Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s interest proved a crucial tipping point in elevating mainstream appreciation for his work.While the collaboration increased demand for his work, Mr. Senbanjo\u2019s mission remains unchanged: to increase the attention paid to African artists both living and dead, including Prince Twins Seven-Seven, Bruce Onobrakpeya, Nike Davies-Okundaye and Tola Wewe.\u201cLaolu brings something that is necessary right now for art and black empowerment,\u201d said Seun Kuti, a musician, collaborator and son of the Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. \u201cLaolu\u2019s work is unapologetically inspired by our ancestors, so I think that\u2019s what makes it so unique and powerful, especially in the times we are in.\u201dMr. Senbanjo said his work offers a history lesson in Yoruba culture. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of codes and writing in what I do, and I want people to study it. I want it to end up in libraries and textbooks,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a movement. If I know Picasso\u2019s life story, why shouldn\u2019t you know mine?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": " What 10 Actors Wore to a Spike Lee Casting Call in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byFew filmmakers are linked to a borough the way that Spike Lee is to Brooklyn. So when Mr. Lee, the 59-year-old director, announced that he was having an open casting call for a coming Netflix series based on \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d last month, Brooklynites of all stripes turned out. The line of actors and performers at the Masonic Temple was so long that it wrapped around an entire block in Fort Greene. Despite the wait, the crowd was in good spirits and, naturally, smartly dressed. Where did you get that jacket?Tell me about the hat.I\u2019m a Brooklyn boy, born and bred. I\u2019ve got to always represent. I always wear this out to auditions. It\u2019s kind of like my lucky hat.Tell me about these glasses.They came from American Apparel, I got them when I worked there a few years ago. They help simplify outfits. I can wear something crazy and then just some plain glasses.You\u2019ve got the goatee going.I used to have a high-top fade. I cut it off when I graduated because for auditions, it put me in too much of a box. So since my top hair went missing, I was like, I\u2019m going to start doing facial things. I don\u2019t like to look plain. I love your hat.I got this on eBay for like, $4. They had one at Urban for like, $32, and I was like, maybe not. I found an image of the hat and looked it up through Google Image. I just got it in the mail, so I\u2019ve been wearing it to death.Your lipstick and pants match.I\u2019m feeling fall vibes. The color is called saddle, which I guess makes sense.You have a strong layering game going on with the cardigan, the jacket, and the top.I have no bodily climate control. If it\u2019s below 75 degrees, then I\u2019m freezing. And if it\u2019s above 75 degrees, I\u2019m sweating profusely, so I have to dress in layers pretty much all the time.What did you want your outfit to project for this audition?Lately, not just for this audition, I\u2019ve been feeling fall goddess-y. October is my prime. I\u2019m from New England, so this is peak fall, so I\u2019m trying to channel that. Plus, I ran straight here from work.You have a lot of different jobs.They all relate to each other, so why not just do it all? You can meet new people, network. I met someone over here through a fashion designer, and now they\u2019re acting.So is your jacket and hat of your own design?I make jackets and hats, based here in New York, really Brooklyn. All the styles really come from Brooklyn. That\u2019s where all the inspiration comes from. There\u2019s Biggie Smalls, as you can see. He\u2019s from Brooklyn.What\u2019s your company called?TruckingFlyWear. Like a trucker\u2019s hat. If you take the \u201cc\u201d out, it\u2019s true king wear. It has a double meaning.How would you classify your style?I don\u2019t like to curse, so I\u2019ll say trucking fly.Why are you here today?Spike Lee helped Martin Lawrence, and I\u2019m a big fan. Huge. The TV show, the stand-up, his personality. That\u2019s who I grew up with, and Spike Lee gave him an opportunity. I came out here with hopes and dreams like everyone else.Tell me about your hat.I picked it up in a consignment shop in Phoenix last summer. It was a one-of-a-kind piece, and I just had to have it.Your glasses are great.I liked the classic frame, the cat eye. They frame everybody\u2019s face well. It\u2019s all vintage minus the jeans. They\u2019re from Uniqlo.You have a retro look going on.Well, I\u2019m from Baltimore.How do you approach dressing for an audition like this? You want to be a blank slate, but you want an edge. You want to have a certain twist to it, you want to have a bit of glam to it if you\u2019re a girl, because you want to stand out.Where\u2019d you get your hat from?I believe I got it from T.J. Maxx. It was a neutral color, and I thought it was stylish. Everyone asked me about it. I have a lot of hats, some brims, some baseball caps.Where are your glasses from?I got these from a little stand in Union Square. Because I have a fuller face, I always look for something bigger. Smaller frames, they just, like, sink in.Tell me about your outfit.I think my jacket\u2019s from Old Navy and the button-up is from Nordstrom Rack. And my shoes are from Ralph Lauren Chaps.You\u2019ve got a great beard.You were in a K-pop band?Yes, it was called EXP. They are now overseas, and I\u2019m no longer with them. I started acting, so I had to make a decision. We were shown on some Indonesian show and interviewed by a Korean magazine, and we almost had an MTV show, but that didn\u2019t work out.I love your hoodie.It\u2019s from H&M. For some reason, I was wearing a black hoodie earlier but because everything was kind of light, I went with this one because it maybe evens things out.And you went with classic Converse.They\u2019re fake leather, like pleather? I needed white because I was tired of my black ones. And I needed something to pull together my almost-preppy look.Are you dressing more as yourself or for the audition?I never really dress for auditions. I kind of just dress the way I feel. Like I know you\u2019re not supposed to wear ripped jeans, but I would wear ripped jeans or a scoop-neck T-shirt. Today I wanted to be kind of preppy, but not. It depends on the day.That\u2019s a unique name.My mom actually named me that. And then the last name is like a vacuum cleaner. (Laughs.)I love your jacket.This is actually my grandmother\u2019s. She was very stylish. Tell me about your necklaces.I made one of these, and these two I bought from this couple who sells jewelry on the street. They travel around the world collecting items from Indonesia and different parts of Africa, and over the years I talk to them like surrogate parents.Your hair is amazing.Well, I\u2019m a Gemini, but I guess I\u2019m a Leo rising, so there\u2019s a part of me that likes to look like a lion with a mane. So some of it is my own and some of it is not, but I added it in myself. I love the idea of have your aura be something that shines out but you\u2019re giving a few clues.What made you come out today?I\u2019ve been following Spike Lee for most of my life. I grew up around the corner from \u201cDo the Right Thing Way.\u201d I\u2019m black and it\u2019s Spike Lee. You just go.Where\u2019s your jacket from?What does your shirt say?Bloodlinefresh. I got it from the thrift as well. It\u2019s a vintage company. I didn\u2019t know about it before I bought it.Is this how your normally dress or is this for the audition?Both. It\u2019s how I normally dress but I also feel like it\u2019s a nice aesthetic to visualize me for a role.Where\u2019s your coat from?It\u2019s vintage from Goodwill. I saw that it was extra, extra large and I love large clothing. I wanted that stump look.I like that you\u2019re wearing a man\u2019s shirt.I want a uniform look. I didn\u2019t want to do too much. I wanted to be plain today, and I thought this was simple but chic.What\u2019s going on with your jeans?My friend made these. It says \u201cMind Your Business, Summer Spring.\u201d I just told her to put these roses on it, and she added all these extra details.I\u2019m extremely eclectic. I might wear a minidress one day or something oversized the next. It depends on what I\u2019m feeling and how I want to express myself. Tell me about your necklace.How do you dress for an audition, especially since Spike has a distinct visual style?I did think that Spike\u2019s about Brooklyn, he\u2019s Afro-centric, which is why I have the kente bit of my shirt. I\u2019m not the best actor when it comes to dressing for the role. I just tried to do nouveau Brooklyn. I know Brooklyn and his mentality.Why did you come out today?I have an agent and a manager, and I almost didn\u2019t come. But I thought that\u2019s not really the spirit. I have a shot to get into a Spike Lee film, one of my lifelong heroes, why not stand out here with everyone else? You\u2019ve got to be in it to win it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Good at Skipping Ads? No, You\u2019re Not", "Date": "2016-11-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I don\u2019t often watch late night television, which may be why I was caught unawares. Jimmy Fallon\u2019s opening monologue began hilariously enough, when abruptly he pivoted to a series of inexplicably weak jokes centered on a forthcoming football game. It slowly dawned on me that I was watching a commercial for NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d albeit one baked right into the opening monologue and delivered by Fallon himself.The realization that something you thought to be \u201creal\u201d is actually an advertisement is an increasingly common, if unsettling, sensation. Mara Einstein calls it \u201ccontent confusion,\u201d and if her book, \u201cBlack Ops Advertising,\u201d is right, we\u2019re in for even more such trickery, indeed a possible future where nearly everything becomes hidden commercial propaganda of one form or another. She forecasts the potential of a \u201cworld where there is no real content: Everything we experience is some form of sales pitch.\u201dEinstein, a former advertising executive turned media professor (who, among other things, worked campaigns for Uncle Ben\u2019s and Miller Lite), makes it clear that things were not always this way. Once upon a time the line between editorial and advertising, if not exactly a Chinese wall, was somewhat clearer. Einstein\u2019s well-researched and accomplished book is mainly about the effort to tear down that wall. The sledgehammers and pick axes in this case are things like \u201csponsored content,\u201d \u201cnative advertising\u201d and \u201ccontent marketing\u201d designed to fool you into thinking they are real. Such stealth advertising may entertain or inform, yet it also brands, or more cleverly, facilitates a later branding exercise or sales pitch. The handoff can be smooth enough that you don\u2019t notice you\u2019ve been steered to exit through the gift shop.\u201cBlack Ops\u201d presents some startling examples of stealth advertising. Remember that guy who in 2012 jumped out of a helium balloon at 128,000 feet for a new world record? Covered widely in the media, it was all, according to Einstein, a disguised Red Bull marketing campaign, but one where Red Bull\u2019s role was so discreet as to be almost invisible. You may also recall the audacious \u201ctagging\u201d of Air Force One by a graffiti artist named Marc Ecko, which has been viewed nearly a million times on YouTube. It was a hoax intended for the branding of a clothing and accessories label. That \u201cad\u201d fooled so many members of the public and press that it was awarded the top prize for digital media at the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival.The book is slightly guilty of exaggerating the novelty of present-day advertising techniques. Content that doubles as brand advertising is not exactly new. In the 1980s, \u201cThe Transformers\u201d and \u201cG.I. Joe\u201d were popular children\u2019s cartoons but also advertisements, and so of course was the much beloved \u201cMickey Mouse Club\u201d back in the 1960s. The idea of inventing media stories for commercial purpose also has a long pedigree, dating to at least the late 1920s, when Lucky Strike staged a protest (the \u201ctorches of liberty\u201d) featuring attractive women demanding the right to smoke outdoors as a part of suffragist liberation (yielding, ultimately, an equal right to lung cancer). Subliminal advertising, perhaps the blackest of all black ops, was popular in the 1950s, until it was banned.The difference, Einstein argues, lies in how much effort is going toward the dark arts. It is, she suggests, for one simple reason: that we, the public, are so good at avoiding or ignoring traditional advertising. We are fickle fish, cynical creatures who have already been hooked so many times that the simpler lures no longer work.We avoid ads using devices as simple as the remote control (originally conceived as an ad-avoidance technology) and as sophisticated as ad-blocking phones (thanks, Apple). Many of us have developed a mental blindness that helps us see through advertising as if it were not there. Indeed, ad avoidance has become a lifestyle, so much so that some people will simply declare, \u201cI don\u2019t watch advertising\u201d the same way one might declare adherence to a gluten-free diet.Einstein\u2019s book wanders from its main topic into a fuller review of contemporary advertising practice, including pseudo-engagement on social media, mass harvesting of private data and other unappealing practices. Perhaps the most important contribution she makes is providing a clear sense of what free content actually costs. There was a time when the idealists among us prophesied that the 21st century would be a golden age of free stuff, powered by a culture of sharing, and that targeted advertising would be a blessing for consumers. Today that vision has soured and even seems like a bad joke given how plagued we are by the rise of stealth advertising, the invasions of privacy, the proliferation of clickbait and stalking advertising, and the general degradation of much of the web.Einstein is not enthusiastic about contemporary advertising practice, and few of us are likely to regard constant deception as attractive. But what\u2019s the remedy? One, briefly mentioned by Einstein, is legal. The Federal Trade Commission regards advertising posing as legitimate content to be an illegal form of \u201cconsumer deception.\u201d Einstein calls for more enforcement, but admits that it\u2019s not easy. What does one do, for example, about the many movies (like \u201cThe Transformers\u201d) and reality shows (\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d) that are simultaneously entertainment and advertisement?Einstein is not the first former marketing executive to turn on her profession; James Rorty, in 1934, wrote of his colleagues: \u201cThey are dead men. Their bones are Bakelite. Their blood is water, their flesh is pallid \u2014 yes, prick them and they do not bleed.\u201d But unlike Rorty, who wanted to destroy advertising, she would prefer to save it: She is nostalgic for the recent past, when audiences sitting through commercials made deception unnecessary. But if that\u2019s the remedy, it is a lost cause: No one who figures out how to avoid advertising willingly goes back.Einstein too quickly discards the most important remedy for advertising\u2019s abuses: paying for content. A broader historical view can remind us that ad-supported media competes with paid media (like HBO, film, books). Those who don\u2019t want to live in a world constantly trying to trick us into watching ads may have the most impact by voting with their dollars and starving the beast of the attention it needs to survive. Paying for things (Facebook, if it let you pay, Einstein tells us, might be $12 a year) strikes at the heart of the business model, and indeed a partial revolt is already underway, as suggested by the popularity of advertising-free subscription services like Netflix.It is a reminder that advertising- supported entertainment is hardly indelible or eternal, but a relatively recent invention whose future is insecure. From this perspective, the rise of black ops advertising may be less a sign of power than of desperation.Tim Wu is the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside our Heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking Back on the Making of \u2018The Godfather\u2019 With Francis Ford Coppola", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported by\u201cOh, gosh, am I bleeding?\u201d Francis Ford Coppola bleated out while ambling around his Napa Valley home, talking on the phone to a reporter.The book shows how he brought Mario Puzo\u2019s 1969 novel to life in a film that would go on to win the Academy Award for best picture in 1973, excising whole portions of the story and highlighting what he believed was a flawed novel\u2019s essence: a narrative of capitalism in America, as seen through the spilled blood and guts of one family.But for a moment, the topic was blood \u2014 his own.\u201cBroke a glass,\u201d he said, explaining that he had been watching a sports event, went to grab the remote control, and then knocked over the glass.The cut wasn\u2019t so bad. He felt fine, he said, save for the fact that he was bleeding, and knew there might be consequences if the blood ended up on anything valuable.\u201cMy wife will kill me,\u201d Mr. Coppola said. \u201cHold on.\u201dSo he put the phone down, went off to dress his wound and then returned for an hour\u2019s worth of questions about the movie he would sort of like to forget, the career he\u2019s mostly left behind and the non-film empire he\u2019s subsequently built.First, he made it clear that the book was a fairly low-profit venture that he did largely because people around him told him it was time. Then, he carped about his publisher.\u201cThe amount of work that company made me do,\u201d said Mr. Coppola, who has an unusual ability to turn complaining into a joyous experience. \u201cI could get that from a speaking engagement. And it\u2019s constant. I have to do this. I have to do that. I have to write the foreword.\u201dAs well as do this interview. Oh, well. What else was there to do but make the best of it? (The interview has been edited and condensed.)When was the last time you watched \u201cThe Godfather\u201d?Oh, I don\u2019t know, years ago. For me, the memory of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d brings great unhappiness. That movie took 60 days, and it was miserable, not to mention the months after of jockeying over the cut. So my reaction is usually of panic and nausea, but that has nothing to do with how it is for the audience.Something I liked about reading your book was finding out how methodical you were. There\u2019s a presumption that all great art is the result of a boundless imagination. This book shows that it\u2019s a slog.It was insecurity. I was so young. I was hired because I was young. A lot of important directors turned it down. Elia Kazan turned it down. Costa-Gavras turned it down, a whole bunch of important directors. So the philosophy was, let\u2019s get someone young, who could presumably be pushed around. Also, I was Italian-American, and that was good, because it meant if the studio got flak they could simply say, \u201cBut it was an Italian-American director.\u201d And I was someone they could get for a good cheap price. How much were you paid?They offered me two fees: either $75,000 and 10 percent of the profits, or $125,000 and 6 percent of the profits. I had two kids and a third one on the way, so I took 125 and 6 percent. I think I asked for 7 percent and didn\u2019t get it. When the movie was done, did you immediately know what a hit it was?I didn\u2019t. Bob Evans, the producer, kept it really close to the vest. He hadn\u2019t shown it to anyone. And I had been so browbeaten, heard I was going to be fired, that they were going to send in an action director. I was shellshocked. There was some happiness on set. Diane Keaton has written that she fell in love with Al Pacino making the film. In the auditions, she indicated he was her favorite, but Paramount didn\u2019t want him. I set up an improv where I took a room at the St. Regis Hotel and I had them order room service. Then I left them alone and I went home, and I\u2019m sure that was the incubation. But it\u2019s tricky. It can backfire. If they break up right during the film. That\u2019s happened to me, too. Do tell. Oh, I shouldn\u2019t say. Another movie. I imagine \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d was easier.Part II was a joy. I had total control. Throughout all this, did you read your reviews?I learned not to, but I did then. I remember when I did \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d Frank Rich said there had not been so big a disaster in years. \u201cSuperman\u201d had just come out. I thought, \u201cThat was about a guy in a suit flying around, and he\u2019s saying \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 is the biggest and worst thing!\u201d What was the most widespread criticism about \u201cThe Godfather?\u201dOf the first? That it was violent and romanticized those guys. Do you think it did?In effect, yes. Because the acting ultimately made those people sympathetic, even though their behavior was so terrible. Real Mafia people are animals. With the third film, the critics really sunk their teeth in.The third part was not something I wanted to do. I was coming out of a bankruptcy. Today you\u2019re the founder of a very successful wine business. You don\u2019t direct movies as regularly. People ask me \u201cWhat do you like better?\u201d I say, \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison.\u201d They\u2019re both very pleasurable, but the cinema remains the most magical thing. Which is why it\u2019s so heartbreaking to see what\u2019s happening to it. If it weren\u2019t for this sliver of independent cinema, there would be nothing left. Doing a movie of more than $3 million on an interesting topic today is nearly impossible. I sometimes say: I didn\u2019t leave the cinema, the cinema went off in its own direction. Meaning?The great Hollywood studios who produced such great films along with great entertainment have now been bought up by telecom companies. So I guess you were not pleased to learn that AT&T was purchasing Time Warner. I do not think it will pass the regulations. Are there movies you liked recently? Many, actually. I loved \u201cSwiss Army Man.\u201d Totally imaginative. I liked \u201cMommy\u201d by Xavier Dolan. \u201cTangerine\u201d was beautiful. So full of life and humor. There is TV now. Many would argue the advent of Netflix, HBO and Amazon in relation sort of make up for the decline of the movie studio. Yes. Cinema and television are becoming the same thing. You can\u2019t say I do this for television or movies. They both can be shown in theaters or at home. It can be one minute or a hundred hours, and you can have a screen that\u2019s big and beautiful like the LG OLED screens, which are a miracle. I noticed recently that you endorsed those. Do you have a deal with them?I kept buying them, so they said: \u201cWould you make a statement about how much you like them? We\u2019ll give you some televisions.\u201d And I said \u201cGreat, because I already ordered them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Actors Flock to Netflix to Satisfy Their Most Loyal Fans", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byStreamingThe fashionable notion that television is better than ever and that cinema or film is battling in vain to maintain relevance is, depending on where you sit, either a potent truth or a spectacularly tedious kernel of received nonwisdom. The fact that popular streaming video services are now investing hefty sums in the creation of content in formats that fit comfortably into commonly accepted notions of TV (varied series in half-hour and full-hour episodes) and motion pictures (self-contained features averaging two hours) puts a new spin on the debate.The movie doesn\u2019t get much more clever from there. Joe sells his book to an internet publisher and is soon mistaken for an actual assassin, kidnapped, and dispatched to Venezuela.

{"Headline": "From Moguls to Mortals", "Date": "2016-11-26", "News": "Supported byScene StealersLOS ANGELES \u2014 Some out-of-work Hollywood moguls handle the transition from general to civilian with grace.But they can also be one of moviedom\u2019s saddest sights. Some are very obviously at loose ends, no matter what kind of face they put on. Others seem terrified about a table downgrade at Mr. Chow.And some are just utterly out of touch, as when one former media titan, struggling to adjust to life without an always-idling private jet, arrived at an airport and was baffled by the touch-screen check-in procedure. What, pray tell, were these newfangled kiosk devices? (I am so not joking.)Hollywood has lately become populated with an unusually large number of free-floating moguls; guys (and they are still almost always guys) who find themselves reigning supreme as media kingpins one day and facing down an existential crisis as mere millionaires the next.They include Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former DreamWorks Animation chief; Jim Gianopulos, replaced as the big boss at 20th Century Fox in June; Philippe Dauman, dismissed as Viacom\u2019s leader in August; and Rob Friedman, eased aside as co-chairman of Lionsgate in September.There are several more examples, including Rob Moore, who recently lost his job as vice chairman of Paramount Pictures.\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting, no question, when you are suddenly dislodged from your life,\u201d Mr. Moore told me. \u201cYou\u2019re raw, and you\u2019re vulnerable. Even though you know this eventually happens to most everyone at a certain level in Hollywood \u2014 that\u2019s just how it works in a hit-driven business \u2014 it\u2019s still a surprise.\u201cIn these all-consuming jobs, your co-workers become the next-closest thing to your children and parents, and not communicating with them in the same way all of a sudden leaves a big gap. You feel a sense of loss.\u201dDon\u2019t feel too bad for Mr. Moore. Under his old contract, Paramount has to pay him for three years, so he has no immediate pressure to find a new gig, even though most people in Hollywood expect him to be courted by a Chinese movie company.Mr. Moore, who sounded relaxed during our interview, said that he had recently returned from Europe (\u201cthe first real vacation I\u2019ve had in 15 years\u201d) and was now starting to think about his next career move. \u201cWhere\u2019s the growth?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cWhere would be a fun place to work next? At some point, you get through the shock of what happened and start getting excited about new opportunities.\u201dSo far, put Mr. Moore squarely in the graceful category.How are his jettisoned compatriots doing, emotionally and otherwise? It is hard to know. Whether trying to fly under the radar while putting together a new act, licking wounds, or still miffed about coverage (mine specifically) of their departure, they declined interview requests. But this much is clear: None are ready to leave the stage.But Comcast did not want one asset \u2014 him \u2014 and so Mr. Katzenberg left the company, a moment that was marked by a ceremony outside the Chinese Theater, where his footprints were immortalized in cement. Variety gave him a 37-page tribute that played like a retirement party, replete with praise and well-wishes from stars. (Elton John: \u201cHow did he do such amazing stunts with those little feet?\u201d)That was in September. But by then, the hard-charging Mr. Katzenberg was already starting a holding company that aims to emulate Barry Diller\u2019s IAC/InterActive Corporation, which owns internet businesses like Match.com and Vimeo.Several of Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s friends told me that he is working to raise $500 million to $700 million in funding to invest in \u201cmobile content\u201d start-ups that his new company will help incubate and operate. For now, Mr. Katzenberg is also still a consultant to AwesomenessTV, a digital media studio that is owned by Comcast and Verizon.All of these bigwigs will be just fine, of course. None certainly have to worry about feeding their families, like a lot of Americans who lose their jobs.Mr. Dauman, 62, who ruled over MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount for a decade as the top Viacom executive, received $72 million in exit compensation.But perception is another matter.Leaving any high-powered, global job requires an altitude adjustment. But leaving one in hierarchy-obsessed Hollywood \u2014 or having the job leave you, as is more often the case \u2014 can be traumatizing on a whole different scale.Sure, cue the tiny violins if you want. But one week, these people are fielding calls from A-listers and making decisions about what millions of people around the world will watch. The next week, they are faced with starring in their own version of \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Man.\u201d Calls get returned, but slower. The media spotlight shifts to the next regime, and you start being called an \u201celder statesman.\u201dShow business is a small, incestuous and, in some cases, cruel club. Unlike other industries, almost everyone in Hollywood lives in a bubble (Beverly Hills and Brentwood during the week, Malibu over the weekend), making it nearly impossible to escape the peer pressure.\u201cWhat are you doing next?\u201d becomes a question that burns like acid. Because status here is openly telegraphed (the platform banquette at the Palm, the early-hour invitation to Vanity Fair\u2019s Oscar party) everyone notices when you lose it.So what is the best way to navigate this transition?Curious for the perspective of those who have left megawatt Hollywood jobs in the past, I called three people who have done it with aplomb. None were fired, instead leaving on their own terms \u2014 a big difference. But each had to face the same question as everyone else: Now what?Quick moves, he added, are usually the wrong ones.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a start-up west of the Mississippi that didn\u2019t reach out to me, and that was flattering,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I quickly realized that a lot of people just want your Rolodex and your name to put on announcements. When you spend 40-plus years building your credibility and your reputation, you have to be careful about how you use that.\u201dIn the end, among other things, Mr. Meyer decided to join the board of a fast-growing entertainment company (Activision) and take on something he never thought he would: He sits on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \u201cAs it turns out, there is life outside Hollywood,\u201d he said with a laugh.\u201cI learned that a job is just a piece of you, it isn\u2019t all of you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many times, especially in Hollywood, that distinction can get lost.\u201d Her advice when that happens? \u201cYou have to reclaim yourself, and you have to do it without worrying what other people think,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are more than other people\u2019s definitions of us.\u201dIn other words, savor the joy of being \u201cfully present\u201d with your family, she said, and \u201cdo what you want to do, and not what you think you have to do\u201d to cling to status.\u201cI was so grateful for my time at CBS, but, let\u2019s be honest, these jobs are insane,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember being at my daughter\u2019s volleyball tournament and not seeing her play because I was in the bathroom at the convention center \u2014 the only quiet spot \u2014 trying to negotiate a new contract with an actress.

It is a philosophy likely to be more rewarding for those whose lives contain more privileged moments than grinding, humiliating or exhausting ones. Those for whom a given moment is more likely to be \u201csun-dappled yoga pose\u201d than \u201chour 11 manning the deep-fat fryer.\u201dOn the face of it, our lives are often much more fulfilling lived outside the present than in it. As anyone who has ever maintained that they will one day lose 10 pounds or learn Spanish or find the matching lids for the Tupperware will know, we often anticipate our futures with more blind optimism than the reality is likely to warrant.Surely one of the most magnificent feats of the human brain is its ability to hold past, present, future and their imagined alternatives in constant parallel, to offset the tedium of washing dishes with the chance to be simultaneously mentally in Bangkok, or in Don Draper\u2019s bed, or finally telling your elderly relative that despite her belief that \u201cno one born in the 1970s died,\u201d using a car seat isn\u2019t spoiling your child. It\u2019s hard to see why greater happiness would be achieved by reining in that magical sense of scope and possibility to outstare a SpaghettiO.What differentiates humans from animals is exactly this ability to step mentally outside of whatever is happening to us right now, and to assign it context and significance. Our happiness does not come so much from our experiences themselves, but from the stories we tell ourselves that make them matter.But still, the advice to be more mindful often contains a hefty scoop of moralizing smugness, a kind of \u201cmoment-shaming\u201d for the distractible, like a stern teacher scolding us for failing to concentrate in class. The implication is that by neglecting to live in the moment we are ungrateful and unspontaneous, we are wasting our lives, and therefore if we are unhappy, we really have only ourselves to blame.This judgmental tone is part of a long history of self-help-based cultural thought policing. At its worst, the positive-thinking movement deftly rebranded actual problems as \u201cproblematic thoughts.\u201d Now mindfulness has taken its place as the focus of our appetite for inner self-improvement. Where once problems ranging from bad marriages and work stress to poverty and race discrimination were routinely dismissed as a failure to \u201cthink positive,\u201d now our preferred solution to life\u2019s complex and entrenched problems is to instruct the distressed to be more mindful.This is a kind of neo-liberalism of the emotions, in which happiness is seen not as a response to our circumstances but as a result of our own individual mental effort, a reward for the deserving. The problem is not your sky-high rent or meager paycheck, your cheating spouse or unfair boss or teetering pile of dirty dishes. The problem is you.It is, of course, easier and cheaper to blame the individual for thinking the wrong thoughts than it is to tackle the thorny causes of his unhappiness. So we give inner-city schoolchildren mindfulness classes rather than engage with education inequality, and instruct exhausted office workers in mindful breathing rather than giving them paid vacation or better health care benefits.In reality, despite many grand claims, the scientific evidence in favor of the Moment\u2019s being the key to contentment is surprisingly weak. When the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted an enormous meta-analysis of over 18,000 separate studies on meditation and mindfulness techniques, the results were underwhelming at best.Although some of the studies did show that mindfulness meditation or other similar exercises might bring some small benefits to people in comparison with doing nothing, when they are compared with pretty much any general relaxation technique at all, including exercise, muscle relaxation, \u201clistening to spiritual audiotapes\u201d or indeed any control condition that gives equal time and attention to the person, they perform no better, and in many cases, worse.So perhaps, rather than expending our energy struggling to stay in the Moment, we should simply be grateful that our brains allow us to be elsewhere.Advertisement"}

Maybe too quickly.Starting in 2002, he directed one bright, bouncy \u2014 some would say tacky \u2014 family comedy after another, like \u201cBig Fat Liar\u201d and \u201cCheaper by the Dozen.\u201d Six in a row made money, no small feat, and his 2006 film \u201cNight at the Museum\u201d was the kind of franchise-spawning hit that most directors go their entire careers without finding.But Mr. Levy was then confronted with that age-old show business conundrum: How do you prevent yourself from being pigeonholed? He could have stayed in a family comedy box, to take the money and run. But the hyperactive Mr. Levy, 48, wanted both commercial hits and critical respect. \u201cI was determined to build a production company that surprises people in its range,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought he was this. Actually, he is much more.\u201dWhile nobody was looking, Mr. Levy just pulled it off.Netflix does not disclose viewership data, but the series was quickly renewed for a second season. When the Golden Globe nominations are announced on Dec. 12, \u201cStranger Things,\u201d with a cast anchored by Winona Ryder, could make a big showing in the television categories, and maybe even earn a nod for best TV drama.For Mr. Levy and his 21 Laps lieutenants, none of whom have previously been players on Hollywood\u2019s awards scene, the sudden one-two punch has led to no small amount of giddiness.\u201cPure, unmitigated thrill is what I feel,\u201d Mr. Levy said over lunch at Mr. Chow here recently. \u201cSo beyond anything we had hoped for. When I used to talk about wanting to build a production company with wide interests and a focus beyond family comedy, people in Hollywood would nod politely. \u2018That\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s never going to happen.\u2019 Guess what? We actually did it!\u201dSo the frenetic Mr. Levy is not, even by a long shot, abandoning his career as a mass-market filmmaker.\u201cI\u2019m sure I have as solid an ego as any filmmaker, but if I can see someone else doing a better job behind the camera than me, then I want them to do it,\u201d Mr. Levy said of people like Mr. Raso. \u201cYou can\u2019t build a company with director avarice.\u201dIt is unusual in Hollywood for A-list directors like Mr. Levy to champion other filmmakers to such a degree; they usually focus all of their resources on furthering their own directing careers. \u201cFrom the start, he became sort of an older brother to me,\u201d Mr. Villeneuve, the \u201cArrival\u201d director, said by phone. \u201cTrying to share his experience, trying to guide me, giving me strong encouragement and good advice in the editing room \u2014 that\u2019s not that common in this business.\u201dMr. Levy, who was born in Montreal and who put himself through film school by landing small roles in shows like \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210,\u201d said that he had to learn to shelve his ego in other ways. One involved staffing 21 Laps. \u201cIn hiring people, you don\u2019t double down on your strengths,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know your weaknesses, and you find support in those areas. Meaning you hire smart, hard-working people with tastes that are different from your own.\u201dBoth \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cArrival,\u201d for instance, were spotted by a pair of 21 Laps executives that Mr. Levy calls \u201cthe Dans\u201d \u2014 Dan Cohen, executive vice president, and Dan Levine, president. Mr. Cohen previously worked on indie films like \u201cLars and the Real Girl.\u201d Mr. Levine is a former Paramount executive.\u201cYou hear about typecasting in front of the camera, but it also happens on the other side,\u201d Mr. Levine said. \u201cPeople were not initially going to bring dramas to us. We had to go out and find writers ourselves.\u201dMr. Levine estimated that 21 Laps now has about 40 movies in development, along with a couple of TV projects, making the company one of Hollywood\u2019s top suppliers.One person who was always a believer? Mr. Levy. And look no further than the company\u2019s name as proof.21 Laps refers to a kindergarten jog-a-thon in 2004. \u201cI expected my daughter, who was not particularly athletic, to run four or five laps and then sit down and pick flowers,\u201d he said.\u201cSomehow,\u201d he continued, \u201cshe went to a place inside herself, to a place of will, and showed everyone what was possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warner Bros., Quietly Thriving, Recasts Its Own Story", "Date": "2016-11-07", "News": "Supported byMr. Tsujihara, the Warner Bros. chief executive, is on track to deliver record operating profit this year, with film leading the way. Last week, Time Warner said his division \u2014 home to Batman, Clint Eastwood, Bugs Bunny, \u201cThe Middle\u201d and TMZ.com \u2014 had income of $433 million, a 12 percent increase from a year earlier. Its corporate sibling HBO, by comparison, with $530 million in profit, grew 2 percent.Yet many people consider Warner Bros. a troubled operation, a notion that Mr. Tsujihara thinks is rooted in an underappreciation of the studio\u2019s wide-ranging businesses and the lingering effect of film pipeline problems that it has moved past.\u201cQuietly, we\u2019ve been having an amazing year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe narrative, over all, has not reflected that.\u201dSo how does Mr. Tsujihara correct the narrative?More hits could follow. Over the next year, Warner Bros. will release \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d \u201cKong: Skull Island,\u201d \u201cJustice League,\u201d Christopher Nolan\u2019s war epic \u201cDunkirk\u201d and two animated Lego movies. Salted among those behemoths are lower-cost entries from Warner\u2019s New Line Cinema unit, like \u201cAnnabelle 2,\u201d a horror movie.When it comes to recasting Warner as the well-oiled giant he believes it is, Mr. Tsujihara also knows that the studio needs to do a better job of telling its own story. Warner executives tend to hunker behind those beige walls, which allows others in Hollywood \u2014 especially those who have left the studio under unhappy circumstances \u2014 to do the talking for them, at times contributing to bracingly negative news media coverage.Add the box office success of \u201cSully\u201d and several modestly budgeted, expertly marketed New Line films this year, including \u201cCentral Intelligence,\u201d \u201cLights Out\u201d and \u201cThe Conjuring 2,\u201d and the studio is on pace to have one of its most profitable years ever. At a time when smaller rivals like Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment are struggling, Warner Bros. has been frustrated that its own financial success has not garnered more notice.\u201cPeople overlook our consistency,\u201d Mr. Tsujihara said.But what about those bad superhero reviews? Analysts worry that the impact of less-than-fulfilling movies like \u201cDawn of Justice\u201d could be felt down the line, perhaps when consumers weigh whether \u201cJustice League\u201d is worth their money.Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst with Nomura, recently raised his fourth-quarter financial estimates for Warner Bros. in anticipation of ticket sales for \u201cFantastic Beasts.\u201d But he noted that Time Warner \u201cfielded exactly zero questions\u201d from analysts on last week\u2019s earnings call about its studio, with the attention going instead to the Turner cable networks and HBO.Warner Bros. would most likely contend that investors were not looking at its operation in full. While movies receive most of the attention, they actually make up a small part of Warner\u2019s overall business.Mr. Tsujihara says he sees consumer products as \u201ca real growth engine.\u201dWill such efforts help Warner persuade outsiders to view it more holistically? It\u2019s unclear. But at least Mr. Tsujihara\u2019s boss has noticed.\u201cKevin has a great understanding of how fast consumer behavior is changing and how the company is changing to meet their expectations,\u201d Jeffrey L. Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, said in an email. \u201cWhat\u2019s really impressed me is how he\u2019s breaking down silos and driving greater collaboration among the businesses, which is helping the company produce the right kinds of content, for the right platforms, at the right time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When he was 4, I divorced his father and raised him on my own. I didn\u2019t receive any financial support, so I worked full time to support us. Now my son is married with three children. But since he married, I am not included in family holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas. For years, I invited them, but they never accepted. They spend holidays with my daughter-in-law\u2019s family. It bothers me that my in-laws don\u2019t seem to care that I\u2019m left alone. I\u2019ve had many talks with my son about this, but nothing changes. Is there anything more I can do?ANONYMOUSI\u2019m sorry that your feelings are hurt. I am also sorry about the volume of mail I receive from people who feel lonely or knocked around by the one-two punch of our compulsory (family) holidays: Thanksgiving and Christmas.But let\u2019s take a step back, Anonymous. You went to some length in your windup to tell us what a dedicated mother you were. But you didn\u2019t work and sacrifice to secure a seat at a holiday table 30 years down the road. You did it out of love for your son. (And good for you!) But sadly, parenting is not a quid pro quo arrangement. Your son does not owe you anything.You write that you have had many conversations with him about this. But have you said (to him or his wife, depending on your relationship): \u201cHoney, I have no place to go on Thanksgiving. Would you ask Mary\u2019s parents if I can join you?\u201d Be that direct. This is your flesh and blood we\u2019re talking about, not a pal from book club. If you have already been this direct, either your son does not want to ask his wife or in-laws, or he has asked and was refused. You have limited leverage either way.I don\u2019t want to sound callous here because I know the holidays can weigh on us. But perhaps you should start exploring different avenues: volunteering on Thanksgiving or inviting friends to celebrate with you. It would be magnificent if your son (and his in-laws) considered your predicament without a nudge from you. But they haven\u2019t. So be clear. If they still won\u2019t bend your way, start knocking on different doors.My brother-in-law is a police officer. He carries a gun, even off duty. He comes to visit us once a year. I told my sister I do not feel comfortable having a gun in the house. (I have a small child.) She said she would talk to her husband, but I doubt she has. What should I do?ANONYMOUSFollow up. Ask, \u201cHow did Jim feel about leaving his gun at home?\u201d In the event of pushback (or noncommittal dithering), add: \u201cWe know that Jim is a responsible gun owner. We just don\u2019t want guns in our home.\u201d If you continue to believe she\u2019s shining you on, install a metal detector at the front door. Happy Thanksgiving!Every year, my sister hosts Thanksgiving, and we all contribute healthy, organic dishes. But my 80-year-old mother insists on bringing her homemade applesauce, to which she adds sugar, a problem for diabetics in the family and not healthy for the rest of us. She thinks that a little sugar doesn\u2019t hurt anyone (including the diabetics) and that people can choose not to eat it. Her disregard of dietary needs and preferences rankles. May I insist she leave the applesauce at home?LYNDA, NEW JERSEYDon\u2019t let a trifling matter like applesauce grow a millimeter larger than it has to. Be diplomatic. Ask your mother to bring two batches: \u201cYour delicious original recipe and one without sugar, please.\u201d Or make the sugar-free version yourself. The essence of potluck dinners is giving up total control for the rainbow contributions of many. No one likes an autocrat. True, your mother does not appear to have a solid grasp on diabetes. But do you really need to get into a tug of McIntosh about it?My in-laws voted for [insert candidate]. I didn\u2019t. They are coming to visit us. How will I bear their presence?

{"Headline": "How Furniture Makers Are Catering to Millennials", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Burrow is on an enviable trajectory right now. The company is a graduate of the prestigious Bay Area tech accelerator Y Combinator; it also has a healthy list of pre-orders for its product\u2019s planned debut in January. But given that pedigree, the product is an unusual one: couches. Not cloud-connected couches or remote-controlled couches \u2014 just couches. Technically, the company makes a couch, singular, available in a few different colors and configurations. The one I was sitting on belonged to Jess Goodman, a friend of the founders and an early supporter. Its design was midcentury modern unexceptional, and it was perfectly nice. But the couch is not Burrow\u2019s main attraction. Burrow is selling a couch experience.When customers order a Burrow couch online, the standard model will ship to their apartments in three or four boxes. A human of average size should be able to take those boxes up the stairs (if they have stairs) and build the couch alone, without tools and within minutes.Chopra and Kuhl tell me that for urban professionals between 25 and 35, the physical process of buying a sofa and moving it into an apartment is a series of \u201cpain points.\u201d Some of these points are literally painful, like carrying a large sofa up a flight of stairs. But the term is business speak for any kind of friction, however abstract, between a customer and a new couch. Burrow doesn\u2019t claim to have improved upon the couch itself: It\u2019s a pain-management company.It helps that furniture sales in the United States are unusually fragmented. It\u2019s a $100 billion annual market, but giants like Ashley HomeStore and Ikea take less than 5 percent each, while regional chains like Rooms to Go and Havertys still account for significant sales. Unlike with, say, office supplies, the industry hasn\u2019t become concentrated in a few huge companies \u2014 the field remains competitive.All of which is to say millennial entrepreneurs could pick a worse thing to sell than a deconstructable couch. As they disrupt our living rooms, these businessmen move us one step closer to a different world. But are we sure we want to live there?As they say, however, nothing in this life is free \u2014 certainly not shipping couches. Burrow manufactures its boxed-up sofas-to-be in Mexico City, then freight-forwards them to warehouses in Cincinnati and New York. Because they\u2019re boxes, rather than constructed furniture, they can stack all the way to the ceiling. The boxes are FedEx and UPS compliant, and they ship from the warehouses like normal packages. The process is advertised as free, but the founders estimate that it will cost them $75 per sofa, or about 10 percent of the $745 purchase price for the two-seat base model. Chopra and Kuhl also figure that if they can ease all the \u201cpain\u201d around obtaining and installing a couch, customers will be happy enough with what they get to refrain from sending it back, which Burrow says it will allow them to do for 100 days. It occurs to me that the kind of person who would order a couch online to reduce logistical hassles is also the kind of person least likely to then pack up that couch and send it back. When I ask the founders about this, they offer angelic smiles. \u201cWe think our model works for almost everyone,\u201d Kuhl says, \u201cbut there are some people who like Ikea.\u201dIkea hardly dominates the market from a numbers perspective, but it\u2019s been a cultural phenomenon for as long as Burrow\u2019s target demographic has been alive, to the point that it\u2019s essentially a default furniture-acquisition source. In a case study well known to those with M.B.A.s, Youngme Moon of Harvard Business School described how the company made a home in America. From the 1985 opening of its first American store, Ikea emphasized everything except the attribute that had been the industry\u2019s sole sales strategy until that point: durability. At Ikea\u2019s prices, furniture didn\u2019t need to be seen as a future heirloom; young adults could furnish their homes with new objects, rather than trawling through thrift stores or taking hand-me-downs from upgrading relatives. Attractive Swedish particle board gave Americans an excuse to jettison their parents\u2019 commitment to lifelong furniture and go shopping more often.\u201cIkea is an amazing company,\u201d says Maxwell Ryan, the chief executive and co-founder of the influential interior-design site Apartment Therapy. \u201cThey have great designers, infrastructure, product variety. They\u2019re very hard to compete with.\u201d Ikea furniture also packs into boxes \u2014 the industry term is \u201cK.D.,\u201d or \u201cknock down\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s based on a very different value proposition from Burrow\u2019s. By turning its stores into theme parks and fitting the warehouse right inside, Ikea bet that it could get customers to tote purchases all the way home by themselves. The pain points of couch shopping are still there, but so are the pleasures of dining out and free child care. Burrow\u2019s experience, on the other hand, is online and low-friction.Burrow isn\u2019t the only company that sees an opening here. \u201cTwenty-four-to-33-year-old career-driven, upwardly mobile people\u201d is how John Humphrey \u2014 a founder and chief executive of the furniture company Greycork \u2014 describes his customers. \u201cThey tend to be in the tech and design fields.\u201d With a Greycork living-room set, you can take a space from zero to furnished in five to 10 days, with free shipping. If a consumer\u2019s main complaint with Ikea furniture is the Allen wrenches, the trip to the store or just the fact that it\u2019s identifiably Ikea, Greycork could be a good alternative.\u201cThe way Ikea is based around the shipping container, we\u2019re based around FedEx,\u201d says Brad Sewell, the founder of the furniture maker Campaign. The ex-Apple engineer\u2019s company sells a chair, a love seat and a sofa \u2014 all the same design in varying widths. Based on the online view, they are not especially distinguishable from the Ikea Norsborg line and are a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. This next generation of couches uses web copy that\u2019s heavy in compound adjectives (\u201claser-cut, powder-coated steel frames\u201d) to project a premium feel onto goods that most buyers can\u2019t touch for themselves. The fact that the furniture folds is more than a logistical accommodation; it\u2019s a key feature.Kyle Hoff is a founder of Floyd, a furniture start-up that ships metal legs \u2014 they adjust to turn any flat surface into a desk or a table \u2014 alongside adjustable shelf brackets and frameworks for platform beds. The initial concept was \u201cjust add boards\u201d; Floyd products bind them into functional furniture. \u201cI wanted to make furniture for people like me,\u201d Hoff says. \u201cI was in my early 20s, moving from city to city, and I needed things that could move with me.\u201d Though Floyd is based in Detroit, Hoff says most of his customers are young professionals in New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. And maybe in is the wrong way to think of it; Floyd customers exist between these (and a few other) metropolitan areas. All the furniture is designed to move as part of a roving lifestyle.If a company can get to market first and establish itself as the singular way to buy a particular necessity online, it can clean up \u2014 even if it\u2019s appealing to a relatively small millennial luxury market. Most of the founders I spoke with mentioned Casper as an inspiration, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The venture-funded company was an overnight success in 2014 selling foam mattresses online and delivering them compressed into manageable boxes. Last year the company was valued at over half a billion dollars. It stands out even among Silicon Valley fairy tales, which makes \u201cCasper for couches\u201d a self-explanatory business pitch.The best thing about this whole product category is that it might represent a step away from Ikea\u2019s disposability without going all the way back to Grandma\u2019s antique sofa. If consumers are already thinking about moving, portability is at least as big an obstacle to maintaining furniture as mediocre craftsmanship and cheap materials. These companies want to make a couch that will last for 10 or 20 years, even if the buyers have no idea where they\u2019ll be or what they\u2019ll be doing that far down the line. Buying a piece of furniture that you will realistically hold onto longer is a kind of forward-thinking thrift.But this new approach also hints at something more sinister, more bad-future. Different furniture suggests different ways of being in the world: A heavy table says one thing, and a mattress on the floor beside a folding chair says another. Campaign takes its name from the furnishings that British colonial functionaries would take on assignments, ready to pack up if recalled by the Crown. It\u2019s an apt fit with one version of upwardly mobile millennial living, which involves reducing all \u201cpersonal\u201d needs to an efficient minimum. It\u2019s a style beloved by Silicon Valley \u2014 which finances accessories like the liquid food replacement Soylent \u2014 and exemplified by the Google engineer who blogged about the time he spent living in a small truck near the office.This Silicon Valley lifestyle and the Silicon Valley business model are caught in a chicken-and-egg dialectic. Each holds that whatever work can be automated, eliminated or subcontracted to others should be, thus leaving all our valuable code ninjas and management rock stars free to do more work, pursue expensive enriching experiences and watch Netflix. This is the luxury that some of the valley\u2019s most successful products are offering; there are now niche online services for doing your laundry, chopping your food, driving you around and delivering your toilet paper. The entire app-services economy can serve as a dispersed and techno-mystified mother, a caretaker who dotes on the implied bachelor user.The various furniture founders \u2014 Burrow\u2019s, Greycork\u2019s, Campaign\u2019s, Floyd\u2019s \u2014 experienced the same series of pain points when it came to couch ownership. All are city-dwelling men with at least some postgraduate education; four of them are 29, the fifth is 28. It\u2019s not surprising that they should encounter similar hassles or, because most attended business school, think of comparable entrepreneurial solutions. But given that investors and customers have encouraged them, it\u2019s worth asking exactly what kind of pain they plan to remove from our world.Maxwell Ryan, of Apartment Therapy, is not optimistic about the prospects of companies like Burrow. \u201cThere\u2019s this Silicon Valley mind-set where they solve a problem and so they think they\u2019re going to make a million dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cBut just because it\u2019s a problem for them doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem for everyone. I haven\u2019t seen that kind of thinking translate over well to the design space.\u201d Nor is he particularly impressed with the plain, one-size-fits-all style they tend to adopt (\u201cit\u2019s ugly\u201d). Ryan says customers want a good narrative to go with their furniture, like Crate and Barrel\u2019s origin story of a young couple\u2019s return from their honeymoon abroad with boxes of cheap imported fineries.But not everyone cares that much about expressing individual style, and Ryan could be underestimating how popular it is these days to stay inside and not talk to anyone. In our emerging economic order, the exertion of emotional energy is a kind of pain \u2014 a red entry in the accounting book of our lives \u2014 and there are new services every day to help us avoid it. Soon it will be possible to build and maintain a complete household full of goods without having to look anyone else in the eye.When my roommate and I moved to Philadelphia this year, we left our giant vintage couch in our fourth-floor Brooklyn walk-up. It was a nice piece of furniture \u2014 solid and soft, in light green floral \u2014 and we were sad to lose it. After we moved into our new place, my brother, who lives nearby, showed us to a neighborhood secondhand store called Jinxed. Inside we found a couch that looked shockingly like our old one. A little smaller, in better condition and orange instead of green, but remarkably similar. It\u2019s not what I would have picked online, but the coincidence was too striking to ignore.From a certain perspective, this was all suffering, insofar as it would have been easier not to do it. I\u2019m not unsympathetic; I\u2019m in the target demographic for a product like Burrow. I am a person who has bought flour on Amazon. But risk and hassle and pain are big parts of interacting with other people on terms that aren\u2019t yours alone. There\u2019s value in having to sustain a mind-set that accounts for other humans and their interests and needs, a value to always remembering that there are people between the apps and our fulfilled desires. If there exists a market incentive to smooth every friction a young businessman can think of \u2014 even something as mundane, low-tech and intrinsically social as a couch \u2014 we risk a very slippery world. \u2666Malcolm Harris is a freelance writer in Philadelphia.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lauren Graham\u2019s Taste of Tokyo", "Date": "2016-11-22", "News": "Supported byNight OutCradling a brown paper bag filled with sake bottles in her arms, a dismayed Lauren Graham stopped short in front of Yakitori Tora, a Japanese restaurant in SoHo. The windows were dark, the tables were empty and the chairs nowhere to be seen.Unfortunately, her plans to share the culture she loves were thwarted on this October evening. Even the coolest mom on television, who returns Friday with four 90-minute episodes on Netflix, can do little when confronted with a locked door.Other than make you laugh.\u201cLet me tell you of my love of Mexico,\u201d Ms. Graham deadpanned.\u201cIt was pretty overwhelming,\u201d she said. She stuck it out for a year, but decided to transfer to Barnard College to study English, after which she received a Master of Fine Arts at Southern Methodist University in 1992. But her big break didn\u2019t come for several more years, when she was cast in \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d in 2000.Ms. Graham recalled the moment in the 1970s when she knew she wanted to act. \u201cMy dad and I went to see \u2018Annie\u2019 at the Kennedy Center, and I got an \u2018Annie\u2019 T-shirt,\u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cSomebody asked me in a store one day if I was in the cast of \u2018Annie,\u2019 and I said yes, because I so wanted to be in the cast of \u2018Annie.\u2019 So my first role was \u2018person who was in the cast of \u201cAnnie.\u201d\u2019 I think I played it pretty well.\u201dAt Japonica, Ms. Graham plopped into a booth next to Ms. Grant, 34. Assessing their outfits for the evening \u2014 both wore black blazers over T-shirts \u2014 Ms. Graham said, \u201cI\u2019d say we kind of dress like our mom.\u201d\u201cShe was a painter, a singer, she was a model, she went to art school, she was interested in writing,\u201d Ms. Graham said of her mother.After scanning the menu, Ms. Graham quickly chose a brand of sake. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most expensive one,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it has gold flakes.\u201dThe moment called to mind the witty Lorelai, a character Ms. Graham had not played in a decade.\u201cWhen we did the first table read, there was so much energy in the room, and I was so nervous,\u201d she said.In the time since she first embodied the fast-talking single mom, the CW replaced the WB, Netflix became an alternative to cable channels and iPhones turned into a common accessory. That last fact is not lost on Ms. Graham, who has a technology-averse alter ego named Old Lady Jackson, who disapproves of televisions in yellow taxis and phones in schools.\u201cIn today\u2019s camera-phone world, you\u2019re eating, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Mmm, I can\u2019t wait to \u2026 ,\u2019\u201d Ms. Graham said, pretending to drift off in a food-induced reverie. \u201cAnd somewhere over there, someone is taking a picture of you to put on their whatever page,\u201d she said.Luckily, that did not stop her. The sisters ate plenty, swapping items and bantering. (\u201cLet me just taste some,\u201d Ms. Grant said of a salmon sashimi, to which Ms. Graham responded, \u201cYou can\u2019t just try a bite of sushi. It doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d and dropped the entire piece on her plate.)At the end of the meal, Ms. Graham and Ms. Grant waved goodbye to their dinner companions and fell back into easy conversation. The half-finished bottle of sake glittered between them as Ms. Graham dived into what might be her favorite role: cool older sister.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "FilmStruck Streaming Service Places a Big Bet on Cinephiles", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWhile the cable industry wonders how many of us will be willing to cut the cord and do without a traditional television package, its online rivals have moved on to a more timely question: How many cords \u2014 albeit invisible, cheaper cords \u2014 will we be willing to pay for at once?Jennifer Dorian, general manager of Turner Classic Movies, which developed the site in partnership with the Criterion Collection, said internal research showed that the people most likely to pay for FilmStruck\u2019s offerings of independent and art-house movies were paying for cable TV and another streaming service. \u201cThey\u2019re already very involved in entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s their hobby, and they don\u2019t mind spending money.\u201dBut even with the backing of two heavyweights, the Turner cable channel and the home entertainment company Criterion, both beloved by film buffs, FilmStruck is entering a niche-streaming field that\u2019s already very crowded. Movie sites like Fandor, Mubi, Tribeca Shortlist and SundanceNow already cover much of the same non-Hollywood ground as FilmStruck. And myriad other sites \u2014 focusing on Asian soap operas, animation, Bollywood films, horror, documentaries \u2014 are going after the same discretionary dollars.FilmStruck has one big advantage \u2014 the connection to Criterion, by far the most prestigious name in DVD and Blu-ray distribution, and its 1,500-film catalog of art-house classics. (Criterion films, available on Hulu for the last five years, will be streamed exclusively on FilmStruck, beginning later this month.) The site\u2019s two-tiered pricing reflects the importance of that connection: A FilmStruck subscription is $6.99 a month, but full access to the Criterion Channel within FilmStruck costs $10.99. (An annual subscription to both is $99.)For $6.99, you get some access to Criterion content: About 200 of its films will be part of the general FilmStruck roster of about 500 titles at any given time, according to Charlie Tabesh, senior vice president for programming at FilmStruck and Turner Classic.In the site\u2019s initial incarnation, the Criterion offerings are heavily front-loaded. The most prominent display is a set of thematic clusters \u2014 political documentaries, movies starring Marcello Mastroianni, films that had been banned in the United States \u2014 and about 80 percent of the selections in those groupings are from Criterion.\u201cI think the movies are a solid piece of it,\u201d said Jonathan Turell, chief executive of the Criterion Collection. \u201cBut I think the way they are presented is what we\u2019re spending a lot of time with.\u201d He said that, beginning with the Coen brothers\u2019 \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d the site would present \u201centire editions\u201d of films, with all of the extras \u2014 commentaries, interviews, documentaries \u2014 that were part of the original Criterion DVD package.\u201cIt appears Turner and Criterion are targeting and planning to super-serve the cinephile,\u201d Mr. Aidem said, adding, \u201cTo super-serve the indie-film fanatic is forgoing a ton of people out there.\u201dIf enough cinephiles are willing to spend $99 a year (which, even when combined with Netflix or Hulu, is significantly less than a cable subscription), then it won\u2019t matter how many viewers FilmStruck forgoes. Not all of its movies are hard to find or all that interesting \u2014 \u201cMadonna: Truth or Dare\u201d or a group of 28 Charlie Chaplin films don\u2019t set the heart racing \u2014 but its elegant interface and the Criterion catalog give it a big head start in the battle to be the second buy.Here are five subscription streaming sites that compete with FilmStruck. The first four offer similar mixes of independent, foreign, cult and documentary films, with Tribeca Shortlist putting more emphasis on mainstream hits. The fifth, Warner Archive Instant, focuses on Hollywood classics. Many of the sites offer free trials and discounts, and all are available on some combination of services like Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast, smart TVs and mobile apps.Fandor$10 a month, $90 a yearMubi$5.99 a monthThe gimmick is that only 30 films are available at a time, for 30 days each, with one film added a day.SundanceNowBest known for nonfiction.Tribeca Shortlist$4.99 a month with Amazon PrimeWarner Archive Instant$9.99 a month, $94.99 a yearThe place for old-Hollywood fare.A Critic\u2019s Notebook article on Wednesday about FilmStruck, a new movie-streaming site, misspelled the surname of the chief executive of the Criterion Collection, a partner in the venture.

Mr. Dassey, who was charged with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse and first-degree sexual assault, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.It was not immediately clear when Mr. Dassey would be released, but the ruling by Judge Duffin concluded that he posed little flight risk or danger to others.

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.How did you approach your next big role after a blockbuster like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d?I wasn\u2019t out to do something outrageously different \u201cjust because.\u201d I read the script and was hooked, couldn\u2019t put it down, completely fell in love with the character and the story.Did you worry about being typecast? It didn\u2019t happen, it seems, so I didn\u2019t have to worry. [Laughs.] I think it\u2019s the opposite, actually. You just can\u2019t get away from the fact that we were those characters in \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d So a modern part makes more sense. Otherwise it\u2019s like Lady Mary in another period drama.Letty seems to be less a hostage than a willing participant on a thrill ride.Letty enjoys the reckless sense of danger that her life often involves. But it\u2019s more than that. With Javier, they sort of smash into one another and discover an understanding in that they\u2019re both loners. They live on the outskirts of society and find it difficult to live a normal life. There\u2019s a chemistry that they haven\u2019t seen in anyone else. And now that they\u2019ve found each other, they really can\u2019t be apart.Lady Mary was a clothes horse but Letty is a master of disguise.Letty\u2019s disguises are really her way of escaping through the masks of these women she puts on. It often starts with a wig, and each one has its own personality.You\u2019ve said that characters who are not necessarily likable are the most fun to play.Like with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d \u2014 or even Lady Mary, particularly in the last [season] \u2014 they\u2019re characters that you go through phases with. You\u2019re rooting for them but you don\u2019t always approve of their behavior. Yet you understand their predicament. It\u2019s about playing a character that is more than just one thing, as we all are. And we\u2019re seeing more and more female roles that are multifaceted, with vulnerability, humor.There will be inevitable comparisons between Lady Mary and the more wanton Letty.I welcome those comparisons. Those \u201cDownton\u201d characters are in people\u2019s hearts, and I\u2019m very grateful for that. And I think some people will be shocked by Letty and that\u2019s O.K. [Laughs].People might be shocked most by your American accent. It\u2019s been a real challenge with the accent. It\u2019s something that I had to get really in my bones before I played the part because I didn\u2019t want to worry while I was doing it. I was wary of spending too much time on the phone with British friends in case it would slip too much.So have you moved to the States? My base is still in London, and I\u2019m looking forward to getting back home for Christmas. I just happen to have been working here the majority of this year. After \u201cGood Behavior,\u201d I went to New Mexico, where I\u2019m finishing up [the Netflix series] \u201cGodless.\u201d It\u2019s set in 1884 and the story centers around a menacing outlaw who is terrorizing the West as he hunts down his partner turned mortal enemy.I hear that you got your driver\u2019s license recently.I was quite a stubborn teenager and all my friends and sisters were doing their driving tests at 16, and I just didn\u2019t want to do what everyone else was doing. And up until now it was my only regret. I then had to learn because Letty drives. So at 34 years old, I\u2019ve finally passed my driving test.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Crisis for Liberalism", "Date": "2016-11-19", "News": "Supported byTHE 2016 campaign was a crisis for conservatism; its aftermath is a crisis for liberalism. The right, delivered unexpectedly to power, is taking a breather from introspection as it waits to see what Trumpism means in practice. The left, delivered unexpectedly to impotence, has no choice but to start arguing about how it lost its way.A lot of that argument already revolves around the concept of \u201cidentity politics,\u201d used as shorthand for a vision of political liberalism as a coalition of diverse groups \u2014 gay and black and Asian and Hispanic and female and Jewish and Muslim and so on \u2014 bound together by a common struggle against the creaking hegemony of white Christian America.This vision had an intuitive appeal in the Obama era, when it won the White House twice and seemed to promise permanent political majorities in the future. And the 2016 campaign was supposed to cement that promise, since it pitted liberalism\u2019s coalition of the diverse against Donald Trump\u2019s explicitly reactive vision.But instead 2016 exposed liberalism\u2019s twofold vulnerability: to white voters embracing an identity politics of their own, and to women and minorities fearing Trump less than most liberals expected, and not voting monolithically for Hillary.Both of these critiques make reasonable points. But I\u2019m not sure they fully grasp the pull of an identitarian politics, the energy that has elevated it above class-based and procedural visions of liberalism.It\u2019s true that identity politics is often illiberal, both in its emphasis on group experience over individualism and, in the web of moral absolutes \u2014 taboo words, sacred speakers, forbidden arguments \u2014 that it seeks to weave around left-liberal discourse. It\u2019s also true that it privileges the metaphysical over the material, recognition over redistribution.But liberal societies have always depended on an illiberal or pre-liberal substructure to answer the varied human needs \u2014 meaning, belonging, a vertical dimension to human life, a hope against mortality \u2014 that neither John Stuart Mill nor Karl Marx adequately addressed.In American history, that substructure took various forms: The bonds of family life, the power of (usually Protestant) religion, a flag-waving patriotism, and an Anglo-Saxon culture to which immigrants were expected to assimilate.Each of these foundations often manifested illiberalism\u2019s evils: religious intolerance, racism and chauvinism, the oppressions of private and domestic power. But they also provided the moral, cultural and metaphysical common ground that political reformers \u2014 abolitionists, Social Gospellers, New Dealers, civil rights marchers \u2014 relied upon to expand liberalism\u2019s promise.Much of post-1960s liberal politics, by contrast, has been an experiment in cutting Western societies loose from those foundations, set to the tune of John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine.\u201d No heaven or religion, no countries or borders or parochial loyalties of any kind \u2014 these are often the values of the center-left and the far left alike, of neoliberals hoping to manage global capitalism and neo-Marxists hoping to transcend it.Unfortunately the values of \u201cImagine\u201d are simply not sufficient to the needs of human life. People have a desire for solidarity that cosmopolitanism does not satisfy, immaterial interests that redistribution cannot meet, a yearning for the sacred that secularism cannot answer.Thus it may not be enough for today\u2019s liberalism, confronting both a right-wing nationalism and its own internal contradictions, to deal with identity politics\u2019 political weaknesses by becoming more populist and less politically correct. Both of these would be desirable changes, but they would leave many human needs unmet. For those, a deeper vision than mere liberalism is still required \u2014 something like \u201cfor God and home and country,\u201d as reactionary as that phrase may sound.Maureen Dowd is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019 and the Rapid-Fire Repartee, Is Returning", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byBURBANK, Calif. \u2014 The Warner Bros. back lot has lent its sets and streets to some of the most storied musicals in Hollywood history: \u201c42nd Street,\u201d \u201cThe Music Man,\u201d \u201cBye Bye Birdie.\u201dThe entire, sprawling cast \u2014 including its stars, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, and supporting actors who\u2019ve gone on to fame elsewhere, like Melissa McCarthy and Milo Ventimiglia (\u201cThis Is Us\u201d) \u2014 has returned. So has the show\u2019s fizzy cocktail of rapid-fire repartee, pop culture savvy and heartfelt drama about mothers and daughters and relationships.But the creators used this second chance to amp up the storytelling complexity. Which explains the faux musical. Both theater obsessives, Ms. Sherman-Palladino and Mr. Palladino roped in the Tony Award winners Sutton Foster and Christian Borle to appear as regional theater actors, and convinced Jeanine Tesori, the composer of \u201cFun Home\u201d and \u201cViolet,\u201d to write four songs for it.\u201cIf we weren\u2019t going to do that \u2014 to go bigger \u2014 we didn\u2019t really see the point,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just want to come back and do a bunch more \u2018Gilmore\u2019 episodes.\u201dOn the surface, the series Ms. Sherman-Palladino pitched back in 1999 would seem to be your basic sentimental family drama. The free-spirit Lorelai Gilmore (Ms. Graham) flees her disapproving family in haughty Hartford at the age of 16, after giving birth to a daughter, Rory (Ms. Bledel). She remakes her life in Stars Hollow, the kind of small town that is filled with quirky, borderline insufferable characters who all know your business. And mother and daughter are best friends, in stark contrast to Lorelai\u2019s fraught relationship with her mother, Emily (Kelly Bishop).But that description doesn\u2019t do justice to a stealthily ambitious show in which Madeleine Albright shows up in Rory\u2019s dreams; Lorelai names her dog Paul Anka; marathon \u201cCop Rock\u201d viewing parties take place; and dialogue is packed with cultural references, both high and low. (Few shows could pair Nietzsche with \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d)And the witty banter does speed by. The scripts for most 42-minute TV episodes come in at a page a minute; \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d scripts ranged between 75 and 80 pages.Underneath the whimsy and the banter, however, lies a sophistication in the treatment of relationships, both familial and romantic, which helped attract an intensely loyal audience. (During its best seasons, the show averaged more than 5 million viewers.)But after six seasons, Ms. Sherman-Palladino and Mr. Palladino abruptly departed the show. A decade on, the couple and studio executives at Warner Bros. Television still sound bewildered that an expired contract led to the rupture.\u201cWe were just getting old and tired,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said, explaining that she and Mr. Palladino were looking for production help so they wouldn\u2019t have to shoulder the same punishing workload. \u201cAnd a little more help turns into a little bit more money. It just got to a certain place where the way we wanted the show to run going forward was not necessarily the way they wanted the show to run going forward. And then the contract just ended. And then they take your parking spot away from you.\u201dThe news didn\u2019t sit too well with the cast.Even though many of the writers had long worked on the show, something felt off. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t sound the same,\u201d Ms. Graham said. She reached for a pop-cultural reference of her own to elaborate, saying that Van Halen was different once David Lee Roth left the band.\u201cI remember being in a scene one day and having a physical feeling that something was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in a scene with two other people and for three pages I didn\u2019t say anything. And I said, \u2018This is just weird. All I do is talk on this show.\u2019\u201dFans noticed, and the WB canceled the show after the seventh season.At first, Ms. Sherman-Palladino and Mr. Palladino had no desire to revisit Stars Hollow. They had moved on to other projects like \u201cBunheads\u201d (on which Ms. Foster starred) and \u201cThe Return of Jezebel James.\u201d But they increasingly encountered a whole new generation of viewers who had discovered the show in reruns, on DVD and then on Netflix, clamoring for a revival.A changing entertainment landscape also gave them an avenue to resurrect the characters but not get bogged down by a full-blown series. The very short seasons and 90-minute running time of the British series \u201cSherlock\u201d enticed.\u201cWe always found ourselves wishing for more space on \u2018Gilmore\u2019 to do the offbeat things or the diversionary side stories,\u201d Mr. Palladino said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first stuff to get cut when you have a 42-minute format. It was a wonderful sense of freedom to really just tell a story.\u201d\u201cIt seemed dramatically to demand something more filmic and less episodic,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said. \u201cBecause it was a little bigger than the things we were trying to tackle on a week-to-week basis.\u201dAnd four, 90-minute chapters, each one pegged to a season, seemed appropriate for a series that showcased the seasons.Despite the professional divorce from Warner Bros. Television, reconciliation came quickly. Peter Roth, president and chief content officer of Warner Bros. Television Group, who bought the original series pitch back in 1999, jumped at the reboot.\u201cThe story had not been finished, not in a way that anybody was satisfied with,\u201d he said.The mini-series was shopped around, and Netflix \u2014 already showing the series, and armed with data demonstrating its appeal across generations \u2014 licensed the specials. It also fit nicely within Netflix\u2019s budding field of reprising older shows, like \u201cFuller House\u201d and \u201cArrested Development.\u201d\u201cWhen you have the original creative team, proactively offering they have a desire to continue telling the story, those are already great ingredients for us,\u201d said Cindy Holland, vice president of original content at Netflix.Ms. Sherman-Palladino had more prosaic reasons for agreeing to the Netflix deal.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to sell soap,\u201d she said. \u201dWe don\u2019t have to stop for the tampon commercials.\u201d\u201cThough I must say that \u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019 in its original run, sold a lot,\u201d Mr. Palladino chimed in.With the bigger budgets, the two could do more location shoots and elaborate setups.And, of course, they could put together a musical.\u201cWe have tap dancing and kick lines,\u201d said Ms. Sherman-Palladino, enthused during a break in filming on that March day.The couple had become friends with Ms. Tesori while serving as producers of the Broadway run of \u201cViolet,\u201d and convinced her to put music to their own lyrics. Stretching over the long history of Stars Hollow allowed them to play with all sorts of genres (There\u2019s a \u201cHamilton\u201d-inspired rap song.)Ms. Foster, who also starred in \u201cViolet,\u201d signed up, and Mr. Borle (\u201cSomething Rotten!,\u201d \u201cFalsettos\u201d) was dragooned into joining his ex-wife, Ms. Foster.\u201cI\u2019m writing him Jewish guilt letters,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino joked. \u201cLook, you\u2019ll break my heart. It\u2019s O.K., if you don\u2019t mind the thought of me hanging from a shower curtain.\u201dHe signed up.Ms. Sherman-Palladino didn\u2019t have to do the hard sell on the rest of the cast.\u201cFrankly, I was badgering Amy for most of those years to do a movie,\u201d Ms. Bishop said.Scheduling, though, was a nightmare. The deal between Warner Bros. Television and Netflix took a while to finalize, and that meant a scramble to line up dozens of cast members and film during the brief window the studio back lot was available. The timing was so tight that Ms. Graham read the scripts just a day before the first table read.\u201cThere\u2019s just been a feeling of right place, right time, right moment,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Palladino said.When Ms. Sherman-Palladino pitched \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d in 1999, she \u2014 unlike many television show creators \u2014 actually knew the endgame. Down to the final four words a character would speak.On Nov. 25, the world will learn which words she\u2019s been planning all along.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article reversed the identities of two actresses.

As in the biggest.Shortly thereafter, the episodes \u2014 edited to include additional scenes \u2014 will run on ABC, with new installments unspooling in typical prime-time fashion. (The look of the series on TV will be enhanced due to Imax technology.)The series, billed as a family action-adventure with signature Marvel humor, will be set in the present day, with some action seeming to take place on the moon.The deal is significant for several reasons.As their live audiences have dwindled and competition has increased, broadcast networks have struggled to create sizzle around new shows. ABC, which urgently needs new hits, is betting that Imax, with its strength among younger consumers known as fanboys, will help make \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d a must-see event.\u201cIn the incredibly crowded marketplace of television, we are very excited about this because it\u2019s a unique and innovative and bold way to debut our best new content,\u201d Ben Sherwood, president of Disney-ABC Television Group, said by phone.ABC wants what Marvel Television and ABC Studios have supplied to Netflix \u2014 buzz-creating, widely watched series like \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and \u201cDaredevil.\u201dA co-financing arrangement with Imax will allow ABC and Marvel to spend more to make \u201cThe Inhumans,\u201d which will include cinema-quality visual effects.

Gelfond, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cWe think this is a business for us,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said of the financing arrangement. \u201cBecause Imax has an equity participation both in the pilot and in the series, this deal will be financially advantageous to Imax on an ongoing basis.\u201dImax has dabbled in the past at showing TV content on its supersize screens.

{"Headline": "At the Los Angeles Auto Show, an Industry Ponders Its Digital Future", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byWheelsLOS ANGELES \u2014 For decades, the car business has been about style, performance, image and fuel efficiency. But suddenly, the industry is in a technological and sociological upheaval that may force automobiles \u2014 and the companies that make them \u2014 to change more in the next five years than they have in the last 50.That was evident in this week\u2019s AutoMobility LA conference, an event held by the organizers of the Los Angeles Auto Show, which will continue over the next two weeks.AutoMobility is an apt name, because much of the innovation seems to involve making the car ever more like a giant smartphone on wheels. But social mobility is a factor, too, as carmakers confront the surging popularity of ride-hailing services, which means fewer people see a need to own a car, while the push toward autonomous vehicles portends a time when many cars will not need people to drive them.Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon that would enable the South Korean automaker\u2019s cars to be remotely started, and the heater or air-conditioner to be turned on, by speaking to an Amazon Echo device inside the home. It was only the latest in a series of car-related apps that Amazon has introduced through Echo and the Alexa personal assistant. Other apps include one that enables Alexa to hail Uber rides.Uber, of course, and other ride-hailing services like Lyft, are potentially big disrupters of the automakers\u2019 conventional business model of selling cars to individual consumers. And new variants are coming along, including See Jane Go, which had a booth at the conference. The company addresses a concern of many women by recruiting only female drivers and accepting only female passengers.Mark F. Fields, Ford Motor\u2019s chief executive, spoke here of the opportunities he saw in selling vehicles to the ride-sharing industry, including, eventually, ones that would drive themselves. But optimism requires the car industry to reimagine itself. Instead of the worldwide automobile industry thinking of itself as the $2.3 trillion business it is now, Mr. Fields said, it should see itself as part of the much bigger global transportation industry.BMW has its own car-sharing venture, ReachNow, which operates in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and will soon be in Brooklyn. It allows members to drive a BMW or Mini vehicle for 41 cents a minute of operation.ReachNow\u2019s chief executive, Steve Banfield, in an interview here, compared the concept to Netflix, the video service that has helped render ownership of DVDs superfluous. That might seem like a threat to BMW\u2019s business of selling cars, but Mr. Banfield described it as more of a get-acquainted marketing approach.Some ReachNow members sign up simply for extended test drives of BMW cars like the electric i3, Mr. Banfield said. And younger members who cannot afford a vehicle early in their careers can become familiar with BMW\u2019s products, making them more likely to become buyers once their salaries catch up with their tastes, he said.For people who do own cars but who would not mind some help paying for them, there are mobile-app services like Turo, which enable car owners to rent out their cars. By renting their vehicles for nine days each month, owners could probably cover their entire car payments and maybe even turn a profit, David Stewart, Turo\u2019s chief business officer, said in a presentation here.Turo is good news for automakers, Mr. Stewart said, because it might help someone wary of owning a vehicle to afford to buy one, or to move up to a more luxurious model as the rental income made it affordable.But the question of who does or does not own a car now might one day seem a quaint distinction when cars start driving themselves. And when that time comes, the companies with the biggest identity crises may be ones like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that have persuaded the public to spend big money on the thrill of taking the wheel.Detlev von Platen, executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, views it as an evolution.\u201cOur cars will always be about the driving experience because that\u2019s what we sell \u2014 experiences,\u201d Mr. von Platen said. \u201cBut we must provide options for our owners, and self-driving technologies that can be activated when desired must be considered.\u201dAnd a self-driving Porsche might be more than a robotic tram. Imagine experiencing the throttle, braking and steering inputs of a professional driver on a racetrack. That could be programmed into the car, said Oliver Blume, Porsche\u2019s chief executive.Porsche might also experiment with new types of sales or leasing options to cultivate loyalty. Mr. von Platen said the company might consider a \u201cflex lease,\u201d under which someone leasing a two-seat 718 Cayman would gain access to a Cayenne S.U.V. for seven days a year, which could be handy for when five seats are needed.The other big technology topic was electric vehicles, which all carmakers have been pursuing as a way to address concerns about the climate, as well as government-mandated rules and targets for lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency.Jaguar announced its I-Pace all-electric S.U.V., a concept car that the company said would be available in 2018.And yet the election of Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic who is widely expected to scale back automotive emission and fuel-efficiency regulations, could alter the industry\u2019s planning for environmentally friendlier cars. The possible relaxation of those regulations was an undercurrent here.And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, recently wrote to the Trump transition team urging a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d to the industry.Mr. Blume of Porsche said his company would stay on its current technology track, even if fuel-economy and emissions standards were relaxed.\u201cWhen we think of new technology, we don\u2019t concern ourselves with political changes,\u201d Mr. Blume said. \u201cWe think electrification is a technology of the future, and we have a responsibility to the environment.\u201dThat debate simply reinforces a characteristic that was fully apparent at AutoMobility LA: The automotive business is not just about moving vehicles; it\u2019s about moving targets.An article on the Automobiles page on Friday 18 about the heavy technology focus of the Los Angeles Auto Show misstated the name of the personal assistant in the Amazon Echo. It is Alexa, not Alexis. The article also gave an incorrect title for Detlev von Platen, who commented on autonomous driving technology. He is executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, not president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Fretting Over the \u2018Netflix Tax\u2019", "Date": "2016-11-28", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Dozens of California cities looking to shore up revenues are flirting with a new idea \u2014 tax your \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d binge.At 9.4 percent, the so-called Netflix tax would treat streaming services as a traditional utility, the city said. If you use multiple services \u2014 for example, Hulu, Amazon Video and HBO \u2014 it would be added to each bill.The move in Pasadena, with a population of about 140,000, has drawn consternation from technology companies and consumers who worry that it could be copied across the state.\u201cWebsites and apps are not utilities and it defies logic to tax them like electricity, water or gas,\u201d said Noah Theran, spokesman for the Internet Association, a trade group.Public officials have argued that taxation rules need to be revised to account for changing technologies. It is unfair, some say, that people who get video through cable television are taxed while those who have shifted over to internet streaming services are not.One question officials would need to resolve is where to stop, analysts say. If streaming video is taxable, then what about music, podcasts or video games?\u201cIt opens a big Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research company.Mr. Verna said many of the streaming video tax proposals in California have bubbled up under the radar. If there is to be a larger debate, it will erupt when people start seeing their bills, he said.For now, the proposed tax is \u201cunder internal review,\u201d William Boyer, a Pasadena city spokesman, said in an email.Tyron Hampton, a council member who has opposed the tax, said that with the city\u2019s underfunded pensions, officials were right to be looking for novel ways to raise money.But the web should be off limits, he said: \u201cThe basic tenet of the internet is that the internet is supposed to be free.\u201dInterest in secession got a boost in California this month after the victory of Donald J. Trump.But another sort of rebellion occurred in Northern California long before Election Day.It was this week in 1941 that a group of miners halted traffic along Route 99 in Siskiyou County and handed out proclamations to motorists declaring the formation of Jefferson, a new state named after the author of the Declaration of Independence.With Yreka as its capital, Jefferson would include parts of both Oregon and California where resentments had simmered over the supposed neglect of politicians in the capitals of Salem and Sacramento.\u201cBonfires blazed along the main north-south highway winding through the towering Siskiyous tonight as determined mining men, with pistols in their belts, stopped motorists and distributed yellow handbills proclaiming \u2018independence\u2019 of a group of Oregon and California counties.\u201dThe agitators complained that the region was deprived of proper roads needed to transport their copper ore and timber. They vowed to barricade the highway every Thursday until their demands were met.But the uprising was to be short-lived.Five days after that, Pearl Harbor was attacked. And the mood for rebellion was eclipsed by the war effort.Now, more than seven decades later, the movement for a state of Jefferson remains a hot issue in Northern California. In 2013, the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a declaration that called for breaking away from the state.The complaints echo those of the miners in the 1940s: chiefly, a perceived lack of representation in Sacramento.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Loss Haunts A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s First Album in 18 Years", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Recorded just before the death of Phife Dawg in March, \u201cWe Got It From Here, Thank You For Your Service\u201d is heavy with his presence.Supported byENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. \u2014 On March 22, at 3 a.m., Q-Tip and Phife Dawg were on the phone. The two rappers \u2014 lifelong friends from Queens and half of the influential hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest \u2014 were \u201cyucking it up,\u201d Q-Tip recalled, and talking about a project few people outside their inner circle knew was in the works: a new Tribe album, the first in 18 years.Q-Tip was in the million-dollar recording studio he built in the basement of his stately New Jersey home; Phife was at his place in the San Francisco Bay Area.The cause was complications from diabetes; Phife was 45. The other members of A Tribe Called Quest were shattered. The rapper Jarobi White was at Q-Tip\u2019s house and heard people screaming. \u201cWe broke down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were two puddles of goo on the floor.\u201d The producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad was in Sherman Oaks, Calif., walking out of an Apple store with a replacement iPhone when the call came in. \u201cI was in shock,\u201d he said. Without any of his contacts, he stood paralyzed, unable to reach out to anyone.\u201cI had no idea that his days was numbered,\u201d Q-Tip said. Retelling this story in the same room where he had had so many conversations with Phife, he became too emotional to speak. He buried his face in his hands and sobbed. Finally he said, \u201cI just want to celebrate him, you know?\u201dOn Friday, Nov. 11, A Tribe Called Quest will do just that, releasing on Epic Records \u201cWe Got It From Here, Thank You for Your Service,\u201d the group\u2019s sixth album. It features all four of the group\u2019s members plus a host of guests \u2014 Andr\u00e9 3000, Kendrick Lamar, Elton John, Jack White and Busta Rhymes, a longtime Tribe collaborator who made a heralded appearance on the 1992 posse cut \u201cScenario.\u201d Busta Rhymes said he saw Q-Tip and Phife in the studio vibing the way they did in the old days. \u201cI seen them laughing and joking and high-fiving, and you can just see that young, invigorated \u2018we\u2019re-just-getting-our-first-opportunity-to-do-this\u2019 energy again!\u201d he said. Q-Tip noted, \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen Phife that happy since we were kids.\u201dThree of Tribe\u2019s five albums went platinum, and the other two went gold, but the group\u2019s influence extended far beyond sales figures. As part of the Native Tongues movement, which also included De La Soul, they were into Afrocentrism and positivity and showed a generation how to make music that was both fun and substantive. \u201cTip\u2019s kind of like the father of all of us, like me, Kanye, Pharrell,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid, it\u2019s kind of like, O.K., who am I going to be? Can I be Eazy-E? Nah. But Q-Tip? Yeah. He seems more like a common kind of person.\u201dEven still, Phife repeatedly asked about doing another group album; Q-Tip would respond, \u201cNot now.\u201d He was on a self-imposed sabbatical. \u201cI wanted to rethink my life as an artist and as a man,\u201d he explained.He stepped out of the spotlight to re-energize himself and flowed into a yearslong period of spiritual rejuvenation. He studied music theory. He read a lot \u2014 Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cMusic Is My Mistress,\u201d Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cSong of Solomon,\u201d George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d the fiction of Paul Beatty, the poetry of Nikki Giovanni. He worked on his own poems. He tried all sorts of things.\u201cI was celibate for like a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to ensure my mental health as a human being.\u201d Then one day he said to himself: \u201cHow much longer are you going to be here? It\u2019s good that you sat and you\u2019re reading these books and you\u2019re leaving the girls alone but, like, get over yourself.\u201d It was time to get back to work.Shortly afterward, in November 2015, the group was asked to perform on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d to commemorate the 25th anniversary of its debut album. It was the group\u2019s first television appearance in 15 years, and everyone agreed. \u201cIt felt right,\u201d Q-Tip said. \u201cThe energy was right. It felt like we was those kids that had that big show in Paris when they were 19. It felt fresh. It felt exciting. It felt new. Plus, it was just good to be with my brothers after all of that time.\u201dMr. White said the group easily slipped back into the zone: \u201cIt was like, oh man, this is the feeling that we\u2019ve all been missing!\u201d That was the night when Q-Tip finally said: \u201cLet\u2019s just do an album! Let\u2019s just start tomorrow!\u201dBut just because you put out the bat signal doesn\u2019t mean everyone can come running. Q-Tip and Mr. White were ready to work on a new album but Mr. Muhammad was in Los Angeles working as the music supervisor for Netflix\u2019s \u201cLuke Cage.\u201d And Phife was in Oakland, recording his own music and dealing with his health problems.Since 1990, Phife had been dutifully managing life with Type 2 diabetes. He was receiving dialysis three times a week and eating right. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in any pain,\u201d his wife, Deisha Taylor, said in a recent interview from the home she and Phife shared. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t been in the hospital in years. He was in a really, really, really good place before he transitioned.\u201dSo Phife flew out to Q-Tip\u2019s home, and they sat and talked for hours.\u201cHe came here, and we was bonding,\u201d Q-Tip said. \u201cWe went through all of the stuff and apologized, and it was just so good, man. We were so back.\u201d Ms. Taylor said Phife was encouraged by the meeting: \u201cThey were developing that chemistry again. He was excited about that.\u201dPhife found a clinic in New Jersey where he could receive dialysis, and in December 2015, just weeks after the triumphant Fallon performance, he began flying between Oakland and New Jersey twice a month and staying at Q-Tip\u2019s house for weeks at a time to work on the album. The music was inspiring, but Q-Tip believes Phife was primarily focused on repairing their relationship.\u201cI really believe he did the traveling back and forth, not for this record, but to make sure that me and him, Malik and Jon, were O.K.,\u201d Q-Tip said, using the names they had as children to emphasize the length and depth of their relationship. \u201cNot Ali. Not Jarobi,\u201d he said, choking up. \u201cHe came to my house to make sure that he and I were O.K.\u201d In the months of working on the new album, they realized they were more than O.K. Phife even talked about maybe moving to New Jersey to a place near Q-Tip\u2019s. The old friends were still tight.All of the recording sessions for \u201cWe Got It From Here, Thank You for Your Service\u201d took place at Q-Tip\u2019s studio, which Busta Rhymes called \u201cphenomenal.\u201d Soft design touches like bamboo floors and pink mood lights contribute to the warm aesthetic. But a vibe also flows from the history in the room. The main recording board has captured the music of Blondie, the Ramones and Art Blakey. There\u2019s a tape reel that was used by Frank Zappa and equipment from the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix.Q-Tip had one major rule for the album: He insisted that everyone who was a part of it come work in the studio. \u201cIf you wrote your rhyme somewhere else, you still had to come back and lay your verse in Q-Tip\u2019s house,\u201d Busta Rhymes said. \u201cSo we pretty much did every song together. Everybody wrote his stuff in front of everybody. Everybody spat their rhymes in front of each other. We were throwing ideas around together.\u201dIt was thrilling to the guys to watch stars like Jack White, Mr. Lamar and Andr\u00e9 3000 come through and record. It was even more exciting to have their brother Phife around all the time. But now some of the group members think that all that traveling may have contributed to grinding him down, physically. \u201cDoing this album killed him,\u201d Jarobi White said simply. \u201cAnd he was very happy to go out like that.\u201dIn the months since Phife died, Q-Tip has worked to finish what he called \u201cthe final Tribe album.\u201d Its title is the one Phife wanted. What does it mean? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Q-Tip said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going with it because he liked it.\u201dQ-Tip said it was tough to finish the album. From April until late October, he recorded and tweaked his way to the end, but one part was never easy. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for me to sit in there and hear his voice,\u201d Q-Tip said. \u201cSometimes I just have to like take a break and walk away. It gets heavy. It doesn\u2019t necessarily get sad, it just gets heavy. I literally feel the energy from him when I hear his voice.\u201dQ-Tip, Jarobi White, Mr. Muhammad and everyone in the Tribe family are still in mourning. The wound is fresh. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be missing him for a while,\u201d Q-Tip said, with an audible lump in his throat. He paused. \u201cGod is in control,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I feel at peace. I feel hopeful. I feel Phife with me.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest misstated the location of the home of the rapper Phife Dawg, who died in March before the group\u2019s new album was completed. He lived near Oakland, Calif. \u2014 not in Oakland.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Comcast and NBCUniversal Used Minions to Fuse an Empire", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byMinions, the impish fire hydrant-shaped yellow misfits who exist to serve the world\u2019s most evil villains, would appear to be unlikely mascots for corporate synergy at Comcast, one of the world\u2019s largest media conglomerates.The animated characters made their debut in 2010 in Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cDespicable Me,\u201d backing up the wicked mastermind Gru in his quest to steal the moon. At the time, federal regulators were reviewing Comcast\u2019s bid to take control of NBCUniversal, the owner of the NBC broadcast network, a bundle of cable television networks, a film studio and theme park business.Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, had long dreamed of building a new industry behemoth that would unite the cable company his father started in 1963 with the flashy world of world of television, news, movies and theme parks.Doing so, he believed, would allow the combined company to lead both the distribution and development of content in an era when people increasingly watched what they wanted when and how they wanted to.\u201cIt started as a concept and a guiding principle, and now it is the secret sauce,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.The story provides a template for looking at AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion takeover of Time Warner, and what might transpire on the consumer, business and regulatory fronts should that deal win approval. AT&T and Time Warner have promised to \u201clead the next wave of innovation\u201d as the worlds of media, communications and technology collide.There are broad similarities. Both deals feature a big TV distributor acquiring a big entertainment company that owns a bundle of television networks, news operations and movie studios. Comcast is the country\u2019s largest cable company, selling television, broadband and phone service to 28.3 million customers. AT&T is the country\u2019s largest television distributor after its acquisition last year of DirecTV, and counts more than 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and TV offerings.\u201cThere are some examples of real concerns about these kinds of consent decrees working, because the company that faces limitations has an arsenal of lawyers and resources to fight against those who seek to take advantage of the consent decree,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge, a Washington-based public interest group, and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department.\u201cOn the other hand, the limitations in the decree have created an opportunity for a variety of online services to grow and expand,\u201d Mr. Kimmelman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is pure market forces that enabled Netflix to explode, Sling TV to grow and companies like Amazon to invest more in online distribution.\u201dStill, AT&T is already facing a regulatory dispute over DirecTV, the satellite company it acquired in 2015. Last week, the Justice Department filed suit against DirecTV asserting that it had colluded with other cable companies in the Los Angeles region over carriage of the SportsNet LA channel, thus preventing Dodgers baseball games from being widely available.There are several differences between the AT&T proposal and the Comcast-NBCUniversal deal. For one, Comcast acquired NBCUniversal when its broadcast, movie and theme park businesses all were struggling. Most stark was NBC, which had been in last place among the four major broadcast networks for seven years in a row.AT&T, on the other hand, is buying Time Warner at what several analysts have called its peak.\u201cThere are definitely a lot of analogies,\u201d Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie Research, said about the two deals. \u201cBut the AT&T-Time Warner deal is as much about the future, with mobility and targeting millennials, as it is about content and distribution coming together.\u201dThat\u2019s a significant contrast to Comcast, which was led by Mr. Roberts and Stephen B. Burke, Comcast\u2019s chief operating officer who went on to become the chief executive of NBCUniversal after the deal. Both men are big believers in collaboration and have a deep understanding of the distribution and the content sides of the media industry.Mr. Burke, the son of a television executive, worked at Disney for more than a decade before joining Comcast, where he ran the company\u2019s cable operations. Mr. Burke\u2019s closest friends and family had questioned his decision to join Comcast in 1998, when it was considered a relatively small, regional cable company. But in discussing the job with Mr. Roberts, the men had agreed on a grand vision: First expand Comcast\u2019s cable footprint, then make a bold move into the content business.Over the years, Comcast famously tried to get into the entertainment business, including with an unsuccessful hostile takeover attempt of the Walt Disney Company in 2004.Immediately after Comcast took control of NBCUniversal, Mr. Burke installed a new leadership team and started working to create a culture where employees would be rewarded for collaboration.Comcast executives say the takeover, which occurred in two steps and was valued at about $30 billion, has benefited both sides of the company. Mr. Burke checked off the successes during a recent conference call: At NBCUniversal, operating cash flow has doubled in the five and a half years since Comcast took control of the company; NBC has started the television season in first place for the fourth season in a row; the film studio has delivered two record years of profits; and the theme park business has quadrupled its cash flow.At Comcast\u2019s cable operations, the company\u2019s third-quarter results for its video business were the best in 10 years, and earnings for its broadband business were the best in seven years.While impressive, some analysts questioned whether they were the result of the combination.Comcast executives would beg to differ, pointing to the results of Project Symphony, a strategy that Mr. Burke created soon after the Comcast-NBCUniversal deal closed to get the company\u2019s units working together. The plan entailed companywide promotion of major projects like the Olympic Games, Jimmy Fallon\u2019s late-night talk show, new cable technologies and the bright-yellow Minions, the product of Universal Pictures\u2019 Illumination Entertainment, which is led by Chris Meledandri.\u201cDespicable Me 2\u201d was identified as a top Project Symphony priority in advance of its opening in 2013.

Let\u2019s Talk About It", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported by(Note: This article will discuss all of the new \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d episodes in detail.)Then there were the weak spots. A lifetime of adoration and indulgence has turned Rory into an entitled flake, attributes that were grating at 22 but appalling at 32. If you want to be a writer so badly, Rory, consider writing literally anything. Other than Luke\u2019s hilariously awful wigs, Rory was the weakest aspect of the revival.When we last saw Rory, she was off to cover the Obama campaign. Times sure have changed! The freelance-writing market is a tough one, certainly, but Rory\u2019s convinced that somehow one \u201cTalk of the Town\u201d piece entitles her to \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what. Never pitching again? Never having to be polite? Never actually writing anything but somehow getting paid to fly to London and be Logan\u2019s mistress?Maybe 90 minutes is not actually the appropriate format for a series that used to run 44-minute episodes. The extended time drew extra attention to the fact that \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d is not great at scene-to-scene plotting. It\u2019s a show that likes \u201cand\u201d much more than it likes \u201ctherefore,\u201d and in 90-minute increments, a lack of causality makes everything feel a little too disposable or a little bit unearned.Rory is profiling a kooky British lady! Then what happens? Uh, then she\u2019s not. Why? She was too kooky. Oh. Was she significant? Not even a little. Emily claims in therapy to still resent Lorelai for a hateful letter that Lorelai utterly denies having written. We never return to this letter, even though it seems significant in that scene. Rory is handed the literal keys to a newspaper, and she doesn\u2019t much care at all.Let\u2019s run down some of the other major plot points and issues in these four episodes:\u2022 Logan needs to fly into the sun. I was never \u201cteam Logan,\u201d and I believe strongly that he is simply blond evil slime animating a human-shaped receptacle. In the 10 years since they did not get engaged, he and Rory have kept up their joyless sexual relationship. Fine; college boyfriends sometimes linger, I guess. But Logan\u2019s engaged. Odette could be her own evil slime for all we know, but no one deserves to be made a fool of, and somehow I doubt that she and Logan have discussed their versions of ethical nonmonogamy.\u2022 For someone who says he hates his dad, Logan has done truly nothing to go against his father\u2019s apparently horrendous demands. I used to think Rory\u2019s fascination with Jess was rooted in some of the ways Jess reminded her of Christopher \u2014 spirited and exciting, but fundamentally unreliable. Turns out it\u2019s Logan who\u2019s the Christopher redux, and vice versa. Everyone is destined to take his or her parents\u2019 money and live that life, apparently. Even Lorelai.\u2022 Lorelai\u2019s inappropriate eulogy for her father struck me as strange and totally out of character, especially because the most fruitful conflicts between Emily and Lorelai \u2014 dramatically fruitful but also significant in their relationship \u2014 come when they see the same thing in different ways. For example, imagine Lorelai giving a little speech that she thought was charming and fine, maybe something about how seeing Richard dote on Rory made her glad he finally got the daughter he really wanted. Emily would see this as offensive, and Lorelai would see it as true, and then their fight would have higher stakes.\u2022 Lorelai would know who Marie Kondo is. Emily would not know who Llewyn Davis is. Nor would Emily know what Airbnb is.\u2022 Why was everyone so fixated on Luke and Lorelai having a baby? They each have a biological child; Luke has also effectively been Rory\u2019s father figure for most of her life, and he helped raise Jess, too. Even in the emotionally closed-off world of Luke Danes, this would have come up again. Remember how invasive Lorelai was about Luke\u2019s \u201cdark day\u201d? They would have talked about this more. Even them.\u2022 Lane was severely absent in these episodes. She\u2019s still in Stars Hollow? That seems almost tragic. I don\u2019t love Paris\u2019s path \u2014 she never seemed particularly interested in being a parent, for example \u2014 but at least she got a few great moments. (She and Doyle have to reconcile, though; they are soul mates.) Lane, though? As always, Lane Kim deserved better.\u2022 So did Sookie. I get it; Melissa McCarthy could only film one scene. But \u2026 why did the show lampshade her absence so much? Just pretend she and Lorelai have seen each other plenty, and we just don\u2019t get to see every moment.\u2022 The Berta stuff was stupid. We all like Rose Abdoo as Gypsy, and double-casting can be cute enough, but the whole \u201cWho even knows what language she speaks? Ha, ha, she has such a big family, and they all live here now!\u201d came across as racist.\u2022 Lorelai\u2019s and Rory\u2019s complaints about Pat\u2019s body at the beginning of \u201cSummer\u201d were bizarre and uncalled-for and offensive. If you don\u2019t want to look at people, don\u2019t go to a pool. Paris\u2019s referral to surrogates as \u201cbreeders\u201d and \u201cbottle-service bimbos\u201d was bizarrely misogynistic. Luke\u2019s attitudes about adoption are racist. (There are many reasons to have qualms about international adoptions, but boy does that not seem to be where Luke is coming from.)\u2022 Why wouldn\u2019t Miss Patty be on the musical committee? She so would! The musical itself is nowhere near as bad as Lorelai seems to believe it is. Yes, it is schlocky and stupid, but \u2026 it\u2019s Stars Hollow. Recall the Stars Hollow Museum. Why is Lorelai so surprised? Also, Jeanine Tesori is no slouch!Even the \u201cbad\u201d songs are actually pretty good: The harmonies are effective, the song structure is intact, and they\u2019re catchy. Was it a good use of time on the episode? No! But don\u2019t blame the musical. Finally, was Sutton Foster literally playing Lorelai in the song \u201cNever or Now\u201d? What part of Stars Hollow history was being re-created in that moment?\u2022 Why did the Life and Death Brigade rob Doose\u2019s? Those steampunk gorillas are the worst people on earth.\u2022 There was so much Logan and so little Jess, yet Jess\u2019s presence felt more significant because he\u2019s one of the only characters to have changed at all since we last saw him. For starters, he\u2019s now seriously jacked. But he\u2019s also more mature than he was when we saw him in Season 6, and his obvious warmth and affection for Luke indicates that he\u2019s done some soul-searching \u2014 and maybe some therapy? \u2014 to help him dismantle his jerk exterior. It\u2019s nice!Dean is fine, but if Rory\u2019s \u201ctee hee, remember when we dated\u201d thing was supposed to seem cute, it sure didn\u2019t. It seemed weird and desperate. She and Dean dated 15 years ago. He is married and has almost-four children. If you met a grown woman who was still this starry-eyed about her high-school boyfriend, you\u2019d feel a little bit sorry for her.\u2022 I liked the return to Chilton, and I particularly liked Paris\u2019s harsh lecture and eventual meltdown. The Tristan fake out, however, was misguided. I was surprised that Rory\u2019s little spiel didn\u2019t reference any of the classes we know she took, or the school newspaper, or Mr. Medina, or any of the significant Chilton experiences we actually saw on the series. Music composition? What? The last thing \u201cGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\u201d needed to do was invent back story. We know the back story. Let us use that knowledge.My list of beefs could go on and on. I would slap a \u201cstop indulging Rory Gilmore\u201d sticker on my car. But I enjoyed this revival so much, too. You can go home again, maybe, if you\u2019re willing to tolerate toupees. I liked being back in the Stars Hollow world, I liked seeing Lauren Graham in action, and I liked knowing that Emily would still be Emily, whether she stayed in the Daughters of the American Revolution or not. And now I want to go back to Stars Hollow again to see the new Gilmore that\u2019s about to join the girls.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Denis Villeneuve of \u2018Arrival\u2019 Leans In to Strong Heroines", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported by\u201cArrival,\u201d the new aliens-have-landed film with Amy Adams (which opensFriday), is the first science-fiction picture directed by Denis Villeneuve, and, despite its ominous overtones and the heartbreak at its core, it also counts among Mr. Villeneuve\u2019s lighter fare.Mr. Villeneuve, who is French Canadian, is widely known for tense cinematic brooders like \u201cPrisoners\u201d and \u201cEnemy,\u201d which both starred Jake Gyllenhaal, and for being hired to direct the forthcoming, doubtlessly moody \u201cBlade Runner\u201d sequel, due next year and starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. Set against Mr. Villeneuve\u2019s body of work, though, these three films are anomalies, for the simple fact that their protagonists are men.Mr. Villeneuve has built and grown his career making films that are about, and led by, women. \u201cArrival\u201d is his sixth feature to focus on a female character.Part of this is happenstance, part of it by design, and part of it is ingrained in Mr. Villeneuve\u2019s DNA. Writing his first feature in the late \u201990s, Mr. Villeneuve said, he consciously chose a female protagonist because he felt it would bring him \u201cthe necessary distance\u201d from his subject. But then his second feature centered on a woman, and then his third, and his fourth, around which time Mr. Villeneuve realized a definite pattern was afoot.\u201cFor me, masculinity is about control, and femininity is more of an embrace, the art of listening,\u201d Mr. Villeneuve, who is 49, said by phone from Budapest, where \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d was being shot. \u201cIt\u2019s very inspiring to explore the shadows of masculinity and femininity, and the tensions between both, and the place of women in the world right now.\u201dMr. Villeneuve was raised in Gentilly, Quebec, a small community northeast of Montreal on the St. Lawrence River that is famous for its nuclear power plant and, now, for being his hometown. While the village was deeply conservative and Catholic, Mr. Villeneuve grew up surrounded by strong, progressive women.Though both of his grandfathers were, in his words, \u201cvery quiet, like shadows,\u201d his grandmothers were strong, eccentric and flamboyant. \u201cTwo figures of power, two women who were very alive,\u201d he said. His father was a notary, and his mother was a homemaker who enthusiastically embraced feminism, leaving a lasting impression on Mr. Villeneuve, who is the eldest of four.\u201cI\u2019m the first generation of men that was in contact with those new ideas of feminism,\u201d Mr. Villeneuve said. \u201cI was raised in a way that I didn\u2019t feel threatened by those ideas. I felt that it was a beautiful thing.\u201dHe also knew his view was not universally shared.\u201cIn Quebec, as women were getting more power, there were the men who agreed with that, and the men who were afraid,\u201d Mr. Villeneuve said. \u201cI think most men are willing to share power with women, but there\u2019s fear. Every time you change something, there\u2019s a friction.\u201dThat the shootings happened in vibrant, cosmopolitan Montreal only compounded Canadians\u2019 horror. Mr. Villeneuve had been a university student in the city at the time, and he was about the same age as the women. Despite initial criticism over his decision to make a film about it, Mr. Villeneuve said he felt the need to \u201crepair and revisit\u201d the atrocity; it was the nightmarish apotheosis of resistance to women\u2019s rise.One offer that especially intrigued him came from a fellow Montrealer, Shawn Levy (who went on to produce the Netflix hit \u201cStranger Things\u201d), who wanted to make a film out of the novella \u201cStory of Your Life\u201d by Ted Chiang, about a linguist tasked with learning the language of visiting aliens.\u201cIt was clear to us that the filmmaker behind \u2018Incendies\u2019 was for real,\u201d said Mr. Levy, a director and head of the production company 21 Laps. \u201cThe command of tone, and visuals in service of tone, was so confident.\u201dMr. Villeneuve was already committed to two other projects, \u201cEnemy\u201d and \u201cPrisoners,\u201d which together took 18 months. \u201cPrisoners\u201d was a particularly dark project, especially after \u201cPolytechnique\u201d and \u201cIncendies\u201d \u2014 Mr. Villeneuve said, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make movies about the darker part of humanity; it\u2019s like you live with it\u201d \u2014 yet it opened the door to his next project, \u201cSicario,\u201d about a female F.B.I. agent (Emily Blunt) drawn into an extralegal effort to quash drug cartels operating across the United States-Mexico border.\u201cThe fact that it was a woman makes the audience lean in even more to her position, and he wanted to embrace that,\u201d Ms. Blunt said. \u201cHe considers these women deeply. There\u2019s nothing superficial when it comes to the layers of women he wants to create in his films.\u201dThe movie was written by Taylor Sheridan, who resisted early suggestions from potential financial backers to turn his lead into a man. Mr. Sheridan was laser-focused on landing Mr. Villeneuve to direct, though not because of his track record directing actresses. (At the time, Mr. Sheridan had yet to see \u201cIncendies.\u201d) \u201cI knew an hour into watching \u2018Prisoners\u2019 that\u2019s our guy,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cHe creates a complete world. There\u2019s such a brooding emotional honesty in what he does.\u201dFor Mr. Villeneueve, having a female lead clinched the film for him. He strongly felt the need, he said, to visit the world of drug cartel violence through a woman\u2019s eyes: Already an accomplished professional, the lead character was trying to hold her own, and be morally upright alongside mercenaries in a shadowy, quasi-legal world.Still, \u201cSicario,\u201d too, was deeply somber, and before taking it Mr. Villeneueve made himself a promise.\u201cI said to myself, I would go back in the dark, if I knew there was something with a lot of light after,\u201d he said. That ended up being the film version of \u201cStory of Your Life,\u201d which has since been rechristened. \u201cI was able to do \u2018Sicario,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbecause \u2018Arrival\u2019 was just after.\u201dProduction took place in Montreal; Ms. Adams said Mr. Villeneuve told her he wanted to be close to his family (he is married to Tanya Lapointe, a Canadian journalist, and has three children from a previous relationship). For her part, Ms. Adams said she did not immediately connect with the film, \u2014 in which the linguist\u2019s attempts at extraterrestrial communication are interspersed with vignettes of conversations with her young daughter. But then Mr. Villeneuve told Ms. Adams that he believed it was the mother-daughter relationship that lay at the film\u2019s heart.\u201cThat\u2019s what locked me in,\u201d Ms. Adams said, adding, \u201cDenis managed to make an emotional science fiction movie that feels intimate.\u201dSpeaking from Budapest, Mr. Villeneuve said he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019ll do next, though he yearns to take a break. \u201cBlade Runner\u201d was sucking up every minute of his time, every joule of his energy, and he was worried that in his exhaustion, he wasn\u2019t making sense during our conversation.Would future projects inevitably involve more female protagonists?\u201cI think that\u2019s something that needs to come naturally,\u201d Mr. Villeneuve said. He recalled a moment in \u201cPrisoners,\u201d when he was shooting a confrontation between two men. \u201cIt was like a western, you know?\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cAnd I felt that it was really refreshing for me, to go back into the masculine world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Netflix Lets Movie Lovers Down, and What to Do About It", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byStreamingAlmost half a century ago, if you had enough disposable income and a certain amount of technical agility, you could have your own YouTube channel. Sort of. You could share your videos with friends who came over to your place to watch them, or you lend them to pals who had hardware similar to yours.The Betamax format compelled a micro approach: early cassettes could record only an hour\u2019s worth of material. Once the Sony rival JVC introduced the VHS format, which could record two hours on a single cassette, and subsequent refinements yielded variable recording speeds, the idea of Hollywood movies on home video became a practical reality.Movies on home video created a new and highly lucrative revenue stream for Hollywood. But as I learned in the mid-1980s when I worked at the consumer electronics magazine Video Review, as much money as home video made, the movie industry always hated it. The idea of consumers actually owning motion pictures was anathema to them. This never changed; as the DVD format took off in the 1990s, I remember one conversation with an insider, who said, \u201cHollywood can\u2019t wait to stop making little aluminum discs.\u201d Nobody, in my experience, would ever speak of this on the record. Indeed, beating the bushes to even get a home video executive to do so now, I came up with nothing.Which brings us to movies on streaming video, which this new column will be addressing regularly in Arts & Leisure and online. By streaming I mean theoretically unlimited access to movies, in the form of digital files viewable on a wide variety of personal devices, from a home-theater projection system to a phone, accessible to consumers via an ever-growing number of \u00e0 la carte services. Even if you buy titles for permanent use, as several services offer, they\u2019re not physical things that you have in your home; you can\u2019t really lend them out. (Yes, many services allow multiple household members to log in, but it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re going to extend that privilege to a random acquaintance.)This started a still-continuing conversation on and off the amorphous entity known as Film Twitter, yielding observations like \u201cThe film selection on Netflix is much worse than your average Blockbuster. It\u2019s like a gas station DVD collection.\u201dThe service has 47 million subscribers in the United States, and its movie library is affected not only by the limitations of particular licensing deals, which means that the number of titles is constantly contracting and expanding, but also by what subscribers actually watch. To use the contemporary buzzword \u201ccurated,\u201d Netflix would argue that it does indeed take a curatorial approach to movies, but one that\u2019s appropriate to a consumer product rather than a museum. It does not see its mission as a conservational one. And the hard truth about the future of streaming services is that even those with the loftiest stated ambitions will be obliged to balance those ambitions against market demand.Because of Netflix\u2019s interface, its jam-packed welcome menu, and the sheer amount of material that turns up in browsing \u2014 not to mention what Mr. Seitz terms its cultural dominance \u2014 a lot of users have the impression that the service is one-stop entertainment shopping that has everything. That\u2019s simply not true. And Netflix doesn\u2019t aspire, or pretend, to have everything, either.One of the more potentially head-spinning features of streaming video is that this state of affairs could change almost overnight. I won\u2019t ask for any credit should some eager Netflix programming exec put together a \u201cDeeper Into \u2018Stranger Things\u2019\u201d movie package.Advertisement"}

Two minutes later, the Argentine woman behind the counter gave him a thumbs up.\u201cIt\u2019s like this everywhere,\u201d said Mr. Jones, 48. \u201cI haven\u2019t paid for a cab since the election.\u201d\u201cYou tell your kids, \u2018Don\u2019t be a bigot,\u2019\u201d he said on camera. \u201cYou tell your kids, \u2018Do your homework and be prepared.\u2019 And then you have this outcome, and you have people putting children to bed tonight. And they\u2019re afraid of breakfast. They\u2019re afraid of, how do I explain this to my children?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say it was a star-making moment,\u201d said Mr. Jones\u2019s friend Ava DuVernay, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker. She quickly added that she had held him in that regard for quite some time, given his three-decade career in civil rights activism, his best-selling books on progressive issues and the considerable time he has spent on the lecture circuit.Growing up in Jackson, Tenn., Mr. Jones knew from an early age he would wind up doing a version of what he is doing now. His parents were educators who taught him about the importance of hard work and social justice.\u201cIn their view, excellence was a weapon against bigotry,\u201d said Mr. Jones, who worked on a student newspaper at the University of Tennessee at Martin before going to Yale Law School.Right after Mr. Jones won a Reebok Human Rights Award in 1998, he spoke at the University of California, Berkeley, and met a law school student named Jana Carter, who ultimately became his wife. (They have two sons, 12 and 8, and live in Los Angeles. Mr. Jones asked that his children\u2019s names not be published.)But suing the police and staging protests took their toll. So did defending those who were released from prison but had no real opportunities for rehabilitation or employment. By 2002, Mr. Jones was seriously burned out.\u201cI went to counseling, meditation groups, did every kind of self-improvement course you could imagine,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cTony Robbins, Landmark Forum, Hoffman Institute. I was like Frankenstein, experimenting on myself.\u201dWith former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s green movement picking up steam, Mr. Jones soon had an epiphany: Why not try to bring together the fights against pollution and poverty, training nonviolent offenders to work in eco-friendly construction, doing things like installing solar panels. He saw it as an ideal form of manual labor, since it couldn\u2019t be outsourced to other countries.The honeymoon was short-lived.As the Drudge Report began linking to the stories and right-wing radio had a field day, it became clear that he had become a liability to the White House and he resigned.Another dark period followed (\u201dan emotional black hole,\u201d as Mr. Jones described it), but he was able to rebuild his reputation.In July 2010, 911truth.org removed his name from a list of those who support its mission, after reviewing its records and failing to find evidence that Mr. Jones had signed the original petition. Then came a visiting professorship at Princeton University and a friendship with Prince, with whom he played table tennis, discussed black history (and was admonished by to stop swearing). And in 2012, CNN hired Mr. Jones to appear on a new iteration of \u201cCrossfire\u201d with Newt Gingrich, Stephanie Cutter and S. E. Cupp.\u201cThe show did not last, but we loved Van\u2019s voice,\u201d said Jeff Zucker, the network\u2019s president, who kept him on afterward as a commentator.They struck up a correspondence and went to breakfast in downtown Los Angeles, where Ms. DuVernay explained that she was working on a documentary about the criminal justice system for Netflix and wanted him to be a part of it.He said yes and referred Ms. DuVernay to Mr. Gingrich, who despite being on the opposite side of the aisle, is now his good friend, and talks in the film about the disparity in sentencing guidelines for white users of powder cocaine and black users of crack cocaine.Central to his progressive mission is finding common ground with right wingers, even as he disagrees with them on matters big and small.\u201cHe makes the conversation better every time he\u2019s a part of it,\u201d said Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor. \u201cHe\u2019s not an ideologue who\u2019s regurgitating talking points. He\u2019s incredibly thoughtful.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a ritual Rock \u2019em Sock \u2019em Robots quality to TV news, where everyone is supposed to come bludgeon the other person with their talking points,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cAnd over the course of the last 18 months, I\u2019ve fallen out of love with that. I think the truth is messy.\u201dThat segues neatly to Mr. Jones\u2019s new web series for CNN, called \u2014 what else? \u2014 \u201cThe Messy Truth.\u201dSeveral thanked Mr. Jones at the end for really listening to them and asked him to pose for pictures. The symbolism of this black man surrounded by a phalanx of star-struck white Trump supporters was hard to miss. (A televised special of \u201cThe Messy Truth\u201d will air on CNN Dec. 6)Consequently, Mr. Jones didn\u2019t want people to infer from his election-night comments that he thinks all of President-elect Trump\u2019s supporters are bigots. At the same time, he thought it was essential not to brush aside the role of racism in Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent.\u201cIf you only focus on the toxic crap, you\u2019re not being fair to the Trump voters,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cBut if you deny all the toxic crap, you\u2019re not being fair to the rest of Americans.\u201dThere is little denying that Mr. Jones is popular among his colleagues at CNN, particularly after watching him last Thursday evening on a rooftop set overlooking the Capitol for a special taping of \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d\u201cWe need more voices like his,\u201d Mr. Khan said.\u201cI think she\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mr. Jones said.If there was anything disappointing about the evening, it was that Mr. Jones\u2019s other on-camera nemesis \u2014 Jeffrey Lord, a staunch Trump defender and former aide to Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp \u2014 wasn\u2019t there for one of their ferocious but friendly altercations.\u201cHow can you not like Jeffrey?\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s adorable. He\u2019s like a Fraggle.\u201dThen he paused. \u201cIf a Fraggle had a tendency towards terrible revisionist history.\u201d\u201cWhich is exactly how I feel about him,\u201d said Mr. Lord, speaking later by phone. \u201cI think Van\u2019s a terrific person and a great friend. We just disagree on everything, and God bless America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Latest Propaganda Tool: The Clinton-Trump Debates on Live TV", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 In the past, Iranians looking to mock the United States would burn cardboard effigies of Uncle Sam or Lady Liberty. But in recent months, as the American presidential election took a series of bizarre turns, Iranians seeking to make fun of the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d have ditched the arts and crafts and simply switched on their TV sets.Iran\u2019s state television, a bastion of conservative ideologues, for once interrupted its regular programing about the \u201cmurders and crimes committed\u201d by the United States and broadcast all three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump \u2014 live.In a country that tightly controls information about the United States and depictions of Western democracy generally, the decision to show the debates was unprecedented but by no means inexplicable: The presidential campaign shows the United States political system in such a poor light, hard-liners evidently want it to speak for itself.\u201cWe only need to sit back and let these candidates show themselves how idiotic they are,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a conservative analyst and a regular guest on state television. \u201cThe best way for us to prove that the U.S. government is corrupt and hideous is by showing these people live on our TV.\u201dLive, yes, but some parts \u2014 especially those criticizing Iran \u2014 were not fully translated. After each debate, analysts discussing the outcome were in unanimous agreement that America, in its current state, \u201ccannot do a damn thing.\u201dTo say that Iran\u2019s political establishment has been thoroughly enjoying the campaign is an understatement. Last week, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the American election \u201ca spectacle for exposing their crimes and debacles.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei seized on the campaign\u2019s tawdriest details: accusations of infidelity and sexual assault.\u201cThe remarks made by these two U.S. presidential candidates over the last few weeks on immoral issues \u2014 which are, for the most part, not baseless accusations \u2014 are enough to disgrace America,\u201d he said during a speech commemorating the 1979 takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran.His supporters responded enthusiastically by shouting, \u201cDeath to America.\u201dMr. Trump, the Republican nominee, was not mentioned by name, but the ayatollah seemed to praise his outspokenness, saying: \u201cPeople pay more attention to him.\u201dThe candidate, he said, is tapping into genuine American dissatisfaction. \u201cBecause the people look at what he says and see it is true,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cThey see it in the facts of their lives.\u201dSince the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been officially anti-American. Many ordinary Iranians have milder feelings for the United States, where over two million of their relatives live.Iran\u2019s leaders, long entangled in a battle for power and influence with the United States in the Middle East, have been emboldened by the American withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201cAmerica is no longer a superpower in the region. It\u2019s weak in the Middle East. They are now only one of the players,\u201d said Jalal Barzegar, a reformist journalist. \u201cIt\u2019s now just a country.\u201dFor Iranians uninterested in watching the debates, Iran\u2019s state television had another option. In recent weeks it has been airing Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d called \u201cHouse of Straw\u201d here because playing cards is considered un-Islamic.Kevin Spacey\u2019s portrayal of the conniving politician Frank Underwood is the perfect embodiment of the \u201cinhumane face\u201d of American politics, state television officials have said.Apparently, Ayatollah Khamenei has also been watching. In his recent speech, he quoted a line uttered by Mr. Spacey in the series.\u201c\u2018Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left one,\u2019 as they say themselves,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cThis is the kind of people they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s festive but also deeply felt, historically minded but also utterly of the now, when hip-hop has largely sloughed off its dourness, its rugged reserve and its reliance on tension. In this moment, melody has become central, and youthful freedom is the prevailing spirit. Whimsy is the next logical step.\u201cBroccoli,\u201d a collaboration with Lil Yachty \u2014 another artist at the vanguard of modern whimsy \u2014 is currently at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. It\u2019s D.R.A.M.\u2019s biggest hit, and emblematic. The primary instruments are piano and flute \u2014 in the distance, you can hear the Renaissance fair \u2014 and the tempo isn\u2019t particularly quick, but feels jaunty nonetheless.Early in the song, D.R.A.M. sings, \u201cAin\u2019t! No! Telling! What! I\u2019m! Finna! Be onnnnnnnnn!,\u201d landing harder and more effectively on each successive word, like ascending a staircase, a trick that feels borrowed from rock \u2032n\u2019 roll shout singing of the 1950s. Later, he raps about his breakthrough, then tells the story of his unlikely present, sprinkled with comic details: \u201cCouple summers later I got paper/I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel/With the capers on a square plate.\u201dD.R.A.M.\u2019s voice is wobbly and fuzzy, sometimes oscillating like the sound that emanates from the arcade booth when Pac-Man dies. It\u2019s endlessly mutable \u2014 flexibility is his signature. The wobble also connotes a lack of self-seriousness: Formal rigor isn\u2019t part of D.R.A.M.\u2019s arsenal, nor is complexity. Instead, he\u2019s a conversational lyricist, who sings in spoken sentences, massaged into melody.On \u201cPassword (All That),\u201d he\u2019s agonizing over his romantic foibles: \u201cFingers crossed hoping that she don\u2019t scroll too far/Down to see, my little plea for Emily/To lay with me while she was so far away.\u201d This is one of a few places on the album where D.R.A.M. uses technology as metaphor, or at least narrative device \u2014 perpetual digital connection is inspiration for D.R.A.M.\u2019s stories about romantic connection.That\u2019s clearest on \u201cWiFi,\u201d an appealingly rusted pseudo-neo-soul duet with Erykah Badu. It seeps, throbs, sighs. D.R.A.M. goes into his upper register for the flirtation: \u201cDo your boyfriend pay your bill for you/To Netflix and chill with me?\u201d Ms. Badu retorts with pressing questions and sly evasions. In the song, Wi-Fi is both literal subject and symbol.Unlike plenty of young stars who are co-opted by Drake, and then sign on for a long-term arrangement, D.R.A.M. found refuge elsewhere: Rick Rubin is a mentor, and on this album, there are production credits for the Kanye West associate Mike Dean and also Donnie Trumpet, a longtime collaborator of Chance the Rapper\u2019s.And that makes sense: D.R.A.M.\u2019s musical vision is earthier and broader than Drake\u2019s. \u201cBig Baby D.R.A.M.\u201d is full of offhand riffs on several decades of black musical styles \u2014 \u201cGet It Myself\u201d leans in on a sort of D.I.Y. gospel harmonizing, filtered through 1970s electro funk. \u201cOutta Sight\u201d sounds like house music played by a slightly tipsy live band, and it\u2019s followed by \u201cDark Lavender,\u201d driven by lounge piano.\u201cMonticello Ave\u201d uses piano the way the Native Tongues might have, then slaps New Jack Swing-inspired vocal harmonies atop it. And on \u201cMisunderstood,\u201d an uproarious collaboration with Young Thug, the schlock-pop producer Ricky Reed serves up triumphant \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d-esque 1980s power rock, while D.R.A.M. comes on like a comedic Rick James impersonator.

{"Headline": "Review: Netflix Does Queen Elizabeth II in \u2018The Crown,\u2019 No Expense Spared", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byA pricey prestige drama about a British monarch? Should we prepare for an orgy of beheadings, sex scandals and battlefield brutality?Well, no; just an orgy of sumptuous scenes and rich performances.The series focuses on the queen\u2019s early years on the throne, but it begins before George\u2019s death in 1952, when she was a princess leading a relatively carefree life with her husband, Prince Philip (Matt Smith). Their wedding in 1947 is lavishly rendered 12 minutes into the opening episode.In less patient hands, the next five years would be condensed into five minutes, with George seen chain-smoking enough to make the point that cigarettes kill, then dying so that we could get on with Elizabeth\u2019s story. But \u201cThe Crown\u201d takes its time arriving at that sea-change moment, and the result is a delicate study in the power of breaking news then versus now.Today, thanks to the internet and social media, everyone knows almost immediately when something major or even not so major happens. Five minutes after the death of a person of the king\u2019s stature, the event would have been absorbed, the \u201cpraying for George\u201d tweets would have been posted, and the snarky post-mortem would already be underway. \u201cThe Crown\u201d lets you feel (or remember) what it was like when information moved more slowly. Elizabeth and Philip were on a world tour at the time. Just reaching her with word that she was now the queen was an ordeal, and in following that thread the series also conveys how the news rolled across the British Empire \u2014 a growing shock wave rather than a quick burst.That\u2019s the kind of treatment needed in a historical drama set in the 1950s, a decade that could not compete with the one immediately before or after it in terms of eventfulness. \u201cThe Crown\u201d is not without its power struggles and scandals. Churchill, who reassumed the post of prime minister in 1951, was thought to be old and out of step even by some in his own party. Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby), Elizabeth\u2019s sister, was having a dalliance with a married man, Peter Townsend (Ben Miles).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tina Brown on the Final Two Episodes of \u2018The Crown\u2019: Love and Duty", "Date": "2016-11-23", "News": "Supported byAs we have seen, the struggle to become the head of state of the American republic can be ugly and brutal. One of the upsides of being a constitutional monarchy is that there\u2019s no such struggle. No one elects the British head of state \u2014 no one but God. The monarch\u2019s role is to be (or, at least, to appear) immutable. Queen Elizabeth II wields a delicate, unsought sovereignty that can never be eschewed (except by abdication or death) and is rarely exercised. She must evolve with change and sometimes nudge it \u2014 but never, ever demand it.Not so. Fortunately for the rest of this first season, there are two especially juicy, seemingly made-for-TV developments: the love life of the Queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, and the wounded vanity of Winston Churchill. Both reach their climax in the final two episodes.Being the younger sister of a queen bee is always a buzz kill. Just ask Lee Radziwill or Pippa Middleton. Or Sarah Ferguson, Princess Di\u2019s sister-in law, an explosive redhead caught on camera having her toes sucked by a dubious Texan boyfriend. Younger sisters seem fated to be racier, more transgressive and more criticized. They seethe with suppressed rebellion. Princess Margaret, played with wonderful spoiled charm by Vanessa Kirby, was luscious and highly sexed. (The latter didn\u2019t change when the former faded.) It was inevitable that the boredom of her life as a royal spare tire would steer her into dangerous territory.And the handsome equerry who caught her eye, Group Captain Peter Townsend, was irresistible. Fifteen years her senior, he was dashing, brave and impeccably trained. The tragedy for P.M., as she was known, was that Townsend (who was rather hotter in real life than the stoic Ben Miles, who plays him) would have been the perfect match for her \u2014 except that he was divorced. Because of that, their union would seem to have been prohibited by the arcane diktats of the Royal Marriage Act of 1772.When Elizabeth, played with exquisite subtlety by Clare Foy, learns that her pledge was based on faulty advice served up by her lugubrious private secretary, Tommy Lascelles, she is full of consternation and hesitant heart-searching. But she yields to precedent \u2014 a victory for Lascelles, masterfully rendered by Pip Torrens as an implacable courtier-as-undertaker, from his sepulchral voice to his boot-brush mustache. Duty and sacrifice are such alien concepts in 21st-century public life that the bleak, irrevocable end to the affair sends a powerful message about what it meant to be royal in the 20th.Kudos to Mr. Morgan for his choice of less obvious material in the beautifully realized ninth episode. In 1954, the two houses of the British Parliament commissioned the celebrated artist Graham Sutherland to paint a portrait of Churchill as an 80th birthday present for the grand old hero of the Second World War. The plan was to unveil it before rolling BBC cameras in a soaring ceremony of thanks at Westminster Hall. But Churchill hated the Sutherland portrait with so much irrational passion that it all turned into a tragicomic fiasco.It\u2019s a feast of character opportunity for John Lithgow, who plays Churchill at the moment when he\u2019s losing his non-Elgin marbles. In scenes of Churchill\u2019s increasingly uneasy sittings with Sutherland, he\u2019s a Lear-like figure, consumed by gloom, defiance and anger \u2014 none of which are improved by his addictions to French cognac and Cuban cigars. Intimations of mortality do nothing to persuade him to resign as prime minister and make way for Anthony Eden, as Churchill\u2019s colleagues and family fervently wish.It\u2019s a familiar misunderstanding. The living subjects of biographers usually hate even \u201cauthorized\u201d books about themselves. However genially a project might begin, they end up feeling betrayed. Churchill had expected a portrait that displayed his triumph as the savior of England, perhaps standing resplendent in his Garter robes, the rocklike bulldog who defeated the \u201cNazzis,\u201d as he liked to pronounce it. But that is not what Sutherland saw.The ever-loyal Clemmie saw to it that the portrait was thrown on a bonfire after her husband died. Perhaps she hoped to forever erase what she saw as Sutherland\u2019s unflattering farewell to all of Churchill\u2019s greatness. But the camera \u2014 whether the BBC\u2019s then or Netflix\u2019s now \u2014 sees, and does not forget.At ten episodes per season, one season per Elizabethan decade, we\u2019ve got 50 more episodes to go, if the series runs its full-length. I can\u2019t wait until Mr. Morgan and Mr. Daldry get to the Brexit debacle \u2014 and to Her Britannic Majesty\u2019s first meeting with President Trump.Advertisement"}
