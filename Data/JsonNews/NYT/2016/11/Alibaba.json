{"Headline": "Alibaba Earnings Show It Again Defying China\u2019s Slowdown", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Amid concerns about a slowdown in the growth of the Chinese economy, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company is showing that \u2014 for now \u2014 business on its platforms is holding steady.Alibaba Group said on Wednesday that its revenue grew strongly in the three months through the end of September, as the myriad brands and small-time vendors on its online shopping sites kept spending heavily on advertising. Although Chinese economic growth has slowed, more shoppers are also turning to Alibaba sites while abandoning physical retail outlets like malls.Alibaba said its sales rose 55 percent to $5.14 billion in its second quarter from the same period a year earlier. Net profit dropped 69 percent from a year ago, to $1.06 billion, because of a one-time accounting gain that had raised last year\u2019s bottom line.While the company has been mostly immune to China\u2019s slowing growth \u2014 gross domestic product expanded 6.7 percent in the past three quarters, down from 6.9 percent for all of 2015 \u2014 the value of goods sold on Alibaba\u2019s online platforms had begun to plateau. While it has a strong hold on the online market for China\u2019s middle-class shoppers, almost all of them already own a smartphone, so growth through new customers is harder to achieve.To compensate for slowing sales growth on its platforms, Alibaba \u2014 which makes money on advertising and fees paid by the vendors that set up virtual stores on its platforms \u2014 has been doing more to improve targeting of advertisements. It is also seeking to bring in new international brands that pay a fee to sell on its platforms.Given the slowdown, analysts have focused more on other businesses that Alibaba has been building up in recent years. But those businesses, like cloud computing and digital entertainment, all posted losses during the quarter. As Alibaba\u2019s profit margins shrink, investors will put more pressure on the company to extract profit from its newer business.During a conference call with analysts, Joseph Tsai, the company\u2019s executive vice chairman, said that its cloud computing and digital entertainment units were \u201ccoming into their own in terms of scale.\u201d Still, he warned that the company viewed its investments in new businesses as projects that may not yield profit for the next five to 10 years.Many have particularly focused on Alibaba\u2019s cloud services which, much like Amazon Web Services, provide easy-to-use, back-end computing power for a wide range of companies.Revenue from the cloud service more than doubled from a year earlier, to $224 million in the most recent quarter, but posted a $60 million operating loss. Alibaba said it had added 74,000 subscribers to the service over the quarter, raising its total paying users to 651,000. Analysts have predicted that the business could begin producing profit for Alibaba in the coming few years.\u201cAlibaba has gone beyond the position of an e-commerce play,\u201d said Jessie Guo, an analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank, citing its cloud computing and logistics arms as well as its electronic payments affiliate, Ant Financial. \u201cWe see it as an ecosystem. That means its model is going to be more sophisticated.\u201dA new spate of public listings by Chinese logistics firms could help Alibaba, Shi Jialong, a technology analyst at Nomura, wrote in a recent note to clients. These firms, which deliver goods ordered online to customers, have risen on the back of Alibaba\u2019s success, and they could use proceeds from those share sales to expand their networks and enhance delivery capabilities, \u201cwhich eventually would help improve the quality of services for Alibaba\u2019s customers,\u201d Mr. Shi wrote.Alibaba\u2019s logistics unit is part of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company\u2019s accounting. In part because of that investigation, short-seller interest in the company has risen near peak levels in recent days, according to data from Bloomberg. Alibaba has said it is cooperating with the inquiry and has begun to disclose more information about those operations to investors.For many, earnings are simply a prelude to Singles Day, an intense shopping holiday on Nov. 11 engineered in part by Alibaba, in which the company\u2019s vendors offer major discounts. Growth in sales on the day of the event has slowed, and Alibaba is pulling out all the stops this year, featuring a slew of entertainment features including a concert by the American pop star Katy Perry.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Adviser Takes Stake in China Ride-Sharing Company", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byA hedge fund billionaire who was an economic adviser to President-elect Donald J. Trump during the campaign has taken a position in a fast-growing Chinese ride-sharing company that recently signed a deal to acquire Uber Technologies\u2019 operations in China.John Paulson, who made $15 billion betting against the housing market before the financial crisis, told his investors on Wednesday that at least one of his portfolios had taken an investment stake in Didi Chuxing, a privately owned Chinese company, said people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.The investment, by Mr. Paulson\u2019s Advantage funds, is roughly 7 percent of the assets of those portfolios, he told investors, these people said.Mr. Paulson disclosed the investment in Didi at a meeting with investors on Wednesday in New York during which he apologized for the overall poor performance of his $1.2 billion Advantage funds. His Paulson Advantage fund is down about 22 percent this year, and a leveraged version called Paulson Advantage Plus is down about 26 percent.In making the investment, Mr. Paulson is joining several prominent hedge funds and investment firms including two so-called Tiger Cubs \u2014 a nickname for firms founded by prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of hedge fund manager Julian Robertson and his Tiger Management. One of those firms, Coatue Management, founded by Philippe Laffont, made a $2 billion investment in July 2015, according to the private equity data site CrunchBase. Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global has also backed the Chinese company, as has Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point.\u201cWe expect Didi to grow into one of China\u2019s largest internet companies, resulting in significant equity appreciation over the next five years,\u201d Mr. Loeb recently told investors in a letter.While Didi has been an alluring investment because of the size of the Chinese market and the company\u2019s ability to knock out the competition by buying its two biggest local competitors \u2014 Uber\u2019s China unit and Kuaidi Dache \u2014 it could take years for the company to make money. This could make it difficult for Mr. Paulson as he faces losses at his firm and investors demand their money back.Didi faces challenges, too. In September, Chinese authorities said they were investigating antitrust concerns with Uber\u2019s planned sale of its Chinese operations to Didi.In recent years, Mr. Paulson has struggled to regain the magic that made him one of the most envied hedge fund managers on Wall Street. He got rich betting on the collapse of the subprime housing market by shorting some of the bonds backed by mortgages issued to consumers with checkered credit histories.This success \u2014 which gave him and his investors a $15 billion payday \u2014 helped him attract investment from a wide array of investors. In a 2015 financial disclosure form, Mr. Trump reported being an investor in three of Mr. Paulson\u2019s funds, including Advantage Plus. It is not known if he is still an investor.But years of poor performance and investor redemptions have taken a toll on his Paulson & Co. hedge fund firm. Total assets under management have plunged to about $12 billion from $36 billion in 2011. One of the firm\u2019s big losing bets this year is Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Its stock has fallen to $18 a share this year from about $100.Mr. Paulson has had a mixed record investing in China.His firm invested in China\u2019s Alibaba, the giant search engine company, before its public offering and made money on it. But he stumbled in 2011 on a stake in Sino Forest, a forestry company that lost most of its value after Carson Block, a short seller, issued a highly critical report that questioned its accounting practices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba, Amid Intense Hype, Confronts a Slowdown on Singles Day", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "Supported byWith clever marketing and help from an online spending boom, the Alibaba Group, in less than a decade, turned Nov. 11 into a symbol of the power of the Chinese consumer. By the end of Friday, by Alibaba\u2019s count, more than $17.7 billion had changed hands on its platforms \u2014 exceeding sales from last year\u2019s event, but a marked slowdown in growth from the previous year.Yet the very dynamics that helped Alibaba engineer the Hallmark-like holiday out of thin air have turned against it.Growth in new internet users is slowing in China, as is growth in the number of Chinese people and companies opening stores on Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms. More important, growth in the value of the goods sold on the company\u2019s platforms is decelerating.Even the numbers underlying the event \u2014 which investors scrutinize as a gauge of the health of Alibaba and the Chinese consumer \u2014 are under a cloud. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how Alibaba reports its Singles Day operating data.Pressed by investor expectations on one hand and a slowdown in growth on the other, investors are watching closely to see what Alibaba\u2019s next act will be.In response, the company has been investing billions of dollars outside China and in a number of thus-far unprofitable businesses like cloud computing. One of its biggest pushes is in entertainment, and Singles Day this year appears aimed at using show business to maintain the buzz.The event this year featured a concert by OneRepublic and appearances by Scarlett Johansson, David and Victoria Beckham, Kobe Bryant and the German soccer player Thomas M\u00fcller. (The singer Katy Perry pulled out of the event, citing a family issue.) The company has also hosted a fashion show, and it is producing a series of television shows for the holiday and introducing a Pok\u00e9mon Go type of augmented reality game.Singles Day has become a symbol of the rise of one of those sources: Chinese consumption. So widely watched is the holiday that Chinese Communist Party leaders have met with the company about the event.\u201cYou live by the sword, you die by the sword,\u201d said Duncan Clark, the founder of the investment advisory firm BDA China and an early adviser of Alibaba who has written a book about the company. \u201cAlibaba has to keep these numbers growing. A slowdown obviously wouldn\u2019t be welcomed by the government.\u201dAlibaba says sales volume is only one metric by which it judges Singles Day, and it said in a written statement that \u201cit is inevitable that the law of big numbers comes into play.\u201dSingles Day was originally an obscure, little-practiced holiday for singles in China to celebrate themselves, and it is held on Nov. 11 for the solitary feeling that the date 11/11 invokes. The company\u2019s version of the holiday was created in 2009 by Daniel Zhang, Alibaba\u2019s current chief executive, who at the time oversaw its Tmall service, the company\u2019s platform for major brands like Adidas and Disney. The promotion, which was intended to help the then-fledgling Tmall platform, posted $7.7 million in sales.Those sales were not reaped by Alibaba, however. The company uses a statistic called gross merchandise value that measures the monetary worth of transactions that flow through its services. Alibaba makes money by charging vendors on its platforms to advertise and for a percentage of sales.\u201cEver heard of a logistics company that reported the value of the goods they shipped?\u201d said Marshall Meyer, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, adding that the metric was confusing in Alibaba\u2019s context.Gross merchandise value is also not defined under accounting standards, and critics have grown increasingly skeptical of the numbers. For example, it does not include returns, which for Singles Day can be as high as 30 percent of sales, analysts say. Alibaba says that returns are usually only in the single digits.Vendors also report that there is pressure to offer steep discounts on Singles Day, ginning up even more sales volume. \u201cIf you don\u2019t lower your price as asked for Singles Day, then in future you will be less favored,\u201d said Odyssey Cheng, a merchant on Alibaba\u2019s sites who sells luxury goods and wine.Alibaba has de-emphasized the metric in recent months and no longer reports it on a quarterly basis. Still, Mr. Zhang, the holiday\u2019s originator, said in an interview that Alibaba decided it would report the number in real time throughout the holiday, as it had in the past.Alibaba, Mr. Zhang said, \u201chad a very transparent conversation with the S.E.C.\u201d He said that Singles Day was a quirk of the Chinese internet that they were proud of, \u201csomething new that didn\u2019t happen in the U.S.\u201dIf it is a novelty, it has its analogues. Perhaps the best comparison might be Apple\u2019s product unveilings each autumn. If Apple\u2019s event has an air of exclusivity and focus on products, Alibaba\u2019s is a far more boisterous, egalitarian affair, but one that turns the company into an emblem of China\u2019s economic rise.\u201cI think me and many in the industry were inspired by Jack Ma and the successful internet businesses of his time,\u201d said Mr. Cheng, the Alibaba merchant. Merchants like Mr. Cheng supply a huge chunk of Alibaba\u2019s revenue as they spend ad dollars on its websites.The same sociopolitical dynamics are at work for Singles Day, except they increasingly include the product-buying audience at home.\u201cThe economy has grown so quickly that more and more people are left with the feeling of not being able to participate fully in the economic miracle,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of the technology research firm Marbridge Consultants. \u201cAll these people now have this holiday where they can celebrate themselves.\u201dWith growth slowing, Alibaba is increasingly counting on those viewers. Last year, the company\u2019s four-hour gala attracted more than 100 million views on television and live-streaming.And Mr. Zhang said that Mr. Ma, who has stepped back from the company\u2019s day-to-day operations, was nonetheless enthusiastic about being part of the show. \u201cJack,\u201d he said, \u201cis very happy to be involved as a participant.\u201dAn article on Friday about Singles Day, an online discounting day in China, misspelled, in some editions, the name of a vendor who uses Alibaba\u2019s sales platforms.

{"Headline": "Snapchat\u2019s Parent Files for a Stock Offering", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017: that of Snapchat, the popular messaging service.The social network\u2019s parent, Snap Inc., has filed confidentially to go public, with an eye toward being valued at more than $30 billion, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday. That would make Snap the third-most-valuable technology company at the time of its market debut, after Alibaba and Facebook.The company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as March, though the final timing for an offering has not been determined.The confidential filing, made with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the presidential election last week, comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings. There have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than $50 million in the United States so far this year, down 41 percent from 2015, according to data from Renaissance Capital.A Snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like Google\u2019s in 2004. Still, like Google, Facebook and other tech companies, Snap\u2019s recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives, including its co-founder Evan Spiegel, to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded.Yet Snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors, as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging service\u2019s signature features. In August, Facebook\u2019s Instagram rolled out its version of the Snapchat Stories photo and video service.Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011, Snapchat has become a darling of the tech world, as it has grown from a simple disappearing-messages service into a digital video phenomenon. Its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generation\u2019s equivalent to television.It has built up its popular Stories service, in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers. And it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses, which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs, silly faces \u2014 or Taco Bell tacos, paid for by sponsors.Such has been the popularity of Snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service. Even the White House has set up a Snapchat account, and President Obama has given an interview on the company\u2019s in-house political show.Analysts have estimated that Snap, which began its advertising business less than two years ago, could reach $1 billion in sales next year, up from more than $350 million this year.Snap\u2019s financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed \u2014 if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares.Unlike some private companies, Snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets, so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware.This sets Snap apart from offerings from Square and Box. Both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders. When Square went public last November, some investors received an additional 10.3 million shares, which came at the expense of other investors.Similarly, when Box went public in 2014, some of the company\u2019s earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares.\u201cSnapchat will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the market,\u201d said Doug Bontemps, Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s managing director of corporate finance. \u201cBut Snapchat is unique. It\u2019s growing quickly, is doing some interesting things with glasses and has gotten a lot of attention. There aren\u2019t a lot of that ilk.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of days in which companies must publicly disclose their offering documents before pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors. It is 15 days, not 21.Advertisement"}
