{"Headline": "Trying Snap\u2019s Spectacles: Live With the Look, Enjoy the View", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported bySpectacles, the first hardware product released by the company that makes the popular photo-messaging app Snapchat, are large, whimsically goofy sunglasses with a camera embedded in the frame.It takes some courage to put them on. But I did so anyway \u2014 and I\u2019m glad I did.The greater likelihood is that you\u2019ll come off as if you\u2019re trying too hard, especially if you\u2019ve got the red or teal Specs. (They also come in a more staid black.) It\u2019s possible members of your family will laugh every time you look in their direction, that your spouse will openly question your maturity and sanity, and your offspring will threaten to disown you. What I\u2019m saying is, it takes a certain personality to pull these off, and your humble-nerd correspondent may not be in possession of said style.But ignore the haters. Whatever your head shape, if you are lucky enough to find some Spectacles this season, you will be getting your eyes behind one of the most compelling new gadgets to be released by a major technology company in years.But Spectacles are worth the titters and strange looks. For a first-generation piece of hardware, these glasses are remarkably well designed, thoroughly useful and completely fun. More than that, they may be lighting the way to a future in which you might finally pull your face away from your phone when anything interesting happens around you.I won\u2019t spend much time detailing how Spectacles work because there isn\u2019t much to say. Like any sunglasses, you slide them over your face when you go outside. When you see something interesting, tap the button near your left temple to snap a 10-second video of the scene. (A small light shines while you\u2019re recording, to prevent spying.) Later on, look at Snapchat on your phone to view, share, caption, draw on or otherwise edit the clips you\u2019ve captured from your Specs.If you aren\u2019t a regular Snapchat user, these glasses are probably not for you, but it is possible to export the videos you capture to your phone\u2019s camera roll. The video quality isn\u2019t spectacular, but it\u2019s surprisingly good; in well-lit areas (which are the main places you\u2019ll be wearing sunglasses) your videos will be nearly as good as those you shoot with your phone.In other ways, Spectacles surpass any phone. Over the last decade, smartphone cameras have intruded upon every corner of life. This has been magical \u2014 I have fantastic pictures of my family that I\u2019d never have captured without my phone \u2014 but it also creates an uncomfortable distance. My children\u2019s primary memory of me is of my face staring at them through a five-inch piece of glass.Spectacles collapse that distance. You can snap a memorable moment without ever leaving the moment. Your eyes are your viewfinder; just reach up and tap, and whatever you look at is recorded.It\u2019s not just that Specs let you remain in the moment. When you play back what you captured from the glasses, you return to the moment more easily. The images I snapped with my Specs over Thanksgiving weekend are deeper, more real and more emotionally evocative than most other snapshots I usually shoot.I think this has to do with point of view. When you take a picture with a camera, you are usually cropping an ideal shot that bears little resemblance to what you actually saw. But Specs don\u2019t idealize the present. Because you just shoot what you see, the images seem to jog deeper memories about what happened when you were there. It\u2019s a trippy sensation, and one I couldn\u2019t resist.There are other thoughtful details in Specs. When you\u2019re just out shooting, they don\u2019t need your phone nearby to work. They come with a charging case made of delightfully tactile, grippy material (you can shoot about 100 clips per charge). And the lenses are mirrored, so you can see yourself when you turn the Specs around for selfies.Mostly, though, I was surprised by the degree of finish from a new gadget. From the Apple Watch to the Oculus Rift, a lot of new hardware released in the last couple of years has failed to deliver on its early hype. Spectacles are different. They\u2019re real, and they\u2019re spectacular.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is \u2018Empathy\u2019 Really What the Nation Needs?", "Date": "2016-11-29", "News": "Supported byFirst Words\u201cEmpathy\u201d is one of Facebook\u2019s all-time favorite buzzwords. For years, Zuckerberg has hopped from conference to conference in a selection of muted hoodies and T-shirts, delivering variations on the same pitch. \u201cMore people are using Facebook to share more stuff,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cThat means that if we want, there\u2019s more out there that we can go look at and research and understand what\u2019s going on with the people around us. And I just think that leads to broader empathy, understanding \u2014 just a lot of good, core, human things that make society function better.\u201d If you think Facebook may have had a hand in tipping popular opinion toward Trump, Zuckerberg seemed to suggest at the Ritz, then something was wrong with you \u2014 something that could be fixed by spending more time on Facebook.But there is a curiously strategic underpinning to these calls for empathy, too. Empathy, after all, is not sympathy. Sympathy encourages a close affinity with other people: You feel their pain. Empathy suggests something more technical \u2014 a dispassionate approach to understanding the emotions of others. And these days, it often seems to mean understanding their pain just enough to get something out of it \u2014 to manipulate political, technological and consumerist outcomes in our own favor.A century later, the rise of social networking means our interactions are once again mediated through our relationship with objects. The theorist Marshall McLuhan once assumed this computerization of culture would lead to a rise in empathetic connection. \u201cThe aspiration of our time for wholeness, empathy and depth of awareness is a natural adjunct of electric technology,\u201d he wrote in \u201cUnderstanding Media,\u201d published in 1964; the computer promised a \u201cPentecostal condition of universal understanding and unity.\u201d But it wound up offering something else too: a convenient alternative to costly, messy interactions with human beings. What social networks like Facebook really offer is empathy in the aggregate \u2014 an illusion of having captured the mood of entire families and friend networks from a safe, neutral distance. Then they turn around and offer advertisers a read on more than a billion users at once. Buzz Andersen \u2014 a tech veteran who has worked for Apple, Tumblr and Square \u2014 told me that in Silicon Valley, \u201cempathy is basically a more altruistic-sounding way of saying \u2018market research.\u2019\u2009\u201dAnd in a marketplace, you\u2019re not trying to understand other people out of altruism or moral responsibility; you\u2019re doing it out of self-interest. In the days after the election, many commenters chafed at the idea that they ought to perform the work of empathizing with Trump\u2019s supporters. Shouldn\u2019t they \u2014 the people who elected him \u2014 try a little empathy for the lives that stand to be crushed by his policies? The market\u2019s answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d There is no movement for right-wing Americans to be more empathetic because they won. The nation has already bought what they were selling. The call for blue-staters to cultivate empathy isn\u2019t about finding instructive truths in others\u2019 worldviews; it\u2019s about understanding their motivations well enough to persuade them to vote differently.On a recent rainy day, I left my office to see empathy leveraged in yet another way. Upworthy, a purveyor of feel-good viral content, had constructed a pop-up \u201cempathy lab\u201d in a nearby park. A black curtain was pulled around a chair and a computer outfitted with software that could map the face at 500 points and analyze its emotional expressions. Participants watched a video \u2014 in my case, a short clip about a young boy with Down syndrome.Outside, a crowd watched a Jumbotron, on which squiggly lines tracked the participant\u2019s empathetic expressions against the average reaction. At the video\u2019s conclusion, an \u201cempathy score\u201d flashed on the screen. Upworthy is invested in empathy because it has found that emotionally engaging content shares well on Facebook \u2014 but also, its reps say, because it can prompt real-world action. Upworthy\u2019s business model relies mainly on the former.Shortly after I arrived, a woman emerged from behind the curtain to spontaneous applause. She had received an empathy rating of 98 \u2014 the day\u2019s high score. It was an odd image, like Facebook projected into real life: A woman lauded for sitting alone, watching a video. In the Victorian era, some critics worried that moralistic novels would channel people\u2019s sympathy into books instead of out into the world. Facebook takes it a step further, rerouting our attempts at empathetic connection back at us. When we reach out to one another, we\u2019re often just feeling ourselves.Amanda Hess is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Biggest Spike in Traffic Deaths in 50 Years? Blame Apps", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byThe messaging app Snapchat allows motorists to post photos that record the speed of the vehicle. The navigation app Waze rewards drivers with points when they report traffic jams and accidents. Even the game Pok\u00e9mon Go has drivers searching for virtual creatures on the nation\u2019s highways.When distracted driving entered the national consciousness a decade ago, the problem was mainly people who made calls or sent texts from their cellphones. The solution then was to introduce new technologies to keep drivers\u2019 hands on the wheel. Innovations since then \u2014 car Wi-Fi and a host of new apps \u2014 have led to a boom in internet use in vehicles that safety experts say is contributing to a surge in highway deaths.After steady declines over the last four decades, highway fatalities last year recorded the largest annual percentage increase in 50 years. And the numbers so far this year are even worse. In the first six months of 2016, highway deaths jumped 10.4 percent, to 17,775, from the comparable period of 2015, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\u201cThis is a crisis that needs to be addressed now,\u201d Mark R. Rosekind, the head of the agency, said in an interview.Alarmed by the statistics, the Department of Transportation in October outlined a plan to work with the National Safety Council and other advocacy groups to devise a \u201cRoad to Zero\u201d strategy, with the ambitious goal of eliminating roadway fatalities within 30 years.The Obama administration\u2019s transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, said that the near-term effort would involve identifying changes in regulations, laws and standards that could help reduce fatalities. That might include pushing for all states to tighten and enforce laws requiring use of seatbelts in cars and helmets on motorcycles, while cracking down on distracted or drunken driving. The effort might also include tougher regulation of heavy trucks, Mr. Foxx said.A second, related effort would focus on setting longer-term goals and speeding the introduction of autonomous-driving technologies that many safety experts say have the potential to prevent accidents by removing distracted humans from the driving equation.One concern so far, though, is that current generations of automated driver-assistance systems, like the Autopilot feature offered by Tesla Motors, may be lulling some drivers into a false sense of security that can contribute to distracted driving.Whether highway safety officials in the Trump administration will have the same priorities, though, is too soon to say. The names of candidates for transportation secretary have not yet been publicly floated.Most new vehicles sold today have software that connects to a smartphone and allows drivers to place phone calls, dictate texts and use apps hands-free. Ford Motor has its Sync system, for example. Others, including Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz, offer their own interfaces as well as Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto.Automakers say these systems enable customers to concentrate on driving even while interacting with their smartphones.\u201cThe whole principle is to bring voice recognition to customers so they can keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel,\u201d said Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford, which began installing Sync in cars in 2007.Since then, the company has added features to reduce distractions, like a \u201cdo not disturb button\u201d that lets drivers block incoming calls and texts.CarPlay allows use of the iPhone\u2019s Siri virtual assistant to answer phone calls, dictate texts and control apps like Spotify and Pandora. Both Sync and CarPlay present simplified menus on a car\u2019s in-dash display to reduce driver distraction and turn off the phone\u2019s screen, eliminating the temptation to use the device itself.But Deborah Hersman, president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the federal National Transportation Safety Board, said it was not clear how much those various technologies reduced distraction \u2014 or, instead, encouraged people to use even more functions on their phones while driving. And freeing the drivers\u2019 hands does not necessarily clear their heads.\u201cIt\u2019s the cognitive workload on your brain that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Ms. Hersman said.Technology in some new cars is meant to reduce driver distractions or compensate for them.Dr. William Chandler, a retired neurosurgeon in Ann Arbor, Mich., just bought a 2017 BMW X5 sport utility vehicle that warns him if he drifts out of his lane on the highway or if a car is in his blind spot. His favorite feature is a heads-up display on the windshield in front of him that projects his speed, the speed limit and navigation information.\u201cIt puts all the directions and turns right there in my field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real safety factor for distracted driving, because I\u2019m never looking at the map on the screen in the console.\u201dBut new cars make up only a small portion of the 260 million vehicles on the road in the United States. Digital diversion is harder to address in older models.Brett Hudson, 26, a teacher at a charter school in Jackson, Mich., said his iPhone 6 Plus had become essential to his daily commute in his 2002 Chevrolet TrailBlazer. He uses Apple Maps for navigation, listens to music via Pandora and gets his favorite Michigan football call-in show on iHeart Radio.To reduce the time he looks at the phone, Mr. Hudson installed an aftermarket Bluetooth system for hands-free phone calls. He mounts the iPhone on a clip attached to an air vent, enabling him to see the screen while still keeping the road in his field of vision.Mr. Hudson concedes that the setup is not risk-free.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that when I do have to touch the phone,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018my brain becomes so totally focused, even in that short period of time, and I don\u2019t really remember what\u2019s happening on the road in those four or five seconds.\u201dInsurance companies, which closely track auto accidents, are convinced that the increasing use of electronic devices while driving is the biggest cause of the rise in road fatalities, according to Robert Gordon, a senior vice president of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\u201cThis is a serious public safety concern for the nation,\u201d Mr. Gordon said at a recent conference in Washington held by the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cWe are all trying to figure out to what extent this is the new normal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Samsung Takes Sensible Course in Bid for Harman International", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsSamsung is riding a stallion instead of a unicorn into the driverless revolution. Despite no stated cost savings, the 28 percent premium the Korean electronics group agreed to pay for Harman International, a connected-car supplier, is reasonable. Companies like Google are investing heavily to invent the automotive future as General Motors and others bet on risky start-ups. This deal suggests there are safer ways to play a mega-trend in the making.The $8 billion price looks opportunistic and fair for a company that will jump-start Samsung\u2019s presence in what it expects to be a $100 billion market by 2025. Harman\u2019s shares hit a three-year low in June, reflecting concerns that car suppliers face tougher times as the long post-crisis boom in American auto sales fades. General Motors last week underscored the worries by announcing a reduction of 2,000 jobs at factories in the United States, after news of similar cuts by Ford Motor.Despite the turn, Harman has been trying to position itself for the longer term. While it is best known for its JBL speakers, features like navigation, infotainment, communications and car safety accounted for nearly half of Harman\u2019s sales in the last year. They are likely to grow in importance as computers take over from humans at the wheel.A lack of advertised cost cuts probably means that Samsung, which plans to run Harman as an independent subsidiary, will have to rely on revenue gains to recoup its investment. It would only take slashing costs equivalent to 4 percent of next year\u2019s sales to cover the premium, but it is also reasonable to think that combining Samsung\u2019s products with Harman\u2019s brands and customers could result in faster growth than either company could manage separately.That makes Harman a more sensible way to gain exposure to the next generation of cars than building technology from scratch the way Google, Apple and Uber are doing. Similarly, investments such as the $500 million GM made in Lyft, the ride-sharing company, and its $1 billion-plus acquisition of Cruise Automation, the software venture, offer huge upside, but with accompanying risk. Harman should be a good ride down the middle of the road.Kevin Allison is a columnist at Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will.i.am Moves Wearables Off the Wrist With the Help of Kendall Jenner and Apple", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayWearable technology is finally beginning to go beyond the wrist.\u201cWhy should you have to take off your earphones when you finish listening to something and put them back in a box or bag, instead of just wearing them around your neck like jewelry?\u201dIt is the kind of question that, when voiced (especially by a coach of \u201cThe Voice UK\u201d), seems enormously obvious, but, apparently, has not occurred to any of us to ask. And it clearly reflects some of the issues in bridging the gulf between fashion and technology: It\u2019s not the products that are the problem, but figuring out what the products should be and what we want our stuff to do.The question did occur, however, to Will.i.am, whose full name is William Adams. So he created an answer.\u201cYou know, we all love buying shoes to match our outfits and bags to match our outfits, but for some reason we don\u2019t expect our technology to match our outfits,\u201d Will.i.am said. \u201cWhy not? Why should we just accept that? What I want to do is change that.\u201dAesthetically speaking, though, you might think of Buttons as the anti-AirPod, Apple\u2019s wireless earphones that, when introduced in September, were compared to tampons and \u201cear cigarettes.\u201d So it will be interesting to see how Buttons are received. To me, they seem like most first-run products: a great idea, but the reality could use some tweaking.The discs, after all, are the most attractive, fashion-y part of the product, but they are also where the magnets reside, so when worn as a necklace they are inside what is effectively the pendant, and the ear piece is what sticks out. As a result, instead of looking like a medallion, which would be a cool addition to an outfit, giving it a 1970s edge, it looks kind of like a little rubber angel. Or a pair of earphones worn around the neck.Still, my guess is that things may evolve: Will.i.am has enlisted a host of major fashion names in his cause. Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell joined the company as partners and ambassadors, and model the new product in its campaign.\u201cKendall represents the new millennial face of fashion, and Naomi is the queen of fashion,\u201d Will.i.am said, explaining why he asked them to get involved. Also adding fashion heft and taste is Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, who has joined as style and fashion director. And Kering, the parent company of Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, is an investor.Together, they are gearing up for a series of introductions of connected fashion technology products in the next year that will include Button bomber jackets, with connected collars, and Button chokers.Meanwhile, Will.i.am plans to involve other collaborators \u2014 musicians, athletes \u2014 to create an ecosystem of advisers on what people wear in all parts of life.\u201cI never wanted to do fashion from a me-too perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to add to the conversation.\u201dTune in to see who is listening.Advertisement"}

But on Thursday, the American search giant tried to portray itself as a stalwart of online competition as it responded to European antitrust charges that it had restricted consumers\u2019 choices and hamstrung its competitors.Google responded on Thursday to two European antitrust charges, saying that its services helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find the digital information they seek online. The company said that the strength in Europe of other American technology companies, like Amazon, showed that Google had not restricted the local digital market.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cWe\u2019re confident these cases will ultimately be decided based on the facts,\u201d he wrote, adding that Google\u2019s products \u201cbenefited consumers and merchants, and expanded competition.\u201dGoogle worries that Europe\u2019s antitrust efforts may eventually hurt its lucrative business model, particularly if it is forced to open up some of its dominant digital services to rivals.For the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, the standoff with Google has become a litmus test for its ability to rein in a dominant technology company, one that has a roughly 90 percent market share in online search in the region. A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment on Google\u2019s antitrust response.The end to the back and forth will not come overnight. The European authorities must now review Google\u2019s rebuttals, and decisions in the cases are not expected until early next summer. The company can then appeal, prolonging the legal wrangling.But for Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, an online marketplace for Android smartphone apps, who has filed a complaint against Google, the antitrust cases are necessary to give European companies the space to compete against their much larger American rival.\u201cOur growth is being slowed down because of Google\u2019s dominant position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s at stake.

{"Headline": "Trump Adviser Takes Stake in China Ride-Sharing Company", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byA hedge fund billionaire who was an economic adviser to President-elect Donald J. Trump during the campaign has taken a position in a fast-growing Chinese ride-sharing company that recently signed a deal to acquire Uber Technologies\u2019 operations in China.John Paulson, who made $15 billion betting against the housing market before the financial crisis, told his investors on Wednesday that at least one of his portfolios had taken an investment stake in Didi Chuxing, a privately owned Chinese company, said people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.The investment, by Mr. Paulson\u2019s Advantage funds, is roughly 7 percent of the assets of those portfolios, he told investors, these people said.Mr. Paulson disclosed the investment in Didi at a meeting with investors on Wednesday in New York during which he apologized for the overall poor performance of his $1.2 billion Advantage funds. His Paulson Advantage fund is down about 22 percent this year, and a leveraged version called Paulson Advantage Plus is down about 26 percent.In making the investment, Mr. Paulson is joining several prominent hedge funds and investment firms including two so-called Tiger Cubs \u2014 a nickname for firms founded by prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of hedge fund manager Julian Robertson and his Tiger Management. One of those firms, Coatue Management, founded by Philippe Laffont, made a $2 billion investment in July 2015, according to the private equity data site CrunchBase. Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global has also backed the Chinese company, as has Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point.\u201cWe expect Didi to grow into one of China\u2019s largest internet companies, resulting in significant equity appreciation over the next five years,\u201d Mr. Loeb recently told investors in a letter.While Didi has been an alluring investment because of the size of the Chinese market and the company\u2019s ability to knock out the competition by buying its two biggest local competitors \u2014 Uber\u2019s China unit and Kuaidi Dache \u2014 it could take years for the company to make money. This could make it difficult for Mr. Paulson as he faces losses at his firm and investors demand their money back.Didi faces challenges, too. In September, Chinese authorities said they were investigating antitrust concerns with Uber\u2019s planned sale of its Chinese operations to Didi.In recent years, Mr. Paulson has struggled to regain the magic that made him one of the most envied hedge fund managers on Wall Street. He got rich betting on the collapse of the subprime housing market by shorting some of the bonds backed by mortgages issued to consumers with checkered credit histories.This success \u2014 which gave him and his investors a $15 billion payday \u2014 helped him attract investment from a wide array of investors. In a 2015 financial disclosure form, Mr. Trump reported being an investor in three of Mr. Paulson\u2019s funds, including Advantage Plus. It is not known if he is still an investor.But years of poor performance and investor redemptions have taken a toll on his Paulson & Co. hedge fund firm. Total assets under management have plunged to about $12 billion from $36 billion in 2011. One of the firm\u2019s big losing bets this year is Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Its stock has fallen to $18 a share this year from about $100.Mr. Paulson has had a mixed record investing in China.His firm invested in China\u2019s Alibaba, the giant search engine company, before its public offering and made money on it. But he stumbled in 2011 on a stake in Sino Forest, a forestry company that lost most of its value after Carson Block, a short seller, issued a highly critical report that questioned its accounting practices.Advertisement"}

Even so, Target needs more customers wandering its aisles over the holiday season and a sustainable plan to compete with Amazon.By most accounts, Target turned things around in its latest quarter. Although overall revenue tumbled nearly 7 percent for the three months ending Oct. 29, to $16 billion, the company surpassed profit and sales forecasts. More high-margin apparel, home and baby items flew off the shelves. E-commerce revenue also grew a healthy 26 percent.The results, which sent Target shares up almost 7 percent on Wednesday, represent a stark turnaround from the previous quarter, when the company blamed a drop in demand for Apple iPhones and such for its weakness. A rocky grocery business and management shake-ups augured more challenges. In August, it cut its full-year earnings expectations.This latest improvement may be short-lived, however. The retailer\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell, was peppier about the final months of the year but not especially cheery. Target expects comparable-store sales to be flat this quarter. Restoring growth in foot traffic is a priority.Marketing its more than 1,000 retail locations as pickup destinations for online orders can help. So, too, should opening stores in cities like New York. Amazon\u2019s product breadth and ever-speedier home delivery are formidable, however. Walmart also is plowing headlong into digital with the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. Trading at just 13 times earnings, below many of its peers, could make Target a mark for investors.

And after six hours of waiting \u2014 first in the wintry cold, and then in a sparsely decorated pop-up store off Fifth Avenue \u2014 I finally claimed mine.First, a primer. Spectacles are sunglasses with embedded cameras that Snapchat introduced two months ago with the aim of funneling ever more videos to its service. The $130 eyewear records 10-second videos and then wirelessly sends them to the user\u2019s Snapchat app.It\u2019s too early to say whether the trendy sunglasses will succeed at that. But it\u2019s no joke to say that they have quickly drawn a following in Manhattan.Snapchat has kept the locations of its Spectacles pop-up stores secret \u2014 they\u2019ve appeared in the Los Angeles area; at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.; in Tulsa, Okla.; and even the Grand Canyon \u2014 but a pop-up in Midtown Manhattan by the glass-cubed Apple Store was sure to grab attention.The attendees were a mix of those whom one might expect and those one might not. Three staff members from the ad agency McCann gathered behind me. One of them, Timothy Min, an ad director, had dashed into the line out of breath, having commuted from Brooklyn via Citi Bike, subway and a frenzied run.There were men in suits and loafers and some apparent tourists.At least one victorious buyer walked back down the line, wearing one pair of Spectacles while hawking the other pair that he had bought with gusto. \u201cFour hundred and you can leave the line!\u201d he shouted. It\u2019s unclear whether he found any takers.Reporters from USA Today and other outlets descended, along with the temperature. By 9:30 a.m., Snapchat employees had handed out wristbands to some of those in line, demarcating in purple plastic who was assured an opportunity to buy up to two pairs of Spectacles. I received the second-to-last bracelet.By about 12:30 p.m., the last of us were ushered into the pop-up space, which had once housed the restaurant and cafe Bottega del Vino. Once warmly decorated, it was now rendered stark white, with brick walls and an exposed industrial ceiling. Television monitors hung from one wall, rotating as they displayed footage captured from Spectacles.At the far end, standing apart from the crowd, was the bright yellow \u201cSnapbot\u201d vending machine that dispensed the glasses.Even inside, time passed slowly. Word circulated that the Snapbot was having trouble reading some credit cards. Some customers were busy taking videos of themselves and others buying the glasses. Mr. Min of McCann worried that he would run late for meetings that he had already postponed on account of his consumerist adventure.Debates arose over which colors to get: stylish black, colorful blue or ostentatious coral. A Snapchat staff member said the most popular choice was black, followed by the teal-like blue. All decisions were final.Several people sat on the floor, peering intently at their smartphones. A few others animatedly discussed how much they could sell their Spectacles for.Though the line was officially cut off two people behind me, a lengthy crowd remained outside. One man pressed his nose against the glass, then placed his palm against the store window while taking a picture of it, a portrait of melodramatic forlornness.Around 1:15 p.m., the store\u2019s white blinds began to descend, slowly closing off the view of the store from the crowd on 59th Street. Perhaps it was to prevent the appearance of pictures of a half-empty boutique.Just before 3 p.m., my turn at the Snapbot finally came up. The vending machine has three giant buttons representing the colors of Spectacles, with a round screen kitted out with Snapchat\u2019s famed lens technology, virtually placing a pair of the glasses on my face as I made my decision. Within five minutes, and after two swipes of my card, I walked away with two pairs, one black and one blue.By 3 p.m., the final customer \u2014 Joey Pennacchio, the creative director for a video game start-up in Los Angeles, who snagged a wristband from a departing customer and persuaded Snapchat employees to let him into the store \u2014 took his turn at the Snapbot. After handing his phone to a security guard to take video of the buying experience, Mr. Pennacchio bought blue and coral Spectacles.\u201cI\u2019m super stoked to get my hands on them,\u201d Mr. Pennacchio said before his purchase. \u201cI came in with pretty low expectations, but the vending machine is pretty cool.\u201dSnapchat employees cheered at the end of their 10-hour workday. The minimalist store would be cleaned up and prepared for the crowds that would surely be lined up when it was scheduled to reopen on Tuesday afternoon.Mr. Pennacchio and I walked out of the store \u2014 and within minutes of leaving, he told me that he had found a taker for one pair, for $450.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Helped Create Trump, and That\u2019s Bad for It", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the election of Donald J. Trump, technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency.Facebook and Google, for example, have both carried fake, frequently incendiary, articles that were highly shared by their users; Twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well, while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far-right hate groups organize and recruit, frequently targeting women and minorities on the site.The leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldn\u2019t try to police political debates. Facebook explains that it can\u2019t be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization.Nice try. These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels. They see America as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The American auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia. Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, said on Twitter that \u201cDetroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity. That is what is to be avoided.\u201dHere is the explanation from Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn\u2019s founder and a Clinton supporter, for Detroit\u2019s failures: \u201cThe overriding problem was this: The auto industry got too comfortable,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cThe Start-Up of You\u201d (the title alone speaks volumes). \u201cThe moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular.\u201d He also attacked any notion of continuity: \u201cInstead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst, they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism.\u201dMr. Hoffman goes further, arguing that it\u2019s not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world. People must harness them, as well.\u201cThe conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen next. Information is limited. Resources are tight. Competition is fierce. The world is changing. And the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking. This means you need to be adapting all the time. And if you fail to adapt, no one \u2014 not your employer, not the government \u2014 is going to catch you when you fall.\u201dIt\u2019s an exhausting, Darwinian life he is describing \u2014 endlessly adapting to a changing, pitiless world. And it\u2019s precisely the opposite kind of life that Mr. Trump was espousing. His voters wish to return to the inefficient, enthusiastically nepotistic (you might call it family-based) factory life of the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 when America was great. Mr. Trump promised to bring his supporters\u2019 jobs back; the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy.It\u2019s unclear how Mr. Trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy. But at least he wasn\u2019t publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working Uber driver.There is one final irony. Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals. In the election, the biggest beneficiary of disruption was Mr. Trump, who defied all rules around decency, responsibility, truthfulness, consistency and even social custom, like releasing tax returns. And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied. Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalism also threatens the global consensus that is so important to the expansion of the tech giants. Yesterday, Russian authorities blocked LinkedIn over a data storage law.How do you like your disruption now?Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Wins if California Voters Tax E-Cigarettes?", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported byWearing a white lab coat, the doctor looks straight at the camera and explains why Californians should vote against higher taxes on tobacco products.\u201cI do everything in my power to stop people from smoking, but that\u2019s not what Prop 56 is really about,\u201d says Dr. Arnold Zeiderman, an obstetrician. The proposed new tax, he says, is really about lining the pockets of \u201cwealthy special interests.\u201dIn addition to placing higher taxes on cigarettes, the measure would tax electronic cigarettes just like other tobacco products for the first time.The measure is a potential boon for state coffers but is also considered a major threat by the tobacco industry, which relies increasingly on its e-cigarette business.Similar fights are playing out across the country. Cigarette companies have spent nearly $4 million to defeat a ballot measure in North Dakota on Tuesday that would also impose a tax on e-cigarettes. This year, at least 17 other states considered legislation to tax e-cigarettes, but only Pennsylvania and West Virginia actually did, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.But nowhere has the fight been more heated than in California, where progressive legislation is often seen as a bellwether for other states. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco and Philip Morris, both of which have their own e-cigarette units, have spent more than $70 million collectively on ads, mailers and other efforts to defeat the ballot measure, making it one of the industry\u2019s most expensive political campaigns.The new taxes could add up to millions of dollars for states, making up for some of the revenue lost as cigarette sales have fallen. Last year, for example, California collected about $750 million from cigarette taxes, down from more than $1 billion in 2005, according to a report from the consulting firm Orzechowski and Walker.But taxes will not affect just big tobacco companies. A number of small vape shops have closed since Pennsylvania\u2019s new 40 percent tax on the wholesale price of e-cigarettes, also called vape pens, went into effect on Oct. 1.At Vegas Vapes in Bryn Mawr, outside Philadelphia, a sign that says \u201cZero Vape Shops = Zero Tax Collected\u201d hangs in the window. The owner, Raffi Farraj, said he had to pass on some of that cost to customers, but not so much that it drives business away.\u201cIf I ate all 40 percent, I\u2019d be closed by the end of the year,\u201d Mr. Farraj said. \u201cIf I charged 40 percent, I\u2019d be closed by the end of the year.\u201dSo far, though, any potential new restrictions appear to be years away. Under the new rule, e-cigarette companies have two years to submit scientific information to the F.D.A. for approval.And the industry is trying to use that timing to its advantage. Until the agency knows more, manufacturers say, it is unfair to tax e-cigarettes the same way as cigarettes.\u201cIt could impede adult consumer interest in vapor products before F.D.A. has had the opportunity to develop a full regulatory approach,\u201d said David Sutton, a spokesman for Altria. The company owns Philip Morris, one of the world\u2019s largest tobacco companies, and the e-cigarette company Nu Mark.Still, groups like the American Lung Association have seized on the F.D.A.\u2019s decision as evidence that more restrictions on e-cigarettes are necessary.\u201cSo much of the product research on them has been limited,\u201d said Erika Sward, the assistant vice president for national advocacy at the lung association. \u201cThe comparison cannot be whether they are as lethal as cigarettes. The comparison is what their impact is on the public health.\u201dThe association has expressed particular concern about children. E-cigarettes can come in flavors like strawberry and apple. Health advocates argue that such flavors entice young people, who are then more inclined to move to cigarettes.\u201cE-cigarettes are a very important element of recruiting kids,\u201d said Mr. Glantz of the center for tobacco research.The \u201cstandard mantra\u201d on cigarette taxes, Ms. Sward said, is that every 10 percent increase yields a 3 to 4 percent decline in smoking among adults, and a 7 percent decline among young people.\u201cKids are really price sensitive,\u201d Mr. Glantz said. \u201cKeeping the price of e-cigarettes low is really important to the tobacco companies.\u201dIn a statement, Blue Shield said it was supporting Proposition 56 because raising taxes was a proven public health approach that would save its members from a \u201clifetime of addiction.\u201dIn addition, some in the vaping industry have criticized health advocates for their ties to pharmaceutical giants. The lung association, for example, has received millions of dollars from Pfizer\u2019s foundation. Pfizer makes Chantix, a drug to help people quit smoking.In a follow-up statement, Ms. Sward of the lung association said that corporate foundations were an \u201cimportant pillar in funding nonprofits.\u201d\u201cNo funder influences our position, agenda or science-based messages,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Puts Slack in Cross Hairs With New Office Chat App", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byREDMOND, Wash. \u2014 In the last couple of years at Microsoft, some old habits have been tossed away, like obsessively placing Windows software at the center of all the company\u2019s big bets. But the company would still dig trenches to protect Office, its $23-billion-a-year software franchise.Microsoft on Wednesday took the wraps off Microsoft Teams, an addition to the Office package that will allow professionals to huddle virtually with colleagues in private chat rooms to talk about anything from work projects to where to get lunch.If you think Microsoft Teams sounds a little like Slack, the relatively new chat service that has pulses pounding among Silicon Valley investors and customers, you would be correct.In fact, if this were 1997, a more bellicose time at Microsoft, people inside the company would be whispering that the new application was a Slack killer. But the tone is different these days, even if the intent is essentially the same.\u201cLook, my job No. 1 is to make sure that the 85 million users I have on Office 365, we go meet their needs and keep growing that base,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference room last week on the Microsoft campus. \u201cThis is not to take away any success anyone else has. We\u2019ve always had lots of tools out here that have competed and also coexisted.\u201dMicrosoft Teams is the most significant new addition in years to Office 365, the current name of the Microsoft software suite, which has over the years migrated from the PC to become a product delivered over the internet that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other applications. Bill Gates, a Microsoft co-founder and now technology adviser, even had a hand in its creation.The reception to Microsoft Teams will help determine whether Mr. Nadella, who became chief executive of the company in early 2014, can extend his recent run of success.Microsoft plans to use distribution, an old standby, to get people using Microsoft Teams, bundling it with the business version of Office 365 at no additional cost.\u201cWe are orders of magnitude bigger in terms of the users we serve,\u201d said Rajesh Jha, executive vice president of Office Engineering at Microsoft.Customers generally pay $5 to $20 a month to subscribe to Office 365. Mr. Nadella\u2019s 85 million figure is the number of active monthly business users of the software.\u201cThat\u2019s where Microsoft has an inherent advantage around security,\u201d Mr. Diwan said.\u201cThe moral of the story is if you\u2019re a large incumbent with many lines of business, it is incredibly difficult to take on a smaller, focused start-up that has traction in the market,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive of Slack, which took out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on Wednesday welcoming Microsoft to the market.What\u2019s more, most people are using Slack because they want to, not because it is being shoved down their throats by a corporate I.T. department. Slack has been embraced by many as a more efficient way for teams to communicate than email, which is not designed for real-time conversations.Messages in Slack are archived and searchable, and people can use it on mobile devices and PCs. Mr. Butterfield said Slack had particularly helped create more transparency across boundaries inside companies, allowing, for example, marketing teams to see what sales staff are talking about and engineers to eavesdrop on product designers.In a demonstration last week at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters, executives showed how Microsoft Teams both resembles Slack and adds to its innovations. Like Slack, the software lets people pepper their messages with GIFs and emojis. There are also ways of connecting Microsoft Teams with other applications and services like Twitter and GitHub.The most noticeable difference is that Microsoft Teams organizes conversations into threads, grouping messages on the same topic to make conversations easier to follow than they are in Slack\u2019s unthreaded message streams. It has customizable tabs for making it simpler to get to commonly used services and files, like budget spreadsheets.Mira Lane, principal architect of Microsoft Teams, demonstrated how people could spontaneously start videoconferences inside the software if they would rather hash things out face to face. \u201cIt\u2019s a really low-friction way of having an ad hoc meeting,\u201d Ms. Lane said.Mr. Butterfield of Slack said the service had plans to support both threaded conversations and videoconferencing in the future.Microsoft began working on Microsoft Teams about 18 months ago, after Mr. Gates encouraged Brian MacDonald, a respected Microsoft engineer credited with creating Outlook, the company\u2019s flagship email application, to come up with a new take on productivity applications.\u201cWe\u2019d have pretty frequent conversations, sometimes group reviews, sometimes one-on-ones,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said. \u201cHe\u2019d send me big, long memos to consume. I\u2019d send him a few ideas back. It was great.\u201dMicrosoft does not always build a new product when it wants to expand the range of Office. About four years ago, it paid $1.2 billion to acquire Yammer, a social networking app that had found a following in the tech industry. So did Microsoft consider buying Slack?\u201cIt\u2019s not something that I looked at,\u201d Mr. Nadella said, adding that he did not know if others who work for him seriously considered it.Mr. Butterfield declined to say whether he was approached by anyone from Microsoft about a deal, but it would not have mattered if someone had. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been pretty clear publicly, and in private conversations with everyone else in the industry, that we have no interest in being acquired,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Rajesh Jha. He is executive vice president of Office Engineering, not corporate vice president. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a picture caption.Advertisement"}

Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the United States, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads.Apple\u2019s rapid growth here in central Texas, where it now employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world\u2019s largest technology company and their economic impact.At Apple\u2019s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company\u2019s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them.Employees here help run Apple\u2019s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company\u2019s American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple\u2019s products.The Austin campus \u2014 the company\u2019s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. \u2014 offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy.Although contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.Apple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States.\u201cApple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\u201dLast week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple\u2019s public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised.Genny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a crazy technical background to do this job,\u201d Ms. Lopez said. \u201cA lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\u201dApple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages \u2014 12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone \u2014 and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer.Employees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M.B.A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple.The region\u2019s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple\u2019s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone.\u201cThere is a high road, and Apple followed that path,\u201d said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. \u201cIt sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.\u201dA mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple\u2019s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware.Flex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.Apple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand.Larger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to ship a phone, and it\u2019s harder to ship a computer,\u201d said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. \u201cAnd it\u2019s harder still for cars and refrigerators.\u201dOver time, the value of Apple\u2019s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. \u201cThere are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is probably more gender equity. And it\u2019s probably better for customers, too.\u201dAlan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer\u2019s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple\u2019s suppliers into the company\u2019s production systems. \u201cHere, there\u2019s a lot more openness and creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cIn manufacturing, it\u2019s a lot more widgets dropping off the line.\u201dMayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough \u2014 at least $20 an hour \u2014 to support the city\u2019s middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices.Some of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple\u2019s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. \u201cThe best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,\u201d Mr. Adler said.Asked about Apple\u2019s lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: \u201cThe product that Apple builds here is us.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the education attained by Genny Lopez. She attended college for two years; she did not receive an associate\u2019s degree.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s New MacBook Pro: Fast and Light, but Not for Everyone", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byTech FixYet by the time he finished watching a live stream of the event, Mr. Leventhal, who has owned only Mac computers for the last 30 years, was turned off. \u201cWith this one I was really disappointed,\u201d he said.In their latest incarnation, MacBook Pros have only one type of connection port, as opposed to the several types they had before. That will require people to buy adapters to plug in devices that use different types of connectors. On the keyboard, Apple also replaced the top row of physical keys, including the Escape key, with a virtual touch strip called the Touch Bar.The benefits? The new laptops are faster, much thinner and lighter than the previous generation, and they have about 10 hours of battery life. The Touch Bar\u2019s virtual buttons transform depending on the app you are using, unlocking the potential for software makers to create custom shortcuts.I tested the new MacBook Pros \u2014 which cost $1,500 to $2,800, depending on the model \u2014 while gathering reactions to the new computers from engineers and information technology professionals over two weeks. I concluded that while the new laptops are capable enough for many professionals, there is no need to rush to buy one.Here are the highlights and lowlights of the new MacBook Pros:In my tests, having only USB-C on the MacBook Pros was the biggest change. The previous MacBook Pros included USB-A and some other types of ports, including HDMI, for connecting devices like printers and monitors. Now the USB-C ports will be the only way to hook up just about everything, including power chargers, external screens and photo-card readers, to the laptop. The entry-level MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports, and the higher-end models include four.What this means in the near term is that you may have to buy adapters to plug in devices with different connectors. Annoyingly, that includes the iPhone power cable, which has a USB-A connector. So to charge an iPhone on a new MacBook Pro, for example, you have to hook up the cable to a dongle that connects USB-A and USB-C devices.In the long run, Apple\u2019s shift to USB-C will help set an industry standard, said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. The goal is to reach a point where all peripheral devices are made with a USB-C connector. So eventually you won\u2019t need adapters.\u201cWe\u2019re going to cut ties with the past and go with the new standard, finally,\u201d Mr. Denslow said.With the Touch Bar, Apple intended to replace some outdated keys with a versatile strip that adapts to the apps you are using. Apple also built a fingerprint sensor into the Touch Bar.The Touch Bar is a breeze to get the hang of, but I didn\u2019t find it helpful in streamlining tasks. If you open the Photos app, for example, the Touch Bar displays thumbnails of photos in your library, and you can tap one to select a photo to edit. That\u2019s neat, but why not just select the photo on your laptop screen? When using the Safari browser, you can use the Touch Bar to select a different browser tab \u2014 but using keyboard shortcuts (Command+1 to choose the first tab, for instance) is quicker.The Escape key also exists as a virtual button on the Touch Bar. I didn\u2019t mind that because I rarely use this key, but the design decision made Mr. Leventhal, the software engineer, wince. He said the physical Escape key was crucial for coders, and not being able to press it seemed crippling.The jury is still out on whether the Touch Bar will be a must-have. When switching back to a laptop with a normal keyboard, I didn\u2019t feel as if I was missing anything. But much like the iPhone on Day 1, the Touch Bar is essentially a blank slate, and the onus is on app developers to make it more compelling.Many Apple loyalists have fixated on the memory constraints and underwhelming performance of the new MacBook Pros. The new models have a maximum of 16 gigabytes of RAM \u2014 the same limit as the previous MacBook Pro \u2014 and roughly the same processor speed as the last professional notebooks. But that\u2019s not the full story.The new notebooks are much faster in some ways than older models, while other parts are only slightly faster. In speed tests run with the app Geekbench 4, the 15-inch MacBook Pro\u2019s computer processor was only 10 percent to 17 percent faster than the 15-inch model released in 2012. Yet the graphics processor, which is crucial for heavy computing tasks, in the new MacBook Pro is about twice as fast as the one in the older model, and the storage drives are much faster, too.The RAM limit might irk users who need power. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can open and the more quickly your computer can juggle them. The problem, in theory, is that in a few years if your future apps hog more memory, you won\u2019t be able to add more memory to MacBook Pros because the most they can hold is 16 gigabytes.Professional Mac users are too divided on the MacBook Pro for me to make a blanket recommendation.On the plus side, these notebooks are fast, with high-resolution screens and responsive keyboards. But the Touch Bar so far feels gimmicky, and not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet.The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for add-ons like extra storage.So if you aren\u2019t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don\u2019t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it\u2019s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price.\u201cIt\u2019s a dark place where you\u2019re doing something that is basically illegal and spending a ton of time to even make it feasible, but I have no good options,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the 21st-Century Craze for Redesigning Everything", "Date": "2016-11-10", "News": "1. The ProblemIn theory, the redesign begins with a problem. The problem might be specific or systemic or subjective. A logo makes a company\u2019s image feel out of date. A familiar household object has been overtaken by new technology. A service has become too confusing for new users. And so on. The world is, after all, full of problems.The human desire to solve problems fuels brand-new inventions too: The wheel, for example, eased conveyance significantly. But the redesign tends to address problems with, or caused by, dimensions of the human-designed world, and identifying such problems may be the designer\u2019s most crucial skill. Redesigns fail when they address the wrong problem \u2014 or something that really wasn\u2019t a problem in the first place. While progress may entail change, change does not necessarily guarantee progress. But a clever redesign, one that addresses the right problem in an intelligent fashion, improves the world, if just by a bit.Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue.Simons was so impressed that she signed two students, Amy Wu and Luke Stern, to a three-month contract that summer. The two of them soon zeroed in on a particularly thorny design problem: the big, instructional decal on Citi Bike\u2019s kiosks. Annual members used a key fob and had no reason to interact with the decal, but it was the gateway for casual users. Consisting mostly of text, the decals were dense and off-putting, especially to tourists uncomfortable with English. Some failed to understand that they were supposed to type in a code from a printed receipt to unlock a bike; instead, they tried to figure out how to insert the receipt itself into a slot on the docking station.There was another, more prosaic reason that Stern and Wu focused on the decal: It was something they could actually change. Citi Bike is operated by a private firm, but New York\u2019s Transportation Department oversees it, too, and the technology involves an external vendor. The decal, however, was produced in-house. So Stern and Wu proposed refashioning it, using a set of instructional pictograms loosely inspired by Ikea booklets. They tested several prototypes and endured baffled responses from Citi Bike users until eventually landing on a gridlike arrangement of visuals that people found intuitive. Simons and the Transportation Department signed off on a final version, and it was installed on the city\u2019s 300-plus Citi Bike stations. Wu checked the service\u2019s publicly available user data a month later and discovered that casual ridership had increased about 14 percent. \u201cIt was a little bit surreal,\u201d Stern recalls. \u201cWe can actually make a difference.\u201dIndeed, this is the platonic ideal of the redesign: A designer sees a problem, proposes a solution, makes a difference. Such tidy narratives fuel a reigning ideology in which every object, symbol or pool of information is just another design problem awaiting some solution. The thermostat, the fire extinguisher, the toothbrush, the car dashboard \u2014 all have been redesigned, whether anybody was clamoring for their alteration or not.This hunger for change has been a boon for firms like IDEO. Tim Brown, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, has overseen IDEO\u2019s steady expansion from product design to interactive and service design for businesses like Bank of America and Microsoft, and in more recent years even for municipalities and governments. He has been a vocal proponent of the idea that \u201cdesign thinking\u201d can be applied to just about any problem. \u201cThere are two takes on the redesign,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThe glass-half-empty take on redesign is, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re unnecessarily redesigning a chair,\u2019 or a lamp, or whatever.\u201dProblem: not enough casual users. Solution: reworking the instructions for newcomers from a text-heavy approach to something more pictorial, reminiscent of Ikea instructions.The glass-half-full take requires a broader perspective: \u201cThe need to redesign is really dependent on how fit for purpose the thing in question is,\u201d Brown says. In his thinking, much of our world is built around systems designed to respond to the social structures and technologies of the industrial age. Everything from systems of education and health care to the design of cities and modes of transportation, he says, all trace their roots to a drastically different era and ought to be fundamentally rethought for the one we live in now. \u201cI think we\u2019ve potentially never been in a period of history where there are so many things that are no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore the idea of redesign is entirely appropriate, I think \u2014 even though it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d2. What to ChangeYou don\u2019t have to listen to Karim Rashid for very long to get a sense that he thinks pretty much every single manifestation of the built environment needs to be redesigned. Known for his colorful personal and professional style, he has had a long run as one of the most famous industrial designers in America. He believes design is a fundamentally social act that makes the world a better place. But it is also, he points out, a business. So in practice, most redesigns begin with a client; without one, not much happens. He has worked with many of them \u2014 on furniture, packaging, gadgets, housewares, luxury goods, even condos and hotels. But he has learned that even having a client does not guarantee that any given redesign will ever make it out of renderings and prototypes and into the real world. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m prolific,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine if all the other stuff got to go to market?\u201dAs Rashid sees it, so many of the things that surround us bear cumbersome vestiges of the past. \u201cThe world is full of this kind of kitsch history \u2014 history that has nothing to do with the world we live in now,\u201d he says. He points to a redesign project of his that fizzled, a complete rethinking of the business-class tableware for Delta Air Lines. His proposal was bold: His bowls had sharp angles that echoed Delta\u2019s triangular logo, his trays had subtle recesses that anchored dishes in place and his wineglasses skipped the stem in favor of a tapered shape with a wide base.\u201cThe stem on a wineglass is meaningless,\u201d Rashid says. He dismisses the conventional argument that it prevents the drinker\u2019s hand from interfering with wine\u2019s ideal temperature; to have the slightest such effect, he claims, you\u2019d have to wrap your palm around the bowl for 20 straight minutes. The stem is actually a leftover artifact, he says, from centuries ago, when goblets made of metal had high stems to signal status and wealth. This design quirk remained after we switched to glass, Rashid says. Making wineglasses look a certain way because that\u2019s how they have always looked is a classic example of privileging form over function. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in first class or business class on an airplane with turbulence,\u201d Rashid says, \u201cwith a wineglass with a stem on it \u2014 do you understand? It\u2019s so stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHis proposed redesigns were striking, but they had to pass muster with the service-item maker, the flight attendants\u2019 union and Delta itself \u2014 which ultimately declined to move forward with the concepts Rashid proposed. \u201cIt was all rejected,\u201d he tells me, with a sigh. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t look like domestic tableware.\u201dRashid loves to \u201cbreak archetypes,\u201d in effect redesigning a whole object category. But the hurdles to doing so involve practicality as well as taste. More recently, he designed the Solarin mobile phone for Sirin Labs. It is equipped with extreme encryption capabilities and made with wealthy, privacy-obsessed customers in mind. It costs an eye-popping $12,000 and up. The client had a sky\u2019s-the-limit attitude about imbuing the phone with a truly distinct form.The payment giant\u2019s top priority in revisiting its logo for the first time in decades: Don\u2019t mess it up. The result, released earlier this year, is a version of the familiar interlocked-circles symbol streamlined for the digital era.3. What to KeepSituations like this can unnerve clients, and this knowledge was certainly relevant to Mastercard when it decided this year to update its logo for the first time in more than 20 years. Raja Rajamannar, the global chief marketing and communications officer, says that the first parameter he gave his designer, Michael Bierut at Pentagram, \u201cwas not to mess things up.\u201d The online crowd can get \u201cpretty nasty,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get mired in unnecessary controversy and negativity.\u201dThis conservatism among clients can frustrate designers. \u201cI was kind of brought up in this tradition that, you know, there\u2019s nothing more inspiring than the blank slate, the open brief,\u201d Bierut says. But over the years he has come to appreciate the challenge of \u201cstarting with a given,\u201d particularly now.\u201cThe last big period of redesign was the postwar era,\u201d Bierut says. \u201cThere was this mania to make older companies look new and modern.\u201d As a more corporate world emerged, the visual vernacular of mom-and-pop businesses looked quaint, and so design shifted from an emphasis on manufacturing things to selling more abstract forms of value. A railroad doesn\u2019t run trains, the thinking went; it provides transportation \u2014 so instead of a representation of a locomotive, its more modern logo might rely on arrows and italic typography. More broadly, idiosyncratic or hand-drawn lettering gave way to stylized and minimal iconography and type treatments that projected far-flung and trustworthy power. \u201cCorporate design was done as a command-and-control exercise,\u201d he says, resulting in a master solution laid out in \u201ca thick binder\u201d prescribing how every branding element would appear.By the \u201980s and \u201990s, that approach started to feel dated, suspicious and at odds with a vogue for more agile management theories. So in the last two decades, there has been a fresh wave of redesigns as companies have repositioned themselves in a more globalized, technologized marketplace. Mastercard is one of many examples of a company looking to update visual strategies designed with billboards and brick-and-mortar stores in mind for the age of social media and a transnational customer base.Nevertheless, the specific dimensions of Mastercard\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t mess it up\u201d parameter included keeping the interlocking circles \u2014 one red, one yellow \u2014 that the brand has used for more than half a century. Bierut believes that this was wise: Unlike a book cover or a poster, a brand mark is \u201cmore like a building,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t unveil it thinking it\u2019s going to work once and then be on its way. It\u2019s supposed to accrue value the longer it\u2019s invested in.\u201d The raw familiarity that builds up over years, which marketers refer to as \u201cequity,\u201d probably plays a bigger factor in our assessment of a supposedly great logo design than we realize. Bierut is tickled, for instance, by how many people seem to admire Target\u2019s logo. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine if you went to your client whose name was Target and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea,\u2019 then you went away for a few weeks and came back with a circle with a dot in the middle, and an invoice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe client would be skeptical \u2014 and the world at large would destroy you.\u201dFor Mastercard, Pentagram got as creative as the brief allowed, offering dozens of yellow-and-red-circle variations \u2014 adding additional colors to suggest inclusivity, or a superminimal take presenting only the outlines of the interlocked rings. Rajamannar (and others at Mastercard, crosschecked by multiple rounds of market research) passed on those, opting for a treatment that amounted to a kind of reiteration of the existing mark. The colors became a little brighter, a set of stripes in their overlap was eliminated in favor of a single orange-y color and the name moved below the circles. Ultimately, in fact, the new symbol is designed to be able to stand alone, with no name at all; Rajamannar says testing conducted across 11 countries found 81 percent of respondents recognized the wordless version of the logo as Mastercard\u2019s.In short, the not-messing-it-up mission was deemed a success \u2014 and there was no notable backlash. \u201cThis kind of brand mark has become more ubiquitous than the designers of the \u201960s and \u201970s ever would have dreamed,\u201d Bierut says, and that may explain a public interest in design that would have been a shock in that era. It should not be so surprising today; the design profession has been on a decades-long mission to have its work taken seriously across the culture. But now, having achieved what they wanted, many designers seem to wish the public would be more deferential \u2014 something Bierut finds amusing. \u201cIf designers claim to want people to be interested and invested in and care about design,\u201d he says, \u201cthey sort of have to accept that interest on the terms of, you know, the audience.\u201d4. Where to CompromiseIn 2011, Jamie Siminoff had just sold a start-up and was spending most of his days in his garage in Pacific Palisades, Calif., determined to come up with a new business concept. Tinkering with ideas including a gardening business and new conference-call technology, he soon became annoyed, because he could never hear his doorbell, and he kept missing visitors. So he \u201chacked together\u201d a system that linked the bell to his phone. His wife told him that it was far more useful than the notions he was chasing in the garage. The idea evolved to include a camera and a motion detector \u2014 and thus the ability to monitor your front door from anywhere, with a smartphone, making the object as much about security as convenience.The product he ended up with, Ring, is a good example of a broader phenomenon in the world of industrial design. The technology shifts that Brown and Rashid cite have quickened the pace of redesigns in more mundane, less grandiose ways. Thanks to the proliferation of cheap sensors, circuit boards, cameras and other components, practically every consumer good now seems susceptible to reinvention as a \u201csmart object.\u201d Even the path Siminoff traveled from concept to design was made easier by technology and start-up mania, first with the aid of a crowdfunding campaign, then with an unsuccessful but profile-raising appearance on \u201cShark Tank.\u201dSometimes such a path results in a version of what the tech critic Evgeny Morozov calls \u201csolutionism\u201d \u2014 starting with a supposed breakthrough and then seeking out a supposed problem that it can hypothetically solve. And at times the presumed innovations in these tech-centric redesigns seem to run well ahead of their potential privacy and security pitfalls. (\u201cYes,\u201d the tech site Motherboard reported last year, \u201cyour smart dildo can be hacked.\u201d) But sometimes it results in a hit, like the widely celebrated update of the thermostat in internet-connected, app-controlled form created by the start-up Nest, which was ultimately bought by Google for $3.2 billion.By his own account, Siminoff\u2019s first stab at the product was a bit off. He called it Doorbot, and its look matched the geeky name: a vaguely sci-fi, curved object with a camera concealed by a spooky, bulbous protrusion. \u201cThat was the pride of the design,\u201d Siminoff says now, laughing. He prototyped it in his garage with a couple of recent college graduates; none of them had a design background. The marketplace set him straight, he says: \u201cNo one wanted this big HAL 9000 thing on the front door.\u201d He still believed in the object\u2019s utility, but he realized he would need to redesign his redesign.Siminoff found his way to Chris Loew, an industrial designer in Silicon Valley, with a long record in technology hardware; he worked on early versions of tablet products and spent 16 years at IDEO helping clients including Samsung and Oral-B. In more recent years he has been hired by a number of start-ups. Impressed by Siminoff, Loew also recognized the issues with Doorbot. \u201cIt was very gadgety,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if you were being shot with radiation or \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not offensive, but you didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d In short, it didn\u2019t look like a doorbell, and even the most impressive technical capabilities have to be presented in a form that makes sense to the consumer.The original version of this reimagined doorbell (equipped with a camera and intercom) had such a sci-fi look that visitors often didn\u2019t know what it was. A redesign of that redesign has placed it in the realm of functional home d\u00e9cor \u2014 and it has been installed in hundreds of thousands of homes.In this case, that meant a design that resonated with basic home architecture. There were already serious technologized constraints: It had to accommodate a fairly large battery, a camera, a circuit board and a motion detector that required an opening of a specific size. And from a purely aesthetic perspective, the architectural setting imposed limits that might not apply to a free-standing product: Nobody really wants to tack a wild experiment in product design to a front door. Loew settled on a rectangular shape that would visually echo molding. \u201cEverybody\u2019s house is really just extruded shapes and planar shapes,\u201d says Loew, who is now Ring\u2019s lead product designer. The product comes in various finishes informed by classic door hardware, and is meant to be notable but not flashy.The company has grown to 500 employees, with hundreds of thousands of installations already done. The only holdover from Doorbot is a circle around the button that glows blue when pressed.5. When to Start OverSmiedt paused on one image of a carry-on bag with a side pocket containing a flask-shaped plastic bottle outfitted with a strong microfilter. This accessory popped up during the luggage-design process as a useful alternative to buying bottled water after every airport security check. \u201cSo no matter what country,\u201d Rashid explained, \u201cI go across and to the bathroom and fill it up with clean water. Because it\u2019s absurd, this idea of drinking bottled water \u2014 the landfill is enormous, 18 million bottles are thrown away a day in America.\u201d Both men immediately saw its appeal. Smiedt promptly \u201cdisappeared,\u201d Rashid continued, \u201cand six months later came back and said: \u2018You know, forget the luggage. We\u2019re doing the water bottle.\u2019\u2009\u201dOn its own, the flasklike form seemed off, so Smiedt pushed for alternatives, something more like what was on Rashid\u2019s product shelf \u2014 but not exactly. An hourglass-like, squeezable shape that Rashid eventually dreamed up was perfect. But it required making a lengthy search to find a capable manufacturer \u2014 \u201cNobody had made a blow-molded bottle that was thinner in the middle,\u201d Smiedt said \u2014 and committing to a huge production order for the product, which they called Bobble.\u201cCompanies are often risk-averse,\u201d Smiedt continued, \u201cand don\u2019t get design\u2019s possibilities. But designers do what they want to design, and it often doesn\u2019t connect with the consumer,\u201d at least not the mass scale he had in mind. \u201cFor me,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe key to design is that it can\u2019t polarize.\u201d Many designers would recoil from that assertion, but as a mass-market-oriented entrepreneur, Smiedt\u2019s goals are different. He thinks a lot about who is not going to like a new take on a useful object, as a way to \u201cget to something that\u2019s really understood.\u201dThis new take on the reusable water bottle started out as an accessory to a luggage redesign. The luggage was scuttled \u2014 but Bobble, with a distinct shape and a strong microfilter, has sold millions.The Bobble bottle sold 15 million units in its first three years on the market. Smiedt sold Bobble to Seventh Generation and has gone back into business with Rashid, this time in a partnership. They want to redesign more travel-related accessories, so they started by dumping their luggage onto a table and talking about what they carried, and what they needed. Their first idea involved finding a way to keep smeary touch-controlled gadgets clean. Rashid designed a travel-size spray bottle, arriving at an elliptical form, more like a worry stone than a bottle. They both loved the object\u2019s shape and feel but wondered about the breadth of its appeal. Ultimately, they shelved it, though not entirely.They went back to the results of the bag-dump experiment and zeroed in on the most bothersome objects: the dull-colored, blocky, careless-looking power adapters and portable chargers and their various entangled wires. What if you combined a wall charger and mobile battery in a single object? What if it had a more appealing aesthetic? Smiedt sourced the technology, and Rashid designed around it to create an object they called Bump. Sifting through a box of prototypes, Smiedt pointed out that this completely different product has almost the same elliptical shape as the discarded cleaner idea. This \u201cfun\u201d form (it comes in magenta, red, black and blue) will carry through the entire product line, he explained. Rashid also devised a matching cable, and a clever silicone sleeve that is used both to store the cable and to protect Bump when it\u2019s tossed into a bag.Of course, there was a hitch. Market testing found that consumers were often happy to use Bump with the (less attractive) power cable they already owned, and didn\u2019t bother with the sleeve. So as Bump goes on sale online and rolls out across big retailers, starting with the Container Store in late October, the cord is now sold separately. And that clever silicone sleeve may also be sold separately \u2014 or it may be on its way to a prototype box somewhere.6. The SolutionAll redesigns have something in common: They end. This does not happen at the moment the redesigned symbol, object or interface is implemented. It happens when that redesign is replaced. Maybe that\u2019s the lofty logic of progress, or just the workaday logic of capitalism. But it\u2019s certainly the logic of the redesign, and perhaps design in general, in the early 21st century. When IDEO\u2019s Tim Brown talks about updating all that is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d today, he\u2019s talking about entire systems, not just their individual and tangible components and manifestations.IDEO started out as an industrial-design firm working on consumer products; it expanded further into interaction design as the digital world took hold, and then it went into services. Now its projects include \u201credesigning\u201d such abstractions as the school lunch (for the city of San Francisco) or the vote (for Los Angeles County), experimenting with how to lace in 21st-century technology elements and shed out-of-date practices. These are incremental efforts that play out over years. There is no momentous before-and-after unveiling, just a continuous process of researching, trying and replacing ideas. This, after all, is how designers work: in an ongoing system of study, hunches, prototypes, tests and do-overs.The inevitability of re-redesign is something that Amy Wu (now part of a Microsoft design team in San Francisco) and Luke Stern (now a designer for Intersection, a firm focused on civic spaces) encountered in their work for Citi Bike. A few months after the triumphant installation of their redesigned kiosk decals, the company that operated Citi Bike was bought by another bike-share operator, Motivate, which runs similar programs for several other cities. They got an email from Citi Bike saying they might be needed again, but then never heard back.The new owner promptly set about a broader upgrade of Citi Bike\u2019s system involving new software and changes to the hardware in those kiosks. This meant that the decals needed to be redesigned yet again. The new ones incorporated some of Wu and Stern\u2019s thinking, but in a new look that, among other things, visually announced to the world that Citi Bike had been updated.Stern and Wu are philosophical about this turn. \u201cThe logistics had changed,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThey had to update the system. Our design wasn\u2019t actually relevant any more. That\u2019s reality, right?\u201d Right. And it was certainly a useful final lesson for an effort that started out as a student project: All redesigns end, but the redesign never does. \u2666Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "While We Weren\u2019t Looking, Snapchat Revolutionized Social Networks", "Date": "2016-11-30", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSnap Inc., the parent company of the popular photo-messaging and storytelling app Snapchat, is having a productive autumn.And yet, even when it\u2019s grabbing headlines, it often seems as if Snap gets little respect.This is all wrong. If you secretly harbor the idea that Snapchat is frivolous or somehow a fad, it\u2019s time to re-examine your certainties. In fact, in various large and small ways, Snap has quietly become one of the world\u2019s most innovative and influential consumer technology companies.Snap, which is based far outside the Silicon Valley bubble, in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, is pushing radically new ideas about how humans should interact with computers. It is pioneering a model of social networking that feels more intimate and authentic than the Facebook-led ideas that now dominate the online world. Snap\u2019s software and hardware designs, as well as its marketing strategies, are more daring than much of what we\u2019ve seen from tech giants, including Apple.Snap is still relatively small; its 150 million daily user base pales in comparison to Facebook\u2019s 1.2 billion, and its success is far from assured. In its novelty, it can sometimes veer toward the bizarre and inscrutable. And it\u2019s not obvious that all of its advances are positive. (For instance, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s always better for our relationships to lose a record of our chats with friends.)Yet it\u2019s no wonder that Facebook and its subsidiaries appear obsessed with imitating Snap. As a font of ideas that many in the tech industry hadn\u2019t considered before, Snap isn\u2019t just popular, but also increasingly important.\u201cRegardless of what happens, they\u2019ve reshaped the social media landscape,\u201d said Joseph B. Bayer, a communications professor at Ohio State University who has studied Snapchat\u2019s impact on how people communicate. \u201cThey\u2019re making risky moves, trying to rethink what people want online as opposed to taking what\u2019s already been done and adding a new flash.\u201dTechies value disruption, and it\u2019s difficult to think of another online company that has shuffled the status quo as consistently as Snap has over the past few years.Before Snapchat, the industry took for granted that everything users posted to the internet should remain there by default. Saving people\u2019s data \u2014 and then constantly re-examining it to create new products and advertising \u2014 is the engine that supports behemoths like Google and Facebook.The diminution of personalization algorithms and virality also plays into how Snapchat treats news. Snapchat\u2019s primary format is called a Story, a slide show of a user\u2019s video clips that are played in chronological order. This, too, is an innovation; before Snapchat, much online content, from blogs to tweets, was consumed in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the oldest. Snapchat\u2019s Stories, which have since been widely copied, ushered in a more natural order \u2014 start at the beginning and go from there.A few years ago, insiders at Snapchat noticed that Stories were an ideal vehicle for relaying news. They could be crowdsourced: If a lot of people were at a concert or sporting event or somewhere that breaking news was occurring, a lot of them were likely to be snapping what was happening. If Snapchat offered them a way to submit their clips, it could spot the best ones and add them to a narrative compilation of the event.While Silicon Valley was shunning editing and curation done by humans, and instead relying on computers to spot and disseminate news, Snapchat began hiring producers and reporters to assemble clips into in-depth pieces.The company calls these Live Stories, and they have been transformative, unlike any other news presentation you can find online. Every day, Snapchat offers one or several stories about big and small events happening in the world, including football games, awards shows and serious news.For instance, this summer, while the rest of the media were engulfed by Hurricane Trump, Snapchat\u2019s news team spent days following the devastating floods in Louisiana. That in itself was unusual, but Snap\u2019s presentation was also groundbreaking: Rather than showing the overhead shots or anchor stand-ups that are conventional on TV news, Snapchat offered video from inside people\u2019s houses, from shelters, from schools. It mixed the macrostory of an impending natural disaster and the government\u2019s response to it with the microtragedies of personal loss, and even the lighter moments of humor and boredom in between.Snapchat has said that it thinks of itself as a camera company rather than a social network. This sounds like marketing puffery (after all, it only just started making its first actual camera, Spectacles), but I think its determination to set itself apart from the rest of the tech industry is important to note.Snap can free itself from Silicon Valley\u2019s accepted norms because it doesn\u2019t think of itself as just another Silicon Valley tech company. It\u2019s time we all started to see it that way, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Outrage in Bronx as Barnes & Noble Is Set to Close", "Date": "2016-11-02", "News": "Supported byEvery day after school, 4-year-old Nicholai Rose demands that his mother take him first to the park then to the Barnes & Noble in the Baychester neighborhood of the Bronx. There, they snuggle in a corner in the children\u2019s section and, each time, read \u201cI Need My Monster,\u201d his favorite picture book.In a few months their ritual will end \u2014 permanently \u2014 when the store closes for good, leaving the Bronx, a borough with nearly 1.5 million people, without one general-interest bookstore. For residents, the closing carries a painful sting the borough knows too well, of being long underserved and overlooked, which persists even as the Bronx is experiencing a renaissance.\u201cHow am I going to tell him that the bookstore is going?\u201d said Nicholai\u2019s mother, Shauna Rose, 29, as she sat in the store on Wednesday, the monster book on her lap. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing else.\u201dWhile Brooklyn and Manhattan might be better known from book titles, the Bronx has been home to famous authors and host to venues that provided them with their muse.The decision has provoked another round of outrage, laced with deep resentment and a sense of loss.Christina Tipiani, 23, a student who lives in the Soundview section of the Bronx, bemoaned the closing as she browsed books with her daughter Gabriella Padilla, 3. \u201cWe have enough clothing stores,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you want to teach your children? I want to teach my child actual values.\u201d .The move, she said, is out of touch with the area\u2019s needs: \u201cWe can\u2019t even afford Saks clothing!\u201dThe loss contributes to a long-held sense that the Bronx is still shunned, even as its years of blight, arson and rampant crime are long past. Property values across the borough have steadily climbed, its population is rising and investment by developers in the South Bronx, once a national symbol of urban decay, hopes to turn the waterfront area into the city\u2019s next hip neighborhood.Barnes & Noble said in a statement it fought to remain open in Baychester but could not afford the higher rent sought by the landlord. As for what might happen in the future, the company said it was committed to reopening in the Bronx at some point. But the impending bookstore desert goes beyond the loss of a single store.\u201cI really do think that there is a preconceived concept that folks that live in the Bronx, they\u2019re not interested in reading, or that they are going to steal everything,\u201d said Claudette Mobley, 72, a retired nurse, as she browsed the aisles of the store. \u201cWe are just as interested in knowledge and reading as anybody else. We just don\u2019t have the access to the things that the rest of New Yorkers do.\u201dDavid Sax, an author who writes about the importance of physical spaces and establishments, including bookstores, said the closing of the Barnes & Noble was a blow to civic pride.\u201cBookstores are located in neighborhoods and areas that are intelligent, elegant, intellectually curious,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for the Bronx, there is a sense of a loss of self-worth \u2014 beyond that if you lose a sneaker shop \u2014 that they weren\u2019t good enough, smart enough to deserve books.\u201dSamuel Port\u00e8, 27, an urban planner who lives in the Marble Hill section of Manhattan, was at the Barnes & Noble, buying a book on entrepreneurship.\u201cIt\u2019s a disservice to the community to not give them books of all natures,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to close down a bookstore where the elderly, where kids, where college students go to seek out knowledge. It\u2019s people up top not taking a feel for what the community actually needs, just thinking about the bottom line, what makes the most money.\u201dThe population of the Bronx is just 200,000 people fewer than Manhattan\u2019s, but Manhattan had nearly 90 bookstores in 2014, according to the most recent census data on such businesses. In recent years there has also been a nationwide resurgence of independent bookshops. Still, the news is not necessarily all bad, said Todd Dickinson, the president of the board of the New Atlantic Independent Booksellers Association, a regional trade group. \u201cIt looks to me that the Bronx missed out on the revival,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut that to me means there is an opportunity, rather than reflecting badly. It means there is potential.\u201dThe Bronx has 35 branches of the New York Public Library, with a collection of 1.7 million items, an increase of 16 percent during the past 10 years to meet the demand of readers. Standing in the fantasy section at the Barnes & Noble, Kim Laird looked around a place she had been visiting for 17 years.She said there was something special about owning a book, explaining that since she was little, she had bought about one book every week there. \u201cFor me, reading is just an escape, books were my escape to a different world that I would probably never get to see in my lifetime,\u201d Ms. Laird said. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s what this store was.\u201dMs. Laird, 23, who lives near the store and plans to attend graduate school, signed a petition to try to keep the store open. \u201cThis fostered my imagination, this created worlds for me, this let me see even realities \u2014 to go to Europe without leaving my room,\u201d she said.\u201cThis for me was my ticket to my way out,\u201d Ms. Laird added. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s gone.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of an author who writes about the importance of physical spaces.

{"Headline": "FilmStruck Streaming Service Places a Big Bet on Cinephiles", "Date": "2016-11-01", "News": "Supported byWhile the cable industry wonders how many of us will be willing to cut the cord and do without a traditional television package, its online rivals have moved on to a more timely question: How many cords \u2014 albeit invisible, cheaper cords \u2014 will we be willing to pay for at once?Jennifer Dorian, general manager of Turner Classic Movies, which developed the site in partnership with the Criterion Collection, said internal research showed that the people most likely to pay for FilmStruck\u2019s offerings of independent and art-house movies were paying for cable TV and another streaming service. \u201cThey\u2019re already very involved in entertainment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s their hobby, and they don\u2019t mind spending money.\u201dBut even with the backing of two heavyweights, the Turner cable channel and the home entertainment company Criterion, both beloved by film buffs, FilmStruck is entering a niche-streaming field that\u2019s already very crowded. Movie sites like Fandor, Mubi, Tribeca Shortlist and SundanceNow already cover much of the same non-Hollywood ground as FilmStruck. And myriad other sites \u2014 focusing on Asian soap operas, animation, Bollywood films, horror, documentaries \u2014 are going after the same discretionary dollars.FilmStruck has one big advantage \u2014 the connection to Criterion, by far the most prestigious name in DVD and Blu-ray distribution, and its 1,500-film catalog of art-house classics. (Criterion films, available on Hulu for the last five years, will be streamed exclusively on FilmStruck, beginning later this month.) The site\u2019s two-tiered pricing reflects the importance of that connection: A FilmStruck subscription is $6.99 a month, but full access to the Criterion Channel within FilmStruck costs $10.99. (An annual subscription to both is $99.)For $6.99, you get some access to Criterion content: About 200 of its films will be part of the general FilmStruck roster of about 500 titles at any given time, according to Charlie Tabesh, senior vice president for programming at FilmStruck and Turner Classic.In the site\u2019s initial incarnation, the Criterion offerings are heavily front-loaded. The most prominent display is a set of thematic clusters \u2014 political documentaries, movies starring Marcello Mastroianni, films that had been banned in the United States \u2014 and about 80 percent of the selections in those groupings are from Criterion.\u201cI think the movies are a solid piece of it,\u201d said Jonathan Turell, chief executive of the Criterion Collection. \u201cBut I think the way they are presented is what we\u2019re spending a lot of time with.\u201d He said that, beginning with the Coen brothers\u2019 \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d the site would present \u201centire editions\u201d of films, with all of the extras \u2014 commentaries, interviews, documentaries \u2014 that were part of the original Criterion DVD package.\u201cIt appears Turner and Criterion are targeting and planning to super-serve the cinephile,\u201d Mr. Aidem said, adding, \u201cTo super-serve the indie-film fanatic is forgoing a ton of people out there.\u201dIf enough cinephiles are willing to spend $99 a year (which, even when combined with Netflix or Hulu, is significantly less than a cable subscription), then it won\u2019t matter how many viewers FilmStruck forgoes. Not all of its movies are hard to find or all that interesting \u2014 \u201cMadonna: Truth or Dare\u201d or a group of 28 Charlie Chaplin films don\u2019t set the heart racing \u2014 but its elegant interface and the Criterion catalog give it a big head start in the battle to be the second buy.Here are five subscription streaming sites that compete with FilmStruck. The first four offer similar mixes of independent, foreign, cult and documentary films, with Tribeca Shortlist putting more emphasis on mainstream hits. The fifth, Warner Archive Instant, focuses on Hollywood classics. Many of the sites offer free trials and discounts, and all are available on some combination of services like Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast, smart TVs and mobile apps.Fandor$10 a month, $90 a yearMubi$5.99 a monthThe gimmick is that only 30 films are available at a time, for 30 days each, with one film added a day.SundanceNowBest known for nonfiction.Tribeca Shortlist$4.99 a month with Amazon PrimeWarner Archive Instant$9.99 a month, $94.99 a yearThe place for old-Hollywood fare.A Critic\u2019s Notebook article on Wednesday about FilmStruck, a new movie-streaming site, misspelled the surname of the chief executive of the Criterion Collection, a partner in the venture.

The company, based in San Francisco, is undergoing a rapid expansion.When Stripe was founded in 2010 by two Irish brothers, John and Patrick Collison, the company set out to help businesses quickly and easily accept payments from anyone, anywhere in the world. Stripe helps companies including Twitter, Salesforce.com, Lyft and Target process payments made via credit cards and newer payment tools such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, Alipay and even Bitcoin.In addition to payments processing, Stripe offers a payment fraud prevention product and a tool kit called Stripe Atlas that allows entrepreneurs around the globe to register their new businesses as United States-based companies with a United States bank account, Stripe payments tools and basic legal, tax and computing services from the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe and Amazon Web Services.

{"Headline": "Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: A Face-Off of Smart Speakers", "Date": "2016-11-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixTO get an idea of how annoying it can be to say \u201cO.K., Google\u201d multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand.O.K., Pepsi. O.K., Chipotle. O.K., Skittles. You get the picture. It\u2019s difficult to utter \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d the phrase used to control Google\u2019s new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool.That is too bad because Google\u2019s Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon\u2019s Echo.So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both Alexa and Google side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories that they shared in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home.What I found was that while Echo is currently more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google\u2019s product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years.Home\u2019s link to Google\u2019s database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase.Just give them both a pop quiz to see. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap?Amazon declined to comment.Occasionally there are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google\u2019s Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent.Most of the time, however, Google has answers when Alexa fails.Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won\u2019t offer a guess.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to presume an answer that may not be right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being really cautious with this feature.\u201dGoogle\u2019s speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone\u2019s residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on Day 1, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies.Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung\u2019s smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue.Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo.With Home, I managed to get Google\u2019s Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn\u2019t able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google\u2019s lack of support for the devices.Google said that for Home\u2019s release, it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come.One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior.For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film \u201cDrive\u201d resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album \u201c2014 Forest Hills Drive\u201d by J. Cole.For podcasts, both speakers were adequate \u2014 but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like \u201cFresh Air\u201d or \u201cRadio Lab,\u201d but it failed to play \u201cThe Sporkful,\u201d a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for.Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf.On the down side, Alexa and Home are fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment.The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino\u2019s, but otherwise can\u2019t do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby.Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants are.One task Alexa can pull off that Google can\u2019t is list showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Mr. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance.\u201cIf you verbally spit out what\u2019s on the screen, then it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said.Echo and Home are largely the same in the basic tasks they can perform. The capabilities that Home currently lacks, like movie showtimes or support for other smart home accessories, will probably show up in software updates or future partnerships.So what really distinguishes one from the other? Right now, Echo\u2019s major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you.But if you aren\u2019t big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google\u2019s speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player.

Instead of a tower on a busy street, this new corporate base is a horizontal structure with a front door that opens onto a public park.Tucked inside a group of 19th-century buildings, the steel-and-glass home of Weyerhaeuser, a wood products and timberlands company, is almost hidden by a row of trees.Weyerhaeuser, founded in 1900, moved from a forested 400-acre spread in suburban Federal Way, about 22 miles south of Seattle\u2019s central business district. Since October, the company\u2019s 700 employees have worked in the new building, which has a half-acre footprint and is in the historic Pioneer Square district, just south of Seattle\u2019s downtown area.The old building \u201cwas too big for us,\u201d said Jack Evans, a company spokesman. At the same time, he added, the company also recognized the recruitment value of an in-town headquarters. \u201cSeattle is the center of gravity,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Developed by Urban Visions, based in Seattle, the seven-story Weyerhaeuser building is a bit of an outlier in the explosive Seattle office market, which is centered on the downtown area to the north, and a second neighborhood, South Lake Union, a former light industrial area just north of downtown. Currently, at least 13 office buildings are rising in these central Seattle markets.\u201cSeattle is one of the busiest markets in the country right now,\u201d said Jake Bos, an office leasing agent who is a senior associate with Kidder Mathews, a local commercial real estate brokerage firm that is not connected to the Weyerhaeuser development.Central Seattle, in fact, is among the leading markets for new office space in the Western United States. In the first nine months of this year, 822,000 square feet of new office space were completed in central Seattle, and 4.93 million more square feet were under construction, according to Kidder Mathews research. In comparison, the financial district of San Francisco, one of the fastest-growing West Coast office markets, reported 1.07 million square feet of office space completed in the same period, and 3.77 million square feet under construction.\u201cAmazon was the catalyst of the office boom, which has been fueled by tech,\u201d Mr. Bos said.In South Lake Union, at least four new office buildings are expected to open before the end of the year; two of them are fully leased to Amazon. Separately, Vulcan Inc., a company owned by Paul G. Allen, a Microsoft founder, recently received permission to build a four-building complex for Google in the same district. Covering two city blocks, the master plan calls for housing, shopping and 607,000 square feet of office space.The interest in central Seattle is a sign of a changing culture. With natural beauty and plentiful waterways in the region, Seattle has a high hip factor and has long been a magnet for millennials. Corporations are returning to urban markets in part because of the ease of attracting younger workers and city dwellers.Mr. Evans of Weyerhaeuser said the new location was a positive for recruitment. The new neighborhood \u2014 unlike one isolated in the woods \u2014 offers amenities including a bakery, a combined bookstore-gallery and a craftsman bookbinder.Access to public transportation also played a large role in Weyerhaeuser\u2019s choice of the historic district, which is within walking distance of nearly every type of transit available in Seattle, including light rail, regional rail, streetcars and ferries. Ninety percent of the employees are transit users.Within an attractive neighborhood, the building itself is a recruitment tool, said the developer, Greg Smith, the founder and chief executive of Urban Visions. \u201cThe emphasis in this building is on wellness and health, including mental health,\u201d he said.A big attraction is the exterior deck on top of the seventh floor. This green roof has a Ping-Pong table, a fire pit, a barbecue grill and an elevated walking path circling the building. From the roof deck, employees have a postcard-worthy view of Elliott Bay, the orange cargo cranes of Seattle harbor directly ahead and the skyline of the central business district.Replacing a parking lot in Pioneer Square, a designated historic district, required the developer to clear many hurdles. The design went through several versions before it won the approval of city officials, who vetted materials, signage and even color choices. In one concession, the sides of the Weyerhaeuser building were made of hand-laid brick, to help the structure blend with its neighbors.\u201cThe design had to pay homage in the neighborhood without trying to appear to be a historic building,\u201d said Leslie Smith, the executive director of the Alliance for Pioneer Square, a nonprofit group. Ms. Smith, who is not related to Mr. Smith, the developer, said she was pleased with the result: \u201cThe building is beautifully understated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Los Angeles Auto Show, an Industry Ponders Its Digital Future", "Date": "2016-11-17", "News": "Supported byWheelsLOS ANGELES \u2014 For decades, the car business has been about style, performance, image and fuel efficiency. But suddenly, the industry is in a technological and sociological upheaval that may force automobiles \u2014 and the companies that make them \u2014 to change more in the next five years than they have in the last 50.That was evident in this week\u2019s AutoMobility LA conference, an event held by the organizers of the Los Angeles Auto Show, which will continue over the next two weeks.AutoMobility is an apt name, because much of the innovation seems to involve making the car ever more like a giant smartphone on wheels. But social mobility is a factor, too, as carmakers confront the surging popularity of ride-hailing services, which means fewer people see a need to own a car, while the push toward autonomous vehicles portends a time when many cars will not need people to drive them.Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon that would enable the South Korean automaker\u2019s cars to be remotely started, and the heater or air-conditioner to be turned on, by speaking to an Amazon Echo device inside the home. It was only the latest in a series of car-related apps that Amazon has introduced through Echo and the Alexa personal assistant. Other apps include one that enables Alexa to hail Uber rides.Uber, of course, and other ride-hailing services like Lyft, are potentially big disrupters of the automakers\u2019 conventional business model of selling cars to individual consumers. And new variants are coming along, including See Jane Go, which had a booth at the conference. The company addresses a concern of many women by recruiting only female drivers and accepting only female passengers.Mark F. Fields, Ford Motor\u2019s chief executive, spoke here of the opportunities he saw in selling vehicles to the ride-sharing industry, including, eventually, ones that would drive themselves. But optimism requires the car industry to reimagine itself. Instead of the worldwide automobile industry thinking of itself as the $2.3 trillion business it is now, Mr. Fields said, it should see itself as part of the much bigger global transportation industry.BMW has its own car-sharing venture, ReachNow, which operates in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and will soon be in Brooklyn. It allows members to drive a BMW or Mini vehicle for 41 cents a minute of operation.ReachNow\u2019s chief executive, Steve Banfield, in an interview here, compared the concept to Netflix, the video service that has helped render ownership of DVDs superfluous. That might seem like a threat to BMW\u2019s business of selling cars, but Mr. Banfield described it as more of a get-acquainted marketing approach.Some ReachNow members sign up simply for extended test drives of BMW cars like the electric i3, Mr. Banfield said. And younger members who cannot afford a vehicle early in their careers can become familiar with BMW\u2019s products, making them more likely to become buyers once their salaries catch up with their tastes, he said.For people who do own cars but who would not mind some help paying for them, there are mobile-app services like Turo, which enable car owners to rent out their cars. By renting their vehicles for nine days each month, owners could probably cover their entire car payments and maybe even turn a profit, David Stewart, Turo\u2019s chief business officer, said in a presentation here.Turo is good news for automakers, Mr. Stewart said, because it might help someone wary of owning a vehicle to afford to buy one, or to move up to a more luxurious model as the rental income made it affordable.But the question of who does or does not own a car now might one day seem a quaint distinction when cars start driving themselves. And when that time comes, the companies with the biggest identity crises may be ones like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that have persuaded the public to spend big money on the thrill of taking the wheel.Detlev von Platen, executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, views it as an evolution.\u201cOur cars will always be about the driving experience because that\u2019s what we sell \u2014 experiences,\u201d Mr. von Platen said. \u201cBut we must provide options for our owners, and self-driving technologies that can be activated when desired must be considered.\u201dAnd a self-driving Porsche might be more than a robotic tram. Imagine experiencing the throttle, braking and steering inputs of a professional driver on a racetrack. That could be programmed into the car, said Oliver Blume, Porsche\u2019s chief executive.Porsche might also experiment with new types of sales or leasing options to cultivate loyalty. Mr. von Platen said the company might consider a \u201cflex lease,\u201d under which someone leasing a two-seat 718 Cayman would gain access to a Cayenne S.U.V. for seven days a year, which could be handy for when five seats are needed.The other big technology topic was electric vehicles, which all carmakers have been pursuing as a way to address concerns about the climate, as well as government-mandated rules and targets for lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency.Jaguar announced its I-Pace all-electric S.U.V., a concept car that the company said would be available in 2018.And yet the election of Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic who is widely expected to scale back automotive emission and fuel-efficiency regulations, could alter the industry\u2019s planning for environmentally friendlier cars. The possible relaxation of those regulations was an undercurrent here.And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, recently wrote to the Trump transition team urging a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a \u201csubstantial challenge\u201d to the industry.Mr. Blume of Porsche said his company would stay on its current technology track, even if fuel-economy and emissions standards were relaxed.\u201cWhen we think of new technology, we don\u2019t concern ourselves with political changes,\u201d Mr. Blume said. \u201cWe think electrification is a technology of the future, and we have a responsibility to the environment.\u201dThat debate simply reinforces a characteristic that was fully apparent at AutoMobility LA: The automotive business is not just about moving vehicles; it\u2019s about moving targets.An article on the Automobiles page on Friday 18 about the heavy technology focus of the Los Angeles Auto Show misstated the name of the personal assistant in the Amazon Echo. It is Alexa, not Alexis. The article also gave an incorrect title for Detlev von Platen, who commented on autonomous driving technology. He is executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, not president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sandmeyer Reaction: A Short Story", "Date": "2016-11-18", "News": "Supported byIntroductionThen there was this:Spy Hunt (O.S.S.?) \u2014 Philly \u2014 an education in risk \u2014 romantic \u2014 violent.I would tell the story, I thought, of how \u201cmy grandfather\u2019s\u201d rough-and-tumble coming-of-age, at the fringes of South Philadelphia\u2019s Jewish underworld, played a key role in his baptism of fire as an O.S.S. spy during World War II. In terms of incident, it was the vaguest of all the plot arcs I envisioned, but paradoxically a sharper insight into my protagonist\u2019s personality seemed to coalesce around it. I saw that it would give me the opportunity \u2014 by what means I still didn\u2019t know \u2014 to show how in \u201cmy grandfather,\u201d an acute problem-solving intelligence was yoked to a violent and sensitive nature, in the service of a quixotic, even romantic dream.Though it would take close to two years of writing for me to get to \u201cThe Sandmeyer Reaction,\u201d anticipating it, knowing I was headed its way, shaped my understanding of everything that led up to it. The story determined all of my narrative choices as I worked toward it, along plot zigzags of war and courtship and prison and python hunting and family madness.For the first time in my writing life, I wasn\u2019t proceeding in straight chronological fashion from beginning to end. Instead I was following, or attempting to follow, the opioid-induced wanderings of a dying man\u2019s memory into the darkest corners of his life, as filtered through the memory of his loving grandson a quarter-century after the old man\u2019s death. As I hung in there with the narrative\u2019s swerves across time, from the late 1950s to the late 1930s to the late 1980s, from New York City to Philadelphia to Coconut Creek, Fla., the as-yet unrealized but undimmed vision of \u201cThe Sandmeyer Reaction\u201d was my pole star. Working steadily toward it, I never lost my way.When, at last, I arrived at what felt like the proper time to begin to tell the story, I began with deep and careful research. I amassed and devoured materials, paper and electronic, related to Jewish South Philly, the heyday of pool hustling, racetrack life, the history of jukeboxes, the O.S.S.\u2019s real-life \u201cQ Branch\u201d and its remarkable director, Stanley Lovell. Lovell\u2019s career had first become known to me through his wonderful memoir, \u201cOf Spies and Stratagems,\u201d beloved by my nonfictional, scare-quoteless grandfather, whose old Pocket Books edition I now reread.Feeling fully provisioned with raw facts sufficient to the telling of various gilt- and ironclad lies, ready to take a crack at the thing, I went off to the MacDowell Colony, in Peterborough, N.H. I devoted the whole of a precious two-week residency to writing the first of several drafts. Those two weeks were equaled in their hallucinatory intensity, at that point, only by the five-day period I had spent writing the Antarctic \u201cRadioman\u201d section of \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d years before. It was a thrilling plunge into a past I had, by that point, nearly come to consider my own. Though I knew that the episode was going to need heavy revision, I felt certain that, once revised, \u201cThe Sandmeyer Reaction\u201d would be what I had always wanted it to be, and do what I had needed it to do.Two years after that \u2014 this past March \u2014 I completed a final revision of \u201cMoonglow.\u201d That month unfurled as yet another, intensely focused, trancelike spell of days in the novel\u2019s history, a history unlike that of any other book I\u2019ve written. In that month I wrote, rewrote, revised and polished 80 new pages, pages I could never have written, could not have known to write, before then. Scant weeks before the book was due back to my publisher, I came to understand 90 percent of everything that turned out to be most important about \u201cmy grandfather,\u201d \u201cmy grandmother,\u201d their marriage and the world they live in.In its detail, in its rhythm, in its presentation of characters in conflict with their anger, their memories, their broken affections for each other, everything seemed all right with \u201cThe Sandmeyer Reaction.\u201d (If that were not true, this passage would have been left forever to languish among its fellow ones and zeros on my hard drive.) But it did not take long for a suspicion to form and quickly grow to a certainty: The book didn\u2019t need \u201cThe Sandmeyer Reaction\u201d anymore!So I went back to Page 1 of the novel, and made my way through it again, up to this section and then beyond it, all the way to the end. This time I was stalking repercussions, aftereffects and foreshadowings. I was looking for proof that what happened to my protagonist during those mad, painful, absurd 48 hours in Washington and Philadelphia in 1943 was demanded by the emotional or storytelling logic of the events leading up to it. More important, I was looking for evidence that those two days of violence and exaltation burned on, forever afterward, in \u201cmy grandfather\u2019s\u201d memory. Of course, somewhere inside me, the outcome of my search was already known, or I wouldn\u2019t have bothered to conduct it in the first place. By the time I reached the end of the book I didn\u2019t have any doubt: Apart from some subsequent gossip among his fellow intelligence officers in Europe about a gangland reputation that has earned him the \u201cLittle Caesar\u201d-inspired nickname of Rico, \u201cThe Sandmeyer Reaction\u201d was never referred to, directly or indirectly, or thought about, or even avoided as a topic, by any character, at any point in the novel, ever again.This came as a shock to me, but the remedy was clear enough. Years of planning, months of work, hours of vivid, violent, wakeful dreaming at the keyboard \u2014 down the memory hole! Buh-bye, painstaking evocation of a midcentury racetrack backside with its slang and architecture! Buh-bye, creepy, damaged yet oddly tender Lemberger and your sociopathic grace! Buh-bye, days of struggle to concoct a plausible-sounding formula for inadvertently rage-inducing magnetic paint, along with a footnote citing my friend, the real-life chemist Cyrus Harmon, who gave a thumbs up to my guessed-at Sandmeyer reaction!Not long before he died, I jotted down the names of the devices and tools my grandfather remembered having contrived during the months he spent working for Stanley Lovell, the O.S.S.\u2019s deputy director for special projects, in the basement of a building at 23rd and E. Lovell, a chemist and patent lawyer, had been personally recruited by \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan to equip clandestine operatives in Europe, North Africa and the Far East. Lovell and his R&D team set to work devising the fountain-pen pistols, lipstick cameras and cyanide-filled shirt buttons that have since featured in the panoplies of movie and television spies. They found new approaches to infiltration, sabotage and secret communication. They hit on ways to kill the enemy with cunning and panache, with exploding pancake flour and incendiary bats. [1]1. Flying mammals, not sporting gear.The list of my grandfather\u2019s devices was fairly long, scrawled with many annotations inside the front cover of the book I happened to be reading that afternoon, Salinger\u2019s \u201cNine Stories.\u201d Decades later, having recommended \u201cFor Esm\u00e9 \u2014 With Love and Squalor\u201d to my elder daughter, I went looking for \u201cNine Stories,\u201d one of a number of titles that had been duplicated on the shelves of my first marriage, in graduate school. At the sight of the cover with its grid of colored blocks a memory of the afternoon returned to me: a slant of submarine light through the eucalyptus outside my mother\u2019s guest bedroom, my grandfather\u2019s brown face against a white pillow, the sound of his Philadelphia vowels at the back of his nose like a head cold. But when I opened the book the inside cover was blank. In making our terminal inventories my ex-wife and I must have exchanged copies. I recall only five of the projects my grandfather claimed to have originated:1) A crystalline compound, dubbed \u201cwhizzite,\u201d that when mixed with an operative\u2019s own urine, and added to the fuel tank of an airplane, truck or panzer, caused delayed but complete and irreparable damage.2) A small, irregular pyramid of steel that, when wedged against a rail along a stretch of track from which the opposite rail had been loosened \u2014 not even removed \u2014 was guaranteed to derail any locomotive moving less than 30 m.p.h.3) A flexible, expandable garrote made of piano wire sheathed in a common shoestring. \u201cFairly reliable,\u201d my grandfather remembered.4) A pair of \u201cconvertible bifocals,\u201d the lower half-moons of whose lenses were ground in such a way that with a few twists of the frames they could be arranged to form a serviceable spyglass.5) A \u201cmagnetic paint\u201d that would, for example, permit a limpet mine to be affixed to wood or glass. \u201cThat one never quite came together,\u201d my grandfather said.My grandfather had an engineering degree from Drexel Tech, and at first he had found the work interesting, but he was a restless man, prone to confound tedium with rage. He had been trained in subterfuge and violence at a secret base in the Maryland mountains with no mention made of dank basements or chemistry projects. Washington in July was the capital of torpid and in 1944 the action felt very far away. My grandfather was wild to get into it.Late one night he was alone in the basement, reading a book and cooking up a 53rd batch of magnetic paint. The only sounds were the drone of an electric fan and the hiss of the Bunsen jet. The hot night, the string of failures that this batch of magnetic paint would soon extend, the meat grinder into which humanity was feeding itself, and that constant fly-buzz of tedium inside his head, all conspired to make my grandfather vulnerable to adventure. He heard what he took to be the sound of someone choking, a man in respiratory distress. He put down his book, stubbed out his cigarette and went looking, half intentionally, for trouble.The office of the deputy director had been improvised in a corner of the basement from bookcases and file cabinets dragged from various supply rooms. At the center of this henge Stanley Lovell, an abstemious man not given to demonstrations of emotion, sat slumped in a swivel chair. On the desk in front of him stood a china teacup and an open bottle of Vat 69. His face was red. He dragged a hasty pocket square across his cheeks.\u201cTears of anger,\u201d he explained.My grandfather said that in his view they were the only tears worth bothering with.\u201cGeorge Strong has me by the short ones,\u201d Lovell said.General Strong was the director of the U.S. Army\u2019s intelligence service, known as G-2. He and Bill Donovan, director of the rival O.S.S., loathed each other passionately, and allowed that passion to shape their strategic agendas.\u201cNow what?\u201d my grandfather said.My grandfather admired the gallant Donovan but the turf war between O.S.S. and G-2 sickened him. He was contemptuous of pissing contests and tribal loyalties. He despised waste, duplication of effort, the ferocious inertia that prevailed when it was time for O.S.S. to share what it knew with G-2, or G-2 with O.S.S.\u201c \u2018Now what?\u2019 \u201d Lovell leaned back in the swivel chair and looked up at a steel beam overhead, furred with dust. He spoke in a rapid monotone as though reading from a text printed on the ceiling. \u201cA G-2 informant filed a report claiming that I became intoxicated at a dinner in Georgetown, whereupon I told my companions that the reason Dieppe was a catastrophe was because a German spy passed advance warning though a clue in the Times of London crossword puzzle.\u201d\u201cDieppe was a catastrophe?\u201d my grandfather said, mildly shocked. German crowing after the failure of the Dieppe raid in 1942 had been widely taken at the time for exaggeration, propaganda. The Allied governments had never said anything to belie this impression.\u201cWhoops,\u201d Lovell said philosophically. He tilted himself forward and smiled at my grandfather without any display of teeth, or humor. He poured another inch of Vat 69 into the teacup, and knocked it back. \u201cThat is why I avoid drink. Especially at Georgetown dinner parties.\u201d\u201cSo you never said anything at any party. G-2 just wants to smear you.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing personal against me, I\u2019m sure. Strong\u2019s just trying to get back at Donovan for Baltimore.\u201d\u201cWhat happened in Baltimore?\u201d\u201cDrink or leave, but don\u2019t cross-examine me, son. You aren\u2019t here to conduct a damn investigation. Sit the hell down.\u201dMy grandfather took the other chair. Lovell pushed the bottle across the desk. There was no second teacup or container of any kind. My grandfather wondered if he were meant to drink straight from the bottle.He went back into the shop, dog-eared a page in his book. A stack of paper cones clung to the side of the water cooler, in a slotted rack. My grandfather took one cone and returned with it to Lovell\u2019s office. He lit a cigarette and sipped Vat 69 from the paper cone. He disliked the taste of liquor and disdained its effect on the brain. But there was, after all, a war on.\u201cWhat happened in Baltimore is one of our boys was doing his job,\u201d Lovell said. \u201cKid named Quincy, just came out of Area B.\u201dWhen a class was matriculated from Area B, the O.S.S. training facility, located on the present-day site of Camp David, trainees were subjected to one further test. Each man was provided with a clean suit of clothes, a small amount of cash and false ID that conferred no special status or authority. He was instructed to make his way to Washington, Baltimore or Philadelphia, infiltrate a restricted site and obtain a piece of authentic, useful intelligence.\u201cSo Quincy decides he\u2019s going to crack Fort Meade. South of Baltimore.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there?\u201d\u201cForty thousand raw recruits. The Army Cooks and Bakers School. Also, a G-2 training unit. Counter Intelligence Corps.\u201d\u201cUh-oh.\u201d\u201cQuincy talks his way onto the base. Says he\u2019s a reporter for The Baltimore Sun doing a story on Fort Meade\u2019s security procedures, how incredibly strict they are.\u201d\u201cTwo hours after Quincy gets in the front door at Meade,\u201d Lovell went on, splashing another slug into my grandfather\u2019s cup, \u201che is interviewing secretaries in the C.I.C. school front office. Getting all kinds of good stuff, it would appear.\u201d\u201cNo one got wise to him?\u201d\u201cOh, somebody got wise. A top man of the C.I.C. school could tell our man wasn\u2019t kosher, if you\u2019ll forgive the expression. Because, in the end, Quincy was a tyro, he\u2019s fresh out of school. He\u2019s never infiltrated anything in his life but the girls\u2019 cabins on the other side of Lake Wigwam. Unlike the man at the C.I.C. school. Who took Quincy for a spy-hunter. And I suppose that spooked him, because, you see, this particular top man at the C.I.C. school seems to have been a German spy.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cHence the sense of embarrassment felt at G-2. The tit for which I\u2019m to be the tat.\u201dLovell pulled the sheet out, scanned it, and looked bitterly pleased with what it contained.\u201cSo he got spooked,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cThe C.I.C. man.\u201d\u201cHe got spooked, he ran. Reportedly to Philadelphia.\u201d\u201cPhiladelphia?\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cWhat part of Philadelphia?\u201d\u201cYou know,\u201d Lovell said, tilting back in his chair again to read whatever was written on the ceiling. \u201cI actually am an orphan, just like your fellow with the chutzpah. Parents died when I was a boy. Left my sister and me and not much else.\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to say that I\u2019ve come very far in life, done very well for myself, without ever being obliged to learn anything about the geography of Philadelphia.\u201d\u201cTell me this,\u201d my grandfather said. He could feel the certainty of salvation or damnation knocking against his rib cage. His life, or at least his war, was at long last about to begin. \u201cSay we grabbed this fella and then handed him over to G-2, let them take the credit for flushing him out, catching him, however they want to play it. All General Strong has to do is drop this Dieppe business and get off your back.\u201dLovell tilted forward. The hinge of his swivel chair registered his alarm.\u201cThat\u2019s the magnetic paint talking,\u201d he said. He opened the bottom drawer of his desk and put away the bottle of Vat 69. \u201cThe fumes are getting to you.\u201d\u201cPossibly,\u201d my grandfather said.\u201cWho\u2019s going to \u2018grab\u2019 him? You?\u201dMy grandfather said that he knew something about the arts of flight and concealment on the streets of Philadelphia. He alluded to certain fellows there, old comrades from boyhood sandlot raids and wars behind the sugar refinery. They had grown up to be tough guys, hoodlums, foot soldiers for men like Nig Rosen and Waxy Gordon. It was their job to fathom the depths of Philadelphia. They might have heard things that policemen and F.B.I. agents were unlikely to hear. As he spoke he saw himself putting a shoulder to the back door of a rowhouse in Gray\u2019s Ferry, falling into a roomful of panic and mayhem amid a shower of splinters. He saw himself working his thumbs into the hollow of the German spy\u2019s throat. It seemed like it might be fun.\u201cYou\u2019re really serious.\u201d\u201cI need to get out of this goddamn basement, sir,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cTo be honest.\u201d\u201cYes, but General Donovan wants you in this goddamn basement. And the last time he didn\u2019t get what he wanted was in 1932.\u201d [2] 2. The year of his unsuccessful bid to succeed F.D.R. as governor of New York.\u201cGive me 24 hours.\u201d My grandfather looked at his wristwatch, though I remember he always seemed to know within five minutes what time it was. \u201cMidnight tomorrow. Let me try to find the bastard. If I do, you convince Wild Bill to reassign me elsewhere.\u201d\u201cElsewhere.\u201d Lovell\u2019s mouth twisted at one corner with what my grandfather presumed must be contempt. \u201cElsewhere where we\u2019re losing an average of five operatives a week? That elsewhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not picky,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cAny kind of elsewhere will do.\u201d\u201cI did not peg you as the hero type.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d my grandfather said, though in fact he believed that he might \u2014 perhaps one day very soon \u2014 prove to be that very thing. \u201cJust bored.\u201dLovell shook his head. He looked disappointed in my grandfather.\u201cYou\u2019re a bright fellow. But I guess not as bright as I thought.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the paint fumes,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cTwo weeks ago I was a genius.\u201dLovell was looking into the teacup as though he hoped to find in it the courage to say no to my grandfather.\u201cI have to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a mess. After Quincy spooked the man. An exchange of fire. Quincy creased the man\u2019s ear, but he got a bullet in the gut for his trouble.\u201d He jabbed the barrel of a finger against his stomach. \u201cHe almost made it through the debriefing.\u201dMy grandfather stood up, and crumpled the paper cone in his fist.\u201cI\u2019m going to need some Benzedrine,\u201d he said. He took his wallet from his hip pocket and made a show of counting the two tens, two fives and three ones that he had known it to contain. \u201cAnd 200 dollars.\u201dLovell blinked. He looked to be on the point of smiling but something about my grandfather\u2019s expression seemed to discourage him from doing so. He picked up a ring of keys on his desk and went to one of the filing cabinets that entombed him. He unlocked its bottom drawer and took out a steel box painted white and stenciled with a red cross. It was full of wax-paper packets the color of used tea bags. He rummaged through them.\u201cBetter not give you the cyanide pills by mistake,\u201d he said.He took out four packets of Benzedrine, four pills to the packet, then went to another file cabinet and unlocked its top drawer. Inside there was a strongbox with a combination lock. Lovell counted out 200 crisp dollars in tens and fives and passed them to my grandfather along with the pills.\u201cHold on,\u201d he said.He opened a door in his desk and brought out a Colt .38 revolver. It was a venerable hunk of iron patched with a nap of dust. It would not have looked out of place on the hip of Teddy Roosevelt, or of Pershing in Mexico. My grandfather weighed it and fingered its grip. He raised it with both hands to take aim at platinum on a periodic table tacked to the wall. He handed the gun back to Lovell.\u201cI won\u2019t need it,\u201d he said.Lovell followed him out of the maze of filing cabinets to his station. My grandfather shut off the Bunsen burner and switched off the fan. He sat down in a chair by his lab table and took off his black oxfords. He reached under the table for a pair of tan work boots that assorted oddly with his blue serge suit. He slipped his book \u2014 it was called \u201cDie Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen\u201d \u2014 into the hip pocket of his suit jacket. He and Lovell shook hands.\u201cI used to know when I was making a mistake,\u201d Lovell said. \u201cNow I haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201dMy grandfather went back to his room in the house near Rock Creek Park, took a shower, put on a clean shirt, socks and necktie. He shaved the blue from his chin and took one of the pills. He caught the first train to Philadelphia from Union Station and with the help of Benzedrine and his ambition organized his thoughts about the best approach to the problem. When he arrived at 30th Street Station in Philly he found a taxi and directed the driver to the corner of Fourth Street and Ritner.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6The pool hall was called Tighe\u2019s, though Tighe was long out of the picture. The present owner, Isidor Mazer, had accepted a majority stake in the establishment as payment for a debt incurred by a nephew of the original Tighe. On a faded wooden sign over the door, half a bisected eight ball dotted the i in \u201cTighe\u2019s.\u201d The eight was a token of defeat as well as victory, my grandfather thought, like a roll of seven at craps, or the reckless seizing of what seemed to be opportunity.Mazer\u2019s business, some of it legitimate, was manifold and far-flung. He conducted it from the upstairs room of Tighe\u2019s, or at least he had as of the day my grandfather left for Camp Claiborne. Since then Mazer and my grandfather had fallen out of touch.Their parting had been strained. A beloved older brother of Mazer\u2019s had been press-ganged into the Czar\u2019s army while still a beardless kid and fed to Japanese Gatlings near the Yalu River in 1905. Mazer\u2019s thinking on the subject of military service was muddled by tragedy and rage. When he heard that my grandfather had enlisted he took the news badly. Nevertheless he and his ancient English bulldog, Hadassah, had made my grandfather a little going-away party: a Chinese restaurant, a visit to the best whorehouse in South Philadelphia, and an early-morning run on a Logan Avenue appetizing store. Hadassah, \u201ca prizewinning bitch and the dam of champions,\u201d in Mazer\u2019s phrase, went everywhere with Mazer. She was wheezy and corpulent in her dotage and looked more like a pig than a dog to my grandfather, who was never especially fond of animals. Her characteristic odor of wet woolen stockings drying on a radiator had not been improved by a plate of creamed herring at Ruby\u2019s.When the party broke up Hadassah and Mazer drove my grandfather down to the train station in Mazer\u2019s Model K. Mazer made no effort to restrain his tears.\u201cThirteen grand you netted for me,\u201d he said. \u201cJust in 1941. With nothing but a wooden stick.\u201dHe dabbed at his cheeks with a handkerchief \u2014 green, red and gold silk patterned with foxhounds and hunting horns. On the seat beside him sat Hadassah. Thirteen thousand dollars was nothing to Isidor Mazer; he staked my grandfather at pocket billiards not for profit but because he liked to see smiles wiped from the faces of hotshots and fools humiliated. My grandfather said something to this effect.\u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d Mazer said tenderly. He blew his nose into the handkerchief. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart kid but the Army is going to make you dumb, and then kill you.\u201d Hadassah made soft croaking sounds to show that she sympathized. \u201cGo on, get killed, you dumb piece of shit.\u201dThat morning in early 1942 the sky had been February gray, the day cold as a nickel. Now it was the gray of August, the morning sticky and warm, a nickel clutched too long in the hand. Tighe\u2019s appeared to have gone out of business years before, but there was nothing in that. Mazer\u2019s first move on transferring his operation to Tighe\u2019s had been to fire the crew that came twice a month to clean the storefront\u2019s windows, two big squares gridded with small square panes. A film of grime, smoke and halitosis municipal and human was permitted to accrue on both sides of the glass. Next Mazer had the fine old etched-glass saloon door with its curlicues of gold-leaf script replaced by plain steel, painted black and fitted with a judas. There were no hours of operation posted, no sign to read open or closed depending on which way you turned it. The brutal geometries of pocket billiards meant as little to Mazer as the men it broke or exalted. He did not care how much business Tighe\u2019s did beyond the minimum required to make it a plausible concern in the eyes of tax gatherers, G-men and the like.My grandfather lingered on the sidewalk, contending with a flutter in his stomach. He remembered pausing here to scatter some last-minute butterflies on a muggy evening five years earlier. It was the night of his encounter with Dinky Shavers out of Chicago. He was a kid of 19 then, his game unknown north of South Street, staked by Isidor Mazer beyond any sum he might ever have hoped to scrape together himself. At that time there had been a store selling layettes on one side of Tighe\u2019s, on the other side a dealer in gravestones. It made my grandfather blush to recall having seen something fit, some kind of poetry in that arrangement. Even 50 years later it embarrassed him to admit to having mistaken a case of nerves for foreknowledge of his destiny, between the baby blanket and the shroud, as a poolroom god. Now it was August 1944. He had without regret abandoned his custom Rambow cue, a gift from Mazer on defeating Dinky Shavers, to his kid brother. The gravestone dealer was still in business, but Hirschman\u2019s Layette had been replaced by a collection center for scrap metal. And the stirring of fate and poetry in his belly was only Benzedrine.He took a deep breath. There was a buzzer by the steel door that had used to remind him promisingly of a woman\u2019s breast, white Bakelite dome, red button. He pushed the nipple twice and let the breath out of his lungs. There was no denying that he had cleaned Dinky Shavers\u2019s clock for him that night.The judas slid open. The expression in the eyes looking over my grandfather wavered between irony and mischief, the eyes of a raccoon ransacking your trash can when you surprised it with a light.My grandfather recognized the eyes as belonging to Louis Lemberger, a former classmate, even at one time something resembling a friend. Lemberger\u2019s father was a chess player, a concert violinist. Until a police horse kicked him in the face while he was watching the 1929 Mummers Parade, Louie Lemberger had been the smartest boy at Thomas Junior High, a whiz kid, self-taught in calculus. The accident left him a mess and an object of universal pity. A story ran in The Inquirer, strangers came forward to pay the medical bills. The horse had knocked out almost all of Lemberger\u2019s teeth. His nose had been smashed flat and then poorly reconstructed so that when healed it was larger than before. It looked like the portion of a dressed capon known as the pupik. When he spoke, which happened with increasing rareness, he sounded congested and slow. In time it became apparent that the encounter between his prefrontal cortex and a horseshoe had also knocked loose something in Lemberger\u2019s mind. His empirical gifts were bent toward petty arson, cruel pranks, experiments with firecrackers and stray dogs. Within a year he burned off the gas of pity in which the accident had enveloped him. He was still smart but in a way that could be useful only to a man like Mazer.\u201cI need to see the old man,\u201d my grandfather said.Lemberger said nothing but the irony went out of his gaze leaving only mischief. There was a story from after the accident about Lemberger, a retarded female cousin and a live mouse. Half a century on my grandfather recalled the story with a shudder and refused to go into it.The panel in the door began to slide shut.\u201cLouie, come on. It\u2019s important. And I\u2019m in a hurry. Look at this.\u201dMy grandfather reached into the breast pocket of his gray suit jacket. Lemberger breathed in sharply, a snuffle of alarm.\u201cEasy,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cNice and slow.\u201dHe took out the folding sleeve of manila cardstock that held his government photostat \u2014 his name, an eagle, some digits \u2014 and held it up to the judas so that Lemberger could get a look. Lemberger leaned closer. My grandfather raised the manila sleeve half an inch higher. As he followed it with his gaze Lemberger\u2019s ruined nose came into view. My grandfather shot out his right hand. He collapsed his fingers together and jammed them through the slot in the door.Even on an August morning in Philadelphia the flesh of Lemberger\u2019s pupik felt strangely clammy. My grandfather hooked his index and middle fingers into Lemberger\u2019s nostrils. He clamped down with his thumb. He gave the nose a clockwise twist and pulled it through the slot. Lemberger grunted. He pressed his hands against the door on his side and tried to push back. Something inside the structure of his nose made a sound like celery between the teeth. My grandfather found that he was willing to pull, if necessary, until he pulled the man entire through the slot in the door or the nose tore loose from a red hole in Lemberger\u2019s face.\u201cOpen up,\u201d he said.He heard Lemberger scrabbling at the latch. The door swung experimentally inward. My grandfather worked all the strength of his right arm into the pinch-grip of his fingers. As the door opened he saw Lemberger groping in the waistband of his trousers. My grandfather reached around the door with his left hand and knocked Lemberger\u2019s hand away. His fingers closed around the grip of an automatic pistol. It felt as warm and inviting to the touch as Lemberger\u2019s nose was repellent and cold. He let go of the nose. Lemberger fell back from the doorway and sat down so hard that his teeth chimed like a pair of castanets. My grandfather was left holding the gun. He stepped into the pool hall with its bouquet of hair oil and spittoon and a hint of wool socks drying on a grate. My grandfather shut the door behind him and set the latch. He took the clip out of the gun and slipped it into his pants pocket. He tossed the gun into Lemberger\u2019s lap.\u201cI said I was in a hurry.\u201dAt the back of the pool hall a short narrow flight of stairs led up to Mazer\u2019s rooms. When Tighe\u2019s was open for business Mazer stationed some professional giant, ex-fighter, ex-policeman, at the bottom of these stairs. On a busy night there might be two giants, armed with a sap or a knuckle-duster, a baseball bat, even a hammer. Mazer saw to it that nobody made trouble. But it was early morning on a weekday and Tighe\u2019s was closed. The giants were all home in their giant gatkes sleeping one off. And my grandfather had the magazine from Louis Lemberger\u2019s .22 in his pants pocket. If trouble were my grandfather\u2019s purpose there was nobody to stop him from making it.He started for the stairs. Lemberger cursed. He grabbed at my grandfather\u2019s right foot in its heavy boot. He got a solid hold on my grandfather\u2019s ankle with one hand and pulled. My grandfather was forced to pivot on his left foot but managed not to lose his balance. Lemberger got his other hand around my grandfather\u2019s ankle. The cuff of my grandfather\u2019s trouser leg rode up. He hopped up and down on his left foot and tried to shake loose of Lemberger.Lemberger scrambled onto his knees. He pushed his face toward the exposed band of pale leg between my grandfather\u2019s cuff and the top of his boot. A half-moon blade cut a slit in Lemberger\u2019s face from the inside, just above the chin. It bore a disconcerting resemblance to a smile. My grandfather recalled with a jolt that in close-quarters fighting, Lemberger had been known to rely on the teeth purchased for him years before by kindhearted readers of The Inquirer. [3] 3. Biting off a convenient part of your enemy in a fight was a venerable South Philadelphia tradition, my grandfather explained, but had always been \u201cmore of an Irish thing.\u201dMy grandfather stopped trying to tug his foot free. He thrust outward with the heel, aiming for the mezzaluna smile. The kick went a little awry. The toe of his boot, reinforced with steel, caught Lemberger between the chin and Adam\u2019s apple. Lemberger fell back with his mouth open. He appeared to be screaming but the only sound that came out was moist and whistling like a garden hose with a pinhole leak. My grandfather rushed the former president of the Thomas Junior High Galileo Club, of which my grandfather had been recording secretary. He raised his foot in its murderous boot. Lemberger opened his eyes wide. My grandfather fought with dwindling resolve against the urge to stomp down on Lemberger\u2019s face as hard as he could.\u201cKnock it off.\u201dMy grandfather eased his foot back to the pool hall floor. The cuff of his trouser leg fell into place.Mazer stood on the stairs in a paisley dressing gown over pinstriped blue pajamas, pale feet stuffed into a pair of black velour mules embroidered with gold anchors. He looked ghastly. The pink plump cheeks had deflated and bore a silvery moire of stretch marks. The pink plump hands had given way to leather over bone. The cancer in Mazer\u2019s bowel was not yet public knowledge but my grandfather saw immediately that the old man was done for. [4]4. He died April 12, 1945, the same day as F.D.R.\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Mazer said. He reached into the hip pocket of his dressing gown and came up with more than half of a perfecto, which he stuck into his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m mildly curious.\u201d The cigar bobbed up and down between his teeth.My grandfather went to Mazer where he was standing haggard on the stairs. He struck a match and held it to the end of Mazer\u2019s cigar.\u201cSay I got shot and needed a doctor to fix me up, but I was intent on keeping a low profile. Would you know who to send me to?\u201d\u201cOnce upon a time, not now,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cSuch doctors are scarce.\u201dMy grandfather felt his throat tighten. He was going to have to do it the hard way, now.\u201cWhy is that?\u201d he said.\u201cA doc willing to do that kind of work, almost by definition he\u2019s not going to be your top-drawer practitioner, right? He\u2019s a drunk, he killed a patient. Sooner or later he\u2019s going to perform malpractice on somebody, amputate the wrong leg or something. The kind of clientele he serves have a violent way of taking their business elsewhere.\u201d\u201cAsking what? Asking for who? What are we talking about, here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to need a doctor,\u201d my grandfather said.Mazer crossed his eyes and smacked his lips until the cigar caught fire. He held it up between two wasted fingers and watched the flame dwindle to a rippled thread of smoke.He stuck the cigar back into his mouth. He blew a gust of smoke into my grandfather\u2019s face. His blue eyes were as bright and irritable as ever. He brushed past my grandfather and shuffled in his slippers to the \u201cThrone of Elijah,\u201d a wing-backed chair with a needlepoint footrest and a view of the best table, where the big money changed hands.\u201cWhy?\u201d he said.\u201cGunshot wound.\u201dMazer frowned. He looked my grandfather up and down appraisingly but with a reluctant shake of the head as though to stipulate ahead of time that he knew my grandfather was putting him on. My grandfather heard Lemberger behind him, a scrape of leather sole against the parquet floor. He reached into the pocket of his suit jacket. He fingered the clip he had taken from Lemberger\u2019s gun.\u201cYeah?\u201d Mazer said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to shoot you?\u201dWithout looking behind him my grandfather tossed the clip over his left shoulder. There was a slap, metal against palm, neat as the arc of a nice catch.\u201cLemberger,\u201d said my grandfather.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6One thing I thought I knew was that at some Moonblatt wedding of the late 1960s my grandfather had presented me to a dapper old party whose name was Dr. Fireman. This Dr. Fireman wore a white Panama hat and a knotted foulard. His Buster Browns were Steinway black. A gold watch chain described a trans-Atlantic route across the globe of his belly.In spite of the man\u2019s panache and beguiling surname I might well have forgotten him, along with all the other guests at the reception that evening. But from the moment my grandfather led me into the room \u2014 some banquet hall in the wilderness of Levittown \u2014 I understood that to my grandfather Dr. Fireman was a person of mysterious importance. My grandfather crouched down beside me, put an arm around my shoulder and pointed out the silver-haired dandy in a pinstriped double-breasted suit, sitting lonely as a mountain in a corner of the room.\u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s give the man a look at you.\u201dAfterward I would forget whatever passed between Dr. Fireman and me in the way of conversation, but I kept the distinct impression that the old man had been pleased to meet me. When after two minutes he and I parted company forever I was in dazzled possession of a Liberty dollar as heavy and venerable as history itself.Only, it turned out, I had it all wrong. It wasn\u2019t a wedding or a Moonblatt affair; the old man\u2019s name was not Fireman; and he wasn\u2019t a doctor at all.\u201cIt was Artie Newman\u2019s bar mitzvah,\u201d my grandfather said. He had slept more soundly than usual during the night. On waking he had asked for French toast, which he called \u201cPan Purdoo\u201d in the exaggerated tourist-from-Iowa accent he put on whenever he said something in French. His voice was strong and his color less sallow. I knew he would never recover but seeing pink in his cheek and hearing a bass note in his voice I could not help thinking that he might. \u201cThe guy\u2019s name was Feuerman. He was a horse trainer, his horses won a lot of races. He was a friend of Marvin Marx.\u201dThat was a name I hadn\u2019t heard in a while, one always charged, in my family, with a certain dark romance. Marvin Marx was something to my cousin Artie on his mother\u2019s side, no blood relative of mine. He was an attorney with ties to the Bruno crime family. (The atmospherics of his career had inspired certain elements of the plot of my first novel.) When casino gambling came to Atlantic City in the late \u201970s, it was Marvin Marx, people said, who did the lawyering.When the mob bosses of Philadelphia went to war \u2014 I was a senior in high school at the time \u2014 Marvin Marx disappeared while on vacation in Hollywood, Fla. It later emerged that he had been shot and strangled by unknown persons who expertly dismembered him, packed him in pieces into a steel oil drum, and sank the oil drum in 50 feet of water off Key Biscayne. Neglecting to consult my grandfather, who had no connection whatever to the matter but would have been happy to explain the biochemistry of putrefaction, the killers failed to punch the necessary escape holes in the oil drum. A month after Marx\u2019s disappearance it bobbed to the surface of Biscayne Bay and its place in family lore.\u201cFeuerman had ties, too,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cOn a lot of those horses of his, I heard it was really Angelo Bruno who put up the money.\u201d\u201cBut . . .\u201d I tried to square this information with the dollar-sized memory I\u2019d been clutching all those years. \u201cBut you called him \u2018Doctor.\u2019 \u201d\u201cNo,\u201d my grandfather said, \u201cI called him \u2018Doc.\u2019 It was a little joke we had.\u201d\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6Lemberger shot my grandfather with the .22, at close range, aiming for a part of the body with no bones or vital organs \u2014 the one known to later decades as a \u201clove handle.\u201d The slug drilled a hole in my grandfather from front to back and lodged in the ornate frame of a portrait of John L. Sullivan, where it remained until 1972, when the building that housed Tighe\u2019s was torn down, prompting a eulogy by Philadelphia Daily News columnist Tom Fox. According to local legend, Fox wrote, the stray shot \u201cwas the parting gift of a Nazi spy on the lam.\u201d As with the silvery asterisk on my grandfather\u2019s ass left behind by the teeth of a broken bottle, a pair of faint white blazes fore and aft forever commemorated the path of Lemberger\u2019s bullet. [5]5. The first time I noticed these scars, as a kid, my grandfather told me that when he was stationed at Camp Lejeune a \u201cbayou worm\u201d had bored its way into his abdomen. He said that the bayou worm had laid hundreds of eggs which gestated for three years before emerging, through a hole in his back, in a painful cavalcade of worms that lasted five hours. The inquiry was never repeated.The wound was clean and well executed but it bled freely and burned like hot wire.\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d said Isidore Mazer from the comfort of the \u201cThrone of Elijah.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t say you were planning to make such a goddamn mess.\u201dMazer had once worked as a cutman for Lew Tendler. He knew his way around a needle driver and suture thread and had already offered, more than once, to patch my grandfather up. It galled him to see my grandfather stand there bleeding all over the floor of his pool hall, not to mention ruining a perfectly good handkerchief.\u201cSilk,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cTwelve dollars at Strawbridge and Clothier.\u201d\u201cPut it on my tab,\u201d my grandfather said. He felt that for the sake of authenticity it would have to appear that he had made shift to dress his wound himself.He bit through the whipstitched hem of the silk handkerchief and then tore it in half. He reached around and tried to poke one of the halves with exceeding gentleness into the exit wound. Lightning forked across his back. His resolve faltered and the bit of handkerchief popped loose from the hole. My grandfather just managed to catch it before it could fall to the ground.He swore, and then turned his attention to the entry wound, which naturally was easier to get at. He took a breath and set his jaw. This time when he worked in the piece of handkerchief lightning flickered all the way to the roots of his eyeballs. His legs bowed and then seemed to forget their business entirely. Lemberger stepped forward to grip him by the elbow.\u201cSteady,\u201d he said.The moment my grandfather asked Lemberger to put a bullet through his midsection the animosity between them had been forgotten. Lemberger seemed to have gained new respect for my grandfather, not as a man who would let himself be shot for the sake of verisimilitude but as an unexpected source of entertainment.\u201cHow about I do the back for you?\u201c Lemberger said.\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said my grandfather.He pasted his fingers to the exit wound and waited while Lemberger went to a small basin that was bolted to the wall outside the toilet. He ran hot water and washed his hands carefully with the castile soap that Mazer provided. Every psychopath he ever knew, my grandfather told me \u2014 he put the number at five \u2014 had been dependably hygienic.While he waited for Lemberger to finish washing my grandfather took measured breaths. He reminded himself that the difference between pain and pleasure was subjective, a matter of context. No doubt there were people out there who would enjoy getting holed by a .22. He tried to imagine that he was that kind of person.\u201cSo where do I go?\u201d my grandfather asked Mazer. \u201cWho\u2019s going to know the doc that\u2019ll fix me up no questions asked?\u201d\u201cNow you ask me that?\u201d Mazer said. \u201cWhat if the answer\u2019s \u2018nobody\u2019? What if I say I don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cI asked you before.\u201dMazer shook his head. He quoted, not for the first time, a wise proverb he claimed to have once found inside of a fortune cookie: \u201cThe journey of a thousand miles begins by leaving out a crucial step.\u201d\u201cBut I told you what the plan was going to be,\u201d my grandfather said.\u201cYes,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cAnd as you may recall I attempted to dissuade you from it.\u201dMy grandfather felt the edge of something cold and cutting laid against his scalp at the hairline. It was the cooling of his sweat. He felt like he might want to vomit, but there would be no point, since he had eaten nothing for the past several hours but Benzedrine pills. So he forbore.\u201c \u2018What if the answer\u2019s nobody?\u2019 \u201d Lemberger said. He jerked some fresh towel down from the roll dispenser and blotted his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s hysterical.\u201d He didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cNow then.\u201dMy grandfather passed Lemberger the other half of the handkerchief and pulled his hand from the wound. There was a peeling sound as his fingers came unstuck.Lemberger\u2019s fingers were again briefly five iron cuffs along my grandfather\u2019s arm. Then somebody tripped a circuit breaker in my grandfather\u2019s head, and he was plunged into darkness.When the lights came on again Lemberger was hugging my grandfather from behind, holding him up by the armpits. The toes of my grandfather\u2019s boots just grazed the floor. Mazer was standing right in front of him, peering in at my grandfather\u2019s face like an exterminator checking a baseboard for holes. The whites of Mazer\u2019s eyes were something closer to ivory. Under the bouquet of his eau de cologne there was something rancid, a bit of meat left between the teeth overnight.\u201cTell me what this is already,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cEnough.\u201dMy grandfather worked himself loose of Lemberger. He saw to it that his legs remembered why he kept them around.\u201cIf I could tell you, Iz, I swear to you, I would.\u201d\u201cShow me the piece of paper that you showed to Louis,\u201d Mazer said.The government identification card in its folded manila sleeve did not give very much away but after he had glanced at it and turned it over once or twice Mazer seemed to feel that he had a better grasp of the situation. He went back over to the wing-backed chair. On his way he fished a dime from the pocket of the paisley robe.Next to the Throne of Elijah sat a primitive Wurlitzer jukebox, made of fumed oak. It had a window leafed with gold curlicues and when you looked in the window you saw 12 shellac records, racked like drying dinner plates. Only Mazer was allowed to operate this piece of equipment, and he only ever played one song, \u201cStars Fell on Alabama.\u201d All the other records were what my grandfather called \u201cblue.\u201d They had been selected by previous management and had titles like \u201cBanana in Your Fruit Basket\u201d and \u201cMeat Balls.\u201d Mazer was a prude. He hated that stuff. The only reason he kept the jukebox around was to have the satisfaction of forbidding its use to others.Mazer pressed the button for \u201cStars Fell on Alabama\u201d and lowered himself onto his throne. A shaft turned a cam, a cam drove a wheel that moved a belt. A metal pawl ticked against a ratchet. Guy Lombardo\u2019s orchestra started to play.\u201cTwenty years ago, I could\u2019ve referred you to three, four crooked docs myself,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cTruly it was an age of gold.\u201d\u201cAlbert the Chink?\u201d Lemberger said. He was digging around in a cabinet under the cash register. This cash register was of an even earlier vintage than the jukebox. It had never in my grandfather\u2019s experience been used to hold money or ring up a charge. Mazer liked to keep accounts in his head and cash out of view. He felt that the sight of money like the bare flesh of a woman interfered with men\u2019s ability not to be idiots. \u201cHe has the eyes, but he\u2019s a Yid.\u201d At the back of the cabinet Lemberger found a box of rolled gauze. \u201cHis brother\u2019s some kind of doc. I had to go to him to get tested for the medicine merit badge.\u201dIt came back to my grandfather, painful in a different way: Louie Lemberger with a kerchief around his neck. The tan shorts, the high woolen socks.\u201cAlbert the Chink\u2019s brother has a permanent case of the shakes, Baden-Powell,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cHe lives under the Girard Avenue Bridge. He couldn\u2019t sew up a chicken.\u201dMy grandfather waved away the roll of gauze that Lemberger proffered.\u201cIt\u2019ll look better if I don\u2019t bandage it. Like I was in more of a rush.\u201d\u201cSay you swiped it from a drugstore.\u201d The damage that had been done to Lemberger\u2019s face by a policeman\u2019s horse at the Mummers parade seemed momentarily to worsen. \u201cSay you jumped a nurse.\u201dMy grandfather recoiled. The way Lemberger came out with the nurse scenario was a little too vivid. But he had to acknowledge that bleeding to death might get in the way of the job he was trying to do. He took off his bloody shirt and allowed Lemberger to mummify his abdomen. Lemberger did the job with precision worthy of a merit badge.\u201cPelz?\u201d Lemberger said over his shoulder, talking to Mazer. He pressed the end of the gauze bandage against the outcrop of my grandfather\u2019s hip with the fingers of his right hand. \u201cTurn. Keep turning.\u201d\u201cWhy did I think Pelz was dead?\u201d Mazer said.\u201cSo he is,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d\u201cThe guy at the mick funeral home on Taney.\u201d\u201cDoyle.\u201d\u201cNot Doyle.\u201d\u201cDoyle.\u201d\u201cIs that Doyle?\u201d\u201cHe went in the Navy.\u201d\u201cFunny how they do the open casket and we don\u2019t,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cNo wonder people don\u2019t trust us.\u201d\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d\u201cI mean, open the goddamn casket,\u201d Mazer suggested to their fellow Jews around the world. \u201cWhat are you trying to hide?\u201dMy grandfather had considered that risk of death would increase with the period of time between gunshot and treatment but in his planning he had failed to take into account, among other things, the established fact that for unknown reasons no conversation at Tighe\u2019s Poolroom, no matter how pea-brained, had ever lasted less than three hours. He hoped that packing and binding the wounds would keep him from bleeding to death before these two managed to come up with the name of someone who was likely to know a doctor sufficiently ruined to treat criminals and German spies on a clandestine cash basis.\u201cTalking of Catholics,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s that priest. Ex-priest. The one that taught science at Southeast Catholic.\u201d\u201cMonk.\u201d\u201cEx-monk. He used to run a hospital in Camden. He\u2019s got to know a lot of docs. He\u2019s a Polack.\u201d\u201cHungarian.\u201d\u201cHungarian?\u201d\u201cHow about we get out the phone book,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cGo through it name by name under \u2018Crooked Doctor Referral\u2019?\u201dMazer and Lemberger looked up at my grandfather with expressions of mild surprise.\u201cI for one have reached the limits of my ignorance,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cI would apologize, but this situation is hardly my fault.\u201d\u201cI can give you a lift over to the Girard Avenue Bridge if you want to look for Albert the Chink\u2019s brother,\u201d Lemberger said.My grandfather picked up his bloody shirt, tweezing it at the shoulder seams with his fingertips. When he put the shirt back on it felt cold and stiff against his skin.\u201cI told you the war would make you stupid,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cI warned you. Two years ago you would never have let Lemberger shoot you for nothing.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for nothing,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cNow he knows how it feels to get shot.\u201dMazer made one of the rueful snorting noises that served him for laughter, but Lemberger did not appear to have been joking, which my grandfather appreciated. If he were to make it through this fucked-up situation alive, he thought, then being shot would be one less thing to waste time worrying about. Being shot turned out to be like everything else that happened in life: Either it killed you or it didn\u2019t. The same odds obtained across the board, with or without gunplay: At the end of every day you were either alive, or you weren\u2019t. Every day, death paid even money. He didn\u2019t regret having let Lemberger shoot him. What bothered him was that now the Nazi was going to get away with killing Quincy, and General Strong was going to hand Stanley Lovell his ass, and maybe Wild Bill his, while he was at it. And my grandfather would never escape the torpor of Washington, the basement at 23rd and E. Once again the start of the life he was destined to lead would have to be postponed. It was too bad the war had made him stupid.\u201cStitch me up, then,\u201d he told Mazer. \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t die in this dump.\u201dBefore Mazer could say anything smart there was a chiming from the stairwell at the back of the poolroom. A series of hammer taps alternated with drum-kicks as Hadassah fell slowly and with a show of dignity down the stairs. When the dog hit bottom she slid her hindquarters under her belly, deftly, a waiter helping a fat man onto a seat cushion. She gave out a wheeze of pleasure. It had been a long and arduous journey from her spot by the gas fire in Mazer\u2019s office. She grinned at Mazer. Black lips, pink tongue, teeth the color you found inside a cotton cigarette filter after you had smoked the cigarette. Gulping air with that sound like she had a permanent head cold. She was leathern and bloated, the offspring of a set of bagpipes and a medicine ball. My grandfather estimated that on that morning in 1944 she must have been at least 20 years old.\u201cHold on a second, now,\u201d Mazer said. He was talking to my grandfather but he was looking at the dog. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t die yet.\u201d\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6My grandfather got into Lemberger\u2019s car, a \u201938 Pontiac coupe, rolled down the window and passed out. There was nothing after that until something cold and hard nuzzled the hollow of his ear.\u201cWake up, peaches,\u201d Lemberger said.My grandfather started awake and the sudden motion lit up the bullet holes. The pain was bad but on the other hand it was in its way comforting because in the half-second before it hit my grandfather could not remember where he was or what he had come there to do. A shudder rippled through his body. The thing nuzzling his ear turned out to be the snout of Lemberger\u2019s gun. My grandfather batted it away.\u201cTake it,\u201d Lemberger said. He had stopped the car and cut the engine. \u201cYou want it. Go on.\u201d\u201cNo thanks.\u201dLemberger misunderstood.\u201cI got others,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just my little Tuesday morning breakfast gun.\u201dHe pressed the gun into the palm of my grandfather\u2019s left hand. My grandfather fought an impulse to jerk the hand away. His skin revolted against the chill of it and another shudder whip-cracked through him. He could not shake the sensation of the cold muzzle against his ear, which somehow he was also experiencing as a taste of metal at the back of his tongue. He forced his fingers to close around the waffle-iron of the pistol grip. He worked to pull himself together.\u201cO.K.?\u201d Lemberger said.\u201cO.K.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThat was a lie; he had never felt so profoundly wrong. It was like when you fell asleep in a funny position and woke up with someone else\u2019s arm in the bed with you, attached to your shoulder. Only this was not just an arm, it was his whole body that felt like somebody else\u2019s. He decided to try looking out the car window to see if that helped.They were parked on the shoulder of a stretch of unpainted blacktop alongside a whitewashed fence. Beyond the fence lay a meadow. The morning smelled of wet grass and something heavier, some tree in flower, a fecund smell that verged on rottenness. Across the road there was another green meadow behind another white fence, more trees. At the moment there were no horses in view, but horses were definitely implied. This was DuPont country, somewhere outside of Wilmington, Del. DuPonts would have horses.\u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u201cA well-known fact about getting shot.\u201d\u201cNot that.\u201d My grandfather pointed at the meadow. \u201cThat.\u201dHe could not explain. The white was too radiant, the green too ripe. The black loops drawn by bees among the grass blades seemed to pick at my grandfather like sutures. A red horse came up over a rise at the far end of the meadow. My grandfather supposed the word for that color of horse was bay. The sky behind the horse was heavy and luminous with rain. Even at a distance the red of the horse\u2019s coat against the gray, to my grandfather, was like sandpaper against the skin. He wondered if getting shot had addled him, or if his recent attempt to confound pain with pleasure had broken something in his brain.\u201cYeah,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cFucking bastards.\u201dEven though Lemberger was a psychopath, and even though at that moment my grandfather was unconcerned with the dialectics of class struggle, he knew what Lemberger meant. They were poor boys, the sons of socialists who revered Heywood and voted Debs. The pretty meadow and the white fence belonged to a man who was likely to rate that bay horse more highly than he would ever have rated my grandfather, Lemberger or anyone who came from their world.For a moment they watched the rich man\u2019s horse rummage and rip at the grass up at the top of the rise. It moved slant-foot across the meadow with a sneaking laziness like a shortstop cheating in on a runner at second. To my grandfather\u2019s eye it had been foolishly or fancifully engineered to defy harsh laws of gravity and dynamics, a cathedral built to stand upon its steeple.\u201cThoroughbred,\u201d Lemberger said.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYeah. All this, it\u2019s stud farm.\u201dIt seemed unlikely Lemberger would not follow this observation with something lewd but it was quiet enough in the coupe to hear the bees stitching up the dandelions.\u201cYou ever ride a horse?\u201d my grandfather said.\u201cOnce,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cBut I only rode its hoof.\u201d\u201cChrist, Lou. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sorry?\u201d\u201cI should have thought.\u201d\u201cYou know, horses come up in conversation from time to time. I almost never faint anymore.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s belated,\u201d my grandfather said. He was aware that after 14 years this was possibly an understatement. \u201cIt was rotten what happened to you.\u201d\u201cThink I give a shit if you\u2019re sorry, ass-rag?\u201d\u201cI would be disappointed if you did.\u201d\u201cAnyway I must have deserved it,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cOtherwise it wouldn\u2019t have happened, right?\u201dMy grandfather said that was a question with two sides and he could see them both, and Lemberger said that was perfect for a guy with a hole on two sides of his body. Then he reached into the Pontiac\u2019s back seat for a gray London Fog raincoat that had been forgotten in the poolroom years ago.\u201cPut this on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll walk right in.\u201dMy grandfather took the coat and the gun and got out of the car. The raincoat was too long and tight at the shoulders but it covered the bloody shirt. It was a piece of luck that rainclouds had blown in during the ride down from Philly but my grandfather did not mistake this for an omen of success. For the time being at least he was cured of that type of thinking. The truth was he had given up hope of catching the German spy, any German spy, now or at any time in his life to come. In Lovell\u2019s office he had thought he was holding one end of a chain of unbreakable inferences:1) The fugitive would seek treatment for his injury.2) He would be obliged to do so sub rosa.3) Doctors willing to provide such services were few and hard to find, even in Philadelphia, but4) Isidor Mazer would know where to send my grandfather.5) Given the scarcity of back-alley sawbones, there was a decent chance that the one my grandfather went to would also have treated the spy, and would \u2014 if left alive \u2014 be able to give my grandfather a notion of the fugitive\u2019s current whereabouts or next destination.But it had all broken down at 4) and once again the thing my grandfather had taken for the unfurling of a plan had turned out to be nothing but a spasm of impulsiveness. When he got back to Washington he was going to have to take a closer look at the military value of magnetic paint. Apparently it possessed the power to induce delusions of grandeur. [6]6. In the O.S.S. Archives at the Library of Congress, I found photostat copies of some notebooks taken from Lovell\u2019s laboratory. According to Cyrus Harmon, a chemist at Olema Pharmaceuticals, to whom I showed the photostats, one route attempted in my grandfather\u2019s effort to produce a \u201cmagnetic paint\u201d involved the synthesis of aryl halides by means of a Sandmeyer reaction. Though the notes do not specify which reagent was employed, among the most common is the compound C5H11ONO, better known as amyl nitrite, or \u201cpoppers.\u201dMy grandfather shut the door and stepped back from the car. He dropped the pistol into a pocket of the raincoat.\u201cSo,\u201d he said, abruptly tired. \u201cWhere do I go?\u201d\u201cService road.\u201dLemberger pointed. About 50 yards down from where they were parked a narrower road branched off to the left. A white fence accompanied it but then appeared to give up and turn back as though in distaste or despair just before the service road entered some trees. Beyond and above the screen of trees my grandfather could see an elegant sweep of green roof, a streaming pennant.\u201cYou think he really was here?\u201d\u201cFuck no,\u201d Lemberger said. \u201cDo you?\u201d\u201cI dunno. The guy told Mazer.\u201d\u201cSome guy told Mazer maybe some other guy heard something about somebody\u2019s nephew that someone else might maybe have seen. How much more than bupkis is that?\u201d\u201cNot very much,\u201d my grandfather conceded.In the mid-1930s a horse trainer from Camden, N.J., had come to Mazer with a business proposition. The horse trainer\u2019s mother had a sister who was married to a Teamster who was married to a sister of Mazer\u2019s. A veterinary school dropout who had served as an Army muleteer in Panama, the horse trainer now worked the ovals and backsides of the mid-Atlantic circuit, supplementing his income by doctoring escapees and gunsels. In this secondary trade he had a certain reputation. It was said that one of his proprietary poultices had saved \u201cLittle Krissy\u201d Herman from the otherwise fatal effects of a poisoned slug. He was tired of tending to other men\u2019s horses, he told Mazer, and there was a yearling grandson of Broomstick he had his eye on. But he lacked the necessary funds. He had spotted a few flaws in the way things were done at Freehold Raceway, and a way of exploiting them. He bided his time watching for the other required elements to present themselves: two all but indistinguishable horses, one a gam young unknown and one a career also-ran. Then he went to Mazer for the necessary yiches. Documents and ear tattoos were altered, bribes were pocketed, and the impostor came in at 30 to 1. Mazer was so pleased that he sent the horse trainer a reward: a pup from a recent litter of Hadassah\u2019s. That was the cue Hadassah had provided when she came downstairs to see what the fuss was about.After the switcheroo things had unraveled a bit for the horse trainer. Only a month after he acquired Broomstick\u2019s grandson an exerciser who had taken his breakfast from a shot glass fell off the yearling during a routine warm-up and got tangled in the animal\u2019s legs. When the mess got untangled the man was dead and the animal had to be destroyed. There were whispers of investigations planned by certain unbribed elements of the state regulatory system. The horse trainer had thought it prudent to hit the road. Iz Mazer had not seen him again until a few weeks ago, when he turned up at Bookbinder\u2019s, having dinner with some touts and cheap gamblers. Mazer had assumed then that the horse trainer was only home for a visit, but on the other hand the Teamster father had recently run off with a cocktail waitress at the Hotel Sylvania, leaving the mother bedridden. A devoted son might have come home to stay, and perhaps taken up his wonted means of support. The horse trainer might very well be the only man in the greater Philadelphia area at this moment who could provide the kind of quiet and the level of competence that my grandfather\u2019s quarry required. So Mazer had made a telephone call from his office at Tighe\u2019s. Dots were connected. There were not quite enough dots to make a picture, but it was better than rousting some rummy under the Girard Avenue Bridge.\u201cHappy hunting,\u201d Lemberger said.He started the engine, pulled away from the shoulder, and turned the Pontiac around. My grandfather watched until he was sure he had been abandoned to his work. Wrong as Lemberger might be in the head, my grandfather felt nothing but pity toward him, and so it was a great relief to see him go. My grandfather thought he might be feeling a bit steadier now. He patted at the bandage. It felt damp but not soaked in blood. He was probably still in shock but at least the nausea and the sense of bodily dislocation seemed to have passed. He was hungry, now \u2014 famished; that too must be a positive sign. On balance he would have preferred not being shot, but he was glad at least to have again put Philadelphia behind him.The grass rustled. He heard what he took for a sigh of irritation. He fished the .22 from the raincoat pocket and spun around, feeling a jolt that was only part panic; the rest of it was pure eagerness to shoot.The red horse was standing at the fence looking sidelong at him with a dark, flirtatious eye. Shifting light veneered its chest, and tendons stood out from the scrollwork of its legs. My grandfather could see the energy strung along the cords of its musculature, could almost hear the music it held in tension, waiting to be struck. But it was his heart that resounded. Looking at the red horse he felt its beauty pulling at something inside him that he would rather have died than call his soul, drawing that nonexistent organ out of his body like the interplanetary soul of Capt. John Carter of Virginia at the start of \u201cA Princess of Mars.\u201dHe slipped the gun back into his pocket.\u201cFor now,\u201d he told the red horse. \u201cBut if nobody down there gives me any breakfast I\u2019m coming back to eat you.\u201dThe red horse lowered its head to address its own breakfast. It gave its tail a twitch. It didn\u2019t say anything in reply but my grandfather understood perfectly well that he was to go fuck himself.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6Passing through the little stand of trees toward the backside of Delaware Park he heard horses bugling. Breakfast time for everyone. When he stepped out of the trees the horses, all at once, left off. The morning seemed to hold its breath. Just as my grandfather began to feel unnerved by the sudden silence the rain started, and a moment later the horses resumed their complaint.The fence here was steel post and hurricane mesh whipstitched along the top with barbed wire. Where it met the road there was a steel gate and a kind of hut with a folding chair inside. The gate stood wide open but you would never get through it without first getting past the man sitting in the hut. Just inside the gate a horse trailer foundered in a surf of mud. Opposite the capsized trailer rose a hump of horse dung wreathed in steam. Beyond the gate the road dissolved in mud and was lost amid a jumble of trailers, canvas tents, shacks, cabins and dozens of long white structures that looked like barracks but were, my grandfather guessed, the horse barns. Some of the buildings were painted white or gray or brick red, others were innocent of paint. The barns had green roofs to match the grandstand\u2019s and were clad in board-and-batten, but the rest of the backside buildings were roofed in rolled creosote or sheets of corrugated metal nailed down at three corners out of four. Some of the structures were no more than tarpaper tacked up over a frame of two-by-fours. It looked as if a traveling circus and a hobo jungle had thrown in with an Army boot camp to see how much open land they could cover if they pooled their resources. You could still make out traces of some original plan; the horse barns were laid out in orderly ranks. But everything else appeared to have been stranded by receding floodwaters or dumped here one building at a time, much the worse for wear, by passing tornadoes. The grandstand with its flags and gingerbread porches did not so much rise behind this encampment as fall athwart it, rung down like a theater curtain painted with a fairy-tale scene.The man sitting in the little three-sided hut had some coals going in an overturned hubcap set on some bricks by his feet. Across the hubcap lay a piece of steel mesh of the kind used to cover the windows of prison buses. As my grandfather approached the gate the man was poking with a long fork at five fat paprika-colored sausages he had arranged on the piece of steel mesh. The sausages did not appear to be anywhere near ready, but the man had already tucked a handkerchief into his shirt collar and spread it over his shirtfront. His heavy Redwings had a fresh shine and much less mud caked on their soles than might have been expected. His chambray shirt was crisp and the creases down the front of his brown ducks were yardstick true. The rolled sleeves of his shirt allowed glimpses of tattoos; on the left arm it said PROVERBS 26:3 but on the right arm all my grandfather could see was the bottom edge of a billowing banner done in blurred green-black ink and the feet of some letters that might turn out to say ROSALIE or HELLBOUND. The man wore his black hair long in front and combed romantically back in the style of Frankie Sinatra, but his brush mustache suggested an officious nature and my grandfather sensed he might be in for a hard time. The man was evidently irritated with the dilatory sausages and when he looked up from the grill to my grandfather the expression on his face stayed the same.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Feuerman,\u201d my grandfather said.The man ran an eye up and down the raincoat. It appeared to raise doubts in his mind. The pattering rain hissed as it hit the fire.The man held up the barbecue fork. Like the brazier it was a kind of contraption, improvised by poking an old shrimp cocktail fork into the coiled spring at one end of those wands you mounted on an ironing board to keep the cord of the iron from getting in your way. The man lifted an eyebrow. The expression on his face changed now to suggest both menace and amusement. You must now prepare yourself, the expression said, to be prodded with a very long fork.The man reached out, slowly, explicitly, his eyes keeping steady contact with my grandfather\u2019s. The tines of the fork aimed for the left pocket of the raincoat. Just before it made contact there the man\u2019s eyebrow went up even higher. He was toying with my grandfather, openly and in a way that my grandfather found mildly hypnotic. The fork jerked and then veered like a dowsing rod toward the right pocket where it found the bulge of the .22. Gently the trident tap-tapped.\u201cO.K.,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cEasy.\u201dHe tweezed the gun out of the pocket and held it pinched like an old sock between two fingers, to emphasize its uselessness to him. The man angled the fork upward so that the little trident was pointed at the gun. He waggled the fork suggestively.\u201cIt might be too heavy.\u201dThe man gave the fork another waggle. My grandfather fitted the gun over it, feeding the tines through the space between the trigger and the trigger guard. Then he let go of the gun. The wire wand bowed, deep, but did not dip, and then sprang back as the gun slid along it toward the man\u2019s hand. He switched the fork to his left hand and let the gun fall off it at the bottom into the palm of his right. The calluses on his palm where it met the fingers were thick and lustrous as tortoiseshell. He emptied the chamber and pocketed the bullets with a touch of legerdemain, pausing only to glance up at my grandfather when he noted that the bullets numbered five. He passed the gun back to my grandfather, who shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201dThe man took in this new information. He set the gun down on a little shelf inside the hut, between a roll of Sen-Sen and a pouch of Drum.\u201cThis ain\u2019t no fire station,\u201d he said.It took my grandfather a few seconds to understand.\u201cNot \u2018fireman,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cFeuerman.\u201d\u201cUh huh. You know this ain\u2019t no fuckin\u2019 hospital neither.\u201dThen he reached out again with the fork. This time he aimed for the raincoat\u2019s bottommost button. My grandfather looked down at the front of the raincoat. The fabric was beaded with quicksilver droplets of rain but was not, it appeared, impermeable to blood. There was a dark blotch shaped roughly like the island of Ceylon over his right side. The man poked at the bottom button. Deftly and with a criminal \u00e9lan he worked the shrimp fork into the buttonhole and over the top of the button till the thing popped open. Moving upward he made short work of popping the uppermost buttons. When the coat fell open he used the fork to lift aside the right flap of the raincoat. What he saw was nothing mysterious or hard to interpret.\u201cChrist.\u201d He let the flap fall back into place. \u201cWhat happened there, boss?\u201d\u201cI was bitten by an ocelot.\u201dThe man hid a smile up under the nailbrush he had growing from his upper lip and returned his attention to the cookfire. He stabbed at a sausage. The fork that had acquitted itself so well with pistols and coat buttons displayed certain shortcomings when applied to its intended task. The sausages rolled around on the grate trying to escape their fate. The man leaned down, trying to gain leverage, and the closer he got, the more the wire bowed and flexed. It took several tries and a certain amount of cursing before he managed to spear one of the sausages. He lifted it to his nose and took an appreciative whiff.\u201cMr. Mazer sent me,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cIsidor Mazer.\u201dThe words emerged from his throat freighted with a great deal more desperation than he had intended or even necessarily known that he felt. Rain was pooling inside his ears and at the small of his back. The bullet wounds throbbed asynchronously, in and out of phase, so that he could never anticipate and thus get on top of the pain which had, he was at last forced to concede, nothing at all to do with pleasure whatsoever. His head was light and his stomach empty. And the sausage smelled wonderful.The man ate it in three bites, watching my grandfather. Mazer\u2019s name appeared to have made no impression on him. A pickup truck rolled up the gate, its bed mounded with sawdust. It was driven by a diminutive elderly Negro wearing a wide-brimmed hat of woven straw. The word MEXICO was embroidered in red thread on the crown. There were holes cut into the brim on either side as if to accommodate the ears of a horse or possibly a mule. The stall man and the driver of the truck, whose name or nickname appeared to be Mexico, engaged in banter about some aspect of work or politics in the backside that my grandfather found at once distracting and incomprehensible. Then the truck rolled away through the gate and when my grandfather looked back the man\u2019s mustache was shining and there was only one sausage left on the grate.The air between my grandfather and the stall man was abruptly swarming with sparkling points of light. My grandfather thought that the drops of rain were catching a patch of sun at a strange angle. He had heard the expression \u201cseeing stars\u201d used with reference to lightheadedness but he had never understood that it described an actual phenomenon. In cartoons when people were about to faint or had been knocked silly a halo of stars (if not little birds) would orbit their heads but this too had seemed to be purely convention like the Xs cartoon corpses had for eyes. He had the odd sensation that the water filling his shoes was not rain but blood, streaming down from his head, not from his wounds. The stall man cursed, bending down and jabbing at the last sausage as the wand buckled and the shrimp fork wiggled in the spring coil.\u201cYou ought to use a telescoping aerial,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cYou could adjust the length depending on how much leverage you needed. If you could shorten it then it would also make it easier to eat with.\u201dThe stall man stopped trying to stab the sausage and looked at my grandfather.\u201cHuh,\u201d he said.In spite of the fact that he was now tottering at the edge of unconsciousness my grandfather briefly outlined six improvements that he would make to the design of the stall man\u2019s barbecue fork, including attaching the fork to the aerial with a metal collar and a rivet and adding a simple grip at the other end, using the handle from an old trowel or a piece cut from a broomstick.\u201cYou talk like an engineer,\u201d said the stall man.My grandfather said that there was a good reason for this. He gave a brief sketch of his career up to the meeting with Wild Bill. The stall man started to grin before my grandfather was halfway through the account. When my grandfather ran out of things to say or the strength to say them the stall man pushed up the sleeve of his left arm to display the tattoo. The motto in the banner was not ROSALIE or HELLBOUND but the French imperative ESSAYONS. Over the banner, executed very poorly, was the heraldic castle with four turrets that symbolized the Army Corps of Engineers.\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to let you have this fucking sausage,\u201d the stall man said. He succeeded in spearing it but just as he raised it off the grate and began to swing it toward my grandfather there was a sound of wheezing and huffing. My grandfather hoped that he was not making the sound, because if he were than he must be in very bad shape. He just had time to remark that the sound was oddly familiar when an English bulldog even fatter and uglier yet moving far faster than Hadassah had ever moved in her life \u2014 maybe it was the example set by its thoroughbred neighbors \u2014 rolled in like an asthmatic bowling ball, paws slapping at the mud. In a single continuous motion it dropped what it had in its mouth, snatched the last sausage right off the fork, and rolled out again.What it dropped from its teeth so that it could grab the sausage turned out to be a human ear, edged with blood. It landed on the grate with a soft plop and immediately began to sizzle. That was the last thing that my grandfather noticed for a little while.When he came to he was lying on his side on a table in a room made of raw lumber and lath. There were jars of cotton and boxes of gauze and a heavy smell of camphor and pine tar. Lying on the floor beside the table where my grandfather lay was a male corpse, dressed in an elegant double-breasted suit. The side of its head was caked with black blood and it wore an expression of profound disappointment. It had lost an ear.There was a chink of metal against metal. My grandfather rolled partway over and saw the stall man, wearing a white linen coat, at a work bench. There was a gas ring on the work bench with a pot of water boiling. The stall man was fishing stainless steel surgical implements out of the boiling water with a set of tongs and laying them out on a towel that lined a steel tray. He picked up the tray and turned to my grandfather.\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d\u201cNope. He just bled out.\u201d\u201cHe was a German spy.\u201d\u201cOnly appropriate, since he grew up in Germantown. Germantown High, he told me, Class of \u201926. Growl, You Bears.\u201d\u201cAre you Feuerman?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you heard.\u201d\u201cI have two questions.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cAre there any more sausages?\u201d\u201cNot impossible. Second question?\u201d\u201cAm I going to bleed out, too?\u201d\u201cHope not.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\u201cGotcha.\u201d\u201cBe straight with me. Can you fix me up?\u201dFeuerman set the tray down and pushed back the sleeves of his white coat, revealing the tattoos.\u201c \u2018Let us try,\u2019 \u201d he said.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6\u201cWake him up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cSir.\u201d\u201cYou want to open your eyes, son?\u201dGasping a little. Too many cigarettes, too many stairs taken too quickly. Somebody else on the other side of the bed, fidgeting with coins or keys.\u201cLast time I opened my eyes,\u201d my grandfather said, \u201cI threw up.\u201d\u201cMight want to take a step back, Lovell.\u201dWhisper of leather against linoleum.\u201cO.K., let her rip, son.\u201dMy grandfather opened his eyes. For the first second or two the world sloshed like a bucket but then it settled down. Bill Donovan and Stanley Lovell were keeping a respectful distance on either side of the bed he did not remember having been laid in, on a ward of a hospital he had been told, at some point, was Walter Reed. He had no idea how he had gotten to Walter Reed from Feuerman\u2019s trailer or how long it had been since the trainer had shot him up with a syringe full of something that could knock out a 500-pound horse.\u201cWell?\u201d Donovan said.My grandfather said he thought they were probably safe to come a little closer. Lovell had gotten himself a haircut and had his mustache trimmed since their previous conversation, which might be a good sign, but on the other hand had made no adjustments in his air of annoyance with my grandfather. Donovan just stood there, in a double-breasted gray-on-navy pinstripe suit, beaming at my grandfather with what appeared to be unalloyed pride. He held out his big paw with its manicured nails and my grandfather shook it.\u201cGood Christ, son, did you ever make a mess of things,\u201d he said happily.My grandfather looked at Lovell. He wanted to ask him about General Strong and the letter of resignation but while he struggled to figure out how to phrase the question discreetly it must have leaked out through his eyes.\u201cFor the time being, yes,\u201d Lovell said, looking incrementally less irritated. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do much.\u201d\u201cYou got shot?\u201d Donovan said.\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cAnd how was that?\u201d\u201cIt hurt like a bastard, sir.\u201d\u201cAnd then a crooked horse doctor stitched you up with some baling twine.\u201d\u201cIt certainly feels that way.\u201d\u201cIt was something of an ordeal, then. But in the end, you hunted your man down.\u201dMy grandfather supposed that this was, strictly speaking, the case.\u201cI guess you could say I located him.\u201d\u201cIs he going to bring any further dishonor to my dear friend and brother in arms General Strong, and his worthy band of bravos?\u201d\u201cI doubt it, sir.\u201dDonovan patted my grandfather on the shoulder.\u201cLooking back,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cStanley says you\u2019ve been itching to get out of the office a little.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019d like to send him elsewhere. Now that we\u2019ve kicked open the door it\u2019s time to send some hunters in. Would it be fair, Lieutenant,\u201d Donovan said, turning on the courtroom manner, \u201cand you\u2019ll pardon the technical jargon, but would it be fair to characterize you as a goddamn bloody-minded Philadelphia Jew-boy gangster?\u201dMy grandfather said he supposed the characterization, while not entirely accurate, would suffice.\u201cWould it also be fair to say you are a coolheaded cleareyed man of science?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201dDonovan smacked my grandfather on the knee and stood up.\u201cWell, good, because that\u2019s the kind of hunter we\u2019re going to need.\u201d\u201cColonel, I have to tell you, by the time I got there, the guy was already \u2014\u201d\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Lovell said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care! You\u2019re getting what you wanted. Just shut the hell up and say thank you.\u201dDespite his bloody-mindedness, my grandfather took Stanley Lovell\u2019s advice, though as a cleareyed man of science he chose to proceed in a more logical fashion, first saying thank you to Wild Bill Donovan, and only then shutting the hell up.All rights reserved.

{"Headline": "How LinkedIn Drove a Wedge Between Microsoft and Salesforce", "Date": "2016-11-05", "News": "Once so close they flirted with a merger, the software giants became archrivals when they realized the value of the data amassed by social networks.Supported byThis is a story of love lost after a fight over social media.Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn \u2014 hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople. When Microsoft won, Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European antimonopoly laws.But not long ago, the two software giants were tight. They even talked about merging their businesses \u2014 not once, but twice. The second round of talks hasn\u2019t previously been reported.A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce, which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model, and Microsoft, which is racing to adjust, exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter. The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.There are big personalities behind the battle. At Microsoft, the job of adjusting course has fallen to Satya Nadella, a poetry-quoting chief executive who is trying to aggressively remake the company in hot areas like the cloud business applications where Salesforce is a leader.\u201cMicrosoft decided it could go ahead and recreate the best parts of Salesforce,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures who has spoken with Mr. Nadella and other business-development executives at Microsoft.Marc Benioff, a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, is considered a self-assured visionary. But he had doubts about staying independent around the time he understood that Microsoft was getting serious about competing with his company.At the time, software used by businesses was usually sold through huge licensing deals for software that would be installed directly on company PCs. Mr. Benioff\u2019s idea was to undercut that model: He would offer the same thing over the internet, without expensive installations, and customers would pay by the month.The idea proved prescient. Though it only recently began turning a profit, Salesforce is on track to have more than $8 billion in revenue this year, representing annual growth of about 25 percent. The total market value of the company is over $50 billion. Salesforce is the largest tech employer in San Francisco, and the company will move into the city\u2019s tallest building, Salesforce Tower, when it is completed.It took Microsoft years to see the potential in what Salesforce was doing. Microsoft had its own C.R.M. product, Dynamics, but it took a back seat inside an empire that, under the former chief executive Steven A. Ballmer, was consumed with battling more prominent competitors like Apple, Google and Sony.Mr. Nadella, a longtime Microsoft executive whose career odyssey at the company included overseeing its C.R.M. product, was less combative than his predecessor. He began reaching out to leaders of many rival companies after he became chief executive in early 2014, with a special goal of improving Microsoft\u2019s standing in Silicon Valley.John W. Thompson, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who had recently become chairman of Microsoft\u2019s board, arranged a dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, Calif., for Mr. Nadella to meet other tech executives, including Mr. Benioff, the Salesforce chief said in a 2015 interview. \u201cAt the end of dinner, I really gave Satya a number of areas I thought we could work closely on,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in the interview. \u201cHe took me up on all of them.\u201dMr. Nadella and Mr. Benioff declined to be interviewed for this article.At one point, Mr. Benioff offered to buy the Dynamics business that Salesforce competed with, but Mr. Nadella turned him down, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Several people briefed on the talks said that account was accurate, though two of them said another factor was that Mr. Benioff thought Microsoft was not respectful enough of his accomplishments in building Salesforce. It was unclear whether Mr. Benioff would be happy in a subordinate role at Microsoft after building Salesforce from the ground up, and it was equally hard to imagine a successful Salesforce without him.Quickly, there were signs that Microsoft planned to get its act together in the C.R.M. business. As part of a broader shake-up, Mr. Nadella moved Dynamics under Scott Guthrie, one of Microsoft\u2019s most respected engineering leaders. This telegraphed that it intended to go after Salesforce\u2019s business.\u201cThey\u2019re serious in a way they haven\u2019t been before,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, an angel investor in Seattle and a former Microsoft manager who occasionally consults with the company.Salesforce did not sit idle. In November, it hired a former head of Dynamics, Bob Stutz, to oversee its data analytics products.Still, Microsoft and Salesforce had reasons to keep the peace. Mr. Nadella wanted Salesforce to use Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure, called Azure, to run its internet applications. A marquee customer like Salesforce could lend credibility to Azure as Microsoft tried to catch Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure provider.In the months after, Mr. Benioff met privately with Mr. Nadella to talk business. Mr. Benioff discussed using Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens augmented reality headset in a Salesforce presentation; that never panned out. And he again brought up the idea of Microsoft\u2019s acquiring Salesforce, according to several people briefed on the talks.Microsoft seemed less receptive to the idea than before, partly because of Salesforce\u2019s price tag and also because Microsoft had decided to compete more aggressively with its own product, these people said. By last February, the discussions were dead, they said.The conversations became contentious enough to place a strain on the longtime friendship between Mr. Benioff and Mr. Thompson, according to two people with knowledge of the relationship. The two men did not speak for months (although things have since thawed). That\u2019s around the time Mr. Benioff seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by Microsoft \u2014 a well-capitalized competitor, many times the size of Salesforce \u2014 according to people who discussed the issue with him.The most alluring acquisition target for both companies, though, was LinkedIn.The business social networking site has become an indispensable tool for people to advertise their employment histories and professional achievements. LinkedIn\u2019s enormous database of profiles could be coupled more tightly with C.R.M. systems to help sales representatives close deals, both companies believed. LinkedIn\u2019s data could also be used to strengthen Microsoft products such as Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s most lucrative products. And LinkedIn comes with a steady revenue stream.For the next several months, Microsoft and Salesforce privately made competing offers for LinkedIn, each sweetening their bids as the competition increased. Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a board member, wooed Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and chairman, according to the LinkedIn filing. Salesforce code-named its LinkedIn effort Project Burgundy.In mid-June, Microsoft won LinkedIn with a bid of $196 a share, all of it in cash, which provided more certainty for LinkedIn shareholders than the combination of cash and stock that Salesforce was offering. Microsoft has more than $136 billion in cash and short-term investments. Salesforce has less than $1.2 billion.\u201cWe were closer than we realized \u2014 maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it!\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cBut we were definitely over our skis!!!!\u201dAs the prospect of a LinkedIn deal began to dim for Salesforce, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, Burke Norton, sent an email to the board saying the company, as result, could contemplate a number of other acquisition targets, one of which \u2014 Demandware \u2014 it ended up buying. Other possibilities, including Adobe, Box, Tableau and Workday, remain independent, according to a presentation attached to the email, which was published on DCLeaks.com.Mr. Benioff has bought at least 10 companies in all. His most expensive purchase, at $2.8 billion, was Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. One big acquisition, the document software company Quip, took direct aim at Microsoft Office, one of Microsoft\u2019s cash cows.There is, of course, no guarantee that LinkedIn will give Microsoft the edge it seeks in data analytics, machine learning and C.R.M. software. The company has a history of fumbling big acquisitions, including its disastrous acquisition of Nokia, which ended in a $7.6 billion write-off, after which Microsoft backed away from mobile phones.While Salesforce\u2019s acquisitions and war chest are relatively small, the company highlighted in a presentation to analysts this fall that it had acquired Quip in part to land its co-founder, Bret Taylor, a former Facebook and Google executive. Analysts view Mr. Taylor as someone who can weave Salesforce\u2019s pieces into a more competitive company.In the meantime, Mr. Benioff cut a deal in May to use primarily Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, not Microsoft\u2019s. The deal was worth $400 million over four years for Amazon.Microsoft wooed away a big Salesforce customer, HP, in September to use Dynamics.\u201cGiven Microsoft\u2019s history and existing monopolies, it is sometimes necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to intervene to ensure that Microsoft is operating in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\u201d said Mr. Norton, Salesforce\u2019s chief legal officer.It\u2019s not clear if the complaints will be a problem for the deal, which has already been approved in the United States.In response to Salesforce\u2019s complaints, Microsoft has said it will bring more price competition to the market. But neither company is totally estranged from its rival, and they say they must work together. In a statement, Peggy Johnson, an executive vice president at Microsoft, said that \u201cwhile we\u2019ll continue to compete, we look forward to continuing to partner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays", "Date": "2016-11-06", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple\u2019s App Store in recent weeks \u2014 just in time to deceive holiday shoppers.The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard\u2019s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a barrage of fake apps,\u201d said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time.Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless \u2014 essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said.But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information.The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple\u2019s process for reviewing every app before it is published.That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google\u2019s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company\u2019s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers.In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them.With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pok\u00e9mon Company, among others.\u201cIt\u2019s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,\u201d he said.\u201cWe strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. \u201cWe\u2019ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We\u2019ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.\u201dIn September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove \u201capps that no longer function as intended, don\u2019t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.\u201d The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing.Despite Apple\u2019s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple\u2019s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered.\u201cIt\u2019s a game of Whac-a-Mole,\u201d Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said.Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients.\u201cWe hope that our clients are all official sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services.\u201dMr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi \u2014 about $3,000 \u2014 for an app written in English.But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook\u2019s campus in Menlo Park, Calif.In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have \u201ctens of employees\u201d at the Facebook address.China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts.Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, \u201cOur angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday.\u201dData from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. \u201cWould give zero stars if possible,\u201d wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. \u201cConstantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.\u201dMr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands.\u201cThe retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,\u201d he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard\u2019s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps.But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real.The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store \u2014 including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear.Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume.Some of the fake apps have even used Apple\u2019s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store.Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple\u2019s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google\u2019s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said.But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pok\u00e9mon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available.\u201cThe criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,\u201d Mr. Clay said.Emily Feng contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Toilets Have Trump\u2019s Name Without His Permission", "Date": "2016-11-15", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The founder of a Chinese brand of high-tech toilets called Trump said he had no intention of soiling the name of America\u2019s next president.Zhong Jiye, the founder, said he had not heard of Donald J. Trump when he registered the English name of his company, Shenzhen Trump Industrial Company Limited, as a trademark in 2002. In Chinese, the company name means \u201cinnovate universally,\u201d he said, highlighting how the toilet seats warm and wash the user\u2019s backside. That Chinese name, he explained, also sounds a little like \u201ctrump.\u201d\u201cWe really didn\u2019t know of this person called Trump,\u201d Mr. Zhong said in a telephone interview from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. \u201cIt was entirely a coincidence.\u201dIn the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s name has adorned ties, steaks, water and other products. In China, it is found on computers, cosmetics, even leather goods.The difference: Many such Chinese products don\u2019t have the president-elect\u2019s permission.Of the 46 registered trademarks under the Trump name in China, 29 appear to be owned by Mr. Trump, based on data with the country\u2019s trademark office. At least 14 companies not associated with Mr. Trump applied for the Trump trademark in 2015 and 2016 alone, according to Itaotm, a Chinese commercial trademark website.The situation highlights the difficulties that big brands and celebrities face as they navigate the country\u2019s relatively new trademark laws.In China, trademarks are generally awarded to those who are first to file with the government. That has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, in a practice known as \u201ctrademark squatting.\u201dMany Western companies like Apple and Starbucks have been caught up in long legal battles to win the right to use their names in China.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to prove bad faith,\u201d said Matthew Dresden, a lawyer with Harris Moure in Seattle who specializes in Chinese intellectual property law. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to prove that your name is well known at the time that the application is filed.\u201dAlan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Mr. Trump isn\u2019t the first world leader wrapped up in a name dispute in China.In 2004, the country\u2019s government officials were not favorably inclined when a Chinese businessman tried to register the Chinese name of former President George W. Bush for a brand of disposable diapers. The officials said the application was likely to be rejected \u201cbecause it may bring about bad social impact if a leader\u2019s name is registered as a trademark,\u201d according to state media.Mr. Zhong, of the toilet maker Shenzhen Trump, said he had not received a challenge from Mr. Trump or his company. Still, he said, he \u201cwill never\u201d give up his trademark easily, if Mr. Trump decides to sue.\u201cLitigating is his right,\u201d Mr. Zhong said. \u201cBut we will let the government make its judgment. We believe the country\u2019s laws will protect businesses like us.\u201dMr. Zhong said he approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ccourageous style and spirit of reform.\u201d He also liked Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cinnovative ideas.\u201dWhen asked about the criticism directed toward Mr. Trump in the United States, Mr. Zhong said, \u201cDemocratic countries are like that. I think a transformation is not bad at all.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Emily Feng contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung to Buy Harman International in an $8 Billion Bet on Cars", "Date": "2016-11-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Samsung Electronics is spending $8 billion to get inside your car.Harman is best known for making car audio systems under brand names popular with audiophiles such as Harman/Kardon and JBL. But Harman\u2019s appeal to Samsung comes from what it calls its connected car business \u2014 an operation that supplies a car\u2019s navigation services, its onboard entertainment systems and its connectivity to the rest of the world.\u201cThe vehicle of tomorrow will be transformed by smart technology and connectivity in the same way that simple feature phones have become sophisticated smart devices over the past decade,\u201d Young Sohn, the president and chief strategy officer of Samsung Electronics, said in a news release.The deal marks the latest ambitious foray by an established name in the technology world into a new generation of smart objects sometimes collectively called the internet of things. Under this vision, everything from home security systems to refrigerators will be connected to the internet, gathering data and controllable at the touch of a smartphone icon.With cars likely to get more screens and more computers, the purchase gives Samsung a stake in what could be an industrywide boom. It also could provide insight for the company\u2019s varied components businesses. Samsung can learn firsthand from Harman what it needs to do to sell its screens, chips and memory to carmakers.Samsung\u2019s $112-a-share offer for Harman represents a 28 percent premium from where its shares traded on Friday, but that is still well below the roughly $145 that each Harman share was fetching early last year. Harman\u2019s results from its professional solutions business \u2014 which makes sound and lighting for concerts and other events \u2014 have weakened. The company has said it will work to bring the operations back to their previous strength.Samsung has largely benefited from the new mobile world, as growing demand for smartphones bolstered sales of its displays and microchips. But the company has faced difficulties selling its own branded phones, including a drop in market share, as Apple captured more of the high end and a new generation of low-cost Chinese manufacturers increased pressure on the bottom.The deal for Harman is a rare one for Samsung, which keeps tight control of its supply chain \u2014 often owning its suppliers outright \u2014 and has mostly eschewed big deals to fill in holes in its portfolio.Samsung said that it would also have access to Harman\u2019s designers and engineers, which would allow for more collaboration. It did not give details on what sorts of services they would aim to build together.It said that Dinesh Paliwal, Harman\u2019s chairman and chief executive, would continue to run the operation, and that it would keep the company\u2019s facilities.The deal is expected to close in mid-2017. Samsung was advised by Evercore, with Paul Hastings as legal counsel. JPMorgan and Lazard advised Harman, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as legal counsel.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs, Bank to the Elite, Makes Pitch to the Masses", "Date": "2016-11-16", "News": "Supported byGoldman Sachs, long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks \u2014 debt happens.On Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals \u2014 even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range \u2014 out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan.\u201cDebt happens. It\u2019s how you get out that counts,\u201d the ads say.Dustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman\u2019s new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank\u2019s aim was to \u201cdestigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.\u201dThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple. Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans \u201ccan be a better option,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research.Mr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut.Through the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals.Goldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its \u201cvampire squid\u201d reputation.But these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman\u2019s longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets.\u201cThe real driver\u201d of the new Marcus lending push is \u201cthe way the capital rules are,\u201d Goldman\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. \u201cWe are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it\u2019s easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,\u201d Mr. Blankfein added.The last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley, which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter\u2019s steadier fee-driven revenues.Although the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010.Marcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman\u2019s head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. \u201cWe were looking for something different, something new\u201d that wouldn\u2019t compete with Goldman\u2019s existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said.Goldman\u2019s growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from great to merely good,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk.It is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. \u201cDigital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,\u201d Mr. Scherr said.Lending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. \u201cThe thing to worry about, when you\u2019re refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,\u201d she said.The small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future.\u201cI think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,\u201d said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cThen three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fund Chief Capitalizes on China\u2019s \u2018Split Personality\u2019 Economy", "Date": "2016-11-12", "News": "Supported byWealth Special SectionBEIJING \u2014 Weijian Shan, chief executive of the Hong Kong fund management firm PAG, says the global economy is dangerous for investors these days. Years of easy money from central banks have helped inflate the prices of just about everything an investor can buy, like stocks or property.\u201cI think that clearly we are in an asset bubble,\u201d Mr. Shan said in a phone interview from Hong Kong.So what should investors do? Mr. Shan recommended a return to the basics. His firm, with $16 billion under management in funds that specialize in fields like private equity and real estate, is looking for value in areas still growing in a sluggish world economy.\u201cWe are not chasing bubbles as many of our peers do,\u201d said Mr. Shan, a former professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cI only want to look at the fundamentals. I want to know how much money this business makes.\u201dIn that, Mr. Shan is positioned well. PAG focuses mainly on investments in or related to Asia, where the fortunes of China, India and other countries remain buoyant even as the global economy sags.\u201cIf you look around the world, Asia is where the growth is,\u201d he said.Mr. Shan said that China, where he was born, \u201cis the most interesting market because of its growth.\u201dBut that growth has declined. In the third quarter, China\u2019s gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent, in contrast with the 9 percent to 10 percent the country enjoyed for years. The downturn has intensified the struggles of what Mr. Shan called China\u2019s \u201cbad economy\u201d \u2014 mainly manufacturing and heavy industries, which have too many factories and too much debt.Mr. Shan, however, also sees a \u201cgood economy\u201d in China. As the government tries to shift the country\u2019s engine of growth away from investing in steel mills and apartment blocks, it is encouraging more private consumption. That is opening opportunities in areas that cater to Chinese consumers.\u201cChina has a split personality at this moment,\u201d Mr. Shan said. But \u201cthe good economy remains quite resilient in spite of the bad economy.\u201dMr. Shan, who once served as a senior partner at the investment firm TPG, is focusing his money on companies that can benefit from China\u2019s rising consumerism. In October, PAG\u2019s private-equity arm invested an undisclosed amount in the Paradise Group, based in Singapore, which operates restaurants across China and Southeast Asia.In August, it spent about $250 million to acquire Golden Apple, which runs a chain of private schools from Chengdu, China\u2019s western metropolis.In its most prominent deal, PAG in April joined Apex Technology, a Chinese producer of ink cartridge components, and others in the acquisition of the printer maker Lexmark International, based in Kentucky, a transaction valued at $3.6 billion. The deal was appealing to PAG, in part because the new owners hope to raise the profile of Lexmark printers in the Chinese marketplace.Mr. Shan also wants to take advantage of some of Asia\u2019s bad economy. With debt levels continuing to rise in China, PAG is developing a strategy for buying and profiting from bad loans at Chinese banks. He also says his firm has generated good returns from buying distressed debt backed by real estate in the region. PAG, which has 30 percent of its capital in real estate, is still sniffing around for reasonably priced property as well.\u201cWe invest in real estate where the price is not out of whack,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is in times like this that you really can differentiate among investors who will be more focused on fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cwho invests along with the rest of the bandwagon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
